wal-mart was incorporated in delaware in october 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when sam m. walton opened a franchise ben franklin variety store in newport, arkansas. in 1946, his brother, james l. walton, opened a
similar store in versailles, missouri. until 1962, our founders business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. in that year, the first wal-mart discount city, which was a discount store, was opened. in fiscal 1984, we opened
our first three sams clubs, and in fiscal 1988, we opened our first supercenter.   in fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in mexico, in which we had a 50% interest, with cifra s.a. de c.v. (cifra). in fiscal 1998, we acquired the
controlling interest in cifra, and in february 2000, cifra officially changed its name to wal-mart de mexico, s.a. de c.v. since fiscal 1992, our international presence has continued to expand and at january 31, 2004, we had international operations
in argentina, brazil, canada, germany, south korea, mexico,

puerto rico (53) and the united kingdom (267). we also operate through joint ventures in china (34). additionally, we hold a 37.8% interest in seiyu, a japanese retail chain which operates approximately 400 stores throughout japan.   our growth, measured both by our net sales and net income, occurs in large
measure as a result of our domestic and international expansion programs along with comparative store sales increases. we consider comparative store sales to be sales at stores that were open as of february 1st of the prior fiscal year and which
have not been expanded or relocated during that period. comparative store sales are also referred to as same-store sales by others within the retail industry.   the following tables provide summary information concerning the additions of units and square footage for domestic discount

segments business is seasonal to a certain extent. generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during our first fiscal quarter.   competition sams clubs compete with other warehouse
clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors. we also compete with other retailers for desirable new club sites. our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise
determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.   distribution during fiscal 2004, approximately 63% of the sams club purchases were shipped from the sams club segments dedicated distribution facilities. suppliers shipped the balance of the sams club
purchases directly to sams club locations. the principal focus of our sams clubs distribution operations is on crossdocking product, while stored inventory is minimized. crossdocking is a distribution process under which shipments
are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers without storage in between. shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility, sometimes less than an hour. a combination of seven company owned and operated distribution
facilities and 12 third-party owned and operated facilities constitute the overall distribution structure for the sams club segment. two of the company owned and operated facilities are located in texas with one located in each of arizona,
arkansas, colorado, minnesota and indiana. of the third-party owned and operated facilities, one of each is located in california, florida, georgia, illinois, maryland, michigan, missouri, new hampshire, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania and
washington. sams club uses a combination of our private truck fleet as well as common carriers to transport our non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to our clubs. however, we contract with common carriers to transport our
perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to our clubs.   international operating segment   our
international segment is comprised of our operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in argentina, canada, germany, south korea, puerto rico and the united kingdom, our operations through majority-owned subsidiaries in brazil and mexico and our
operations through joint ventures in china. wal-marts portion of the results of our unconsolidated 37.8% minority interest in japanese retailer, seiyu, is included in the other segment. the international segments net sales for the fiscal
years ended january 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, were $47.6 billion, $40.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively. during the most recent fiscal year, no single location accounted for as much as 1% of total company sales or net income.   general operating formats vary by country, but include discount
stores in canada and puerto rico; supercenters in argentina, brazil, china, germany, south korea, mexico, puerto rico and the united kingdom; sams clubs in brazil, canada, china, mexico, and puerto rico; superamas (traditional supermarket),
bodegas (combination discount and grocery store), suburbias (specialty department store) and vips (restaurant) in mexico; todo dias (combination discount and grocery store) in brazil; neighborhood markets (traditional supermarkets) in china; asda
stores (combination grocery and apparel store) and george stores (apparel store) in the united kingdom; and amigo supermarkets in puerto rico.   merchandise the merchandising strategy for the international operating segment is similar to that of domestic segments in the breadth and
scope of merchandise offered for sale. while brand name
merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, several store brands not found in the united states have been developed to
serve customers in the different markets in which the international segment operates. in addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.   operations the hours of operation for operating units in the
international segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. while sales are primarily on a cash-and-carry basis, credit cards or other consumer finance
programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.   seasonal aspects of operations the international operating segments business is seasonal to a certain extent. generally, the highest volume of sales occurs in our fourth fiscal quarter. the
seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.
competition the international operating segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the supermarket,
discount, department, drug, variety, specialty and wholesale sectors of the retail market in each of the countries in which we operate and, in mexico, with local, national and international restaurant chains. our ability to offer our customers low
prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the international segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position. in our international units, our ability to effectively operate the food departments has a major impact
on the segments competitive position in the markets where we operate.   distribution the international segment operates export consolidation facilities in california, florida and texas in support of product flow to its mexican, asian, and latin american markets. we operate a
total of 53 distribution facilities that are located in argentina, brazil, canada, china, germany, puerto rico, the united kingdom and mexico. through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic product to the operating
units. during fiscal 2004, approximately 76% of the international segments purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. suppliers ship the balance of the international segments purchases directly to our stores in the various
countries in which we operate. a combination of company owned and operated distribution facilities and third-party facilities makes up the overall distribution structure for international logistics.   employees (associates)   as of january 31, 2004, the company employed approximately 1.5 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.2 million
associates in the united states and approximately 360,000 associates in foreign countries. most associates participate in incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon the companys productivity

ii. environmental matters: item 103 of sec regulation s-k requires
disclosure of certain environmental matters. the following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement:   during fiscal 2001, the state of connecticut filed suit against the company in the superior court for the judicial district of hartford alleging various
violations of state environmental laws and alleging that the company failed to obtain the appropriate permits or failed to maintain required records relating to storm water management practices at 12 stores. in december 2003, the state filed an
amended complaint alleging that the company also had discharged wastewater associated with vehicle maintenance activities and photo processing activities without proper permits. the suit seeks to ensure the companys compliance with the general
permits applicable to those activities.   the united states
environmental protection agency (epa) has alleged that the company and some of its construction contractors have violated the epas stormwater regulations on specific sites primarily in colorado and utah, but also in other parts of
the country. on july 31, 2003, the company served the epa with a notice of dispute as required by a national consent decree entered into between the company and the epa in august 2001. serving the notice of dispute initiated an informal dispute
resolution process in accordance with the terms of the consent decree. the company also filed a copy of the notice of dispute with the united states district court for the western district of arkansas.
on july 29, 2002, the epa advised the company that it had initiated an investigation involving the
companys compliance with sections 608 and 609 of the clean air act and regulations promulgated thereunder with regard to the sales of class i and class ii refrigerant products. the statutes provide that the sales of these products are
restricted to persons and/or entities which are properly licensed. the epa asserts that, during the relevant time period, the company made approximately 20 such sales to non-licensed persons and/or entities. the company has reached an agreement to
settle these allegations without admitting any wrongdoing or violations of the statutes by paying a $400,000 civil penalty and entering into a consent decree with the epa. when approved by the court, the consent decree will require that the company
comply fully with the relevant clean air act sections and regulations in the future.   in august 2003, the company was served with a grand jury subpoena in connection with an investigation by the office of district attorney of harris county, texas. the subpoena seeks information related to the waste
disposal activities of one of the companys photo processing labs. the company is cooperating with the investigation.   in the spring of 2003, an investigation was initiated by the florida department of environmental protection (fdep) in connection with the
companys alleged failure to comply with certain rules and regulations governing the ownership and operation of above-ground storage tank systems as set forth in chapter 62-761, florida administrative code. negotiations between the company and
the fdep to resolve this matter have commenced.   iii.
immigration matter: on or about october 30, 2003, wal-mart was formally advised by the united states attorney for the middle district of pennsylvania that it was the target of a federal grand jury investigation. the notice from the
government did not identify the nature of the allegations against wal-mart, but rather generally indicated that wal-mart was the target of a grand jury investigation assessing potential violations of federal law including conspiracy, aiding and
abetting transporting illegal aliens and encouraging illegal aliens to reside in the united states, all for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain, and aiding and abetting the unlawful employment of illegal aliens. wal-mart
believes the grand jury investigation relates to its relationship with certain third-party contractors providing floor cleaning services to wal-mart and those contractors alleged employment of individuals who may be in the united states
illegally. the grand jury investigation is on-going. any potential liability on the part of the company cannot be determined at this time.   on or about november 10, 2003, a civil action was filed against the company in the united states district court for the district of new jersey, captioned
zavala et al. v. wal-mart corporation, et al., case no. 03-cv-5309. this complaint asserts claims under the fair labor standards act, the racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act, and various statutory causes of action and common law
torts arising from the companys relationship with certain third-party contractors responsible for providing floor cleaning services in its stores. any potential liability on the part of the company cannot be determined at this time.
