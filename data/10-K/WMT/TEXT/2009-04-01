A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, ITS HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN THE FOURTH

FISCAL QUARTER, WHICH INCLUDES THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AND THE LOWEST VOLUME OCCURS

DURING THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER.

CHAINS. OUR SUPERCENTERS COMPETE WITH OTHER SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS,

INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES AND WITH OTHER RETAILERS FOR NEW

STORE SITES.

OUR

ABILITY TO DEVELOP THE RIGHT LOCATIONS AND OFFER VALUE AND SERVICE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS LARGELY DETERMINES OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WITHIN THE RETAIL

INDUSTRY. WE EMPLOY MANY PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WITHIN

OUR INDUSTRY. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

•

EDLP

– OUR COMMITMENT TO PRICE LEADERSHIP AND OUR PRICING PHILOSOPHY UNDER

WHICH WE PRICE ITEMS AT A LOW PRICE EVERY DAY SO THAT OUR CUSTOMERS TRUST

THAT OUR PRICES WILL NOT CHANGE UNDER FREQUENT PROMOTIONAL

ACTIVITY;

•

ROLLBACKS

– OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUALLY PASS COST SAVINGS ON TO THE CUSTOMER BY

LOWERING PRICES ON SELECTED GOODS;

•

STORE

WITHIN A STORE – A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY TO ASSISTANT AND

DEPARTMENT MANAGERS AS TO MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND OVERALL DEPARTMENT

PERFORMANCE;

•

STORE

OF THE COMMUNITY – A PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT THE MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT IN

A PARTICULAR STORE FITS THE DEMOGRAPHIC NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IN

WHICH THAT STORE IS LOCATED;

•

CLEAN,

FAST AND FRIENDLY – OUR COMMITMENT TO DELIVER A GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

THROUGH FAST, FRIENDLY SERVICE IN A CLEAN

ENVIRONMENT;

•

WIN,

PLAY AND SHOW – A STRATEGY TO SELECT A MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT BASED ON OUR

GROWTH POTENTIAL, ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND CUSTOMER CREDIBILITY IN EACH

BUSINESS; AND

•

SAVE

EVEN MORE  – A STRATEGY TO MEET OR BE BELOW A COMPETITOR’S

ADVERTISED PRICE ON KEY VALUE

ITEMS.

IN

ADDITION TO THESE PROGRAMS, WE BELIEVE OUR BROAD ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE THAT

PROVIDES ONE-STOP SHOPPING, OUR IN-STOCK LEVELS THAT PROVIDE CONFIDENCE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS THAT WE WILL HAVE WHAT THEY NEED, AND OUR LONG OPERATING HOURS THAT

ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AT THEIR CONVENIENCE, PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES.

DISTRIBUTION.

DURING

FISCAL 2009, APPROXIMATELY 81% OF THE WALMART U.S. SEGMENT’S PURCHASES OF

MERCHANDISE WERE SHIPPED TO THE SEGMENT’S STORES THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTION

CENTERS. THE BALANCE OF MERCHANDISE PURCHASED WAS SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO STORES

DURING

FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY DISPOSED OF GAZELEY LIMITED (“GAZELEY”), AN ASDA

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIARY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. CONSEQUENTLY,

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH GAZELEY AND THE GAIN ON DISPOSAL ARE

PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

AND CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO THIS OPERATION WERE INSIGNIFICANT FOR ALL PERIODS

PRESENTED.

DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY’S JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY, THE SEIYU LTD., WILL CLOSE 23

STORES AND DISPOSE OF CERTAIN EXCESS PROPERTIES. THIS RESTRUCTURING WILL INVOLVE

INCURRING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEASE TERMINATION OBLIGATIONS, ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES AND EMPLOYEE SEPARATION BENEFITS, ALTHOUGH ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESTRUCTURING AND

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE AFFECTED STORES AND PROPERTIES ARE PRESENTED AS

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE CASH FLOWS AND

ACCRUED LIABILITIES RELATED TO THIS RESTRUCTURING WERE INSIGNIFICANT FOR ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED.

IN JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANY COMPLETED

A TENDER OFFER FOR THE SHARES OF DISTRIBUCIÓN Y SERVICIO D&S S.A.

(“D&S”), ACQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 58.2% OF THE OUTSTANDING D&S SHARES

(THE "FIRST OFFER").  D&S HAS 197 STORES, 10 SHOPPING CENTERS AND 85

PRESTO FINANCIAL SERVICES BRANCHES THROUGHOUT CHILE. THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE

D&S SHARES IN THE FIRST OFFER

WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.55 BILLION.

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2009, ASSETS RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITION AFTER THE FIRST

OFFER, WERE APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION IN

GOODWILL, LIABILITIES ASSUMED WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION AND MINORITY

INTEREST WAS APPROXIMATELY $395 MILLION.  UNDER THE

CHILEAN SECURITIES LAWS, THE COMPANY

WAS REQUIRED AFTER THE FIRST OFFER TO INITIATE A SECOND TENDER OFFER (THE

"SECOND OFFER") FOR THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING SHARES OF D&S ON THE SAME

TERMS AS THE FIRST OFFER. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SECOND OFFER IN MARCH 2009,

ACQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 16.4% OF THE OUTSTANDING D&S SHARES FOR

APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION, RESULTING IN THE COMPANY OWNING APPROXIMATELY 74.6%

OF THE D&S SHARES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, THE FORMER D&S

CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS WERE EACH GRANTED A PUT OPTION THAT IS EXERCISABLE

BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2011 THROUGH JANUARY 2016. DURING THE EXERCISE PERIOD, THE

PUT OPTION ALLOWS EACH FORMER CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE

COMPANY TO PURCHASE UP TO ALL OF THEIR SHARES OF D&S (APPROXIMATELY 25.1%)

OWNED FOLLOWING THE SECOND OFFER

AT FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME OF AN

EXERCISE, IF ANY.  THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF D&S, AS

WELL AS THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2009, ARE

PRELIMINARY.

MERCHANDISE.

THE MERCHANDISING STRATEGY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF

OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF

MERCHANDISE OFFERED FOR SALE. WHILE BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE ACCOUNTS FOR A

MAJORITY OF SALES, NUMEROUS STORE BRANDS NOT FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE

BEEN DEVELOPED TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DIFFERENT MARKETS IN WHICH THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES. IN ADDITION, STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DEVELOP

RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH COUNTRY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SOURCES OF

QUALITY MERCHANDISE.

8

OPERATIONS.

THE HOURS OF OPERATION FOR OPERATING UNITS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT VARY BY

COUNTRY AND BY INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITHIN COUNTRIES, DEPENDING UPON LOCAL AND

NATIONAL ORDINANCES GOVERNING HOURS OF OPERATION. WE ACCEPT A VARIETY OF PAYMENT

METHODS INCLUDING CREDIT CARDS, DEBIT CARDS AND PRIVATE-LABEL STORE CREDIT CARDS

ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS. OTHER CONSUMER FINANCE PROGRAMS EXIST IN

CERTAIN MARKETS TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF GOODS BY THE

CUSTOMER.

ACROSS

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, WE ARE LEVERAGING BEST PRACTICES, LESSONS FROM

MULTIPLE STORE FORMATS AND GLOBAL PROCUREMENT PRACTICES. IN ADDITION,

RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY GLOBAL SUPPLIERS CONTINUE TO HELP US LEVERAGE OUR VOLUMES

ACROSS COUNTRIES.

SEASONAL

ASPECTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT’S BUSINESS IS SEASONAL

TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. GENERALLY, THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF SALES OCCURS IN THE FOURTH

FISCAL QUARTER. THE SEASONALITY OF THE BUSINESS VARIES BY COUNTRY DUE TO

DIFFERENT NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS, FESTIVALS AND CUSTOMS, AS WELL AS

DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.

COMPETITION.

THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT COMPETES WITH A VARIETY OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND

INTERNATIONAL CHAINS IN THE SUPERMARKET, DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY

AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, WHOLESALE CLUBS,

INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN

WHICH WE OPERATE AND, IN MEXICO, WITH LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

RESTAURANT CHAINS. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS LOW PRICES ON QUALITY

MERCHANDISE THAT OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL VALUE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT

DETERMINES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL

UNITS, OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE THE FOOD DEPARTMENTS EFFECTIVELY HAS A MAJOR

IMPACT ON THE SEGMENT’S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE

OPERATE.

DISTRIBUTION.

WE

UTILIZE A TOTAL OF 146 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES LOCATED IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL,

CANADA, CHILE, CHINA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, JAPAN,

MEXICO, NICARAGUA, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND TWO EXPORT

CONSOLIDATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THROUGH THESE FACILITIES, WE

PROCESS AND DISTRIBUTE BOTH IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC PRODUCTS TO THE OPERATING

UNITS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT. DURING FISCAL 2009, APPROXIMATELY 74% OF THE

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT’S PURCHASES FLOWED THROUGH THESE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

SUPPLIERS SHIP THE BALANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT’S PURCHASES DIRECTLY TO

OUR STORES IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OF THESE 146

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, WE OWNED AND OPERATED 34 AND LEASED AND OPERATED 34.

THIRD PARTIES OWNED AND OPERATED THE REMAINING 78 DISTRIBUTION

FACILITIES.

SAM’S

OUR ABILITY TO OFFER LOW PRICES AND QUALITY MERCHANDISE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

DISTRIBUTION.

DURING FISCAL 2009, APPROXIMATELY 65% OF THE SAM’S CLUB SEGMENT NON-FUEL

PURCHASES WERE SHIPPED FROM THE SAM’S CLUB SEGMENT’S DEDICATED DISTRIBUTION

STRATEGICALLY THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES. OF THESE 26 DISTRIBUTION

FACILITIES, WE OWNED AND OPERATED 8. THIRD PARTIES OWNED AND OPERATED THE

REMAINING 18 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

THE

PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF OUR SAM’S CLUB’S DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS IS ON CROSSDOCKING

PROCESS UNDER WHICH SHIPMENTS ARE DIRECTLY TRANSFERRED FROM INBOUND TO OUTBOUND

TRAILERS. SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY SPEND LESS THAN 24 HOURS IN A CROSSDOCK FACILITY,

SOMETIMES LESS THAN AN HOUR.

RISK

FACTORS

THE RISKS

DESCRIBED BELOW COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. THESE RISKS ARE NOT THE ONLY

RISKS THAT WE FACE. OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL

FACTORS THAT APPLY TO ALL COMPANIES OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY,

AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY

CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS.

GENERAL

ECONOMIC FACTORS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GLOBALLY OR IN ONE OR MORE OF THE MARKETS WE SERVE, MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN THE UNITED STATES, HIGHER

INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, WEAKNESS IN THE HOUSING

MARKET, INFLATION, HIGHER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, DECREASES IN CONSUMER

DISPOSABLE INCOME, UNAVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER CREDIT, HIGHER CONSUMER DEBT

LEVELS, HIGHER TAX RATES AND OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, OTHER REGULATORY

CHANGES, OVERALL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE SELL THROUGH OUR WALMART

U.S. SEGMENT AND SAM’S CLUB SEGMENT, CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL TO ONE

WITH A LOWER AVERAGE GROSS MARGIN, CAUSE A SLOWDOWN IN DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES

OF GOODS AND RESULT IN SLOWER INVENTORY TURNOVER AND GREATER MARKDOWNS ON

INVENTORY. HIGHER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, DECREASES IN CONSUMER

DISPOSABLE INCOME, CHANGES IN TAX AND OTHER LAWS, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY

COSTS, WEAKNESS IN THE LOCAL HOUSING MARKET, CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS AND OTHER

ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ECONOMIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR MERCHANDISE IN THOSE COUNTRIES,

ESPECIALLY THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH AVERAGE INCOMES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN

IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS,

COST OF SALES, INVENTORY TURNOVER AND MARKDOWNS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT.

11

HIGHER

INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS,

INFLATION, HIGHER COSTS OF LABOR, INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES FLUCTUATIONS, HIGHER TAX RATES AND OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, THE

IMPOSITION OF MEASURES THAT CREATE BARRIERS TO OR INCREASE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE, CHANGES IN OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER

ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE

OPERATIONS CAN INCREASE OUR COST OF SALES AND OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. THE ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT

AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS, ALSO AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF

OUR SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM WE PURCHASE GOODS, A FACTOR THAT CAN RESULT IN AN

INCREASE IN THE COST TO US OF THE GOODS WE SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR, IN MORE

EXTREME CASES, COULD RESULT IN CERTAIN SUPPLIERS NOT PRODUCING GOODS IN THE

VOLUME TYPICALLY AVAILABLE TO US FOR SALE.

WE

MAY FACE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR EXPANSION IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING

CONVERSIONS OF DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR

EXPANSION STRATEGY DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS

SUCCESSFULLY IN NEW MARKETS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND UPON OUR ABILITY TO

INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STORES IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE OPERATIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO OPEN ADDITIONAL SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES, NEIGHBORHOOD

MARKETS AND SAM’S CLUBS AND TO CONVERT EXISTING DISCOUNT STORES INTO

SUPERCENTERS DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND

RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

LOCAL LAND USE AND OTHER REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS

OF THE TYPE IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR VARIOUS FORMATS, AS WELL AS LOCAL COMMUNITY

ACTION OPPOSED TO THE LOCATION OF SPECIFIC STORES AT SPECIFIC SITES AND THE

ADOPTION OF CERTAIN LOCAL LAWS RESTRICTING OUR OPERATIONS, MAY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES AND CLUBS, TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO

SUPERCENTERS OR TO RELOCATE OR EXPAND EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN CITIES AND

STATES. INCREASED REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS COULD LIMIT

OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONVERT OUR DISCOUNT STORES INTO

SUPERCENTERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OPEN NEW SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES,

NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS OR SAM’S CLUBS OR CONTINUE TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO

SUPERCENTERS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME

GROWTH, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, IF CONSUMERS IN THE MARKETS

INTO WHICH WE EXPAND ARE NOT RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS OR ARE OTHERWISE

NOT RECEPTIVE TO OUR PRESENCE IN A MARKET, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IMPEDIMENTS

TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR

BUSINESS STRATEGY FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT INCLUDES EXPANSION BY SELECTIVE

ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES THAT ADD NEW STORES AND MARKETS TO OUR

EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OPENING NEW UNITS IN THE COUNTRIES

IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING OPERATIONS. IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING

OPERATIONS, NEW UNITS MAY BE OPENED IN THE FORMATS ALREADY EXISTING IN THOSE

COUNTRIES OR MAY BE OPENED IN NEWLY INTRODUCED FORMATS, SUCH AS SUPERCENTERS OR

SAM’S CLUBS, NOT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED IN THOSE MARKETS. AS IN THE UNITED STATES,

OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES OR TO EXPAND OR RELOCATE EXISTING STORES IN A

MARKET SERVED BY OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR

ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND OUR ABILITY TO

ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAWS CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO ACQUIRE ATTRACTIVE PRE-EXISTING BUILDINGS IN WHICH TO LOCATE UNITS OR SITES

ON WHICH TO BUILD NEW UNITS OR TO EXPAND EXISTING UNITS. IN ADDITION, ACCESS TO

LOCAL SUPPLIERS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ADD NEW UNITS

OR TO EXPAND PRODUCT SELECTIONS IN EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. MOREOVER,

CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN SOME MARKETS INTO WHICH WE EXPAND OR INTO WHICH WE

INTRODUCE NEW RETAIL CONCEPTS MAY RESULT IN THE CONSUMERS IN THOSE MARKETS NOT

BEING AS RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS AS WE ANTICIPATE THOSE CONSUMERS WILL

BE AND MAY MAKE AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO SUCH ISSUES MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR EXPANSION PLANS FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL

SEGMENT, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES AT ACCEPTABLE

PRICES AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING THE ACQUISITION OF ANY SUCH

CANDIDATE IDENTIFIED. ALTHOUGH WE ULTIMATELY BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ANY NEWLY ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO OUR EXISTING

OPERATIONS, NO CERTAINTY EXISTS THAT FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR ALLIANCES WILL BE

SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR OPERATIONS OR CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED IN

A REASONABLE TIME. OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR

ACQUISITION OR ALLIANCE OR TO INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND

ALLIANCES INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE GROWTH OF OUR

INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

FAILURE

TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES, CHANGES IN LAWS AND OTHER LABOR

ISSUES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR

ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD

DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF

QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES. OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR LABOR NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY

TO FIND QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO FILL POSITIONS THAT BECOME VACANT AT OUR EXISTING

STORES, CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHILE CONTROLLING OUR ASSOCIATE WAGE AND

RELATED LABOR COSTS, IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PERSONS IN THE

WORK FORCE OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS WITHIN

THOSE MARKETS, PREVAILING WAGE RATES, CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH AND OTHER

INSURANCE COSTS AND ADOPTION OF NEW OR REVISED EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE, TO ATTRACT OR TO RETAIN QUALIFIED

PERSONNEL, IF OUR COSTS OF LABOR OR RELATED COSTS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY OR IF

NEW OR REVISED LABOR LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTED, OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE COULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY.

WE

FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM OTHER RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS, WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE

RETAIL BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETES

FOR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, STORE SITES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND IN OTHER

IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS WITH MANY OTHER LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL

RETAILERS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE

HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR WALMART U.S. SEGMENT COMPETES WITH RETAILERS OPERATING

DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS,

SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES AND HYPERMARTS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND

CATALOG BUSINESSES. OUR SAM’S CLUB SEGMENT COMPETES WITH OTHER WHOLESALE CLUB

OPERATORS, AS WELL AS DISCOUNT RETAILERS, RETAIL AND WHOLESALE GROCERS AND

GENERAL MERCHANDISE WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED

RETAILERS, WHOLESALERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. INTERNATIONALLY, WE COMPETE WITH

RETAILERS WHO OPERATE DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES,

SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, WHOLESALE CLUBS,

INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. SUCH RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE

CLUB OPERATORS COMPETE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING MERCHANDISE SELECTION AND

AVAILABILITY, SERVICES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS, LOCATION, STORE HOURS, IN-STORE

AMENITIES AND PRICE. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER VALUE AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS

THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EDLP, ROLLBACKS, STORE WITHIN A STORE AND

STORE OF THE COMMUNITY, HAVE ALLOWED US TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR

COMPETITORS IN MOST INSTANCES. WHERE NECESSARY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH

COMPETITORS WHO PRICE MERCHANDISE AT POINTS LOWER THAN THE PRICES WE SET UNDER

OUR EDLP PHILOSOPHY, WE WILL LOWER OUR PRICES ON GOODS FOR SALE. OUR ABILITY TO

RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHANGES IN THE RETAIL MARKETS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SEE “ITEM 1. BUSINESS” ABOVE

FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR COMPETITIVE SITUATION IN OUR VARIOUS OPERATING

SEGMENTS.

ALTHOUGH

THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE

RETAIL INDUSTRY ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING SOME CONSOLIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT

IN INCREASED COMPETITION AND SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE DYNAMICS OF THE RETAIL

MARKETPLACE. SUCH CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN COMPETITORS WITH GREATLY IMPROVED

FINANCIAL RESOURCES, IMPROVED ACCESS TO MERCHANDISE, GREATER MARKET PENETRATION

THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR COMPETITIVE

POSITIONS. SUCH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COULD RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF A WIDER

VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES BY SUCH CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

12

RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOURCED AND THE SAFETY

OF THOSE PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE

PRODUCTS WE SELL ARE SOURCED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL

SUPPLIERS. GLOBAL SOURCING OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IS AN IMPORTANT

FACTOR IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ALL OF OUR SUPPLIERS MUST COMPLY WITH

APPLICABLE LAWS, INCLUDING LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AND OTHERWISE BE

CERTIFIED AS MEETING OUR REQUIRED SUPPLIER STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. OUR ABILITY TO

FIND QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO MEET OUR STANDARDS, AND TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A

TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT

TO SUPPLIERS LOCATED AND GOODS SOURCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH FOREIGN SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED,

THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS’ FAILURE TO MEET OUR SUPPLIER

STANDARDS, LABOR PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY OUR SUPPLIERS, THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW

MATERIALS TO SUPPLIERS, MERCHANDISE QUALITY ISSUES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES,

TRANSPORT AVAILABILITY AND COST, TRANSPORT SECURITY, INFLATION, AND OTHER

FACTORS RELATING TO THE SUPPLIERS AND THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED

ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THE UNITED STATES’ FOREIGN TRADE POLICIES,

TARIFFS AND OTHER IMPOSITIONS ON IMPORTED GOODS, TRADE SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, THE LIMITATION ON THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS

OR OF GOODS CONTAINING CERTAIN MATERIALS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER FACTORS

RELATING TO FOREIGN TRADE ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE AND OTHER FACTORS

AFFECTING OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR ACCESS TO PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR

CUSTOMERS COUNT ON US TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SAFE PRODUCTS. CONCERNS REGARDING THE

SAFETY OF FOOD AND NON-FOOD PRODUCTS THAT WE SOURCE FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND THEN

SELL COULD CAUSE SHOPPERS TO AVOID PURCHASING CERTAIN PRODUCTS FROM US, OR TO

SEEK ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THEIR FOOD AND NON-FOOD NEEDS,

EVEN IF THE BASIS FOR THE CONCERN IS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. ANY LOST CONFIDENCE

ON THE PART OF OUR CUSTOMERS WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO REESTABLISH. AS

SUCH, ANY ISSUE REGARDING THE SAFETY OF ANY FOOD AND NON-FOOD ITEMS WE SELL,

REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE,

JUDICIAL, ACCOUNTING, REGULATORY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS AND CONDITIONS

SPECIFIC TO THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE

CURRENTLY CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHILE, COSTA RICA, EL

SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, JAPAN, MEXICO, NICARAGUA, PUERTO RICO, AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM, AS WELL AS THROUGH JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS IN CHINA AND INDIA

AND OUR OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES IN CHINA. DURING FISCAL 2009, OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERATED 24.6% OF OUR NET SALES. AS A RESULT OF A

RECENT ACQUISITION OF OPERATIONS AND OUR EXPANSION ACTIVITIES IN FOREIGN

COUNTRIES, WE EXPECT THAT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ACCOUNT FOR A

LARGER PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN FUTURE YEARS. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS IN

THESE COUNTRIES OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COULD BE

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR

CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE POLITICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, TRADE

POLICIES, BOTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, CURRENCY REGULATIONS, AND OTHER MATTERS IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES OR

REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON

FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

MOREOVER,

THE ECONOMIES OF SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS HAVE IN THE

PAST SUFFERED FROM HIGH RATES OF INFLATION AND CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS, WHICH, IF

THEY OCCURRED AGAIN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OTHER

FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE FOREIGN TRADE,

MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES BOTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES,

LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND

SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING NUMEROUS FACILITIES

LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LESS STABLE THAN THE UNITED

STATES. ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERALLY

INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. THE

VARIOUS RISKS INHERENT IN DOING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY ALSO

EXIST WHEN DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MAY BE EXAGGERATED

BY THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING BUSINESS IN NUMEROUS SOVEREIGN JURISDICTIONS DUE TO

DIFFERENCES IN CULTURE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

NATURAL

DISASTERS AND GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

THE

OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES, FLOODS AND

EARTHQUAKES, OTHER WEATHER CONDITIONS, SUCH AS MAJOR WINTER STORMS, AND

GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CIVIL UNREST IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE OR

IN WHICH OUR SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED OR TERRORIST ATTACKS, BOTH INTERNATIONALLY

AND DOMESTICALLY, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. SUCH EVENTS COULD RESULT IN PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO ONE OR MORE OF OUR

PROPERTIES, THE CLOSURE OF ONE OR MORE STORES, CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS,

THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE WORK FORCE IN A MARKET, THE TEMPORARY OR LONG-TERM

DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS FROM SOME LOCAL AND OVERSEAS SUPPLIERS, THE

DISRUPTION IN THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS FROM OVERSEAS, THE DISRUPTION OR DELAY IN

THE DELIVERY OF GOODS TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR STORES WITHIN A COUNTRY IN

WHICH WE ARE OPERATING, THE REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN OUR

STORES, THE DISRUPTION OF UTILITY SERVICES TO OUR STORES AND OUR FACILITIES, AND

DISRUPTION IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR STORES.  THESE FACTORS COULD

OTHERWISE DISRUPT AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

THE

SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY AND OTHERS RESULTING FROM

THE HURRICANES IN FISCAL YEAR 2006 RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN PROPERTY

INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND LIMITATIONS IN COVERAGE OFFERED BY THE PROPERTY INSURANCE

MARKETS TO US AND OTHERS. THE INSURANCE COVERAGE OFFERED TO THE COMPANY FOR

NAMED WINDSTORMS, SUCH AS HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

LIMITED AND CARRIED HIGHER PREMIUMS THAN THE COVERAGE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE TO

US. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO BE PRIMARILY SELF-INSURED FOR LOSSES

THAT MAY RESULT FROM NAMED WINDSTORMS.

13

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY.

WE ARE

INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, WHICH INCLUDE CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT,

TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION. CERTAIN OF THESE LAWSUITS, IF DECIDED ADVERSELY TO US

OR SETTLED BY US, MAY RESULT IN LIABILITY MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. WE ARE CURRENTLY A DEFENDANT IN NUMEROUS

CASES CONTAINING CLASS-ACTION ALLEGATIONS IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE BROUGHT

CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS.  IN ADDITION, WE

ARE A DEFENDANT IN

DUKES V.

WAL-MART STORES, INC.

, A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL

PAST AND PRESENT FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN ALL OF OUR RETAIL STORES AND WHOLESALE

CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CLASS AS CERTIFIED IN

DUKES

CURRENTLY INCLUDES

PRESENT AND FORMER FEMALE ASSOCIATES. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE ALLEGE THAT WE

HAVE ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN IN

PROMOTIONS, PAY, TRAINING AND JOB ASSIGNMENTS AND SEEK, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, FRONT PAY, BACK PAY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES. ON

JUNE 4, 2004, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT HEARING THIS CASE ISSUED AN ORDER

GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART THE PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE HAVE APPEALED. ON FEBRUARY 6, 2007, A DIVIDED

THREE-JUDGE PANEL OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

UPHELD THE DISTRICT COURT’S RULING. ON FEBRUARY 20, 2007, THE COMPANY FILED

A PETITION ASKING THAT THE DECISION BE RECONSIDERED BY A LARGER PANEL OF THE

COURT OF APPEALS. ON NOVEMBER 11, 2007, THE THREE-JUDGE PANEL WITHDREW ITS

OPINION OF FEBRUARY 6, 2007, AND ISSUED A REVISED OPINION. AS A RESULT, THE

COMPANY’S PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC WAS DENIED AS MOOT. THE COMPANY FILED A

NEW PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC ON JANUARY 8, 2008. ON FEBRUARY 13,

2009, THE COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED AN ORDER GRANTING THE PETITION. THE COURT OF

APPEALS HEARD ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE PETITION ON MARCH 24, 2009. WE DISCUSS THESE

CASES AND OTHER LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE PARTY IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW UNDER

THE CAPTION “ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” AND IN NOTE 8 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE PART OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS WHICH

ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND ARE

INCLUDED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

IF

WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER-RELATED INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE

OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS, INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS AND BECOME

SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

AS DO

MOST RETAILERS, WE RECEIVE CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS. IN

ADDITION, OUR ONLINE OPERATIONS AT

WWW.WALMART.COM

AND

WWW.SAMSCLUB.COM

DEPEND UPON THE SECURE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OVER PUBLIC

NETWORKS, INCLUDING INFORMATION PERMITTING CASHLESS PAYMENTS. A COMPROMISE OF

OUR SECURITY SYSTEMS THAT RESULTS IN CUSTOMER PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING

OBTAINED BY UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR

CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS, AS WELL AS OUR OPERATIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY, AND COULD RESULT IN LITIGATION AGAINST US OR

THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, A SECURITY BREACH COULD REQUIRE THAT

WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES RELATED TO OUR INFORMATION SECURITY

SYSTEMS AND COULD RESULT IN A DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY OUR

ONLINE SALES OPERATIONS.

WE

RELY EXTENSIVELY ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, SUMMARIZE RESULTS

AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS. DISRUPTIONS IN BOTH OUR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY (BACK-UP)

SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS.

ALTHOUGH

WE HAVE INDEPENDENT, REDUNDANT AND PHYSICALLY SEPARATE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY

COMPUTER SYSTEMS, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS WE HAVE EACH YEAR,

IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE MAINTAIN UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS CRITICAL

COMPUTER SYSTEMS. OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR BACK-UP SYSTEMS, ARE

SUBJECT TO DAMAGE OR INTERRUPTION FROM POWER OUTAGES, COMPUTER AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, COMPUTER VIRUSES, SECURITY BREACHES, CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES, TORNADOES AND HURRICANES, AND USAGE ERRORS BY OUR

EMPLOYEES. IF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND OUR BACK-UP SYSTEMS ARE DAMAGED OR CEASE

TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO FIX OR

REPLACE THEM, AND WE MAY SUFFER INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS IN THE INTERIM.

ANY MATERIAL INTERRUPTION IN BOTH OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND BACK-UP SYSTEMS

MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE PURSUING COMPLEX INITIATIVES TO TRANSFORM OUR INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS, WHICH WILL INCLUDE, FOR MANY OF OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS, ESTABLISHING COMMON PROCESSES ACROSS OUR LINES OF BUSINESS. THE RISK OF

SYSTEM DISRUPTION IS INCREASED WHEN SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM CHANGES ARE UNDERTAKEN,

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS WILL MITIGATE THIS RISK.

IF WE FAIL TO INTEGRATE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES WE MAY FAIL TO

REALIZE THE COST SAVINGS ANTICIPATED TO BE DERIVED FROM THESE

INITIATIVES.

WE

MAY NOT TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS, WHICH COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND OUR MARKET SHARE.

IT IS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT CONSISTENTLY AND SUCCESSFULLY THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OUR

CUSTOMERS WILL DEMAND. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR

ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO EVOLVING TRENDS IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER

PREFERENCES. FAILURE TO TIMELY IDENTIFY OR EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO CHANGING

CONSUMER TASTES, PREFERENCES AND SPENDING PATTERNS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR

RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

OUR MARKET SHARE.

UNITED

STATES.

AS OF JANUARY 31, 2009, IN THE UNITED STATES, WE OWNED 3,100

OF THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH DISCOUNT STORES, SUPERCENTERS AND NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS

OPERATED AND 483 OF THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH OUR SAM’S CLUBS OPERATED. LAND ON

WHICH OUR STORES ARE LOCATED IS EITHER OWNED OR LEASED BY THE COMPANY. IN THE

UNITED STATES, WE LEASE THE REMAINING BUILDINGS IN WHICH OUR STORES AND CLUBS

OPERATE FROM EITHER COMMERCIAL PROPERTY DEVELOPERS PURSUANT TO CAPITAL OR

OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS OR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN CONNECTION

WITH INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BOND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL STORE LEASES PROVIDE

FOR ANNUAL RENTALS, SOME OF WHICH ESCALATE DURING THE ORIGINAL LEASE TERM. IN

SOME CASES, THE LEASES PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL RENT BASED ON SALES VOLUME.

SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF THE COMPANY’S STORE LEASES HAVE RENEWAL OPTIONS, SOME OF WHICH INCLUDE

ESCALATION CLAUSES CAUSING AN INCREASE IN RENTS.

WE USE

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO CONSTRUCT OUR BUILDINGS.

OUR 121

WALMART U.S. AND 26 SAM’S CLUB DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ARE LOCATED STRATEGICALLY

THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES. OF THESE 147 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES,

WE OWNED AND OPERATED 114 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND THIRD PARTIES OWNED AND

OPERATED THE REMAINING 33 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE OWN

OFFICE FACILITIES IN BENTONVILLE, ARKANSAS THAT SERVE AS OUR HOME OFFICE AND

LEASE OFFICE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOR OUR WALMART.COM

EACH COUNTRY IN WHICH WE ARE CONDUCTING BUSINESS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

ARE SUPPORTED BY 146 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AS OF JANUARY 31,

2009.  OF THESE 146 DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, WE OWNED AND OPERATED 34

THE

DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR SOLANO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, HAS ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY’S

STORE IN VACAVILLE, CALIFORNIA, FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CALIFORNIA

STATUTES REGULATING HAZARDOUS WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HANDLING PRACTICES.

SPECIFICALLY, THE COUNTY IS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF A

LIMITED AMOUNT OF DAMAGED OR RETURNED PRODUCT CONTAINING DRY GRANULAR FERTILIZER

AND PESTICIDES ON OR ABOUT APRIL 3, 2002. THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY

NEGOTIATING TOWARD A RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE

DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, HAS ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY’S

STORE IN FOOTHILL RANCH, CALIFORNIA, FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CALIFORNIA

STATUTES REGULATING HAZARDOUS WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HANDLING PRACTICES.

SPECIFICALLY, THE COUNTY IS ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF A

LIMITED AMOUNT OF DAMAGED PRODUCT CONTAINING DRY GRANULAR PESTICIDE ON OR ABOUT

JANUARY 24, 2005. THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING TOWARD A RESOLUTION

OF THIS MATTER. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS

MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (“EPA”) APPROACHED A GROCERY INDUSTRY GROUP TO

RESOLVE ISSUES RELATING TO REFRIGERANT-HANDLING PRACTICES AND TO REDUCE THE USE

OF OZONE-DEPLETING REFRIGERANTS IN REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY THEN

APPROACHED THE EPA INDEPENDENTLY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, AND PROPOSED A PLAN

FOR REMOVING OZONE-DEPLETING REFRIGERANTS FROM CERTAIN TYPES OF REFRIGERATION

EQUIPMENT. THE PARTIES ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING A RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER.

WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

JANUARY 2007, WAL-MART PUERTO RICO, INC. BECAME AWARE THAT THE U.S. ARMY CORPS

OF ENGINEERS (“USACE”) WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF A PERMIT ISSUED

BY THAT AGENCY IN 2003, FOR THE FILL OF 0.23 ACRES OF A CREEK AND ITS CONTIGUOUS

WETLANDS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WAL-MART STORE IN CAGUAS, PUERTO RICO.

ON JANUARY 19, 2007, WAL-MART PUERTO RICO RESPONDED TO THESE ISSUES IN

WRITING. ON JANUARY 25, 2007, THE USACE ISSUED A FORMAL NOTICE OF

NON-COMPLIANCE TO WAL-MART PUERTO RICO REGARDING THIS MATTER. WAL-MART PUERTO

AND WORKING WITH THE USACE TO RESOLVE THE MATTER. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT

PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE

OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON

NOVEMBER 8, 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM THE

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SEEKING

DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANY’S RECEIPT, TRANSPORTATION,

HANDLING, IDENTIFICATION, RECYCLING, TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF CERTAIN

MERCHANDISE THAT CONSTITUTES HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE COMPANY

HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS A TARGET OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO POTENTIAL

VIOLATIONS OF THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (“RCRA”), THE CLEAN

WATER ACT AND THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION STATUTE. THIS U.S.

ATTORNEY’S OFFICE CONTENDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE USE OF COMPANY TRUCKS

TO TRANSPORT CERTAIN RETURNED MERCHANDISE FROM THE COMPANY’S STORES TO ITS

RETURN CENTERS IS PROHIBITED BY RCRA BECAUSE THOSE MATERIALS MAY BE CONSIDERED

HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT, TO COMPLY WITH RCRA, THE COMPANY

MUST SHIP FROM THE STORE CERTAIN MATERIALS AS “HAZARDOUS WASTE” DIRECTLY TO A

CERTIFIED DISPOSAL FACILITY USING A CERTIFIED HAZARDOUS WASTE CARRIER. THE

COMPANY CONTENDS THAT THE PRACTICE OF TRANSPORTING RETURNED MERCHANDISE TO ITS

RETURN CENTERS FOR SUBSEQUENT DISPOSITION, INCLUDING DISPOSAL BY CERTIFIED

FACILITIES, IS COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WHILE MANAGEMENT

CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE

THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY,

THE U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA HAS INITIATED

ITS OWN INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE COMPANY’S HANDLING OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENT

REQUESTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL REQUESTING

DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TWO OF THE COMPANY’S DISTRIBUTION

FACILITIES. FURTHER, THE COMPANY ALSO RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE LOS ANGELES

COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR DOCUMENTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE

INTERROGATORIES REQUESTING INFORMATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGARDING THE

COMPANY’S HANDLING OF MATERIALS AND HAZARDOUS WASTE. CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND THE STATE OF NEVADA HAVE ALSO INITIATED

INVESTIGATIONS INTO THESE MATTERS. THE COMPANY IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE

RESPECTIVE AUTHORITIES. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF

THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON

MARCH 28, 2008, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION FROM THE

MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (“DEPARTMENT”) ALLEGING VARIOUS

VIOLATIONS OF MISSOURI HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH

THE ACTIVITIES OF A THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTOR WITH WHOM THE COMPANY HAD CONTRACTED

FOR RECYCLING SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN

ITEMS TO THE CONTRACTOR FOR RECYCLING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MANAGED AS HAZARDOUS

WASTE. THE EPA HAS INSPECTED THE CONTRACTOR’S FACILITIES, AND BOTH THE EPA AND

THE U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI ARE CONDUCTING

INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED A RESPONSE TO THE NOTICE OF VIOLATION

AND IS COOPERATING WITH THESE AUTHORITIES. WHILE MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE OUTCOME WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

REFERENCE TO THE INFORMATION INCLUDED UNDER THE CAPTIONS “MARKET PRICE OF COMMON

OUR

COMMON STOCK IS PRINCIPALLY TRADED IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE NEW YORK STOCK

EXCHANGE. AT MARCH 27, 2009, THE LATEST PRACTICABLE DATE, THERE WERE

298,263 COMMON STOCK SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD.

FROM TIME

TO TIME, WE HAVE REPURCHASED SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER A $10.0 BILLION

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN SEPTEMBER

2004.

ON

MAY 31, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPLACED THE $10.0 BILLION SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH HAD $3.3 BILLION OF REMAINING AUTHORIZATION FOR SHARE

REPURCHASES, WITH A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED ON

JUNE 1, 2007. UNDER THE NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THERE IS NO

EXPIRATION DATE OR OTHER RESTRICTION LIMITING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH WE CAN MAKE

OUR SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM, WHICH WILL EXPIRE ONLY WHEN AND IF

WE HAVE REPURCHASED $15.0 BILLION OF OUR SHARES UNDER THE PROGRAM. UNDER THE NEW

PROGRAM, REPURCHASED SHARES ARE CONSTRUCTIVELY RETIRED AND RETURNED TO UNISSUED

STATUS. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHEN TO EXECUTE THE SHARE

REPURCHASES, INCLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CURRENT CASH NEEDS, OUR CAPACITY

FOR LEVERAGE, OUR COST OF BORROWINGS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

AT JANUARY 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY $5.0 BILLION REMAINED OF THE $15.0

BILLION AUTHORIZATION. AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INSTABILITY

OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, WE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN

OCTOBER 2008. WE REINSTITUTED OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FEBRUARY 2009 AND

WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR MARKET CONDITIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

PROGRAM.

THERE WAS

NO SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009.
