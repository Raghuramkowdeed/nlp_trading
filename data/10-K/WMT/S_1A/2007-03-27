ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW

COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. THESE RISKS ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS THAT WE FACE. OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE NOT

PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC FACTORS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND

INTERNATIONALLY, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GLOBALLY OR IN ONE OR MORE OF THE

MARKETS WE SERVE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN THE UNITED STATES, HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, INFLATION, HIGHER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, HIGHER CONSUMER DEBT LEVELS, HIGHER TAX RATES AND OTHER

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE SELL THROUGH OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT AND SAMS CLUB SEGMENT, CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL TO ONE WITH A LOWER

AVERAGE GROSS MARGIN AND RESULT IN SLOWER INVENTORY TURNOVER AND GREATER MARKDOWNS ON INVENTORY. HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, INFLATION, HIGHER COSTS OF LABOR, INSURANCE AND HEALTHCARE, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES FLUCTUATIONS, HIGHER TAX RATES AND OTHER CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASE OUR COST OF SALES AND OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES, AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT AND SAMS CLUB SEGMENT. HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, CHANGES IN TAX AND OTHER LAWS, CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ECONOMIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR MERCHANDISE IN THOSE COUNTRIES, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS, COST OF SALES, INVENTORY TURNOVER AND MARKDOWNS OR OTHERWISE

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT.

WE MAY FACE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR EXPANSION IN THE

UNITED STATES, INCLUDING CONVERSIONS OF DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR

EXPANSION STRATEGY DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS SUCCESSFULLY IN NEW MARKETS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND UPON OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STORES IN MARKETS IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO

OPEN ADDITIONAL SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES, NEIGHBORHOOD MARKETS AND SAMS CLUBS AND TO CONVERT EXISTING DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND TO

ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAND USE AND OTHER REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS OF THE TYPE IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR VARIOUS FORMATS, AS WELL AS LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION OPPOSED TO THE LOCATION OF SPECIFIC

STORES AT SPECIFIC SITES AND THE ADOPTION OF CERTAIN LOCAL LAWS RESTRICTING OUR OPERATIONS, MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES AND CLUBS, TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS OR TO RELOCATE OR EXPAND EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN CITIES

AND STATES. INCREASED REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS COULD LIMIT OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO CONVERT OUR DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OPEN NEW SUPERCENTERS, DISCOUNT STORES, NEIGHBORHOOD

MARKETS OR SAMS CLUBS OR CONTINUE TO CONVERT DISCOUNT STORES INTO SUPERCENTERS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, IF CONSUMERS IN THE MARKETS INTO WHICH WE

EXPAND ARE NOT RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

12

IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT INCLUDES EXPANSION BY SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

THAT ADD NEW STORES AND MARKETS TO OUR EXISTING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OPENING NEW UNITS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING OPERATIONS. IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EXISTING OPERATIONS, NEW UNITS MAY BE OPENED IN THE FORMATS

ALREADY EXISTING IN THOSE COUNTRIES OR MAY BE OPENED IN NEWLY INTRODUCED FORMATS, SUCH AS SUPERCENTERS OR SAMS CLUBS, NOT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED IN THOSE MARKETS. AS IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR ABILITY TO OPEN NEW STORES OR TO EXPAND OR RELOCATE

EXISTING STORES IN A MARKET SERVED BY OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE, HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE NEW STORE SITES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. LOCAL LAWS CAN AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ATTRACTIVE PRE-EXISTING BUILDINGS IN WHICH TO LOCATE UNITS OR SITES ON WHICH TO BUILD NEW UNITS OR TO EXPAND EXISTING UNITS. IN ADDITION, ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ADD NEW UNITS

OR TO EXPAND PRODUCT SELECTIONS IN EXISTING UNITS IN CERTAIN MARKETS. MOREOVER, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN SOME MARKETS INTO WHICH WE EXPAND OR INTO WHICH WE INTRODUCE NEW RETAIL CONCEPTS MAY RESULT IN THE CONSUMERS IN THOSE MARKETS NOT BEING AS

RECEPTIVE TO OUR RETAIL CONCEPTS AS WE ANTICIPATE THOSE CONSUMERS WILL BE. IF WE DO NOT EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE OUR EXPANSION PLANS FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING THE ACQUISITION OF

ANY SUCH CANDIDATE IDENTIFIED. ALTHOUGH WE ULTIMATELY BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ANY NEWLY ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, NO CERTAINTY EXISTS THAT FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR ALLIANCES WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY

INTEGRATED INTO OUR OPERATIONS OR CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED IN A REASONABLE TIME. OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE CANDIDATES FOR ACQUISITION OR ALLIANCE OR TO INTEGRATE EFFECTIVELY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES INTO OUR EXISTING

OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE GROWTH OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES AND OTHER LABOR ISSUES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND

OUR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES. OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR LABOR NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO FIND QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO FILL POSITIONS

THAT BECOME VACANT AT OUR EXISTING STORES, CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHILE CONTROLLING OUR ASSOCIATE WAGE AND RELATED LABOR COSTS, IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF

QUALIFIED PERSONS IN THE WORK FORCE OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE ARE LOCATED, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS WITHIN THOSE MARKETS, PREVAILING WAGE RATES, CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH AND OTHER INSURANCE COSTS AND CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEGISLATION. IF WE ARE

UNABLE TO LOCATE, TO ATTRACT OR TO RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL OR IF OUR COSTS OF LABOR OR RELATED COSTS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE AFFECTED ADVERSELY.

WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM OTHER RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE RETAIL BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS COMPETES FOR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, STORE SITES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND IN

OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS WITH MANY OTHER LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL RETAILERS, BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS. OUR WAL-MART STORES SEGMENT COMPETES WITH RETAILERS OPERATING

DISCOUNT, DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES AND HYPERMARTS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. OUR SAMS CLUB SEGMENT COMPETES WITH OTHER WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS, AS

WELL AS DISCOUNT RETAILERS, RETAIL AND WHOLESALE GROCERS AND GENERAL MERCHANDISE WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS, WHOLESALERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. INTERNATIONALLY, WE COMPETE WITH RETAILERS WHO OPERATE

DEPARTMENT, DRUG, VARIETY AND SPECIALTY STORES, SUPERMARKETS, SUPERCENTER-TYPE STORES, HYPERMARTS, WHOLESALE CLUBS, INTERNET-BASED RETAILERS AND CATALOG BUSINESSES. SUCH RETAILERS AND WHOLESALE CLUB OPERATORS COMPETE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING

MERCHANDISE SELECTION AND AVAILABILITY, SERVICES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS, LOCATION, STORE HOURS, IN-STORE AMENITIES AND PRICE. OUR ABILITY TO OFFER VALUE AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EDLP, ROLLBACKS, STORE WITHIN A

STORE AND STORE OF THE COMMUNITY, HAVE ALLOWED US TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR COMPETITORS IN MOST INSTANCES. WHERE NECESSARY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH COMPETITORS WHO PRICE MERCHANDISE AT POINTS LOWER THAN THE PRICES WE SET UNDER OUR EDLP

PHILOSOPHY, WE WILL LOWER OUR PRICES ON GOODS FOR SALE. OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHANGES IN THE RETAIL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SEE ITEM 1. BUSINESS. ABOVE FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR COMPETITIVE SITUATION IN OUR VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE IS HIGHLY

FRAGMENTED, CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING SOME CONSOLIDATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION AND SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE DYNAMICS OF THE RETAIL MARKETPLACE. SUCH CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN COMPETITORS

WITH GREATLY IMPROVED FINANCIAL RESOURCES, IMPROVED ACCESS TO

13

MERCHANDISE, GREATER MARKET PENETRATION THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR COMPETITIVE POSITIONS. SUCH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COULD

RESULT IN THE PROVISION OF A WIDER VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES BY SUCH CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOURCED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE PRODUCTS WE SELL ARE SOURCED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS. GLOBAL SOURCING OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL IS AN

IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ALL OF OUR SUPPLIERS MUST COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, INCLUDING LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AND OTHERWISE BE CERTIFIED AS MEETING OUR REQUIRED SUPPLIER STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. OUR ABILITY TO FIND

QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS WHO MEET OUR STANDARDS, AND TO ACCESS PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLIERS LOCATED AND GOODS SOURCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH FOREIGN SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED, THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIERS FAILURE TO MEET OUR SUPPLIER STANDARDS, LABOR PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY OUR SUPPLIERS, THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS TO

SUPPLIERS, MERCHANDISE QUALITY ISSUES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, TRANSPORT AVAILABILITY AND COST, INFLATION, AND OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO THE SUPPLIERS AND THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, THE UNITED

STATES FOREIGN TRADE POLICIES, TARIFFS AND OTHER IMPOSITIONS ON IMPORTED GOODS, TRADE SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON CERTAIN COUNTRIES, THE LIMITATION ON THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS OR OF GOODS CONTAINING CERTAIN MATERIALS FROM OTHER

COUNTRIES AND OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO FOREIGN TRADE ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THESE AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR ACCESS TO PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, ACCOUNTING, REGULATORY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

SPECIFIC TO THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE CURRENTLY CONDUCT

OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CANADA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, JAPAN, MEXICO, NICARAGUA, PUERTO RICO AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS WELL AS THROUGH JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS IN CHINA. DURING FISCAL 2007, OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS GENERATED 22.3% OF OUR NET SALES. AS A RESULT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, WE EXPECT THAT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN FUTURE YEARS DESPITE THE RECENT

DISPOSITIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS IN GERMANY AND SOUTH KOREA. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS IN THESE COUNTRIES OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR

CONTROL. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE POLITICAL CONDITIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LEGAL AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS, CURRENCY REGULATIONS, AND OTHER MATTERS IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE COSTS OR ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, THE ECONOMIES OF SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN

WHICH WE HAVE OPERATIONS HAVE IN THE PAST SUFFERED FROM HIGH RATES OF INFLATION AND CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS, WHICH, IF THEY OCCURRED AGAIN, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

INCLUDE FOREIGN TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES BOTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES, LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING MAJOR

FACILITIES LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LESS STABLE THAN THE UNITED STATES. ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS GENERALLY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE COSTS AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. THE VARIOUS RISKS INHERENT IN DOING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY ALSO EXIST WHEN DOING

BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND MAY BE EXAGGERATED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING BUSINESS IN NUMEROUS SOVEREIGN JURISDICTIONS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CULTURE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

NATURAL DISASTERS AND GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OR MORE NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, AND GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS, SUCH AS CIVIL UNREST IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH

WE OPERATE OR IN WHICH OUR SUPPLIERS ARE LOCATED OR TERRORIST ATTACKS DISRUPTING TRANSPORTATION AND UTILITY SYSTEMS, BOTH INTERNATIONALLY AND DOMESTICALLY, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. SUCH EVENTS COULD RESULT IN

PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES, THE CLOSURE OF ONE OR MORE STORES, CLUBS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE WORK FORCE IN A MARKET, THE TEMPORARY OR LONG-TERM DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS FROM SOME LOCAL AND

OVERSEAS SUPPLIERS, THE DISRUPTION IN THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS FROM OVERSEAS, DELAY IN THE DELIVERY OF GOODS TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR STORES WITHIN A COUNTRY IN WHICH WE ARE OPERATING AND THE REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN OUR

STORES. THESE FACTORS COULD OTHERWISE DISRUPT AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

14

THE SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY AND OTHERS RESULTING FROM THE HURRICANES IN

FISCAL YEAR 2006 RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN PROPERTY INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND LIMITATIONS IN COVERAGE OFFERED BY THE PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKETS TO US AND OTHERS. THE INSURANCE COVERAGE OFFERED TO THE COMPANY FOR NAMED WINDSTORMS, SUCH AS

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS, WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LIMITED AND CARRIED HIGHER PREMIUMS. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO BE PRIMARILY SELF-INSURED FOR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM NAMED WINDSTORMS.

NAMED WINDSTORM ACTIVITY WAS MINIMAL IN FISCAL 2007, AND THE COMPANY DID NOT INCUR ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES THIS PAST HURRICANE SEASON.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, WHICH INCLUDE CONSUMER, EMPLOYMENT, TORT AND OTHER LITIGATION. CERTAIN OF THESE LAWSUITS, IF DECIDED

ADVERSELY TO US OR SETTLED BY US, MAY RESULT IN LIABILITY MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. WE ARE CURRENTLY A DEFENDANT IN NUMEROUS CASES CONTAINING CLASS-ACTION ALLEGATIONS IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE

BROUGHT CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN

DUKES V. WAL-MART STORES, INC.

, A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL PAST AND PRESENT FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN ALL OF OUR RETAIL STORES AND

WHOLESALE CLUBS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CLASS AS CERTIFIED IN

DUKES

CURRENTLY INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION PRESENT AND FORMER FEMALE ASSOCIATES. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE ALLEGE THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF

DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN IN PROMOTIONS, PAY, TRAINING AND JOB ASSIGNMENTS AND SEEK, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, FRONT PAY, BACK PAY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS FEES. THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT HEARING THIS CASE HAS ISSUED AN

ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE HAVE APPEALED. RECENTLY, A DIVIDED THREE-JUDGE PANEL OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT UPHELD THE DISTRICT

COURTS RULING, AND WE ARE NOW ASKING THAT THE RULING BE RECONSIDERED BY A LARGER PANEL OF THAT COURT OF APPEALS. WE DISCUSS THESE CASES AND OTHER LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE PARTY IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND IN NOTE 8 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE PART OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IS INCLUDED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM 10-K.

IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF CUSTOMER-RELATED INFORMATION, WE COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS, INCUR

SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS AND BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

AS DO MOST RETAILERS, WE RECEIVE CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR ONLINE OPERATIONS AT WWW.WALMART.COM AND WWW.SAMSCLUB.COM DEPEND UPON THE SECURE TRANSMISSION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OVER PUBLIC NETWORKS, INCLUDING INFORMATION PERMITTING CASHLESS PAYMENTS. A COMPROMISE OF OUR

SECURITY SYSTEMS THAT RESULTS IN CUSTOMER PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING OBTAINED BY UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS, AS WELL AS OUR OPERATIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

LIQUIDITY, AND COULD RESULT IN LITIGATION AGAINST US OR THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, A SECURITY BREACH COULD REQUIRE THAT WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES RELATED TO OUR INFORMATION SECURITY SYSTEMS AND COULD RESULT IN A

DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY OUR ONLINE SALES OPERATIONS.
