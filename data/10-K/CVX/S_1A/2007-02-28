ITEM 1A.    RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS CRUDE OIL PRICES. EXCEPT

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF RUNNING AN INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

BUSINESS, CHEVRON DOES NOT SEEK TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

CHANGES. A SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT DECLINE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES

MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND ITS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PLANS.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING

AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS IN

PROMISING AREAS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO BRING

LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON

BUDGET AND SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF

MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER

FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL

EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BY-PRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES

AND/OR

TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, 24 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING

INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA. APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES,

WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN

DECEMBER 2006, OPEC ADMITTED ANGOLA AS A NEW MEMBER EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2007. OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES AT THE END OF 2006

IN ANGOLA REPRESENTED 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL.

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT THE SCIENTIFIC

AND POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE AND

EXTENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT,

WILL CONTINUE, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER REGULATION THAT

AFFECTS THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH UNCERTAIN, THESE

DEVELOPMENTS COULD INCREASE COSTS OR REDUCE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY SELLS. THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS (E.G., THE

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AT OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND THE PROCESSING

OF NATURAL GAS AT LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITIES) TYPICALLY

RESULT IN EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES. LIKEWISE, EMISSIONS

ARISE FROM MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CRUDE

OIL TRANSPORTATION AND REFINING. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH BEYOND THE

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE USE OF PASSENGER VEHICLE FUELS AND

RELATED PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS ALSO RESULTS IN THESE EMISSIONS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, DOMESTIC LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY

MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN

VARIOUS PHASES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. THESE INCLUDE

THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND CURRENT

STATE-LEVEL ACTIONS. SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH CHEVRON

OPERATES HAVE RATIFIED THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, AND THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY COMPLYING WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS WITHIN

THE EUROPEAN UNION. ALTHOUGH RESOLUTIONS SUPPORTING CAP

AND TRADE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE

U.S. CONGRESS, NO BILL RESTRICTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

HAS BEEN PASSED TO DATE.

IN CALIFORNIA, THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE

ON JANUARY 1, 2007. THIS LAW CAPS CALIFORNIAS

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT 1990 LEVELS BY 2020; DIRECTS THE AIR

RESOURCES BOARD, THE RESPONSIBLE STATE AGENCY, TO DETERMINE

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN AND OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT

MANDATORY REPORTING RULES FOR SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE

GASES; DELEGATES TO THE AGENCY THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT COMPLIANCE

MECHANISMS (INCLUDING MARKET-BASED APPROACHES); AND PERMITS A

ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE TARGETS UNDER EXTRAORDINARY

CIRCUMSTANCES. RELATED REGULATORY ACTIVITY IS UNDER WAY WITHIN

THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE COMPANY EXTRACTS

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, OPERATES REFINERIES, AND MARKETS AND

SELLS GASOLINE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME

WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT THE STATE AGENCIES REGULATIONS

WILL AFFECT THE COMPANYS CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS.
