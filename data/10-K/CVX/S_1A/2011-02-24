RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS

PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A HISTORY OF GENERATING

SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND

TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS, SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD

MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL,

WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

GEOPOLITICAL RISK. CHEVRON ACCEPTS THE RISK OF CHANGING

COMMODITY PRICES AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS PLANNING PROCESS. AS

SUCH, AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY CARRIES SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CRUDE OIL PRICES.

DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF HISTORICALLY LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM EARNINGS AND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. THE IMPACT ON

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCT

SALES.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION OR THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING

AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE,

DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO

BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION

ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION

OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES BEYOND ITS CONTROL, INCLUDING

HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL

UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES,

EXPLOSIONS AND SYSTEM FAILURES, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN

SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE NATURAL

ENVIRONMENT.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS HAVE INHERENT RISKS AND HAZARDS THAT

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AND CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT.

CHEVRONS RESULTS DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND

MITIGATE THE RISKS AND HAZARDS INHERENT TO OPERATING IN THE

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO

MINIMIZE THESE OPERATIONAL RISKS BY CAREFULLY DESIGNING AND

BUILDING ITS FACILITIES AND CONDUCTING ITS OPERATIONS IN A SAFE

AND RELIABLE MANNER. HOWEVER, FAILURE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS

EFFECTIVELY COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED INCIDENTS, INCLUDING

RELEASES, EXPLOSIONS OR MECHANICAL FAILURES RESULTING IN

PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF LIFE, ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF

REVENUES, LEGAL LIABILITY

AND/OR

DISRUPTION TO OPERATIONS. CHEVRON HAS IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINS

A SYSTEM OF POLICIES, BEHAVIORS AND COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS TO

MANAGE SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY

RISKS; TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND POLICIES;

AND TO RESPOND TO AND LEARN FROM UNEXPECTED INCIDENTS.

NONETHELESS, IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE CHEVRON IS NOT THE

OPERATOR, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL

OVER THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE AND

CONTROL SUCH RISKS.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS FROM LITIGATION

OR GOVERNMENT ACTION.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. OFTEN THESE

OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES OVER WHICH THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY ARISING FROM PRIVATE

LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENT ACTION, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT SOCIETAL

PRESSURES OR POLITICAL OR OTHER FACTORS ARE INVOLVED, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE IMPOSED WITHOUT REGARD TO

THE COMPANYS CAUSATION OF OR CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASSERTED

DAMAGE, OR TO OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL

TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT

TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY

MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE

ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

25 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES WERE

LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT

INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES

(OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND

VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND

KUWAIT. TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED

RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

CONTINUED POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING CLIMATE

CHANGE, THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT, AND POTENTIAL

MITIGATION THROUGH REGULATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION

AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS ARE

CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. FOR

INSTANCE, THE KYOTO PROTOCOL AND CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL

WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUAL OR PENDING

FEDERAL, STATE AND PROVINCIAL REGULATIONS, ENVISION A REDUCTION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH MARKET-BASED REGULATORY

PROGRAMS, TECHNOLOGY-BASED OR PERFORMANCE-BASED STANDARDS OR A

COMBINATION OF THEM. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO EXISTING

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE SUCH

REGULATION IS CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION

AND NEW ZEALAND.

IN 2010, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

FINALIZED TWO REGULATIONS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT THAT ESTABLISH

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS FOR NEW LIGHT-DUTY VEHICLES

AND CLARIFY PRECONSTRUCTION PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW OR

MODIFIED STATIONARY SOURCE FACILITIES WITH GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS THAT EXCEED 75,000 TONS PER YEAR OF CARBON DIOXIDE

EQUIVALENT. IN ADDITION, THE EPA RECENTLY AGREED TO DEVELOP

ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM

UTILITIES AND REFINERIES. THE AGENCY IS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP

THESE NEW REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN

MAY 2012 (UTILITIES) AND NOVEMBER 2012 (REFINERIES), SO IT IS

NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THEIR IMPACT AT THIS TIME.

THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED AND MAY IN THE

FUTURE CONSIDER LEGISLATION AIMED AT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS. AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT ANY

SPECIFIC CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS IN 2011 OR BEYOND, AND IT IS

UNCLEAR HOW ANY SUCH LEGISLATION WOULD RECONCILE WITH THE CLEAN

AIR ACT OR CURRENT EPA REGULATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2010, CALIFORNIA ADOPTED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING

THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATES

GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT, ALSO KNOWN AS AB32. THE FIRST

COMPLIANCE PERIOD OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BEGINS IN 2012

AND ENDS IN DECEMBER 2014. CHEVRON MAY INCUR COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH EMISSIONS REDUCTION ACTIVITIES, AND THE PURCHASE OF

ALLOWANCES OR CREDITS FOR ITS FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IN

ADDITION, CHEVRONS PURCHASED ENERGY COSTS FROM UTILITIES

MAY INCREASE STARTING IN JANUARY 2012, WHEN ELECTRICITY

GENERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ALLOWANCES OR CREDITS FOR

ELECTRICITY SOLD IN CALIFORNIA.

THESE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS-RELATED LAWS, POLICIES

AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE,

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS UNCERTAIN

AND IS EXPECTED TO VARY BY JURISDICTION DEPENDING ON THE LAWS

ENACTED IN EACH JURISDICTION, THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES IN

IT AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND VARIOUS MINERALS SUCH

AS COAL; THE UPGRADING OF PRODUCTION FROM OIL SANDS INTO

SYNTHETIC OIL; POWER GENERATION; THE CONVERSION OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS INTO REFINED PRODUCTS; THE PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION

AND REGASIFICATION OF NATURAL GAS; THE TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND CONSUMERS OR

CUSTOMERS USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS RESULT IN

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT COULD WELL BE REGULATED. SOME OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CONSUMERS AND CUSTOMERS

USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ACTIONS TAKEN BY

THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL.

THE EFFECT OF REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, THE SECTORS COVERED, THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON WOULD

BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS OR WOULD

NEED TO PURCHASE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS ON THE OPEN MARKET OR

THROUGH AUCTIONS, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF EMISSION

ALLOWANCES AND CREDITS, AND THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR OTHER

REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER THE COSTS

INCURRED THROUGH THE PRICING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES OR INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE OR USE

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY SELLS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

SALES VOLUMES, REVENUES AND MARGINS.

CHANGES

IN MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD.

IN PREPARING THE COMPANYS PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INCLUDING ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, CHEVRONS MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER

APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS AS OF A SPECIFIED DATE. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

EXPERIENCE AS OF THAT DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK

AND UNCERTAINTY. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

AREAS REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BY

MANAGEMENT INCLUDE MEASUREMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS; ESTIMATES OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RECOVERABLE RESERVES; ACCRUALS FOR

ESTIMATED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVES; AND

IMPAIRMENTS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. CHANGES IN

ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE INFORMATION UNDERLYING THE

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

PLANS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES,

COULD AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR EXPENSES.
