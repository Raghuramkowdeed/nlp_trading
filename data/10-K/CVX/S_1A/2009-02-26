RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL,

WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

GEOPOLITICAL RISK.

DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF HISTORICALLY LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM EARNINGS AND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. THE IMPACT ON

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED-PRODUCT

SALES.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING

AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE

HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME,

CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE;

AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER

FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL

EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES

AND/OR

TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, 29 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING

ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL

ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES,

WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

(EXCLUDING RESERVES IN INDONESIA, WHICH RELINQUISHED ITS OPEC

MEMBERSHIP AT THE END OF 2008).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS CONTINUED POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES

CONCERNING CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT

AND POTENTIAL REMEDIATION OR MITIGATION THROUGH REGULATION THAT

COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION

AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS ARE

CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS PHASES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. THE

KYOTO PROTOCOL, CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT

AND AUSTRALIAS PROPOSED CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME,

ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUAL OR PENDING FEDERAL, STATE AND PROVINCIAL

REGULATIONS, ENVISION A REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

THROUGH MARKET-BASED TRADING SCHEMES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

COMPLYING WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS WITHIN THE

EUROPEAN UNION.

AS A RESULT OF THESE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE,

OPERATING, MAINTENANCE AND REMEDIATION COSTS. THE LEVEL OF

EXPENDITURE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

IS UNCERTAIN AND MAY VARY BY JURISDICTION DEPENDING ON THE LAWS

ENACTED IN EACH JURISDICTION AND THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES

IN IT. THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS

(E.G., THE PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AT OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND THE

PROCESSING OF NATURAL GAS AT LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITIES)

TYPICALLY RESULT IN EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES. LIKEWISE,

EMISSIONS ARISE FROM POWER AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

CRUDE OIL TRANSPORTATION AND REFINING. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH BEYOND

THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE USE OF PASSENGER VEHICLE FUELS

AND RELATED PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS ALSO RESULTS IN GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS THAT MAY BE REGULATED.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY

OF EMISSION ALLOWANCES AND CREDITS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON

WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCES OR NEED TO

PURCHASE THEM IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH AUCTIONS AND THE

IMPACT OF LEGISLATION ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER

THE COSTS INCURRED THROUGH THE PRICING OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. MATERIAL COST INCREASES OR INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE OR

USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY SELLS. TO THE EXTENT THESE COSTS ARE NOT

ULTIMATELY REFLECTED IN THE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.
