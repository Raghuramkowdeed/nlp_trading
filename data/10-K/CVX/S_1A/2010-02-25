RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL,

WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

GEOPOLITICAL RISK.

DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF HISTORICALLY LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM EARNINGS AND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. THE IMPACT ON

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED-PRODUCT

SALES.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION OR THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING

AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE,

DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO

BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION

ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION

OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER

FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL

EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, EXPLOSIONS AND SYSTEM FAILURES, ANY

OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO

PEOPLE OR THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS FROM LITIGATION

OR GOVERNMENT ACTION.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. OFTEN THESE

OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES OVER WHICH THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY ARISING FROM PRIVATE

LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENT ACTION, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT SOCIETAL

PRESSURES OR POLITICAL OR OTHER FACTORS ARE INVOLVED, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE IMPOSED WITHOUT REGARD TO

THE COMPANYS CAUSATION OF OR CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASSERTED

DAMAGE OR TO OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL

TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, 26 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING

ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE

BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. TWENTY-TWO PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE

LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

CONTINUED POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING CLIMATE

CHANGE, THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT AND POTENTIAL

MITIGATION THROUGH REGULATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION

AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS ARE

CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. FOR

INSTANCE, THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, AUSTRALIAS PROPOSED

LEGISLATION AND CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT,

ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUAL OR PENDING FEDERAL, STATE AND PROVINCIAL

REGULATIONS, ENVISION A REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

THROUGH MARKET-BASED REGULATORY PROGRAMS, TECHNOLOGY-BASED OR

PERFORMANCE-BASED STANDARDS OR A COMBINATION OF THEM. THE

COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO EXISTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS

IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE SUCH REGULATION IS CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE,

INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NEW ZEALAND.

IN DECEMBER 2009, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) ISSUED A FINAL ENDANGERMENT FINDING FOR GREENHOUSE GASES,

WHICH SPECIFICALLY FOUND THAT EMISSIONS OF SIX GREENHOUSE GASES

THREATEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE AND THAT GREENHOUSE GASES

FROM NEW MOTOR VEHICLES AND ENGINES ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH

POLLUTION. THESE FINDINGS DO NOT THEMSELVES IMPOSE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, THE AGENCY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

PROMULGATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS FOR LIGHT-DUTY

VEHICLES AND REGULATIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN STATIONARY

SOURCE FACILITIES THAT EXCEED AN AS-YET UNDETERMINED THRESHOLD

TO OBTAIN PERMITS IN ADVANCE, WHICH PERMITS COULD REQUIRE

IMPLEMENTATION OF SO-CALLED BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL

TECHNOLOGIES. IN JUNE 2009, THE U.S. HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES APPROVED THE AMERICAN CLEAN ENERGY AND SECURITY

ACT. THIS IS KNOWN AS THE WAXMAN-MARKEY BILL, WHICH INCLUDES

PROVISIONS FOR A

CAP-AND-TRADE

PROGRAM, AIMED AT CONTROLLING AND REDUCING EMISSIONS OF

GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE UNITED STATES. AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHETHER OR WHEN THE U.S. SENATE MAY ACT

ON CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, HOW ANY BILL APPROVED BY THE

SENATE WILL BE RECONCILED WITH THE WAXMAN-MARKEY LEGISLATION OR

WHETHER ANY FEDERAL LEGISLATION WILL SUPERSEDE THE EPAS

REGULATORY ACTIONS.

THESE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS-RELATED LAWS, POLICIES

AND REGULATIONS, MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE,

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS UNCERTAIN

AND IS EXPECTED TO VARY BY JURISDICTION DEPENDING ON THE LAWS

ENACTED IN EACH JURISDICTION, THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES IN

IT AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS MINERALS SUCH AS COAL; THE UPGRADING OF PRODUCTION FROM

OIL SANDS INTO SYNTHETIC OIL; POWER GENERATION; THE CONVERSION

OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INTO REFINED PRODUCTS; THE

PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION AND REGASIFICATION OF NATURAL GAS; THE

TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS

AND CONSUMERS OR CUSTOMERS USE OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS RESULT IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT COULD WELL BE

REGULATED. SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CONSUMERS AND

CUSTOMERS USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS

ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS IN RESPONSE TO

SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL.

THE EFFECT OF REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, THE SECTORS COVERED, THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON WOULD BE

ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS OR NEED TO

PURCHASE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH

AUCTIONS, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF EMISSION ALLOWANCES AND

CREDITS, AND THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR OTHER REGULATION ON

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER THE COSTS INCURRED THROUGH

THE PRICING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. MATERIAL PRICE

INCREASES OR INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE OR USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY

SOURCES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

SELLS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS SALES VOLUMES,

REVENUES AND MARGINS.

CHANGES

IN MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD.

IN PREPARING THE COMPANYS PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INCLUDING ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, CHEVRONS MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER

APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS AS OF A SPECIFIED DATE. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

EXPERIENCE AS OF THAT DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK

AND UNCERTAINTY. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

AREAS REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BY

MANAGEMENT INCLUDE MEASUREMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS; ESTIMATES OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RECOVERABLE RESERVES; ACCRUALS FOR

ESTIMATED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVES; AND

IMPAIRMENTS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. CHANGES IN

ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE INFORMATION UNDERLYING THE

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

PLANS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES,

COULD AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR EXPENSES.
