FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS CRUDE OIL PRICES. EXCEPT

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF RUNNING AN INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

BUSINESS, CHEVRON DOES NOT SEEK TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

CHANGES. A SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT DECLINE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES

MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND ITS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PLANS.

THE SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE

COMPANY DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING

AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS IN

PROMISING AREAS, DRILLING SUCCESS, ABILITY TO BRING LONG

LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON BUDGET

AND SCHEDULE, AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF MATURE

PROPERTIES.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY

NATURAL OR HUMAN FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, EARTHQUAKES,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLOODS AND OTHER FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND

OTHER POLITICAL EVENTS, FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS, OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONS BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY

RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS

BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

HOST GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE

COMPANYS PARTIALLY- OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES, AND/OR TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED

RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL

CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF

EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED

RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE

COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND RESULTS, AND ARE CAREFULLY

CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT

AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, APPROXIMATELY 23 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PROVED

RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS

SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING

COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING INDONESIA, NIGERIA

AND VENEZUELA. APPROXIMATELY 22 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE

LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.
