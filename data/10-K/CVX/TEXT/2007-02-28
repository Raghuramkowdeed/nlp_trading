SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON

CORPORATION,

1

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL,

MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS, MINING OPERATIONS OF COAL AND

OTHER MINERALS, POWER GENERATION AND ENERGY SERVICES. THE

COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

APPROXIMATELY 180 OTHER COUNTRIES. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

(UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND ALSO MARKETING NATURAL

GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM)

OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM

PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL

CAR. CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING

OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND

FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

A LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES

E-4

AND

E-5

OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, CHEVRON HAD NEARLY 62,500

EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 6,600 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES).

APPROXIMATELY 28,800, OR 46 PERCENT, OF THE COMPANYS

EMPLOYEES WERE EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

ACQUISITION

OF UNOCAL CORPORATION

ON AUGUST 10, 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED UNOCAL CORPORATION

(UNOCAL), AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

COMPANY. THIS ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE RULES OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT NO. 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

UNOCALS PRINCIPAL UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS WERE IN NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA, INCLUDING THE CASPIAN

REGION. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDED OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN

PROPRIETARY AND COMMON CARRIER PIPELINES, NATURAL GAS STORAGE

FACILITIES AND MINING OPERATIONS. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

UNOCAL ACQUISITION IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 2 BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-34

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

OVERVIEW

OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, AND INDIVIDUAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

CONTROL OVER SOME OF THEM. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES, REGULATING HOW

COMPANIES ARE STRUCTURED AND WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT

THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME

CASES, LIMITING THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE

DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THESE COMMODITIES. THE

MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES

(OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE WORLDS SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE

OIL, AND THEIR PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN

DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY. DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS

PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS

OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER

PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY

A SIGNIFICANT PART. SEASONALITY IS NOT A PRIMARY DRIVER TO

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON

COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM COMPANIES AS WELL

AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LEASES AND OTHER

PROPERTIES AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR REQUIRED TO DEVELOP

AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS,

CHEVRON ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM

COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION ENTITIES IN THE SALE OR ACQUISITION OF VARIOUS

GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION IN 2001. IN 2005, CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION CHANGED ITS NAME TO CHEVRON CORPORATION. AS USED IN

THIS REPORT, THE TERM CHEVRON AND SUCH TERMS AS

THE COMPANY, THE CORPORATION,

OUR, WE AND US MAY REFER TO

CHEVRON CORPORATION, ONE OR MORE OF ITS CONSOLIDATED

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD. ALL OF THESE TERMS

ARE USED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED AS A PRECISE

AND ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY,

WITH OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA,

THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA, AND AUSTRALASIA. TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2006 WERE $16.6 BILLION,

INCLUDING $1.9 BILLION FOR CHEVRONS SHARE OF

EXPENDITURES BY AFFILIATED COMPANIES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE CASH

OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. IN 2005 AND 2004, EXPENDITURES WERE

$11.1 BILLION AND $8.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES

EXPENDITURES OF $1.7 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION IN THE

CORRESPONDING PERIODS. THE 2005 AMOUNT EXCLUDES THE

$17.3 BILLION ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL.

OF THE $16.6 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2006,

77 PERCENT, OR $12.8 BILLION, RELATED TO UPSTREAM

ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED

FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2005 AND 2004. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS, REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2007, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE 18 PERCENT HIGHER AT

$19.6 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.4 BILLION OF SPENDING BY

AFFILIATES. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS, OR $14.6 BILLION, IS

BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH

$10.6 BILLION OF THAT AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2006, CHEVRON CONDUCTED EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 35 OTHER COUNTRIES.

WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF 2.67 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY IN 2006, INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS IN

CANADA AND PRODUCTION UNDER THE BOSCAN OPERATING SERVICE

AGREEMENT IN VENEZUELA, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENT

FROM 2005. THE INCREASE BETWEEN PERIODS WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION. REFER TO THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-6

FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE

20042006 CHANGES IN PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL

GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS AVERAGE WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN 2007 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES,

INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE PRICE EFFECT

ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN

DEVELOPMENT WORK IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY

PRODUCTION IN 2008 TO THE DESIGN CAPACITY OF 80,000 BARRELS

OF CRUDE OIL AND 40 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS.

THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THE DEEPWATER TYPHOON AND BORIS

FIELDS WERE SOLD DURING 2006. THE PRODUCTION PLATFORM AT TYPHOON

CAPSIZED DURING HURRICANE RITA IN 2005 AND WAS SAFELY CONVERTED

INTO AN ARTIFICIAL REEF PRIOR TO THE SALE.

DURING 2006, CHEVRON WAS ENGAGED IN OTHER DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO.

DEVELOPMENT WORK CONTINUED AT THE 58 PERCENT-OWNED AND

OPERATED TAHITI FIELD, WHERE PRODUCTION

START-UP

IS

EXPECTED IN 2008. DEVELOPMENT DRILLING COMMENCED IN FEBRUARY

2006, AND WELL COMPLETION WORK IS EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED

DURING 2007. INITIAL BOOKING OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

OCCURRED IN 2003, AND THE TRANSFER OF THESE RESERVES INTO THE

PROVED DEVELOPED CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED NEAR THE TIME OF

PRODUCTION

START-UP.

WITH AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE OF 30 YEARS, TAHITI IS

DESIGNED TO HAVE A MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION OF

125,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 70 MILLION CUBIC FEET

OF NATURAL GAS.

AT THE 63 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED BLIND FAITH DISCOVERY,

A SUBSEA DEVELOPMENT PLAN UTILIZING A SEMI-SUBMERSIBLE

PRODUCTION SYSTEM WAS APPROVED BY CHEVRON AND ITS PARTNER IN

LATE 2005, AT WHICH TIME THE COMPANY MADE ITS INITIAL BOOKING OF

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AT BLIND FAITH

COMMENCED IN EARLY 2007. RECLASSIFICATION OF THE RESERVES TO THE

PROVED DEVELOPED CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED NEAR THE TIME OF

PRODUCTION

START-UP

IN

2008. INITIAL TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION RATES FOR THE FIELD ARE

ESTIMATED AT 30,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 30 MILLION

CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS, THEREAFTER RISING TO MAXIMUM RATES OF

40,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 35 MILLION CUBIC FEET

OF NATURAL GAS. THE EXPECTED PRODUCTION LIFE OF THE FIELD IS

APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION

TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ULTRA-DEEP PERDIDO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN

THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO. THE DEVELOPMENT ENCOMPASSES THE

INSTALLATION OF A PRODUCING HOST FACILITY DESIGNED TO SERVICE

MULTIPLE FIELDS, INCLUDING CHEVRONS 33 PERCENT-OWNED

GREAT WHITE, 60 PERCENT-OWNED SILVERTIP AND

58 PERCENT-OWNED TOBAGO. CHEVRON HAS A 38 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE PERDIDO REGIONAL HOST. ALL OF THESE FIELDS AND

THE PRODUCTION FACILITY ARE PARTNER-OPERATED. FIRST OIL IS

EXPECTED TO OCCUR BY 2010, WITH THE FACILITY CAPABLE OF HANDLING

130,000 BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY. THE

COMPANYS INITIAL BOOKING OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

OCCURRED IN 2006, AND THE PHASED RECLASSIFICATION OF THESE

RESERVES TO THE PROVED DEVELOPED CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED NEAR

THE TIME OF PRODUCTION

START-UP.

THE PROJECT HAS AN EXPECTED LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS.

EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN 2006 INCLUDED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A

DISCOVERY EARLY IN THE YEAR AT THE 60 PERCENT-OWNED AND

OPERATED BIG FOOT PROSPECT LOCATED IN WALKER RIDGE

BLOCK 29. A SIDETRACK WELL AT BIG FOOT WAS COMPLETED

MID-YEAR AND ENCOUNTERED THE SAME PAY INTERVALS AS THE DISCOVERY

WELL. ADDITIONAL APPRAISAL DRILLING IS PLANNED FOR THE FIRST

HALF OF 2007.

AT THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED JACK DISCOVERY IN

WALKER RIDGE BLOCK 758, A SUCCESSFUL EXTENDED PRODUCTION

FLOW TEST ON THE JACK #2 WELL WAS COMPLETED IN

MID-2006. ADDITIONAL APPRAISAL DRILLING IS SCHEDULED FOR THE

20072008 TIME FRAME. DATA EVALUATION CONTINUED IN EARLY

2007 AT THE NEARBY 41 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED SAINT MALO

PROSPECT. SAINT MALO WAS DISCOVERED IN 2003, AND AN APPRAISAL

WELL WAS COMPLETED IN 2004. FUTURE APPRAISAL DRILLING IS BEING

PLANNED BASED ON ONGOING TECHNICAL STUDIES THAT ARE

INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL REGIONAL DATA. AT THE

25 PERCENT-OWNED AND NONOPERATED 2005 KNOTTY HEAD

DISCOVERY, A SUCCESSFUL SIDETRACK WELL WAS DRILLED DURING 2006.

ADDITIONAL APPRAISAL DRILLING AND POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT

ALTERNATIVES WERE BEING EVALUATED IN EARLY 2007. AT THE

30 PERCENT-OWNED AND NONOPERATED TUBULAR BELLS PROSPECT, AN

APPRAISAL WELL IN 2006 SUCCESSFULLY TESTED THE EASTERN PORTION

OF THE RESERVOIR STRUCTURE. ADDITIONAL APPRAISAL WORK IS BEING

PLANNED TO FURTHER DELINEATE THE RESERVOIR AND TO EVALUATE

POTENTIAL DEEPER TARGETS. PLANS WERE IN PROGRESS IN EARLY 2007

AT THE 22 PERCENT-OWNED AND NONOPERATED PUMA DISCOVERY TO

COMPLETE AN IN-PROGRESS APPRAISAL WELL AND TO SCHEDULE

ADDITIONAL APPRAISAL DRILLING FOR 2007.

AT THE END OF 2006, THE COMPANY HAD NOT YET RECOGNIZED PROVED

RESERVES FOR ANY OF THE EXPLORATION PROJECTS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BESIDES THE ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPLORATION PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AREA, CHEVRON ALSO

MOVED FORWARD WITH THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL PERMITTING

PROCESS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A NATURAL GAS IMPORT TERMINAL AT

CASOTTE LANDING IN JACKSON COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI. IN FEBRUARY

2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL ENERGY

REGULATORY COMMISSION TO CONSTRUCT THE FACILITY. THE TERMINAL

WOULD BE LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE COMPANYS PASCAGOULA

REFINERY AND BE DESIGNED TO PROCESS IMPORTED LIQUEFIED NATURAL

GAS (LNG) FOR DISTRIBUTION TO INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS IN MISSISSIPPI, FLORIDA AND THE NORTHEAST.

THE TERMINAL WOULD HAVE AN INITIAL NATURAL-GAS PROCESSING

CAPACITY OF 1.3 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY. A DECISION TO

CONSTRUCT THE FACILITY WILL BE TIMED TO ALIGN WITH THE

COMPANYS LNG SUPPLY PROJECTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO 1 BILLION CUBIC

FEET PER DAY OF REGASIFICATION CAPACITY AT THE THIRD PARTY-OWNED

SABINE PASS LNG TERMINAL BEGINNING IN 2009. ALSO IN THE SABINE

PASS AREA, THE COMPANY HAS UP TO 1 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER

DAY OF PIPELINE CAPACITY IN A NEW PIPELINE THAT WILL BE

CONNECTED TO THE SABINE PASS LNG TERMINAL. THE NEW PIPELINE

SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO CHEVRONS SABINE AND

BRIDGELINE PIPELINES, WHICH CONNECT TO THE HENRY HUB.

INTERCONNECT CAPACITY OF 600 MILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY HAS

ALSO BEEN SECURED TO AN EXISTING PIPELINE. THE HENRY HUB IS THE

PRICING POINT FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE

NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE (NYMEX) AND IS LOCATED ON THE

NATURAL GAS PIPELINE SYSTEM IN LOUISIANA. HENRY HUB

INTERCONNECTS TO NINE INTERSTATE AND FOUR INTRASTATE PIPELINES.

DEEPENED

AND/OR

COMPLETED IN THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV RESERVOIRS TO GENERATE

VOLUMES REQUIRED FOR THE NEW SGP TRAIN, AND RESERVES ASSOCIATED

WITH THE PROJECT WERE RECLASSIFIED TO THE PROVED DEVELOPED

CATEGORY. OVER THE NEXT DECADE, ONGOING FIELD DEVELOPMENT IS

EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO PROVED DEVELOPED.

SGI INVOLVES TAKING A PORTION OF THE SOUR GAS SEPARATED FROM THE

CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AT THE SGP PROCESSING TRAIN AND REINJECTING

IT INTO THE TENGIZ RESERVOIR. CHEVRON EXPECTS THAT SGI WILL HAVE

TWO KEY EFFECTS. FIRST, SGI WILL REDUCE THE SOUR GAS PROCESSING

CAPACITY REQUIRED AT SGP, THEREBY INCREASING LIQUID PRODUCTION

CAPACITY AND LOWERING THE QUANTITIES OF SULFUR AND GAS THAT

WOULD OTHERWISE BE GENERATED. SECOND, IT IS EXPECTED THAT OVER

TIME SGI WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND RECOVERABLE

VOLUMES AS THE INJECTED GAS MAINTAINS HIGHER RESERVOIR PRESSURE

AND DISPLACES OIL TOWARD PRODUCING WELLS. BETWEEN 2007 AND 2008,

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RECOGNIZING ADDITIONAL PROVED RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SGI EXPANSION. THE PRIMARY SGI RISKS INCLUDE

UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT COMPRESSOR PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH

INJECTING HIGH-PRESSURE SOUR GAS AND SUBSURFACE RESPONSES TO

INJECTION.

ESSENTIALLY ALL OF TCOS PRODUCTION IS EXPORTED THROUGH THE

CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC) PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM TENGIZ

IN KAZAKHSTAN TO TANKER LOADING FACILITIES AT NOVOROSSIYSK ON

THE RUSSIAN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA. CPC IS SEEKING STOCKHOLDER

APPROVAL FOR AN EXPANSION TO ACCOMMODATE INCREASED TCO VOLUMES

BEGINNING IN 2009. DURING 2006, TCO CONTINUED THE CONSTRUCTION

OF EXPANDED RAIL CAR LOADING AND RAIL EXPORT FACILITIES, WHICH

IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THIRD QUARTER 2007. AS OF EARLY

2007, OTHER ALTERNATIVES WERE ALSO BEING EXPLORED TO INCREASE

EXPORT CAPACITY PRIOR TO EXPANSION OF THE CPC PIPELINE.

VENEZUELA.

CHEVRON HAS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST IN

THE HAMACA HEAVY OIL PRODUCTION AND UPGRADING PROJECT LOCATED IN

VENEZUELAS ORINOCO BELT. THE CRUDE OIL UPGRADING BEGAN IN

LATE 2004. IN 2005, THE FACILITY REACHED TOTAL DESIGN CAPACITY

OF PROCESSING AND UPGRADING 190,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF

HEAVY CRUDE OIL (8.5 DEGREES API GRAVITY) INTO

180,000 BARRELS OF LIGHTER, HIGHER-VALUE CRUDE OIL (26

DEGREES API GRAVITY). IN 2006, DAILY NET PRODUCTION AVERAGED

36,000 BARRELS OF LIQUIDS AND 8 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS. IN LATE FEBRUARY 2007, THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA

ISSUED A DECREE ANNOUNCING THE GOVERNMENTS INTENTION FOR

THE STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, PETRÓLEOS DE VENEZUELA

S.A., TO INCREASE ITS OWNERSHIP LATER THIS YEAR IN ALL ORINOCO

HEAVY OIL ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING CHEVRONS

30 PERCENT-OWNED HAMACA PROJECT, TO A MINIMUM OF

60 PERCENT. THE IMPACT ON CHEVRON FROM SUCH AN ACTION IS

UNCERTAIN BUT IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE COMPANY OPERATED THE ONSHORE BOSCAN FIELD FOR 10 YEARS

UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT WITH PETRÓLEOS DE

VENEZUELA S.A. IN OCTOBER 2006, THE CONTRACT WAS CONVERTED INTO

A JOINT STOCK COMPANY, PETROBOSCAN, IN WHICH CHEVRON IS A

39 PERCENT OWNER. AT THE SAME TIME, OPERATORSHIP WAS

TRANSFERRED FROM CHEVRON TO PETROBOSCAN. NO PROVED RESERVES HAD

BEEN RECOGNIZED UNDER THE OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT, BUT

PROVED RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NEW

20-YEAR

PRODUCTION CONTRACT WERE RECORDED IN 2006. UNDER THE OPERATING

SERVICE AGREEMENT, BOSCAN HAD AVERAGE NET PRODUCTION OF 109,000

OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS PER DAY FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF

2006. NET PRODUCTION FOR THE FINAL THREE MONTHS OF 2006 UNDER

THE JOINT STOCK COMPANY WAS 30,000 OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS PER

DAY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AVERAGE CRUDE OIL DISTILLATION CAPACITY UTILIZATION DURING 2006

WAS 90 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH 86 PERCENT IN 2005. IN

GENERAL, THIS INCREASE RESULTED FROM LESS PLANNED AND UNPLANNED

DOWNTIME IN 2006, DUE PARTLY TO DOWNTIME IN 2005 THAT WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HURRICANES IN THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO. NO

DOWNTIME WAS CAUSED BY HURRICANES IN 2006. AT THE U.S. FUEL

REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL DISTILLATION CAPACITY UTILIZATION AVERAGED

99 PERCENT IN 2006, COMPARED WITH 90 PERCENT IN 2005,

AND CRACKING AND COKING CAPACITY UTILIZATION AVERAGED

86 PERCENT AND 76 PERCENT IN 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY. CRACKING AND COKING UNITS, INCLUDING FLUID

CATALYTIC CRACKING UNITS, ARE THE PRIMARY FACILITIES USED IN

OTHER LIGHT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS U.S. WEST COAST, GULF COAST AND SALT

LAKE REFINERIES PRODUCE LOW-SULFUR FUELS THAT MEET 2006 FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT SPECIFICATIONS. INVESTMENTS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE

LOW-SULFUR FUELS IN EUROPE, CANADA, SOUTH AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA

WERE COMPLETED IN 2006. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES

FOR CLEAN-FUEL PROJECTS IN ITS SOUTHEAST ASIA REFINERIES.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY COMPLETED AN EXPANSION OF THE PASCAGOULA,

MISSISSIPPI, REFINERYS FLUID CATALYTIC CRACKING UNIT TO

FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT CARGO TRANSPORTED BETWEEN

U.S. PORTS BE CARRIED IN SHIPS BUILT AND REGISTERED IN THE

UNITED STATES, OWNED AND OPERATED BY U.S. ENTITIES, AND

MANNED BY U.S. CREWS. AT YEAR-END 2006, THE COMPANYS

U.S. FLAG FLEET WAS ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN TRANSPORTING

REFINED PRODUCTS BETWEEN THE GULF COAST AND THE EAST COAST AND

FROM CALIFORNIA REFINERIES TO TERMINALS ON THE WEST COAST AND IN

ALASKA AND HAWAII. DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY CONTRACTED FOR

THE BUILDING OF FOUR U.S. FLAGGED PRODUCT TANKERS, EACH

CAPABLE OF CARRYING 300,000 BARRELS OF CARGO. THESE TANKERS

ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM 2007 THROUGH 2010 AND ARE

INTENDED TO REPLACE THE EXISTING THREE U.S. FLAG SHIPS.

THE INTERNATIONAL FLAG VESSELS WERE ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN

TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA, BLACK SEA,

MEXICO AND WEST AFRICA TO PORTS IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE,

AUSTRALIA AND ASIA. REFINED PRODUCTS WERE ALSO TRANSPORTED BY

TANKER WORLDWIDE. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY TOOK DELIVERY OF TWO

NEW DOUBLE-HULLED TANKERS WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF

2.5 MILLION BARRELS AND TERMINATED THE LEASE ON ITS LAST

SINGLE-HULLED VESSEL.

IN ADDITION TO THE VESSELS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY OWNS A

ONE-SIXTH INTEREST IN EACH OF SEVEN LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG)

TANKERS TRANSPORTING CARGOES FOR THE NORTH WEST SHELF (NWS)

PROJECT IN AUSTRALIA. ADDITIONALLY, THE NWS PROJECT HAS TWO LNG

TANKERS UNDER LONG-TERM TIME CHARTER. IN 2005, CHEVRON PLACED

ORDERS FOR TWO ADDITIONAL LNG TANKERS TO SUPPORT EXPECTED GROWTH

IN THE COMPANYS LNG BUSINESS. THESE CARRIERS ARE PLANNED

TO BE DELIVERED IN 2009.

THE FEDERAL OIL POLLUTION ACT OF 1990 REQUIRES THE SCHEDULED

PHASE-OUT BY YEAR-END 2010 OF ALL SINGLE-HULL TANKERS TRADING TO

U.S. PORTS OR TRANSFERRING CARGO IN WATERS WITHIN THE

U.S. EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE. THIS HAS RAISED THE DEMAND

FOR DOUBLE-HULL TANKERS. AT THE END OF 2006, 100 PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYS OWNED AND BAREBOAT-CHARTERED FLEET WAS

DOUBLE-HULLED. THE COMPANY IS A MEMBER OF MANY

OIL-SPILL-RESPONSE COOPERATIVES IN AREAS AROUND THE WORLD IN

WHICH IT OPERATES.

CHEMICALS

CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM) IS EQUALLY OWNED

WITH CONOCOPHILLIPS CORPORATION. AT THE END OF 2006, CPCHEM

RESEARCH

AND TECHNOLOGY

THE COMPANYS ENERGY TECHNOLOGY COMPANY SUPPORTS

CHEVRONS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES WITH

TECHNOLOGIES THAT SPAN THE HYDROCARBON VALUE CHAIN FROM

EXPLORATION TO REFINING AND MARKETING.

THE TECHNOLOGY VENTURES COMPANY IDENTIFIES, GROWS AND

COMMERCIALIZES EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO

TRANSFORM ENERGY PRODUCTION AND USE. THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

PORTFOLIO INCLUDES BIOFUELS, HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE, ADVANCED

BATTERIES, NANO-MATERIALS AND RENEWABLE ENERGY APPLICATIONS.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2006, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE

ACQUISITION OF A 22 PERCENT INTEREST IN GALVESTON BAY

BIODIESEL L.P., WHICH IS BUILDING ONE OF THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE

BIOFUEL PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

ALSO ENTERED INTO RESEARCH ALLIANCES WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF

CALIFORNIA, DAVIS AND THE GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. BOTH

ARE FOCUSED ON CONVERTING CELLULOSIC BIOMASS INTO VIABLE

TRANSPORTATION FUELS.

CHEVRONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE

$468 MILLION, $316 MILLION AND $242 MILLION FOR

THE YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES IN THE AREAS DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS

PROCESSES, AND ULTIMATE SUCCESSES ARE NOT CERTAIN. ALTHOUGH NOT

ALL INITIATIVES MAY PROVE TO BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, THE

COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA IS NOT

SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND

SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. CHEVRON EXPECTS MORE ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED REGULATIONS IN

THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS OPERATIONS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF

COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS

OPERATIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING

BUSINESS.

IN 2006, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE $385 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY

7 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES. THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO RETROFIT

EXISTING FACILITIES AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW

FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE UPSTREAM

AND DOWNSTREAM SEGMENTS AND RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR- AND

WATER-QUALITY PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS

REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING

FACILITIES. FOR 2007, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION. THE FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS

OF FULFILLING THIS COMMITMENT ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED

BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND THEIR IMPACT ON

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.    RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS CRUDE OIL PRICES. EXCEPT

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF RUNNING AN INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

BUSINESS, CHEVRON DOES NOT SEEK TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

CHANGES. A SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT DECLINE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES

MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND ITS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PLANS.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING

AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS IN

PROMISING AREAS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO BRING

LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON

BUDGET AND SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF

MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER

FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL

EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BY-PRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES

AND/OR

TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, 24 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING

INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA. APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES,

WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN

DECEMBER 2006, OPEC ADMITTED ANGOLA AS A NEW MEMBER EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2007. OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES AT THE END OF 2006

IN ANGOLA REPRESENTED 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL.

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT THE SCIENTIFIC

AND POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE AND

EXTENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT,

WILL CONTINUE, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER REGULATION THAT

AFFECTS THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH UNCERTAIN, THESE

DEVELOPMENTS COULD INCREASE COSTS OR REDUCE

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY SELLS. THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS (E.G., THE

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AT OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND THE PROCESSING

OF NATURAL GAS AT LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITIES) TYPICALLY

RESULT IN EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES. LIKEWISE, EMISSIONS

ARISE FROM MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CRUDE

OIL TRANSPORTATION AND REFINING. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH BEYOND THE

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE USE OF PASSENGER VEHICLE FUELS AND

RELATED PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS ALSO RESULTS IN THESE EMISSIONS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, DOMESTIC LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY

MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN

VARIOUS PHASES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. THESE INCLUDE

THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND CURRENT

STATE-LEVEL ACTIONS. SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH CHEVRON

OPERATES HAVE RATIFIED THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, AND THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY COMPLYING WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS WITHIN

THE EUROPEAN UNION. ALTHOUGH RESOLUTIONS SUPPORTING CAP

AND TRADE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE

U.S. CONGRESS, NO BILL RESTRICTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

HAS BEEN PASSED TO DATE.

IN CALIFORNIA, THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE

ON JANUARY 1, 2007. THIS LAW CAPS CALIFORNIAS

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT 1990 LEVELS BY 2020; DIRECTS THE AIR

RESOURCES BOARD, THE RESPONSIBLE STATE AGENCY, TO DETERMINE

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN AND OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT

MANDATORY REPORTING RULES FOR SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE

GASES; DELEGATES TO THE AGENCY THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT COMPLIANCE

MECHANISMS (INCLUDING MARKET-BASED APPROACHES); AND PERMITS A

ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE TARGETS UNDER EXTRAORDINARY

CIRCUMSTANCES. RELATED REGULATORY ACTIVITY IS UNDER WAY WITHIN

THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE COMPANY EXTRACTS

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, OPERATES REFINERIES, AND MARKETS AND

SELLS GASOLINE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME

WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT THE STATE AGENCIES REGULATIONS

WILL AFFECT THE COMPANYS CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

CHEVRONS U.S. REFINERIES ARE IMPLEMENTING A CONSENT

DECREE WITH THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

AND FOUR STATE AIR AGENCIES TO RESOLVE CLAIMS ABOUT

CHEVRONS PAST APPLICATION OF NEW SOURCE REVIEW

PERMITTING PROGRAMS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. THE CONSENT DECREE

PROVIDES THAT CHEVRON WILL PAY STIPULATED PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN

VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSENT DECREE, IF DEMAND IS MADE BY THE EPA.

IN JULY 2006, CHEVRONS REFINERY IN PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI

EXCEEDED ITS EMISSION LIMIT UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE FOR

PARTICULATE MATTER. THE EXCEEDANCE WAS REPORTED AT THE TIME AND

THE POSSIBILITY OF A PENALTY WAS DISCUSSED. IN JANUARY 2007, THE

MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (MDEQ) AND THE

EPA ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND A REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF

$210,000 IN STIPULATED PENALTIES FOR THE JULY 2006 PARTICULATE

MATTER EXCEEDANCE. THE COMPANY, THE EPA AND THE MDEQ ARE IN

NEGOTIATION WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF THE PENALTY

DEMAND.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-6 FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF

FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA FOR THE

THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2006.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

CHEVRONS CURRENT AND FUTURE EARNINGS DEPEND

LARGELY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM

(EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION) AND

DOWNSTREAM (REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION)

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT

AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOTH SEGMENTS IS

MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. IN THE DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE LARGEST COST COMPONENT OF

REFINED PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL TREND IN EARNINGS IS

TYPICALLY LESS AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS

CHEMICALS BUSINESS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND

INVESTMENTS. EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANY IN ANY PERIOD MAY

ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE

INFREQUENT AND/ OR UNUSUAL IN NATURE. CHEVRON AND THE

OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AT LARGE ARE CURRENTLY

EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN CERTAIN COSTS THAT EXCEEDS

THE GENERAL TREND OF INFLATION IN MANY AREAS OF THE

WORLD. THIS INCREASE IN COSTS IS AFFECTING THE

COMPANYS

OPERATING EXPENSES FOR ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY FOR THE

UPSTREAM BUSINESS.

TO SUSTAIN ITS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION IN

THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MUST DEVELOP AND

REPLENISH AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS THAT OFFER ADEQUATE

FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED.

IDENTIFYING PROMISING AREAS FOR EXPLORATION, ACQUIRING

THE NECESSARY RIGHTS TO EXPLORE FOR AND TO PRODUCE

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, DRILLING SUCCESSFULLY, AND

HANDLING THE MANY TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS IN

A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER ARE ALL IMPORTANT

FACTORS IN THIS EFFORT. PROJECTS OFTEN REQUIRE LONG

LEAD TIMES AND LARGE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. CHANGES IN

ECONOMIC, LEGAL OR POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES CAN HAVE

SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE PROFITABILITY OF A PROJECT

OVER ITS EXPECTED LIFE. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF

HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES, CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS HAVE

SOUGHT TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACTS OR IMPOSE ADDITIONAL

COSTS ON THE COMPANY. OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY ATTEMPT TO

DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO

MONITOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS, TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT IN

EVALUATING FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND

OTHERWISE SEEK TO MITIGATE ANY RISKS TO THE COMPANYS

CURRENT OPERATIONS OR FUTURE PROSPECTS. IN LATE FEBRUARY 2007, THE

PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA ISSUED A DECREE ANNOUNCING THE

GOVERNMENTS INTENTION FOR THE STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY,

PETRÓLEOS DE VENEZUELA S.A., TO INCREASE ITS OWNERSHIP LATER

THIS YEAR IN ALL ORINOCO HEAVY OIL ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING

CHEVRONS 30 PERCENT-OWNED HAMACA PROJECT, TO A MINIMUM OF

60 PERCENT. THE IMPACT ON CHEVRON FROM SUCH AN ACTION IS

UNCERTAIN BUT IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION

OR LIQUIDITY.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUALLY EVALUATES

OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT KEY TO

PROVIDING SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE, OR TO ACQUIRE

ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO ITS ASSET BASE TO

HELP AUGMENT THE COMPANYS GROWTH. DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER 2007, THE COMPANY AUTHORIZED THE SALE OF ITS 31

PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE NEREFCO REFINERY AND

THE ASSOCIATED TEAM TERMINAL IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE

TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO SIGNING OF THE SALES

AGREEMENT AND OBTAINING NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECORD A GAIN UPON CLOSE OF THE

SALE. IN EARLY 2007, THE COMPANY WAS ALSO IN

DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE POSSIBLE SALE OF ITS FUELS

MARKETING OPERATIONS IN THE NETHERLANDS, BELGIUM AND

LUXEMBOURG. NEITHER THE REFINING NOR MARKETING ASSETS

WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE HELD-FOR-SALE CRITERIA OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT

NO. 144,

IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

. OTHER

ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS MAY OCCUR IN

FUTURE PERIODS AND COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR

LOSSES.

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE

COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE

CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES

ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY

HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS,

PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED

DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY

MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST OR POLITICAL

UNCERTAINTY.

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOREOVER, ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION.

THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IN THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS,

AND ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING ITS

FACILITIES AND BUSINESS.

PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY COSTS AND

OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFICIENT

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS CAN ALSO BE

SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS

CONTROL. EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE NOT

ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION, BUT ALSO PRICES

CHARGED BY THE INDUSTRYS PRODUCT- AND

SERVICE-PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE

VOLATILITY OF THE INDUSTRYS OWN SUPPLY AND DEMAND

CONDITIONS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE OIL AND

GAS INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE

INCREASES FOR THESE ITEMS DURING 2005 AND 2006, AND AN

UPWARD TREND IN PRICES MAY CONTINUE INTO 2007. CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES

ALSO CAN BE AFFECTED BY UNINSURED DAMAGES TO PRODUCTION

FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST.

INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL GENERALLY

INCREASED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2006 AND DECLINED IN THE

SECOND HALF. PRICES AT THE END OF 2006 WERE SLIGHTLY

LOWER THAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. THE SPOT PRICE

FOR WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE OIL, A

BENCHMARK CRUDE OIL, AVERAGED $66 PER BARREL IN 2006,

AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $9 PER BARREL FROM THE

2005 AVERAGE PRICE. THE RISE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES

BETWEEN YEARS REFLECTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASING

DEMAND IN GROWING ECONOMIES, THE HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN SOME AREAS OF THE

WORLD AND SUPPLY CONCERNS IN OTHER KEY PRODUCING

REGIONS. FOR EARLY 2007 INTO LATE FEBRUARY, THE WTI

SPOT PRICE AVERAGED ABOUT $56 PER BARREL.

AS WAS THE CASE IN 2005, A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL IN

PRICES EXISTED IN 2006 BETWEEN HIGH-QUALITY,

LIGHT-SWEET CRUDE OILS (SUCH AS THE U.S. BENCHMARK

WTI) AND HEAVIER TYPES OF CRUDE. THE PRICE FOR THE

HEAVIER CRUDES HAS BEEN DAMPENED BECAUSE OF AMPLE

SUPPLY AND LOWER RELATIVE DEMAND DUE TO THE LIMITED

NUMBER OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PROCESS THIS

LOWER-QUALITY FEEDSTOCK INTO LIGHT PRODUCTS (I.E.,

MOTOR GASOLINE, JET FUEL, AVIATION GASOLINE AND DIESEL

FUEL). THE PRICE

FOR HIGHER-QUALITY, LIGHT-SWEET CRUDE OIL HAS REMAINED

HIGH, AS THE DEMAND FOR LIGHT PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN BE

MORE EASILY MANUFACTURED BY REFINERIES FROM LIGHT-SWEET

CRUDE OIL, HAS BEEN STRONG WORLDWIDE. CHEVRON PRODUCES

HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN CALIFORNIA, CHAD, INDONESIA, THE

PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND

KUWAIT, VENEZUELA AND IN CERTAIN FIELDS IN ANGOLA,

CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM NORTH SEA. (REFER TO PAGE

FS-11 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

CRUDE OIL PRICES.)

IN CONTRAST TO PRICE MOVEMENTS IN

THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL, PRICE CHANGES FOR

NATURAL GAS ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH REGIONAL

SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS. IN THE UNITED STATES

DURING 2006, BENCHMARK PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED

ABOUT $6.50 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET (MCF), COMPARED

WITH ABOUT $8 IN 2005. FOR EARLY 2007 INTO LATE

FEBRUARY, PRICES AVERAGED ABOUT $7 PER MCF.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUMES PRODUCED

IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE INVENTORY IN UNDERGROUND

STORAGE RELATIVE TO CUSTOMER DEMAND. NATURAL GAS PRICES

IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ALSO TYPICALLY HIGHER DURING

THE WINTER PERIOD WHEN DEMAND FOR HEATING IS GREATEST.

IN CONTRAST TO THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN OTHER

REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE

DIFFERENT SUPPLY, DEMAND AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES,

TYPICALLY RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE

SALES PRICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION OF NATURAL

GAS. (REFER TO PAGE FS-11 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE

NATURAL GAS PRICES FOR THE UNITED STATES AND

INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.) ADDITIONALLY, EXCESS SUPPLY

CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD

CANNOT EASILY SERVE TO MITIGATE THE RELATIVELY

HIGH-PRICE CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

MARKETS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO

TRANSPORT AND RECEIVE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS.

TO HELP ADDRESS THIS REGIONAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN

SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS, CHEVRON IS

PLANNING INCREASED

FS-3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INVESTMENTS IN LONG-TERM PROJECTS IN AREAS OF

EXCESS SUPPLY TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND

LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER, ALONG WITH

INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO REGASIFY THE PRODUCT IN

MARKETS WHERE DEMAND IS STRONG AND SUPPLIES ARE NOT AS

PLENTIFUL. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OVERALL

INVESTMENT IN THESE LONG-TERM PROJECTS, THE NATURAL GAS

SALES PRICES IN THE AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY (BEFORE THE

NATURAL GAS IS TRANSFERRED TO A COMPANY-OWNED OR

THIRD-PARTY PROCESSING FACILITY) ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN

WELL BELOW SALES PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS THAT IS

PRODUCED MUCH NEARER TO AREAS OF HIGH DEMAND AND CAN BE

TRANSPORTED IN EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE NETWORKS

(AS IN THE UNITED STATES).

BESIDES THE IMPACT OF THE FLUCTUATION IN PRICE

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, THE LONGER-TERM TREND

IN EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ALSO A

FUNCTION OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS,

AND THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES.

CHEVRONS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

IN 2006, INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS AND

PRODUCTION UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT,

AVERAGED 2.67 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, OR 6 PERCENT

HIGHER THAN PRODUCTION IN 2005. THE INCREASE BETWEEN

PERIODS WAS LARGELY DUE TO VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL IN AUGUST 2005. THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES THAT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2007 WILL

AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. THIS

ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE PRICE EFFECT ON

PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS,

CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF

COMPANY OPERATIONS, AND PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS THAT

COULD BE CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER, LOCAL CIVIL UNREST

AND CHANGING GEOPOLITICS. FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS ALSO

ARE AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE

PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND

THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. MOST OF CHEVRONS UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES. INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM PROJECTS GENERALLY ARE

MADE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION.

APPROXIMATELY 24 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2006 OCCURRED IN THE

OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND

VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN

SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. IN DECEMBER 2006, OPEC

ADMITTED ANGOLA AS A NEW MEMBER EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2007. OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION FOR 2006 IN ANGOLA REPRESENTED 6

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL. IN OCTOBER 2006, OPEC

ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION TO REDUCE OPEC-MEMBER

PRODUCTION QUOTAS BY 1.2 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL

PER DAY, OR 4.4 PERCENT, FROM A PRODUCTION LEVEL OF

27.5 MILLION BARRELS, EFFECTIVE

NOVEMBER 1, 2006. IN DECEMBER 2006, OPEC ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL

QUOTA REDUCTION OF 500,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER

DAY, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2007. OPEC QUOTAS DID NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT CHEVRONS PRODUCTION LEVEL IN

2006. THE IMPACT OF QUOTAS ON THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION

IN 2007 IS UNCERTAIN.

IN OCTOBER 2006, CHEVRONS BOSCAN AND LL-652

OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS IN VENEZUELA WERE

CONVERTED TO EMPRESAS MIXTAS (I.E. JOINT STOCK

CONTRACTUAL STRUCTURES), WITH PETRÓLEOS DE VENEZUELA

S.A., AS MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER. BEGINNING IN OCTOBER,

CHEVRON REPORTED ITS EQUITY SHARE OF THE BOSCAN AND

LL-652 PRODUCTION, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 90,000

BARRELS PER DAY LESS THAN WHAT THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED UNDER THE OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS. THE

CHANGE TO THE EMPRESA MIXTA STRUCTURE DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

AT THE END OF 2005 IN CERTAIN ONSHORE AREAS OF

NIGERIA, APPROXIMATELY 30,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF THE

COMPANYS NET PRODUCTION CAPACITY REMAINED SHUT-IN

FOLLOWING CIVIL UNREST AND DAMAGE TO PRODUCTION

FACILITIES THAT OCCURRED IN 2003. BY THE END OF 2006,

THE COMPANY HAD RESUMED OPERATIONS IN PORTIONS OF ALL

THE AFFECTED FIELDS, AND MORE THAN 20,000 BARRELS PER

DAY OF PRODUCTION HAD BEEN RESTORED. IN EARLY 2007,

ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION RESTORATION ACTIVITIES CONTINUED

IN THE AREA; HOWEVER, INTERMITTENT CIVIL UNREST COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT COMPANY OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

REFER TO PAGES FS-6 THROUGH FS-7 FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM OPERATIONS.

DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT ARE

CLOSELY TIED TO GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND

FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON

INDUSTRY REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS. OTHER FACTORS

INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS

REFINING AND MARKETING NETWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

THE CRUDE-OIL AND PRODUCT-SUPPLY FUNCTIONS, AND THE

ECONOMIC RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL. PROFITABILITY CAN

ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF CHARTER EXPENSES

FOR THE COMPANYS SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN

BY THE INDUSTRYS DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT

TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS

CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND

ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE COMPANYS REFINERY AND

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

THE COMPANYS CORE MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST

COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE U.S. GULF COAST, LATIN

AMERICA, ASIA AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE COMPANY

OPERATES OR HAS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REFINERIES IN

EACH OF THESE AREAS, EXCEPT LATIN AMERICA. IN 2006,

EARNINGS FOR THE SEGMENT IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY,

MAINLY AS THE RESULT OF HIGHER AVERAGE MARGINS FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND IMPROVED OPERATIONS AT THE

COMPANYS REFINERIES.

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDUSTRY MARGINS IN THE FUTURE MAY BE VOLATILE

AND ARE INFLUENCED BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE

OIL USED FOR REFINERY FEEDSTOCK AND BY CHANGES IN THE

SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS.

THE INDUSTRY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BALANCE CAN BE AFFECTED

BY DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES RESULTING FROM

MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND UNPLANNED OUTAGES, INCLUDING

WEATHER-RELATED DISRUPTIONS; REFINED-PRODUCT INVENTORY

LEVELS; AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS.

REFER TO PAGES FS-8 THROUGH FS-9 FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS IN THE PETROCHEMICALS BUSINESS

ARE CLOSELY TIED TO GLOBAL CHEMICAL DEMAND, INDUSTRY

INVENTORY LEVELS AND PLANT CAPACITY UTILIZATION.

THE EFFECT OF SEVEN ADDITIONAL MONTHS OF PRODUCTION

FROM THE UNOCAL PROPERTIES THAT WERE ACQUIRED IN

AUGUST 2005. SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS

WERE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSE AND EXPENSES FOR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MATELY $400 MILLION FROM ASSET SALES. HIGHER PRICES FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN 2005 AND FIVE MONTHS OF

EARNINGS FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS CONTRIBUTED

APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION TO THE INCREASE BETWEEN

PERIODS. APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF THIS AMOUNT

RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER PRICES ON

HERITAGE-CHEVRON PRODUCTION. THESE BENEFITS WERE

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF LOWER

PRODUCTION, HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AND HIGHER

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HERITAGE

CHEVRON PROPERTIES.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2006 WAS $56.66 PER BARREL,

COMPARED WITH $46.97 IN 2005 AND $34.12 IN 2004. THE

AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS $6.29 PER THOUSAND

CUBIC FEET IN 2006, COMPARED WITH $7.43 AND $5.51 IN

2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2006 AVERAGED

763,000 BARRELS PER DAY, UP 5 PERCENT FROM 2005 AND

DOWN 7 PERCENT FROM 2004. THE INCREASE BETWEEN 2005 AND

2006 WAS DUE TO THE FULL-YEAR BENEFIT OF PRODUCTION

FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL

PROPERTIES. THE DECREASE FROM 2004 WAS ASSOCIATED

MAINLY WITH THE EFFECTS OF HURRICANES, PROPERTY SALES

AND NORMAL FIELD DECLINES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

ADDITIONAL VOLUMES FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL PROPERTIES.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION FOR 2006 AVERAGED 462,000 BARRELS PER DAY,

AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 2 PERCENT FROM 2005 AND A

DECREASE OF 9 PERCENT FROM 2004. NET NATURAL GAS

APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION FROM HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN MONTHS OF

PRODUCTION FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL PROPERTIES. ABOUT 70

PERCENT OF THIS BENEFIT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES. SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE

BENEFITS WERE INCREASES IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE,

OPERATING EXPENSE AND EXPLORATION EXPENSE. ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECTING 2006 INCOME WERE HIGHER TAXES

RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN TAX RATES IN THE U.K. AND

VENEZUELA AND SETTLEMENT OF TAX CLAIMS AND OTHER TAX

ITEMS IN VENEZUELA, ANGOLA AND CHAD. FOREIGN CURRENCY

EFFECTS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $371 MILLION IN 2006, BUT

INCREASED INCOME $14 MILLION IN 2005.

INCOME IN 2005 WAS APPROXIMATELY $7.5 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $5.8 BILLION IN 2004, WHICH INCLUDED

GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION FROM PROPERTY

SALES. HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN

2005 AND FIVE MONTHS OF EARNINGS FROM THE FORMER

UNOCAL OPERATIONS INCREASED INCOME APPROXIMATELY $2.9

BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THIS

BENEFIT AROSE FROM THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER PRICES ON

HERITAGE-CHEVRON PRODUCTION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THESE BENEFITS WERE HIGHER EXPENSES BETWEEN PERIODS

FOR CERTAIN INCOME TAX ITEMS, INCLUDING THE ABSENCE OF

A $200 MILLION BENEFIT IN 2004 RELATING TO CHANGES IN

UNINSURED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HURRICANES IN 2005

AND A NUMBER OF CORPORATE ITEMS THAT INDIVIDUALLY WERE

NOT SIGNIFICANT. TOTAL EXPENSES INCREASED IN 2005 FROM

2004 DUE MAINLY TO THE INCLUSION OF FORMER-UNOCAL

AND SETTLEMENT OF A TAX CLAIM IN VENEZUELA. RATES WERE

INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY INC.

AT YEAR-END 2006, CHEVRON OWNED A 19 PERCENT

EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COMMON STOCK OF DYNEGY INC., A

PROVIDER OF ELECTRICITY TO MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS

THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY COMMON STOCK WAS APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION.

THIS AMOUNT WAS ABOUT $180 MILLION BELOW THE COMPANYS

PROPORTIONATE INTEREST IN DYNEGYS UNDERLYING NET

ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

WRITE-DOWNS OF THE INVESTMENT IN 2002 FOR DECLINES IN

THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES BELOW THE

COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY. THE DIFFERENCE HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE

EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC DYNEGY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE

VARIOUS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF

THE DYNEGY SHARES. THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF

DYNEGYS REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY WHEN

APPROPRIATE TO RECOGNIZE A PORTION OF THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND DYNEGYS HISTORICAL

BOOK VALUES. THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGYS COMMON STOCK AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, WAS APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION.

INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK

IN MAY

2006, THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY SERIES C

PREFERRED STOCK WAS REDEEMED AT ITS FACE VALUE OF

$400 MILLION. UPON REDEMPTION OF THE PREFERRED STOCK,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OF $130

MILLION ($87 MILLION AFTER TAX).

DYNEGY PROPOSED BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH LS POWER

GROUP

DYNEGY AND LS POWER GROUP, A PRIVATELY HELD POWER

PLANT INVESTOR, DEVELOPER AND MANAGER, ANNOUNCED IN

SEPTEMBER 2006 THAT THE COMPANIES HAD EXECUTED A

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO COMBINE DYNEGYS ASSETS AND

OPERATIONS WITH LS POWER GROUPS POWER-GENERATION

PORTFOLIO AND FOR DYNEGY TO ACQUIRE A 50 PERCENT

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN A DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURE WITH

LS POWER. UPON CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION, CHEVRON WILL

RECEIVE THE SAME NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE NEW COMPANYS

CLASS A COMMON STOCK THAT IT CURRENTLY HOLDS IN DYNEGY.

CHEVRONS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE COMBINED COMPANY

WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT. THE TRANSACTION IS

SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE

AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF TWO-THIRDS OF DYNEGYS COMMON

SHAREHOLDERS AND THE RECEIPT OF REGULATORY APPROVALS.

COMPARED WITH $20.1 BILLION IN 2005 AND $14.7 BILLION

IN 2004.

THE 2006 INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES MAINLY REFLECTED HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE

UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM SEGMENTS, INCLUDING A FULL YEAR

OF EARNINGS FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS THAT WERE

ACQUIRED IN AUGUST 2005. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WAS NET OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE PENSION

PLANS OF $0.4 BILLION, $1.0 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION IN

2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY

OF $1.0 BILLION IN 2006, $2.7 BILLION IN 2005 AND $3.7

BILLION IN 2004.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ASSET

SALES DURING 2006 WAS SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANYS

THE COMPANY PAID DIVIDENDS OF

APPROXIMATELY $4.4 BILLION IN 2006, $3.8 BILLION IN

DEBT, CAPITAL LEASE AND MINORITY INTEREST

OBLIGATIONS

TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE BALANCES WERE

$9.8 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, DOWN FROM $12.9 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAD MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS OF

$209 MILLION, UP FROM $200 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005.

THE $3.1 BILLION REDUCTION IN TOTAL DEBT AND

CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DURING 2006 INCLUDED THE

EARLY REDEMPTION AND MATURITY OF SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL

DEBT ISSUES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER, $185 MILLION OF

UNION OIL COMPANY BONDS MATURED. IN THE SECOND QUARTER,

THE COMPANY REDEEMED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF

UNOCAL DEBT PRIOR TO MATURITY. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, A

$129 MILLION TEXACO CAPITAL INC. BOND MATURED, AND

UNION OIL COMPANY BONDS OF $196 MILLION WERE REDEEMED

PRIOR TO MATURITY. COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCES AT THE END

OF 2006 WERE REDUCED $626 MILLION FROM YEAR-END 2005.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, A $144 MILLION TEXACO CAPITAL INC.

BOND MATURED.

THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS

DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT, TOTALED $6.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, UP

FROM $5.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005. OF THESE AMOUNTS,

$4.5 BILLION AND $4.9 BILLION

WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH

PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END 2006, SETTLEMENT OF

THE RECLASSIFIED AMOUNT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE

THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2007, AS THE COMPANY HAD

THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED

CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE THE AMOUNTS ON A

LONG-TERM BASIS. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO

MAINTAIN COMMERCIAL PAPER LEVELS IT BELIEVES

APPROPRIATE AND ECONOMIC.

AT YEAR-END 2006, THE COMPANY HAD $5 BILLION IN

COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR BANKS,

WHICH PERMITTED THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE FACILITIES

SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND CAN BE USED FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS

BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH

NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS,

MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY

BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED

INDEBTEDNESS AT INTEREST RATES BASED ON THE LONDON

INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING

RATES PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS

REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO

BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS THREE

EXISTING EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS ON

FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT

TOGETHER WOULD PERMIT ADDITIONAL REGISTERED DEBT

OFFERINGS UP TO AN AGGREGATE $3.8 BILLION OF DEBT

SECURITIES.

IN 2004, CHEVRON ENTERED INTO $1 BILLION OF

INTEREST RATE SWAP TRANSACTIONS, IN WHICH THE COMPANY

RECEIVES A FIXED INTEREST RATE AND PAYS A FLOATING

RATE, BASED ON THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE SWAP AGREEMENTS, OF WHICH $250 MILLION

AND $750 MILLION WILL TERMINATE IN SEPTEMBER 2007 AND

FEBRUARY 2008, RESPECTIVELY, THE NET

CASH SETTLEMENT WILL BE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

FIXED INTEREST RATES AND FLOATING INTEREST RATES.

THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING PUBLIC BONDS ISSUED BY

CHEVRON CORPORATION PROFIT SHARING/SAVINGS PLAN TRUST

FUND, CHEVRON CANADA FUNDING COMPANY (FORMERLY CHEVRON

TEXACO CAPITAL COMPANY), TEXACO CAPITAL INC. AND UNION

OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE

GUARANTEED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ARE RATED AA BY

INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANYS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER

IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND P-1 BY

MOODYS, AND THE COMPANYS CANADIAN COMMERCIAL PAPER IS

RATED R-1 (MIDDLE) BY DOMINION BOND RATING SERVICE. ALL

OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY, INVESTMENT-GRADE

SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT

PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE

CAPITAL-SPENDING

PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET

DISPOSITIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED

CASH REQUIREMENTS AND THAT DURING PERIODS OF LOW

PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW

MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY CHEMICALS,

IT HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE BORROWINGS AND/OR

MODIFY CAPITAL-SPENDING PLANS TO CONTINUE PAYING THE

COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE COMPANYS

HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

A $5 BILLION

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM INITIATED IN DECEMBER 2005

WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2006. DURING 2006, ABOUT

78.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THIS

PROGRAM AT A TOTAL COST OF $4.9 BILLION.

IN DECEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY AUTHORIZED THE

ACQUISITION OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION OF ITS

COMMON SHARES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES,

AS PERMITTED BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL

REQUIREMENTS AND SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER

FACTORS. THE PROGRAM IS FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO THREE

YEARS AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. UNDER THIS

PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 1.3 MILLION

SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR $100 MILLION DURING

DECEMBER 2006 AND THROUGH MID-FEBRUARY 2007 INCREASED

THE TOTAL SHARES ACQUIRED TO 8.2 MILLION AT A COST OF

$592 MILLION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL

REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2006 WERE $16.6 BILLION,

INCLUDING $1.9 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE CASH

OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. IN 2005 AND 2004, EXPENDITURES

WERE $11.1 BILLION AND $8.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES

EXPENDITURES OF $1.7 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION IN THE

COR-

RESPONDING PERIODS. THE 2005 AMOUNT EXCLUDES THE

$17.3 BILLION ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL CORPORATION.

OF THE $16.6 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2006,

ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS, OR $12.8 BILLION, RELATED TO

UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE

WAS ALSO EXPENDED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2005 AND

2004. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70

PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IN EACH OF

THE THREE YEARS, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING

FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

IN 2007, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WILL BE 18 PERCENT HIGHER AT

$19.6 BILLION,

INCLUDING $2.4 BILLION OF

SPENDING BY AFFILIATES.

ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE

TOTAL, OR $14.6 BILLION,

IS BUDGETED FOR

LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE

GUARANTEES.

THE $296 MILLION IN GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO

AFFILIATES RELATED TO BORROWINGS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS.

THESE GUARANTEES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE LOWER

INTEREST RATES AND GENERALLY COVER THE CONSTRUCTION

PERIODS OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. INCLUDED IN THESE

AMOUNTS ARE THE COMPANYS GUARANTEES OF $214 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH A CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION GUARANTEE FOR

THE DEBT FINANCING OF THE COMPANYS EQUITY INTEREST IN

THE BTC CRUDE OIL PIPELINE PROJECT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE $296 MILLION GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN 2007

AND 2011, WITH THE REMAINING EXPIRING BY THE END OF

2015. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THE GUARANTEE SHOULD AN

AFFILIATE BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS, GENERALLY

FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED.

THE $131 MILLION IN GUARANTEES PROVIDED ON BEHALF

OF THIRD PARTIES RELATE TO CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO

GOVERNMENTS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE $131

MILLION IN GUARANTEES EXPIRE BY 2011, WITH THE

REMAINDER EXPIRING BY 2015. THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES

SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN OR CONTRACT

TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, CHEVRON ALSO HAD

OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES FOR ABOUT $120 MILLION OF

EQUILON DEBT AND LEASES. FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 2002

DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN EQUILON, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED AN INDEMNIFICATION FROM SHELL FOR ANY CLAIMS

ARISING FROM THE GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY HAS

FS-14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOT RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES.

APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED

WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THE 2007 THROUGH 2011 PERIOD, WITH

THE GUARANTEES OF THE REMAINING AMOUNTS EXPIRING BY

2019.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN

INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION

WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN

THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

PERFORM IF THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL

LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300 MILLION.

THROUGH THE END OF 2006, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY

$48 MILLION UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE

OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION

PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING

TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO

ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON

AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL,

THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT

TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER

2001. CLAIMS RELATING TO EQUILON INDEMNITIES MUST BE

ASSERTED EITHER AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY 2007 OR NO LATER

THAN FEBRUARY 2009, AND CLAIMS RELATING TO MOTIVA

INDEMNITIES MUST BE ASSERTED EITHER AS EARLY AS

FEBRUARY 2007 OR NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2012. UNDER THE

TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT

ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY

HAS NOT RECORDED ANY LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS

UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS

COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE

INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE

CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY

EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY

APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED

CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT

WERE SOLD IN 1997. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT,

THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED UNTIL APRIL 2022,

WHEN THE LIABILITY EXPIRES. THE ACQUIRER SHARES IN

CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM

OBLIGATION OF $200 MILLION, WHICH HAD NOT BEEN REACHED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006.

SECURITIZATION

THE COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN

RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN ITS DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE

ENTITIES (SPES). AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY

$1.2 BILLION, REPRESENTING ABOUT 7 PERCENT OF CHEVRONS

TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE BALANCE,

WERE SECURITIZED. CHEVRONS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL

EXPOSURE UNDER THESE SECURITIZATIONS AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, WAS APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION. THESE ARRANGEMENTS

HAVE THE EFFECT OF ACCELERATING CHEVRONS COLLECTION OF

THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SPES

EXPERIENCE MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF

RECEIVABLES, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO LOSS EXPOSURE

CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN THESE

SECURITIZATIONS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY

PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND

STORAGE CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS, UTILITIES, AND

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE

APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE

VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE: 2007  $3.2 BILLION; 2008 

$1.7 BILLION; 2009  $2.1 BILLION; 2010  $1.9

BILLION; 2011  $0.9 BILLION; 2012 AND AFTER  $4.1

BILLION. A PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS MAY ULTIMATELY

BE SHARED WITH PROJECT PARTNERS. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER

THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION IN 2006,

$2.1 BILLION IN 2005 AND $1.6 BILLION IN 2004.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS

EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO THE PRICE VOLATILITY

OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL

GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY

FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY,

INCLUDING: FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND STORAGE OF

CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY REFINERIES. THE

COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR

LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF THIS ACTIVITY

WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS IN 2006.

THE COMPANYS MARKET EXPOSURE POSITIONS ARE

MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN INTERNAL

RISK

FS-15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONTROL GROUP TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE

COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN

APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD

OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS

RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING ACTIVITIES CONSIST MAINLY

OF FUTURES, OPTIONS, AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE

NYMEX (NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE) AND ON ELECTRONIC

PLATFORMS OF ICE (INTER-CONTINENTAL EXCHANGE) AND

GLOBEX (CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE). IN ADDITION,

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCT SWAP

CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO

PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER

OIL AND GAS COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER

MARKETS.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED

AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN

INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM

PUBLISHED MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT

THIRD-PARTY QUOTES.

EACH HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE

PRICE OF NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS

WOULD INCREASE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NATURAL GAS

PURCHASE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BY APPROXIMATELY $10

MILLION, INCREASE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CRUDE OIL PURCHASE DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS BY ABOUT $4 MILLION AND REDUCE THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE REFINED PRODUCT SALE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

BY ABOUT $30 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE SAME

HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN THE PRICES OF THESE

COMMODITIES WOULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY THE SAME

OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS.

THE HYPOTHETICAL EFFECT ON THESE CONTRACTS WAS

ESTIMATED BY CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

CONTRACTS AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL

AND CURRENT MARKET PRICES MULTIPLIED BY THE CONTRACT

AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180 DAYS

OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND

ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN

CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS,

FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES

REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT YEAR-END

2006 WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $40

MILLION. THE EFFECT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE FOR A

HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT DECREASE IN THE YEAR-END VALUE

OF THE U.S. DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST

RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE

THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY

REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED

TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH

RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

AT YEAR-END 2006, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY

OF RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS

APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR. THERE WERE NO RECEIVE

FLOATING SWAPS OUTSTANDING AT YEAR END. A

HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE OF 10 BASIS POINTS IN FIXED

INTEREST RATES WOULD REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

RECEIVE FIXED SWAPS BY APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION.

FOR THE FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THERE WAS NOT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN

MARKET RISK BETWEEN 2006 AND 2005.

THE HYPOTHETICAL VARIANCES USED IN THIS SECTION

WERE SELECTED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND DO NOT

REPRESENT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATION OF MARKET CHANGES.

THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES COULD DIFFER

MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS

REPORT, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING

RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A, OF THE COMPANYS

2006 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS

ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM

SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS. LONG-TERM PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS ARE IN PLACE WITH THE COMPANYS REFINING

AFFILIATE IN THAILAND. REFER TO PAGE FS-15 FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOREGOING

AGREEMENTS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED ON TERMS

CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED

WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY

TO APPROXIMATELY 75 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE MAJORITY

OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND

REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE IN CERTAIN

OXYGENATED GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGE OF MTBE

INTO GROUNDWATER. RESOLUTION OF THESE ACTIONS MAY

ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE

THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE

OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE,

INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE

FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT USE MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE

OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

RFG PATENT

FOURTEEN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE

BROUGHT BY CONSUMERS OF REFORMULATED GASOLINE (RFG)

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALLEGING THAT UNOCAL MISLED THE CALIFORNIA AIR

RESOURCES BOARD INTO ADOPTING STANDARDS FOR

COMPOSITION OF RFG THAT OVERLAPPED WITH UNOCALS

UNDISCLOSED AND PENDING PATENTS. ELEVEN LAWSUITS ARE

NOW CONSOLIDATED IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND THREE ARE

CONSOLIDATED IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT. UNOCAL IS

ALLEGED TO HAVE MONOPOLIZED, CONSPIRED AND ENGAGED IN

UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION, RESULTING IN INJURY TO

CONSUMERS OF RFG. PLAINTIFFS IN BOTH CONSOLIDATED

ACTIONS SEEK UNSPECIFIED ACTUAL AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES,

ATTORNEYS FEES, AND INTEREST ON BEHALF OF AN ALLEGED

CLASS OF CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED SUMMERTIME RFG IN

CALIFORNIA FROM JANUARY 1995 THROUGH AUGUST 2005.

UNOCAL BELIEVES IT HAS VALID DEFENSES AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST

THESE LAWSUITS. THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL EXPOSURE

RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS CANNOT CURRENTLY BE

ESTIMATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS

CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY

TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON

THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR

PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS

SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES

AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER

STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL FIELDS, SERVICE

STATIONS, TERMINALS,

LAND

DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND

MINING OPERATIONS,

WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED

OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE

COSTS ARE NOT FULLY

DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH

FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN

MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE

CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT

OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE

DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN

PROPORTION TO OTHER

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND

THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH

COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE

FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN

ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE

COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE

SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE

POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL

PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

CHEVRONS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS $1,441 MILLION. INCLUDED IN THIS

BALANCE WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OF 242 SITES FOR

WHICH THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE

REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS

OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS.

THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT

YEAR-END 2006 WAS $122 MILLION. THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND

LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND

SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY

FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES

TO REQUIRE CHEVRON TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS

WASTE SITES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2006 ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,319 MILLION, $834 MILLION

RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 2,250 SITES FOR THE COMPANYS

U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND

OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE

STATIONS AND TERMINALS), AND PIPELINES. THE REMAINING

$485 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN THE

INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($117 MILLION), UPSTREAM ($252

MILLION), CHEMICALS ($61 MILLION) AND OTHER ($55

MILLION). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING,

CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR

GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE

ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF

CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR

EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR

FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND

MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE

CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH

IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION

AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR LOCAL

REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END

2006 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO

INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE RECORDED,

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST

OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO

SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE

CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION

TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH

SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY

IMPLEMENTED FASB STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143). UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR

PROPERTIES. REFER TO NOTE 24 ON PAGE FS-58

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS,

SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS FACILITIES, NO

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX

EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE LIABILITIES

GENERALLY ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE

ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED. THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES

HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1996 FOR CHEVRON CORPORATION,

1997 FOR UNOCAL CORPORATION (UNOCAL) AND 2001 FOR

TEXACO CORPORATION (TEXACO). CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX

LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1991 FOR CHEVRON,

1998 FOR UNOCAL AND 1987 FOR TEXACO. SETTLEMENT OF OPEN

TAX YEARS, AS WELL AS TAX ISSUES IN OTHER COUNTRIES

WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES, IS NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY AND, IN

THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME AND

FRANCHISE TAXES FOR ALL YEARS UNDER EXAMINATION OR

SUBJECT TO FUTURE EXAMINATION.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

CHEVRON AND ITS AFFILIATES

CONDUCT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN APPROXIMATELY 180

COUNTRIES. BESIDES THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY AND

ITS AFFILIATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE

FOLLOWING COUNTRIES: ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA,

AZERBAIJAN, BANGLADESH, BRAZIL, CAMBODIA, CANADA, CHAD,

CHINA, COLOMBIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO,

DENMARK, FRANCE, INDIA, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN, MYANMAR,

THE NETHERLANDS, NIGERIA, NORWAY, THE PARTITIONED

NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA, THE

PHILIPPINES, REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, SINGAPORE, SOUTH

AFRICA, SOUTH KOREA, THAILAND, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, THE

UNITED KINGDOM, VENEZUELA, AND VIETNAM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY

CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL

ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES

IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. AS HAS OCCURRED

IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS TO

INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY

OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR ASSETS OR TO IMPOSE

ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES ON THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS OR BOTH.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED

RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS,

POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE

SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED

PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF

VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND

THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS

AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT

WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE

ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF

EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS FIELDS. THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE

WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF FUTURE

DRILLING ACTIVITY OR DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $1.2

BILLION OF SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AN INCREASE OF $130

MILLION FROM 2005 AND AN INCREASE OF $568 MILLION FROM

2004. MORE THAN $300 MILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS WERE

ADDED AT THE TIME OF THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION IN AUGUST

2005.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION

EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH

WELL WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN

PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE

WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED. THE EFFECT ON EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE

PERIODS OF THE $1.2 BILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT

YEAR-END 2006 IS UNCERTAIN PENDING FUTURE ACTIVITIES,

INCLUDING NORMAL PROJECT EVALUATION AND ADDITIONAL

DRILLING.

REFER TO NOTE 20, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-47, FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUSPENDED WELLS.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR

PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES,

INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER

WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR

PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK

HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING

INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A

POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES. FOR

THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET

BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION,

AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE

OWED TO CHEVRON IS

FS-18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150 MILLION.

THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT

WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM

AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS, TRADING PARTNERS,

U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES,

GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS, AND SUPPLIERS.

THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE

AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY

PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO

REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE,

ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS

TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO

IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE

ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN

GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH

THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE

TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND

GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF COMPLYING

WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY

OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL

COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY

OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION

TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED

WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY

MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS

OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY OWNED FACILITIES AND AT

THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE

COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE

CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT NON-CHEVRON SITES WHERE COMPANY

PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE

EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO

FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED

PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED

ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR

REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY

THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON ESTIMATED ITS

WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2006 AT

APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION FOR ITS CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE

APPROXIMATELY $870 MILLION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES AND $1.3 BILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE PREVENTION, CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING,

CLOSED OR DIVESTED SITES, AND THE ABANDONMENT AND

RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR 2007, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $1.2 BILLION. THESE

CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF

COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE

COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY

THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR

EXISTING FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED

IN THE FUTURE TO: PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT;

COMPLY WITH EXIST-

ING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR

REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY

PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE

COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM

TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR

FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER

DIFFERENT REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS

DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE PRIOR TO THE

ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING TO THE

DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS

OF SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH

MATTERS TO CHANGE; AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA,

THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REVISION AS

CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS

MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES THAT

THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS

BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE

ESTIMATION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES UNDER

SEC RULES THAT REQUIRE ... GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING

DATA (THAT) DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY

(RESERVES) TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN

RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING

CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE

ESTIMATE IS MADE. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY

INFORMATION, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-68, FOR THE CHANGES

IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER

31, 2006, AND TO TABLE VII, CHANGES IN THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES, ON PAGE FS-21, INCLUDES

REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS

OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN

IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. THIS COMMENTARY

SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES

ELSEWHERE IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO

ESTIMATES, UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32. THE DEVELOPMENT

AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS,

INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED

DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY

MANAGEMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED

CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE

COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND

EXPENSE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.

TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE

APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH

PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH

ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING

OPEB OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND

THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES.

NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-48, INCLUDES

INFORMATION ON THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AT THE END OF 2006 AND 2005, THE

COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE FOR THE THREE

YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND THE UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS FOR THOSE PERIODS. THE NOTE ALSO PRESENTS

THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF RECORDING THE FUNDED STATUS

OF EACH OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AT

YEAR-END 2006 UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF

FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132R

(FAS 158).

PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE IS RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN OPERATING

EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. WITH

THE ADOPTION OF FAS 158, THE YEAR-END 2006 FUNDED

STATUS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS

AND OBLIGATIONS, OF EACH OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IS RECOGNIZED

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE FUNDED STATUS OF OVERFUNDED PENSION

PLANS IS RECORDED AS A LONG-TERM ASSET IN DEFERRED

CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS. THE FUNDED STATUS OF

UNDERFUNDED OR UNFUNDED

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IS

RECORDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR RESERVES FOR

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. AMOUNTS YET TO BE RECOGNIZED

AS COMPONENTS OF PENSION OR OPEB EXPENSE ARE RECORDED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TO

ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION

ASSETS, THE COMPANY USES A PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES

ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT

OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS

FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED

USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM

RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES. THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN

ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8 PERCENT SINCE

2002. FOR THE 10 YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2006, ACTUAL

ASSET RETURNS AVERAGED 9.7 PERCENT FOR THIS PLAN.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE

MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF

PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE

PRECEDING THREE MONTHS AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM

ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING

RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG

ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM

DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE

CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER

PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT

DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE

PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY

SELECTED A 5.8 PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE MAJOR U.S.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THIS RATE WAS

SELECTED BASED ON MOODYS AA CORPORATE BOND INDEX AND A

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE

BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT

YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END 2006. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT

THE END OF 2005 AND 2004 WERE 5.5 PERCENT AND 5.8

PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE PENSION

PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE

FOR 2006 WAS APPROXIMATELY $585 MILLION. AS AN

INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S.

PENSION PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN

EXPENSE FOR 2006 BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION. A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME

PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2006 BY

APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION.

FS-20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE

PENSION OBLIGATION, THUS CHANGING THE FUNDED STATUS OF

A PLAN RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE

TOTAL PENSION LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, FOR UNDERFUNDED PLANS WAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE

SENSITIVITY OF PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION, A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT

RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN

WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY

$275 MILLION, WHICH WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE PLANS

FUNDED STATUS FROM UNDERFUNDED TO OVERFUNDED, RESULTING

IN A PENSION ASSET OF ABOUT $250 MILLION. OTHER PLANS

WOULD BE LESS UNDERFUNDED AS DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE.

THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND DISCOUNT

RATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLDS FINANCIAL MARKETS.

IN 2006, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN

CONTRIBUTIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION

(APPROXIMATELY $225 MILLION TO THE U.S. PLANS). IN

2007, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION

AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RESULTS,

CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL

FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE

INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2006

WAS ABOUT $230 MILLION AND THE TOTAL LIABILITY, WHICH

REFLECTED THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AT THE

END OF 2006, WAS $3.3 BILLION.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO

THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2006, A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF

THE COMPANY-WIDE OPEB EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE DECREASED

OPEB EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION. A 0.25

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE SAME

PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYWIDE OPEB LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE DECREASED

TOTAL OPEB LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2006 BY

APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION.

FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE

ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS

LIMITED TO 4 PERCENT PER YEAR. THE CAP BECOMES

EFFECTIVE IN THE YEAR OF RETIREMENT FOR

PREMEDICARE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES RETIRING ON OR AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2005. THE CAP WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1,

2005, FOR PREMEDICARE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES RETIRING

BEFORE THAT DATE AND ALL MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES.

FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES UNDER AGE 65 WHOSE

CLAIMS EXPERIENCES ARE COMBINED FOR RATING PURPOSES,

THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES START WITH 9

PERCENT IN 2007 AND GRADUALLY DROP TO 5 PERCENT FOR

2011 AND BEYOND. AS AN INDICATION OF THE HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF

OPEB EXPENSE IN 2006, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE RATES

FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, WHICH

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB

OBLIGATIONS, WOULD HAVE INCREASED OPEB EXPENSE $8

MILLION.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED

TO DETERMINE EXPENSE AND THE FUNDED STATUS OF EACH

PLAN AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

BENEFIT PLAN COSTS IN

THE YEAR THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS.

INSTEAD, THE DIFFERENCES ARE INCLUDED IN ACTUARIAL

GAIN/LOSS AND UNAMORTIZED AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. REFER TO NOTE 21,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-48, FOR INFORMATION ON THE $2.6

BILLION OF ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006; A DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD

USED TO AMORTIZE THOSE COSTS; AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE

COSTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EXPENSE DURING 2007.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY ASSESSES ITS

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT

BE RECOVERABLE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES

AND, FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES,

SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED

PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN

ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET

OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET

IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN MATTERS SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS ON

OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE

OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND

CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY

CHEMICALS AND REFINED PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT

REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT

ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND

LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

NO MAJOR IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E WERE RECORDED FOR THE

THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2006. AN ESTIMATE AS TO

THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND

IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE

BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF

ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS,

FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE

AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS,

WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN

ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO BECOME

IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS WELL AS

INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY

INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED

TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE AT THE TIME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO

WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF

THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND

THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS

INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED

RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. DIFFERING

ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS

IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT

AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT

REVIEWS AND DETERMINES THAT NO WRITE-DOWN IN THE

CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED.

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY

SINGLE FIELD OR CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS

PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSET REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF

SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY PERIOD

HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS

EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP,

NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE

REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS

DISPOSED OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A

HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A

DECISION IS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS. THAT IS, THE

ASSETS WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-FOR-SALE AND THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, LESS COSTS TO SELL, ARE

LESS THAN THE ASSETS ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  PURCHASE-PRICE ALLOCATION

ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES THE

ALLOCATION OF THE COMPANYS PURCHASE PRICE TO THE

VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS

AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. THE COMPANY USES ALL

AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO MAKE THESE FAIR VALUE

DETERMINATIONS, AND FOR MAJOR ACQUISITIONS, MAY HIRE AN

INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL FIRM TO ASSIST IN MAKING

FAIR-VALUE ESTIMATES. IN SOME INSTANCES, ASSUMPTIONS

WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE

REVENUES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH AN ASSET MIGHT

HAVE TO BE USED IN DETERMINING ITS FAIR VALUE. ACTUAL

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF NET CASH FLOWS FROM REVENUES AND

EXPENSES RELATED TO THAT ASSET OVER TIME MAY DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INITIAL ESTIMATES, AND IF THE

TIMING IS DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY OR IF THE NET CASH

FLOWS DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY, THE ASSET COULD BECOME

IMPAIRED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED

BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT

THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL

BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT. THE GOODWILL ARISING FROM THE UNOCAL

ACQUISITION IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS

AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS,

LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION.

ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY FROM ESTIMATES FOR A

VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING

INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON CULPABILITY AND

ASSESSMENTS ON THE

AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY,

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT

TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND

THEIR INTERPRETATION, THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE

CONTAMINATION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS

RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES IF MANAGEMENT

DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECORDS THESE LOSSES AS

OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME. REFER TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS

ELSEWHERE IN THIS SECTION FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS

FROM LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION AND

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE THREE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS

FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED

IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE

BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT MUST BE

ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND

THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, BOTH

IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES

OF SUCH LOSS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EITF ISSUE NO. 04-6, ACCOUNTING FOR STRIPPING

COSTS INCURRED DURING PRODUCTION IN THE MINING INDUSTRY

(ISSUE 04-6)

IN MARCH 2005, THE FASB RATIFIED THE

EARLIER EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) CONSENSUS ON

ISSUE 04-6, WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON JANUARY

1, 2006. STRIPPING COSTS ARE COSTS OF REMOVING

OVERBURDEN AND OTHER WASTE MATERIALS TO ACCESS MINERAL

DEPOSITS. THE CONSENSUS CALLS FOR STRIPPING COSTS

INCURRED ONCE A MINE GOES INTO PRODUCTION TO BE TREATED

AS VARIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

A COMPONENT OF MINERAL INVENTORY COST SUBJECT TO

ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 43,

RESTATEMENT

AND REVISION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETINS

. ADOPTION

OF THIS ACCOUNTING FOR THE COMPANYS COAL, OIL SANDS

AND OTHER MINING OPERATIONS RESULTED IN A $19 MILLION

REDUCTION OF RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006.

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF

FASB STATEMENT NO. 109 (FIN 48)

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB

ISSUED FIN 48, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY

ON JANUARY 1, 2007. THIS INTERPRETATION CLARIFIES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE UNCERTAIN

IN NATURE. UNDER FIN 48, A COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE A TAX

BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN

TAX POSITION ONLY IF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT IS THAT

ITS POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A GREATER

THAN 50 PERCENT LIKELIHOOD) TO BE UPHELD ON AUDIT BASED

ONLY ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX POSITION. THIS

ACCOUNTING INTERPRETATION ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON

MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY, DERECOGNITION THRESHOLDS,

FINANCIAL STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION AND DISCLOSURES,

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RECOGNI-

FS-22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TION, AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT. THE NEW

INTERPRETATION IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE BETTER FINANCIAL

STATEMENT COMPARABILITY AMONG COMPANIES.

REQUIRED ANNUAL DISCLOSURES INCLUDE A TABULAR

RECONCILIATION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT THE

BEGINNING AND END OF THE PERIOD; THE AMOUNT OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD

AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE; THE AMOUNTS OF INTEREST

AND PENALTIES RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS;

ANY EXPECTED SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FROM UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVER THE

SUBSEQUENT 12-MONTH REPORTING PERIOD; AND A DESCRIPTION

OF THE TAX YEARS REMAINING TO BE EXAMINED IN MAJOR TAX

JURISDICTIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 48, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE AN INCREASE IN THE

LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND ASSOCIATED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007. IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS INCREASE IN LIABILITY, THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES RETAINED EARNINGS AT THE BEGINNING

OF 2007 WILL BE REDUCED BY $250 MILLION OR LESS. THE

AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY AND IMPACT ON RETAINED

EARNINGS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON CLARIFICATION EXPECTED

TO BE ISSUED BY THE FASB RELATED TO THE CRITERIA FOR

DETERMINING THE DATE OF ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH A TAX

AUTHORITY.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157)

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 157,

WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY

1, 2008. THIS STANDARD DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES

A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. FAS 157 DOES

NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BUT WOULD

APPLY TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER OTHER ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS. THE IMPACT, IF ANY, TO THE COMPANY FROM THE

ADOPTION OF FAS 157 IN 2008 WILL DEPEND ON THE

COMPANYS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THAT TIME THAT ARE

REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF CHEVRON

CORPORATIONS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF

ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED

STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED

BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM

15(A)(1) OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION

OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER

31, 2006 AND 2005, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS

AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE

PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM

15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED

OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING

THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS ON APRIL 1, 2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ON DECEMBER 31, 2006.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT,

INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS

FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE

CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE

COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR

AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED

STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE

AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND

OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL,

ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING

FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

AND ALSO MARKETING NATURAL GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) OPERATIONS RELATE TO

REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS;

MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM

PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR

EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE

MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS,

PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT

OIL ADDITIVES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL

AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING

DISCUSSION AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE

MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES SUBJECT THE COMPANY

TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS

VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE IMPACT AS A

RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED

COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF CONTROLLED

SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND

VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS

JOINT VENTURES AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE

CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN

AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A

SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20

PERCENT TO 50 PERCENT OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY

EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER

POLICY DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY

METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE

ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY CURRENTLY IN

INCOME. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE

PROVIDED FOR THESE GAINS AND LOSSES.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT

WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE.

WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS

WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE

WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE

DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND

INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED

RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST

BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT

CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE.

SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF OTHER

INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING

VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY

IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE

EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

BASED ON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS

GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

THE AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY

WHEN APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL

BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY

OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK

POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY, GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE,

DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE

COMPANY MAY ELECT TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW

HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM

NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN

CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS TRADING ACTIVITY,

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE

REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES, GAINS AND

LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. INTEREST RATE

SWAPS  HEDGING A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE

DEBT  ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES,

WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH

RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR

SALE AND ARE IN HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE

INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH

MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF

THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS. THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET, WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL,

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY STATED

AT COST, USING A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD. IN

THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET.

MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY

ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS

USED FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS,

RELATED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS

IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE

CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED

PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED

RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED PROVED

RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ARE ALSO CAPITALIZED

FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT HAVE FOUND CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE

CLASSIFIED AS PROVED WHEN THE DRILLING IS COMPLETED,

PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT

QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. ALL OTHER

EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE

20, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-47, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING

PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, ARE

ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR

CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED UNDISCOUNTED

FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN

TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE

WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD

PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE

OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER

OF USE OF OR A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A

MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED

ASSET OR ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED

OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN

TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, GENERALLY THEIR

DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW ON AN INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION,

DEVELOPMENT AREA, OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN

THE REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND CHEMICAL

AREAS, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE GENERALLY DONE ON THE

BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A MARKETING AREA OR

MARKETING ASSETS BY COUNTRY. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE

RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE

EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS

THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE EXCEEDS THE

FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED

IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE LOWER VALUE.

AS REQUIRED UNDER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143), THE FAIR VALUE

OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND A

LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED

ASSET AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER

ALSO TO NOTE 24, ON PAGE FS-58, RELATING TO

AROS.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED

COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING

PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED

USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD

AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED.

DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED

MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE

RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC

VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED

COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR MINING

ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD AS THE PROVEN RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE

CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE

DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED

TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES;

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD GENERALLY IS USED TO

DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO

AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL

RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT SUBJECT

TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS

OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS ARE RECORDED AS

EXPENSES AND FROM SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES

FOR MAINTENANCE (INCLUDING THOSE FOR PLANNED MAJOR

MAINTENANCE PROJECTS), REPAIRS AND MINOR RENEWALS TO

MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN OPERATING CONDITION ARE

GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND

RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ACQUIRED

IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO

AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, THE COMPANY TESTS

SUCH GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR

IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS

IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD

MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE GOODWILL

ARISING FROM THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION IS DESCRIBED IN

MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING

OPERATIONS OR TO CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS

ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS

OR CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE

CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS

ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR

CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND

CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED IN

PART ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE REMEDIATION

COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL

AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION

FROM PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS AN INTEREST WITH

OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS

OF THE COMPANYS NET WORKING INTEREST (ENTITLEMENT

METHOD). EXCISE, VALUE-ADDED AND OTHER SIMILAR TAXES

ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY ON A

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS

EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO PRICE VOLATILITY OF

CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY

FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF ITS

ACTIVITY, INCLUDING: FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND STORAGE OF

CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS, AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY REFINERIES. THE

COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR

LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY USES INTERNATIONAL SWAPS DEALERS

ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS TO GOVERN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK.

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED.

WHEN THE COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE

OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION

WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY

ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY,

THE NET MARKED-TO-MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE

NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH

THAT COUNTERPARTY AND IS A REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE

COMPANYS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO USES

OTHER NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES

WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS TO

MITIGATE CREDIT RISK.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, LONG-TERM

RECEIVABLES  NET AND DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER

NONCURRENT OBLIGATIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE

COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED AS

EITHER SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES OR

PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS, WHEREAS TRADING

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180 DAYS OR

LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES.

THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED

PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND

LEASE COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180

DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS

AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS

AND LOSSES REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE

SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE

INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS

CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL

AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH

RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

WITH GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED DIRECTLY IN INCOME AS

PART OF INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED EITHER FROM QUOTED

MARKET PRICES OR, IF NOT AVAILABLE, THE PRESENT VALUE

OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT

THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE

INSTRUMENTS WERE SETTLED AT YEAR-END.

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $5,131 AND $7,424 HAD

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $5,621 AND $7,945 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE

SECURITIES IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. PORTFOLIOS. EURODOLLAR

BONDS, FLOATING-RATE NOTES, TIME DEPOSITS AND

COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS HELD.

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD FAIR

VALUES OF $9,200 AND $8,995 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE BALANCES, $8,247 AND

$7,894 AT THE RESPECTIVE YEAR-ENDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS

CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES UNDER 90

DAYS. THE REMAINDER, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE

SECURITIES, HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY

1.4 YEARS.

FOR THE FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THERE WAS NOT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN

MARKET RISK FROM THAT PRESENTED IN 2005.

FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AT THE END OF 2006 AND 2005 WERE NOT

MATERIAL.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS,

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PLACED WITH A WIDE

ARRAY OF FINAN-

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  CONTINUED

CIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT

RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE

COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. SIMILAR STANDARDS OF

DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE

COMPANYS COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE DISPERSED

AMONG THE COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A

CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES

THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE

FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED

SUFFICIENT, REQUIRING LETTERS OF CREDIT IS A PRINCIPAL

METHOD USED TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 8.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ALTHOUGH EACH SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN AFFAIRS, CHEVRON CORPORATION

THEIR AFFILIATES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE INVESTMENTS

ARE GROUPED AS FOLLOWS: UPSTREAM  EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION; DOWNSTREAM  REFINING, MARKETING AND

ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE

FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT MANAGERS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE

ACCOUNTABLE DIRECTLY TO AND MAINTAIN REGULAR CONTACT

APPROVES MAJOR CHANGES TO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY BUDGETS. HOWEVER, BUSINESS-UNIT MANAGERS

WITHIN THE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE

FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND

INTEREST IN DYNEGY, MINING OPERATIONS, POWER

GENERATION BUSINESSES, WORLDWIDE CASH MANAGEMENT AND

DEBT FINANCING ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE

ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING

SEGMENTS ARE BILLED FOR THE DIRECT USE OF CORPORATE

SERVICES. NONBILLABLE COSTS REMAIN AT THE CORPORATE

LITIGATION

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY

TO APPROXIMATELY 75 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE MAJORITY

OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND

REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE IN CERTAIN

OXYGENATED GASOLINES AND THE

ALLEGED SEEPAGE OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER. RESOLUTION OF

THESE ACTIONS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE

ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED

TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS,

MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT USE MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE

OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

RFG PATENT

FOURTEEN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE

BROUGHT BY CONSUMERS OF REFORMULATED GASOLINE (RFG)

ALLEGING THAT UNOCAL MISLED THE CALIFORNIA AIR

RESOURCES BOARD INTO ADOPTING STANDARDS FOR COMPOSITION

OF RFG THAT OVERLAPPED WITH UNOCALS UNDISCLOSED AND

PENDING PATENTS. ELEVEN LAWSUITS ARE NOW CONSOLIDATED

IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA AND THREE ARE CONSOLIDATED IN CALIFORNIA

STATE COURT. UNOCAL IS ALLEGED TO HAVE MONOPOLIZED,

CONSPIRED AND ENGAGED IN UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION,

RESULTING IN INJURY TO CONSUMERS OF RFG. PLAINTIFFS IN

BOTH CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS SEEK UNSPECIFIED ACTUAL AND

PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS FEES, AND INTEREST ON

BEHALF OF AN ALLEGED CLASS OF CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED

SUMMERTIME RFG IN CALIFORNIA FROM JANUARY 1995

THROUGH AUGUST 2005. UNOCAL BELIEVES IT HAS VALID

DEFENSES AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THESE

LAWSUITS. THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO

THESE LAWSUITS CANNOT CURRENTLY BE ESTIMATED.

TAXES  CONTINUED

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASED

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

$3,800 IN 2006. THE INCREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO

HIGHER PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS RESULTING

FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 158, INCREASED FOREIGN

TAX CREDITS RESULTING FROM HIGHER CRUDE OIL PRICES IN

TAX JURISDICTIONS WITH HIGH INCOME TAX RATES, AND

INCREASED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO FOREIGN

TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR WHICH NO BENEFIT IS EXPECTED

TO BE REALIZED. TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS EXIST IN MANY

INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. WHEREAS SOME OF THESE TAX

LOSS CARRYFORWARDS DO NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE,

OTHERS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES FROM 2007 THROUGH 2029.

FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $1,916 WILL EXPIRE

BETWEEN 2009 AND 2016.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 WAS PASSED INTO LAW.

THE ACT PROVIDES A DEDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM QUALIFIED

DOMESTIC REFINING AND UPSTREAM PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES,

WHICH IS TO BE PHASED IN FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THE NET EFFECT OF THIS PROVISION OF THE

ACT TO RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FEDERAL EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE FOR 2007 TO APPROXIMATELY 33 PERCENT, BASED ON

CURRENT EARNINGS LEVELS. IN THE LONG TERM, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS THAT THE NEW DEDUCTION WILL RESULT IN A

DECREASE OF THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO ABOUT 32

PERCENT FOR THAT CATEGORY OF INCOME, BASED ON CURRENT

EARNINGS LEVELS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EITF ISSUE NO. 04-6, ACCOUNTING FOR STRIPPING

COSTS INCURRED DURING PRODUCTION IN THE MINING INDUSTRY

(ISSUE 04-6)

IN MARCH 2005, THE FASB RATIFIED THE

EARLIER EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) CONSENSUS ON

ISSUE 04-6, WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON JANUARY

1, 2006. STRIPPING COSTS ARE COSTS OF REMOVING

OVERBURDEN AND OTHER WASTE MATERIALS TO ACCESS MINERAL

DEPOSITS. THE CONSENSUS CALLS FOR STRIPPING COSTS

INCURRED ONCE A MINE GOES INTO PRODUCTION TO BE TREATED

AS VARIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

A COMPONENT OF MINERAL INVENTORY COST SUBJECT TO ARB

RESTATEMENT AND REVISION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH

ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING FOR THE COMPANYS COAL, OIL

SANDS AND OTHER MINING OPERATIONS RESULTED IN A $19

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF

FASB STATEMENT NO. 109(FIN 48)

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 48, WHICH

BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2007.

THIS INTERPRETATION CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR

INCOME TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE UNCERTAIN IN NATURE.

UNDER FIN 48, A COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE A TAX BENEFIT

IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITION ONLY IF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS

POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A GREATER

THAN 50 PERCENT LIKELIHOOD) TO BE UPHELD ON AUDIT

BASED ONLY ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE TAX

POSITION. THIS ACCOUNTING INTERPRETATION ALSO PROVIDES

GUIDANCE ON MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY, DERECOGNITION

THRESHOLDS, FINANCIAL STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION AND

DISCLOSURES, INTEREST AND PENALTIES RECOGNITION, AND

ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT. THE

NEW INTERPRETATION IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE BETTER

FINANCIAL STATEMENT COMPARABILITY AMONG COMPANIES.

REQUIRED ANNUAL DISCLOSURES INCLUDE A TABULAR

RECONCILIATION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT THE

BEGINNING AND END OF THE PERIOD; THE AMOUNT OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD

AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE; THE AMOUNTS OF INTEREST

AND PENALTIES RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; ANY EXPECTED SIGNIFICANT

IMPACTS FROM UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OVER THE SUBSEQUENT 12-MONTH REPORTING

PERIOD; AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE TAX YEARS REMAINING TO

BE EXAMINED IN MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 48, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE AN INCREASE IN THE

REDUCED BY $250 OR LESS. THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY

AND IMPACT ON RETAINED EARNINGS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON

WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1,

FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE

STATEMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS BUT WOULD APPLY TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER

OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THE IMPACT, IF ANY, TO THE

COMPANY FROM THE ADOPTION OF FAS 157 IN 2008 WILL

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR

MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY PREFUNDS

DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS AS REQUIRED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS

OR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE PREFUNDING PROVIDES

ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL

QUALIFIED PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT TYPICALLY FUND U.S. NONQUALIFIED

PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAWS AND REGULATIONS BECAUSE

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS

ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT RETURNS MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE

THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS, AS WELL

AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING

RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS ARE UNFUNDED, AND THE

COMPANY AND THE RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR

MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES IN THE COMPANYS MAIN

U.S. MEDICAL PLAN IS SECONDARY TO MEDICARE (INCLUDING

PART D) AND THE INCREASE TO THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREE

MEDICAL COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 4 PERCENT PER YEAR. THIS CONTRIBUTION CAP BECOMES

EFFECTIVE IN THE YEAR OF RETIREMENT FOR

PRE-MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES RETIRING ON OR AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2005. THE CAP WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1,

2005, FOR PRE-MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES RETIRING

BEFORE THAT DATE AND ALL MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES.

CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE

COMPANY, AND ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE BASED ON ACTUAL

PLAN EXPERIENCE.

IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED CHANGES TO

SEVERAL OF ITS U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS, PRIMARILY MERGING BENEFITS UNDER SEVERAL

UNOCAL PLANS INTO RELATED CHEVRON PLANS. UNDER THE PLAN

COMBINATIONS, FORMER-UNOCAL EMPLOYEES RETIRING ON OR

AFTER JULY 1, 2006, RECEIVED RECOGNITION FOR UNOCAL PAY

AND SERVICE HISTORY TOWARD BENEFITS TO BE PAID UNDER

THE CHEVRON PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

UNOCAL EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRED BEFORE JULY 1, 2006, AND

WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE UNOCAL

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN WERE MERGED INTO THE

CHEVRON PRIMARY U.S. PLAN EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR

MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES UNDER THE CHEVRON PLAN WERE

INCREASED IN 2007 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MERGER OF

FORMER-UNOCAL PARTICIPANTS INTO THE CHEVRON PLAN.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY

IMPLEMENTED THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AT DECEMBER

31, 2006, RELATED TO THE COMPANYS U.S. PENSION,

INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER APPROXIMATELY NINE, 13 AND 10 YEARS,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMORTIZATION PERIODS REPRESENT THE

ESTIMATED AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES

EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLANS. THESE

LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED 10

PERCENT OF THE HIGHER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION OR MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. THE

AMOUNT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION IS DETERMINED ON A

PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS. DURING 2007, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES

ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $139 AND $81 WILL BE AMORTIZED

FROM

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, AND ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF

$81 WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR

RECOGNIZING PRIOR SERVICE COSTS (CREDITS) RECORDED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, WAS APPROXIMATELY SIX AND 13 YEARS

FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY,

AND SEVEN YEARS FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES PRIOR SERVICE COSTS

OF $46 AND $17 WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION

PLANS, AND PRIOR SERVICE CREDITS OF $81 WILL BE

AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

THE 2006 U.S. DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS REMEASUREMENT ON JULY 1,

2006, DUE TO PLAN COMBINATIONS AND CHANGES, PRIMARILY MERGING BENEFITS UNDER SEVERAL UNOCAL PLANS

INTO RELATED CHEVRON PLANS.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANYS

ESTIMATES OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION

ASSETS IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL

ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE

PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND

THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET-CLASS RISK

FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED

USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM

RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002 FOR

U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION

PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8 PERCENT.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR

U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION

EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE THREE

MONTHS PRECEDING THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE, AS

OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS

UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE

THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE

EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET

VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF

THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF

THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION

EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE

REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 5.8 PERCENT

DISCOUNT RATE BASED ON MOODYS AA CORPORATE BOND INDEX

AND A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE

BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT

YIELD CURVE. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF 2005 AND

2004 WERE 5.5 PERCENT AND 5.8 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF

ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL PLAN, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES

START WITH 9 PERCENT IN 2007 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO

5 PERCENT FOR 2011 AND BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005,

THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES STARTED WITH

10 PERCENT IN 2006 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 5 PERCENT

FOR 2011 AND BEYOND. IN BOTH MEASUREMENTS, THE ANNUAL

INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS WAS CAPPED AT 4

PERCENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES CAN HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR RETIREE

HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE IMPACT IS MITIGATED BY THE 4

PERCENT CAP ON THE COMPANYS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR

THE PRIMARY U.S. PLAN. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES OF CHEVRON AND CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP).

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE

COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE FUNDED

EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE RELEASE OF COMMON

STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLAN (LESOP), WHICH IS DISCUSSED BELOW. TOTAL COMPANY

MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE

ESIP WERE $169, $145 AND $139 IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF

SHARES RELEASED FROM THE LESOP TOTALING $6, $4 AND $138

IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING

AMOUNTS,

TOTALING $163, $141 AND $1 IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENT OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRON ESIP

IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). IN 1989,

CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LESOP AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF

THE ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES PARTIAL PREFUNDING OF THE

COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

AS PERMITTED BY AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLANS

, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO CONTINUE ITS

PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON AICPA STATEMENT OF

POSITION 76-3,

ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

, AND SUBSEQUENT

CONSENSUS OF THE EITF OF THE FASB. THE DEBT OF THE

LESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS

COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFIT PLAN TRUST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

AND THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO

LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS DIVIDENDS

RECEIVED AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE.

INTEREST ACCRUED ON LESOP DEBT IS RECORDED AS INTEREST

EXPENSE. DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED

AS A REDUCTION OF RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL LESOP SHARES

ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE

COMPUTATIONS.

TOTAL (CREDITS) EXPENSES RECORDED FOR THE LESOP

WERE $(1), $94 AND $(29) IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $17, $18 AND $23 OF INTEREST

EXPENSE RELATED TO LESOP DEBT AND A (CREDIT) CHARGE

TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $(18), $76 AND $(52).

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES, $59,

$55 AND $52 WERE USED IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. THE AMOUNT IN

2006 INCLUDED $28 OF LESOP DEBT SERVICE THAT WAS

SCHEDULED FOR PAYMENT ON THE FIRST BUSINESS DAY OF

JANUARY 2007 AND WAS PAID IN LATE DECEMBER 2006.

INCLUDED IN THE 2004 AMOUNT WAS A REPAYMENT OF DEBT

ENTERED INTO IN 1999 TO PAY INTEREST ON THE ESOP DEBT.

INTEREST EXPENSE ON THIS DEBT WAS RECOGNIZED AND

REPORTED AS LESOP INTEREST EXPENSE IN 1999. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2005 OF

$98 TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE IN EXCESS OF

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY THE LESOP. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE

REQUIRED IN 2006 OR 2004 AS DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY THE

LESOP WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE.

SHARES HELD IN THE LESOP ARE RELEASED AND

ALLOCATED TO THE ACCOUNTS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS BASED

ON DEBT SERVICE DEEMED TO BE PAID IN THE YEAR IN

PROPORTION TO THE TOTAL OF CURRENT YEAR AND

TEXACO STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (TEXACO SIP)

ON THE

CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF TEXACO IN OCTOBER 2001,

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE

CONVERTED TO CHEVRON OPTIONS. THESE OPTIONS RETAINED A

PROVISION FOR BEING RESTORED, WHICH ENABLES A

THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE

FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT

WERE SOLD IN 1997. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT,

THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED UNTIL APRIL 2022,

WHEN THE LIABILITY EXPIRES. THE ACQUIRER SHARES IN

CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM

OBLIGATION OF $200, WHICH HAD NOT BEEN REACHED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006.

SECURITIZATION

THE COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL

ENTITIES (SPES). AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY

$1,200, REPRESENTING ABOUT 7 PERCENT OF CHEVRONS TOTAL

CURRENT ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLES BALANCE, WERE

SECURITIZED. CHEVRONS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL

EXPOSURE UNDER THESE SECURITIZATIONS AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, WAS APPROXIMATELY $80. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE

THE EFFECT OF ACCELERATING CHEVRONS COLLECTION OF THE

SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SPES

EXPERIENCE MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF

RECEIVABLES, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO

LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN

THESE SECURITIZATIONS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

OTHER ($55). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO

REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH.

THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE

FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE

DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT,

REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON

LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND

BESIDES THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE FOLLOWING

COUNTRIES: ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, AZERBAIJAN,

BANGLADESH, BRAZIL, CAMBODIA, CANADA, CHAD, CHINA,

COLOMBIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, DENMARK,

FRANCE, INDIA, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN, MYANMAR, THE

NETHERLANDS, NIGERIA, NORWAY, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL

ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA, THE PHILIPPINES,

REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, SINGAPORE, SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTH

KOREA, THAILAND, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, THE UNITED

KINGDOM, VENEZUELA AND VIETNAM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC,

REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED

STATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE

TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF

THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR

ASSETS OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES ON

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR BOTH.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED

RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS,

POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE

SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED

PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF

VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND

THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE

COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE

CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE

LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR

PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES,

INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER

WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR

PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK

HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING

INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A

POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES. FOR

THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT,

NOTE 23.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  CONTINUED

CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET

BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200, AND THE

POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO

CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150. THE TIMING OF THE

SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF

ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND

SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS, TRADING PARTNERS, U.S.

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES,

GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS, AND SUPPLIERS. THE

AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE

AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS

TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO

REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE,

ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS

TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO

IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE

ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN

GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 24.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT (FASB) NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING

FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, (FAS 143). THIS

ACCOUNTING STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A

LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) THAT

IS RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED

ASSET AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THESE

ASSETS REQUIRE RECOGNITION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

(1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING

ASSET FOR AN ARO, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT

LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION OF THE ASSET, AND (3) THE

PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND

DISCOUNT RATES. IN 2005, THE FASB ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 47,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 143

, (FIN 47), WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE FOR

THE COMPANY ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. FIN 47 CLARIFIES THAT

THE PHRASE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION,

AS USED IN FAS 143, REFERS TO A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO

PERFORM ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY FOR WHICH THE TIMING

AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT ARE CONDITIONAL ON A FUTURE

EVENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE

COMPANY. THE OBLIGATION TO PERFORM THE ASSET RETIREMENT

ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY

EXISTS ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT.

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF

SETTLEMENT OF A CONDITIONAL ARO SHOULD BE FACTORED INTO

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY WHEN SUFFICIENT

INFORMATION EXISTS. FAS 143 ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN SOME

CASES, SUFFICIENT INFORMATION MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO

REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ARO. FIN 47

ALSO CLARIFIES WHEN AN ENTITY WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT

INFORMATION TO REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ARO. IN ADOPTING FIN

47, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY ADDITIONAL

LIABILITIES FOR CONDITIONAL AROS DUE TO AN INABILITY

TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE

OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT

DATES.

FAS 143 AND FIN 47 PRIMARILY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

ACCOUNTING FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING

ASSETS. NO SIGNIFICANT AROS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED

ASSETS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED, AS INDETERMINATE

SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENTED

ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE

COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND

CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE INDICATES THE CHANGES TO THE

COMPANYS BEFORE-TAX ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN

2006, 2005 AND 2004.

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A

COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY

THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS, THE WORLD PETROLEUM

CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM

GEOLOGISTS. THE SYSTEM CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE

HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS

AT THE TIME OF REPORTING  THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND

THREE NONCOMMERCIAL. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL

CLASSIFICATION ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES

OF UNPROVED, PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE NONCOMMERCIAL

CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT

RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT

GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS

FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING CONDITIONS. NET PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE

ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN

EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED

OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THE

QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING

WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED

NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF UNDERGROUND

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET

TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. AS

PART OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS RELATED TO

RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVES

ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS CHAIRED BY THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANAGER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF A

CORPORATE DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE

EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANYS

WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL OF

THE RAC MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN SEC GUIDELINES FOR

PROVED RESERVES CLASSIFICATION. THE RAC COORDINATES ITS

ACTIVITIES THROUGH TWO OPERATING COMPANY-LEVEL RESERVES

MANAGERS. THESE TWO RESERVES MANAGERS ARE NOT MEMBERS

OF THE RAC SO AS TO PRESERVE THE CORPORATE-LEVEL

INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY

RESPONSIBILITIES: PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OF THE

BUSINESS UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVE CHANGES; CONFIRM

THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES

ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND APPROPRIATE

STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN

THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH PROVIDES

STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR

CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON RESERVES.

FS-68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V

 RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION  CONTINUED

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN

MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM BUSINESS

UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED

BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR CHANGES ARE ALSO

REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND PLANNING

COMMITTEE AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHOSE MEMBERS

INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANYS ANNUAL RESERVE

ACTIVITY IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

IF MAJOR CHANGES TO RESERVES WERE TO OCCUR BETWEEN THE

ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED

WITH THE BOARD.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING

THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE THE LARGEST

PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN

EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED-RESERVE RECORDS AND

DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH THE

CORPORATE

RESERVES MANUAL.

RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

OPERATIONS WERE 8.6 BILLION BARRELS. (REFER TO PAGE

E-11 FOR THE DEFINITION OF OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.)

APPROXIMATELY 28 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RESERVES WERE IN

THE UNITED STATES. FOR THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN

EQUITY AFFILIATES, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES WERE 3

BILLION BARRELS, 80 PERCENT OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED

WITH THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN TCO. DURING

THE YEAR, THE COMPANYS BOSCAN AND LL-652 CONTRACTS IN

VENEZUELA WERE CONVERTED TO EMPRESAS MIXTAS (I.E.,

JOINT STOCK CONTRACTUAL STRUCTURES). THE COMPANY HAD

NOT PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ANY RESERVES FOR ITS BOSCAN

OPERATIONS, BUT DID SO THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE

CONVERSION. THE CONVERSION OF LL-652 RESERVES WAS

TREATED AS THE SALE OF CONSOLIDATED COMPANY RESERVES

AND THE ACQUISITION OF EQUITY AFFILIATE RESERVES.

ASIDE FROM THE TCO OPERATIONS, NO SINGLE PROPERTY

ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF COMPANYS TOTAL

OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. FEWER THAN 20 OTHER

INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF

ASSETS EACH CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT AND 5 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANYS OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES, WHICH

IN THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 36 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PROVED RESERVES TOTAL. THESE PROPERTIES WERE

GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES,

SOUTH AMERICA, WEST AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE

ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

IN THE UNITED STATES, TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT

RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2006 WERE 2.4 BILLION BARRELS. OF

THIS AMOUNT, 40 PERCENT, 21 PERCENT AND 39 PERCENT WERE

LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, THE GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER

U.S. AREAS, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CALIFORNIA, LIQUIDS RESERVES REPRESENTED 95

PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH MOST CLASSIFIED AS HEAVY

OIL. BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE NEED TO EMPLOY

ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, THE PRODUCING OPERATIONS ARE

CAPITAL INTENSIVE IN NATURE. MOST OF THE COMPANYS

HEAVY-OIL FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOY A CONTINUOUS

STEAMFLOODING PROCESS.

IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION, LIQUIDS REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 64 PERCENT OF TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT

RESERVES. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE

AND, AS A RESULT, ARE ALSO CAPITAL INTENSIVE. COSTS

INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN WELLS, PRODUCTION PLATFORMS AND

OTHER FACILITIES, SUCH AS GATHERING LINES AND STORAGE

FACILITIES.

IN OTHER U.S. AREAS, THE RESERVES WERE SPLIT

ABOUT EQUALLY BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS. FOR

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED

RECOVERY METHODS, INCLUDING WATER-FLOOD AND CO

2

INJECTION.

THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN

THE FOLLOWING TABLES, FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2006, IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF

FUTURE TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTSIDE

THE COMPANYS CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT

PERMITTING, PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS,

DECLINES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS,

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED UNDERGROUND OIL

AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND CHANGES THERETO FOR THE

YEARS 2004, 2005 AND 2006 ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLES ON

PAGES FS-70 AND FS-72.

DURING 2006, THE PERCENTAGES OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, TRANSFERRED

TO DEVELOPED RESERVES WERE 11 PERCENT AND 2 PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND AFFILIATED

COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES, CHEVRON HAS SIGNIFICANT

INTERESTS IN PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATHABASCA PROJECT. FOR

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, CHEVRON VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SEC REGULATIONS DEFINE THESE RESERVES AS MINING-RELATED

AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES. NET PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES WERE 443 MILLION

BARRELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE OIL SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE STANDARDIZED

MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES, WHICH IS FOUND

ON PAGE FS-75.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF

PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2004 THROUGH 2006 IN THE

TABLE ABOVE ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2004,

NET REVISIONS DECREASED RESERVES 218 MILLION BARRELS

FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND INCREASED RESERVES FOR

AFFILIATES BY 204 MILLION BARRELS. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, THE DECREASE WAS COMPOSED OF 161 MILLION

BARRELS FOR INTERNATIONAL AREAS AND 57 MILLION BARRELS

FOR THE UNITED STATES. THE LARGEST DOWNWARD REVISION

INTERNATIONALLY WAS 70 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA. ONE

FIELD IN ANGOLA ACCOUNTED

FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE NET DECLINE AS CHANGES WERE

MADE TO OIL-IN-PLACE ESTIMATES BASED ON RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE DATA. ONE FIELD IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC AREA

ESSENTIALLY ACCOUNTED FOR THE 43 MILLION-BARREL

DOWNWARD REVISION FOR THAT REGION. THE REVISION WAS

ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED WELL

PERFORMANCE. PART OF THE 36 MILLION-BARREL NET

DOWNWARD REVISION FOR INDONESIA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE

CALCULATION OF RESERVES FOR COST-OIL RECOVERY UNDER A

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

68 MILLION-BARREL NET DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE GULF OF

FS-70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V

 RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION  CONTINUED

MEXICO AREA WAS ACROSS SEVERAL FIELDS AND BASED

MAINLY ON RESERVOIR ANALYSES AND ASSESSMENTS OF WELL

PERFORMANCE. FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, THE 206

MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR TCO WAS BASED ON AN UPDATED

ASSESSMENT OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE FOR THE TENGIZ

FIELD. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS INCREASE WAS A

DOWNWARD EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE

VARIABLE ROYALTY-RATE CALCULATION. DOWNWARD REVISIONS

ALSO OCCURRED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS BECAUSE OF THE

EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON VARIOUS

PRODUCTION-SHARING TERMS AND VARIABLE ROYALTY

CALCULATIONS.

IN 2005, NET REVISIONS REDUCED RESERVES BY 239

MILLION AND 24 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES,

RESPECTIVELY. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE NET

DECREASE WAS 199 MILLION BARRELS IN THE INTERNATIONAL

AREAS AND 40 MILLION BARRELS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

LARGEST DOWNWARD NET REVISIONS INTERNATIONALLY WERE 108

MILLION BARRELS IN INDONESIA AND 53 MILLION BARRELS IN

KAZAKHSTAN, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER

YEAR-END PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY

CONTRACTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 40 MILLION-BARREL

REDUCTION WAS ACROSS MANY FIELDS IN EACH OF THE

GEOGRAPHIC SECTIONS. MOST OF THE DOWNWARD REVISION FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES WAS A 19 MILLION-BARREL REDUCTION

IN HAMACA, ATTRIBUTABLE TO REVISED GOVERNMENT ROYALTY

PROVISIONS. FOR TCO, THE DOWNWARD EFFECT OF HIGHER

YEAR-END PRICES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

IN 2006, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 39

MILLION AND 84 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES,

RESPECTIVELY. INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

ACCOUNTED FOR THE NET INCREASE OF 39 MILLION BARRELS.

THE LARGEST UPWARD NET REVISIONS WERE 61 MILLION

BARRELS IN INDONESIA AND 27 MILLION BARRELS IN

THAILAND. IN INDONESIA, THE INCREASE WAS THE RESULT OF

INFILL DRILLING AND IMPROVED STEAMFLOOD PERFORMANCE.

THE UPWARD REVISION IN THAILAND REFLECTED ADDITIONAL

DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY DURING THE YEAR.

THESE UPWARD REVISIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

REDUCTIONS IN RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH DECREASED RESERVES BY 43 MILLION

BARRELS AND BY 32 MILLION BARRELS, RESPECTIVELY. MOST

OF THE UPWARD REVISION FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES WAS

RELATED TO A 60 MILLION BARREL INCREASE IN TCO AS A

RESULT OF IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN 2006, IMPROVED RECOVERY

INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 83 MILLION

BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. RESERVES IN THE

UNITED STATES INCREASED 52 MILLION BARRELS, WITH

CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING 49 MILLION BARRELS OF THE TOTAL

INCREASE DUE TO STEAMFLOOD EXPANSION AND REVISED

MODELING ACTIVITIES. INTERNATIONALLY, IMPROVED RECOVERY

INCREASED RESERVES BY 31 MILLION BARRELS, WITH NO

SINGLE COUNTRY ACCOUNTING FOR AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN

10 MILLION BARRELS.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2006, EXTENSIONS

AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE

BY 107 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES IN NIGERIA

INCREASED BY 27 MILLION BARRELS DUE IN PART TO THE

INITIAL BOOKING OF RESERVES FOR THE APARO FIELD.

ADDITIONAL DRILLING ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTED 19 MILLION

BARRELS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 14 MILLION BARRELS

IN ARGENTINA. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GULF OF MEXICO

ADDED 25 MILLION BARRELS, MAINLY THE RESULT OF THE

INITIAL BOOKING OF THE GREAT WHITE FIELD IN THE

DEEPWATER PERDIDO FOLD BELT AREA.

PURCHASES

IN 2005, THE ACQUISITION OF 572 MILLION

BARRELS OF LIQUIDS RELATED SOLELY TO THE ACQUISITION OF

UNOCAL IN AUGUST. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE 376

MILLION BARRELS ACQUIRED IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREAS

WERE REPRESENTED BY VOLUMES IN AZERBAIJAN AND THAILAND.

MOST VOLUMES ACQUIRED IN THE UNITED STATES WERE IN

TEXAS AND ALASKA.

IN

2006, ACQUISITIONS INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES

WORLDWIDE BY 21 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES AND 119 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY

AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE AMOUNT WAS

MAINLY THE RESULT OF NEW AGREEMENTS IN NIGERIA, WHICH

ADDED 13 MILLION BARRELS OF RESERVES. THE

OTHER-EQUITY-AFFILIATES QUANTITY REFLECTS THE RESULT OF

THE CONVERSION OF BOSCAN AND LL-652 OPERATIONS TO JOINT

STOCK COMPANIES IN VENEZUELA.

SALES

IN 2004, SALES OF LIQUIDS VOLUMES REDUCED

RESERVES OF CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY 179 MILLION

BARRELS. SALES TOTALED 130 MILLION BARRELS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND 33 MILLION BARRELS IN THE OTHER

INTERNATIONAL REGION. SALES IN THE OTHER REGION OF

THE UNITED STATES TOTALED 103 MILLION BARRELS, WITH TWO

FIELDS ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE

VOLUME. THE 27 MILLION BARRELS SOLD IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO REFLECT THE SALE OF A NUMBER OF SHELF

PROPERTIES. THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL SALES INCLUDE THE

DISPOSAL OF WESTERN CANADA PROPERTIES AND SEVERAL

FIELDS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. ALL THE SALES WERE

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PROGRAM TO DISPOSE OF

ASSETS DEEMED NONSTRATEGIC TO THE PORTFOLIO OF

PRODUCING PROPERTIES.

IN 2005, SALES OF 58 MILLION BARRELS IN THE

OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREA RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION

OF THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS ONSHORE IN CANADA.

IN 2006, SALES DECREASED RESERVES BY 15 MILLION

BARRELS DUE TO THE CONVERSION OF THE LL-652 RISKED

SERVICE AGREEMENT TO A JOINT STOCK COMPANY IN

VENEZUELA.

TABLE ABOVE ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2004,

REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES BY A NET 248 BILLION CUBIC FEET (BCF),

COMPOSED OF INCREASES OF 928 BCF INTERNATIONALLY AND

DECREASES OF 680 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES.

INTERNATIONALLY, ABOUT HALF OF THE 346 BCF INCREASE IN

AFRICA RELATED TO PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA, FOR WHICH

CHANGES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH WELL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS,

DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND LEASE FUEL CALCULATIONS. THE

236 BCF ADDITION IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION WAS

RELATED PRIMARILY TO RESERVOIR ANALYSIS FOR A SINGLE

FIELD. MOST OF THE 325 BCF IN THE OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AREA

WAS RELATED TO A NEW GAS SALES CONTRACT IN TRINIDAD AND

TOBAGO. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE NET 391 BCF DOWNWARD

REVISION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WAS RELATED TO

WELL-PERFORMANCE REVIEWS AND TECHNICAL ANALYSES IN

SEVERAL FIELDS. MOST OF THE NET 316 BCF NEGATIVE

REVISION IN THE OTHER U.S. AREA RELATED TO TWO COAL

BED METHANE FIELDS IN THE MID-CONTINENT REGION AND

THEIR ASSOCIATED WELLS PERFORMANCE. THE 963 BCF

INCREASE FOR TCO WAS CONNECTED WITH UPDATED ANALYSES OF

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND PROCESSING PLANT YIELDS.

IN 2005, RESERVES WERE REVISED DOWNWARD BY 14 BCF

FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND 498 BCF FOR EQUITY

AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NEGATIVE

TABLE V

 RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION  CONTINUED

ABLE TO ONE FIELD IN KAZAKHSTAN, DUE MAINLY TO THE

EFFECTS OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON VARIABLE-ROYALTY

PROVISIONS OF THE PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT. RESERVES

ADDITIONS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES TOTALED 211 BCF

AND 243 BCF IN AFRICA AND OTHER, RESPECTIVELY. THE

MAJORITY OF THE AFRICAN REGION CHANGES WERE IN ANGOLA,

DUE TO A REVISED FORECAST OF FUEL GAS USAGE, AND IN

NIGERIA, FROM IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE. THE

AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY COMPRESSION IN COLOMBIA

ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE INCREASE IN THE OTHER

REGION. REVISIONS IN THE UNITED STATES DECREASED

RESERVES BY 9 BCF, AS NOMINAL INCREASES IN THE SAN

JOAQUIN VALLEY WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY DECREASES IN

THE GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER REGION. FOR THE TCO

AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, A REDUCTION OF 547 BCF

REFLECTS THE UPDATED FORECAST OF FUTURE ROYALTIES

PAYABLE AND YEAR-END PRICE EFFECTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

VOLUMES ADDED AS A RESULT OF AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

IN 2006, REVISIONS ACCOUNTED FOR A NET INCREASE OF

481 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND 26 BCF FOR

AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET INCREASES

OF 511 BCF INTERNATIONALLY WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

30 BCF DOWNWARD

REVISION IN THE UNITED STATES. DRILLING AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ADDED 337 BCF OF RESERVES IN

THAILAND, WHILE KAZAKHSTAN ADDED 200 BCF, LARGELY DUE

TO DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO INCREASED

185 BCF, ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE

AND A NEW CONTRACT FOR SALES OF NATURAL GAS. THESE

ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS

OF 224 BCF IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 130 BCF IN

AUSTRALIA DUE TO DRILLING RESULTS AND RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE. U.S. OTHER HAD A DOWNWARD REVISION OF

102 BCF DUE TO RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, WHICH WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UPWARD REVISIONS OF 72 BCF IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA RELATED TO RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING. TCO HAD AN UPWARD

REVISION OF 26 BCF ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND UPDATED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2004, EXTENSIONS AND

DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF 214 BCF,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES OF 144 BCF,

WITH 89 BCF ADDED IN THE OTHER REGION AND 54 BCF

ADDED IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH DRILLING ACTIVITIES

IN A LARGE NUMBER OF FIELDS.

IN 2005, CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES INCREASED

RESERVES BY 370 BCF, INCLUDING 167 BCF IN THE UNITED

STATES AND 118 BCF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. IN THE

UNITED STATES, 99 BCF WAS ADDED IN THE OTHER REGION

AND 68 BCF IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, PRIMARILY DUE TO

DRILLING ACTIVITIES. THE ADDITION IN ASIA-PACIFIC

RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED DRILLING IN

KAZAKHSTAN.

IN 2006, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR

AN INCREASE OF 799 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

REFLECTING A 531 BCF INCREASE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

AND A U.S. INCREASE OF 268 BCF. BANGLADESH ADDED 451

BCF, THE RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND FIELD

EXTENSIONS, AND THAILAND ADDED 59 BCF, THE RESULT OF

DRILLING ACTIVITIES. U.S. OTHER CONTRIBUTED

157 BCF, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE

SOUTH TEXAS AND THE PICEANCE BASIN, AND THE GULF OF

MEXICO ADDED 111 BCF, PARTLY DUE TO THE INITIAL BOOKING

OF RESERVES AT THE GREAT WHITE FIELD IN THE DEEPWATER

PERDIDO FOLD BELT AREA.

PURCHASES

IN 2005, ALL EXCEPT 7 BCF OF THE 5,656

BCF TOTAL PURCHASES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNOCAL

ACQUISITION. INTERNATIONAL RESERVE ACQUISITIONS WERE

4,488 BCF, WITH THAILAND ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT HALF THE

VOLUMES. OTHER SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES WERE ADDED IN

BANGLADESH AND MYANMAR.

IN 2006, ACQUISITION OF NATURAL GAS RESERVES WERE

35 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, ABOUT EVENLY DIVIDED

BETWEEN THE COMPANYS UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS. AFFILIATED COMPANIES ADDED 54 BCF OF

RESERVES, THE RESULT OF CONVERSION OF AN OPERATING

SERVICE AGREEMENT TO A JOINT STOCK COMPANY IN

VENEZUELA.

SALES

IN 2004, SALES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

TOTALED 547 BCF. OF THIS TOTAL, 436 BCF WAS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND 111 BCF IN THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL

REGION. IN THE UNITED STATES, OTHER REGION SALES

ACCOUNTED FOR 289 BCF, REFLECTING THE DISPOSAL OF A

LARGE NUMBER OF SMALLER PROPERTIES, INCLUDING A COAL

BED METHANE FIELD. GULF OF MEXICO SALES OF 147 BCF

REFLECTED THE SALE OF SHELF PROPERTIES, WITH FOUR

FIELDS ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE TOTAL

SALES. SALES IN THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGION

REFLECTED THE DISPOSITION OF THE PROPERTIES IN WESTERN

CANADA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

IN 2005, SALES OF 248 BCF IN THE OTHER

INTERNATIONAL REGION RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF

FORMER-UNOCALS ONSHORE PROPERTIES IN CANADA.

IN 2006, SALES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

TOTALED 149 BCF, MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

CONVERSION OF A RISKED SERVICE AGREEMENT TO A JOINT

STOCK COMPANY IN VENEZUELA.

TABLE VI  STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE

NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING PROVED OIL AND

GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 69. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH INFLOWS

FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END

PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF

ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE

LIMITED TO THOSE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED

FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE

YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END

COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF YEAR-END

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME

TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END

STATUTORY TAX RATES. THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE

DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED

FUTURE PRETAX NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF

RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE

CALCULATED

USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS.

DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN

FUTURE EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN

RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE IMPRECISE

AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES,

WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED

FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE ARBITRARY VALUATION

PRESCRIBED UNDER FAS 69 REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION

COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH

YEAR AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF

THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL AND

GAS RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED
