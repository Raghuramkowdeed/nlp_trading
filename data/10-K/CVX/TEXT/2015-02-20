statements. the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. unless legally required, chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the companys joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the companys production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, other natural or human factors, or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other pending or future litigation; the companys future acquisition or disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the u.s.dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set forth under the heading risk factors on pages 22 through 24 in this report. in addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions. other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements. 2parti item 1. businessgeneral development of businesssummary description of chevron chevron corporation,* a delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to u.s.and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, and power and energy services. upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on page e-4. as of december31, 2014, chevron had approximately 64,700employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). approximately 31,800employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 49percent, were employed in u.s.operations. overview of petroleum industry petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. production levels from the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. in its downstream business, chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. operating environment refer to pages fs-2 through fs-9 of this form10-k in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook.chevrons strategic direction chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. in the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. in the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. the company also continues to apply commercial excellence in supply, trading and transportation to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, and to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance. information about the company is available on the companys website at www.chevron.com. information contained on the companys website is not part of this annual report on form10-k. the companys annual reports on form10-k, quarterly reports on form10-q, current reports on form8-k and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section13(a)

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. upstream reserves refer to table v beginning on pagefs-65 for a tabulation of the companys proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2012 and each year-end from 2012 through 2014. reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended december31, 2014, are summarized in the discussion for table v. discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. the company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. the external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.at december 31, 2014, 20 percent of the company's net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan and 19 percent were located in the united states.the net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2012 through 2014 are shown in the following table: at december 31201420132012liquids millions of barrelsconsolidated companies4,2854,3034,353affiliated companies1,9642,0422,128total liquids6,2496,3456,481natural gas

producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. in the united states, the company is contractually committed to deliver 239billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties through 2017. the company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed u.s.reserves and third-party purchases. these commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts. 6outside the united states, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 705billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2015 through 2017 from operations in australia, colombia, denmark and the philippines. these sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries.development activities refer to table i on pagefs-61 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2014, 2013 and 2012.the following table summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells

and production activities in key areas chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. chevrons 2014 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, beginning on pagefs-3, are presented below. the comments include references to total production and net production, which are defined under production in exhibit99.1 onpagee-10. the discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. united statesupstream activities in the united states are primarily located in california, the gulf of mexico, colorado, louisiana, michigan, new mexico, ohio, oklahoma, pennsylvania, texas, west virginia and wyoming. average net oil-equivalent production in the united states during 2014 was 664,000barrels per day. in california, the company has significant production in the sanjoaquin valley. in 2014, net daily production averaged 163,000barrels of crude oil, 66million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000barrels of natural gas liquids (ngls). approximately 86percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with api gravity lower than 22 degrees). during 2014, net daily production in the gulf of mexico averaged 133,000barrels of crude oil, 320million cubic feet of natural gas and 15,000barrels of ngls. chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico during 2014. the jack and st. malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (fpu) located between the two fields. chevron has a 50percent interest in the jack field and a 51percent interest in the st. malo field. both fields are company-operated. chevron's interest in the production host facility is 40.6 percent. the facility has a design capacity of 170,000barrels of crude oil and 42 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to accommodate production from the jack/st. malo development as well as third-party tiebacks. first production was achieved in december 2014, and production from three of 10 planned wells ramped-up during first quarter 2015. in addition, front-end engineering and design (feed) activities continued in 2014 on the second phase of the development plan for the jack and st. malo fields, and construction is expected to commence on stage 2 in 2016. proved reserves have been recognized for this project. production from the jack/st. malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 94,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. the jack and st. malo fields have an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up.construction and commissioning activities for the 60 percent-owned and operated big foot project progressed during 2014, reaching 93 percent complete by year end. the project facilities have a design capacity of 75,000barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. first production is anticipated in late 2015. the field has an estimated production life of 35years from the time of start-up. proved reserves have been recognized for this project. at the 58percent-owned and operated tahiti field, work continued during 2014 on tahiti 2  a project that is designed to increase recovery from the main producing interval. the last injection well is expected to be completed in first quarter 2015. additional infill drilling is scheduled for the tahiti field through 2016, with production from the first well expected in second-half 2015. the initial recognition of proved reserves occurred in 2014 for the infill drilling. the tahiti field has an estimated remaining production life of at least 20years. the company has a 42.9percent nonoperated working interest in the tubular bells field. first production was achieved in november 2014. total production is expected to average 58,000 to 67,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2015. the field has an estimated production life of 25 years from the time of start-up. the company has a 15.6percent nonoperated working interest in the mad dogfield. the next development phase, the mad dog 2 project, is planned to develop the southern portion of the field. the development plan was re-evaluated in 2013, and feed was re-entered on a new development concept in third quarter 2014. at the end of 2014, proved reserves had not been recognized for

25 beginning on fs-59 for a summary of the company's research and development expenses. environmental protection: the company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to  minimize the impact of those that may occur. chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. in the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, chevron also maintains a worldwide emergency response team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. to complement the companys capabilities, chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the marine spill response corporation, which operates in u.s.territorial waters, and oil spill response, ltd., which operates globally. the company is a founding member of the marine well containment company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the gulf of mexico. in addition, the company is a member of the subsea well response project (swrp). swrps objective is to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. refer to management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page fs-16 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on chevron, and on the company's 2014 environmental expenditures. refer to page fs-16 and note 23 on page fs-58 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. refer also to item 1a. risk factors on pages 22 through 24 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change. item 1a. risk factorschevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys results of operations or financial condition. chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices: chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. as such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected, as will its production and proved reserves. upstream assets may also become impaired. the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. the scope of chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources: the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. the companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors: chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. the companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.chevron utilizes comprehensive risk management systems to assess potential physical and other risks to its assets and to plan for their resiliency. while capital investment reviews and decisions involve uncertainty analysis, which incorporates potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, chevron cannot predict the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.22the companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight: chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. however, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. in certain situations where chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action: the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. in addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to ecuador matters, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-42.the company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure: the company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. as a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. the company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevrons business:  the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. in certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. in other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. in addition, changes in national or state environmental regulations, including those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing, could adversely affect the company's current or anticipated future operations and profitability.regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons products: continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results. international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. these and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products. some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. 23the effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period: in preparing the companys periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934, including its financial statements, chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. these estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.item 1b. unresolved staff commentsnone.item 2. propertiesthe location and character of the companys crude oil and natural gas properties and its refining, marketing, transportation and

proceedings: as previously disclosed in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, filed on february 21, 2014, on august 6, 2012, a piping failure and fire occurred at the chevron u.s.a. inc. refinery in richmond, california. various federal, state, and local agencies initiated investigations as a result of the incident. based on its civil investigation, the united states environmental protection agency (epa) issued a finding of violations (fov) to chevron on december 17, 2013, which includes 62 findings of alleged noncompliance at the refinery. the majority of these findings relate to the august 2012 fire and alleged violations of chemical-accident-prevention laws, but the fov also addresses a number of release-reporting issues, some of which are unrelated to the fire. resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.as previously disclosed in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, filed on february 21, 2014, in july 2009, the hawaii department of health (doh) alleged that chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties in conjunction with commitments chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its hawaii refinery pursuant to a clean air act settlement with the united states epa and the doh. the company has disputed many of the allegations. resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more. as initially disclosed in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, filed on february 21, 2014, the state of new mexico provided to chevron a notice of violation on december 11, 2013, alleging that the flaring of fuel gas that occurred during periodic compressor purging events at the chevron buckeye co2 plant resulted in hourly air emissions during these events in excess of the plant permit limits and alleging that the company had failed to timely report these excess emissions. the company has reached a settlement agreement with the state of new mexico and paid a civil penalty of less than $100,000 to resolve the alleged violation.24as initially disclosed in the quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended march 31, 2014, filed may 2, 2014, a fire was reported on february 11, 2014, at chevron appalachia, llcs lanco 7h well located in dunkard township, greene county, pennsylvania. the pennsylvania department of environmental protection (pa dep) and the occupational safety and health administration of the united states (osha) initiated investigations as a result of the incident. based on its civil investigation to date, the pa dep has issued chevron a notice of violation alleging nine separate incidents of noncompliance. resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000 or more.item 4. mine safety disclosuresinformation concerning mine safety

the discussions that follow.refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs-7 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended december31, 2014. business environment and outlook chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, canada, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, nigeria, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014, reflecting robust non-opec supply growth led by expanding unconventional production in the united states, weakening growth in emerging markets, and the decision by opec in fourth quarter 2014 to maintain its current production ceiling. the downturn in the price of crude oil  has impacted, and, depending upon its duration, will continue to significantly impact the company's results of operations, cash flows, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. if lower prices persist for an extended period of time, the company's response could include further reductions in operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures and additional asset sales. the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increases is unknown.  in the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products.  refer to the "cautionary statement relevant to forward-looking information" on page 2 and to "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, on pages  22 through 24 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition. the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and growth. refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs-7 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2014. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.fs--2management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of changes in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of ongoing operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. in recent years, chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. as a result of the decline in prices of crude oil and other commodities in 2014, these cost pressures are beginning to soften. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti)crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $99 per barrel for the full-year 2014, compared to $109 in 2013. as of mid-february2015, the brent price was $60 per barrel. the majority of the companys equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. while geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions supported crude prices through mid-year, crude prices have since been in decline, as signs of crude oil over-supply emerged during the second half of the year due to continued robust non-opec supply growth, concern over softness in the global economic recovery, and material easing of geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions. downward pressure on crude pricing has been further magnified by opecs decision in november 2014  to maintain the current production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day despite evidence of market surplus.the wti price averaged $93 per barrel for the full-year 2014, compared to $98 in 2013. as of mid-february2015, the wti price was $53 per barrel. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2014 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the u.s. market. fs--3management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsa differential in crude oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). after peaking early in second quarter 2014, the differential has eased in north america as refinery crude runs remained at or above record levels. outside of north america, easing of geopolitical tensions and continued expansion of supply of light sweet crudes has pressured light sweet crude prices relative to those for heavier, more sour crudes. chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page fs-11 for the companys average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in north america. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $4.28 per thousand cubic feet (mcf)during 2014, compared with $3.70 during 2013. as of mid-february2015, the henry hub spot price was $2.73 per mcf. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand, regulatory and commercial   factors. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. the company's contract prices for liquefied natural gas (lng) are typically linked to crude oil prices. chevron's international natural gas realizations averaged $5.78 per mcf during 2014, compared with $5.91 per mcf during 2013. (see page fs-11 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2014 averaged 2.571 million million barrels per day. about one-fifth of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2014 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2014 or 2013. at their november2014 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30million barrels per day, which has been in effect since december2008. the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2015 will be flat to 3 percent growth compared to 2014. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including the duration of the low price environment that began in second-half  2014; quotas that may be imposed by opec; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fs--4management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfields; or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the united states.net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2014, a decrease of 1 percent from year-end 2013. the reserve replacement ratio in 2014 was 89 percent. refer to table v beginning on page fs-65 for a tabulation of the companys proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2012 and each year-end from 2012 through 2014, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending december31, 2014.on november 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned.  on march 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field.  no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to either of these seeps have emerged.  as reported in the companys previously filed periodic reports, it has resolved civil claims relating to these incidents brought by a brazilian federal district prosecutor.  as also reported previously, the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against chevron and eleven chevron employees. on february 19, 2013, the trial court dismissed the criminal matter, and on appeal, on october 9, 2013, the appellate court reinstated two of the ten allegations, specifically those charges alleging environmental damage and failure to provide timely notification to authorities.  on february 27, 2014, chevron filed a motion for reconsideration.  while reconsideration of the motion to dismiss is pending, there will be further proceedings on the reinstated allegations.  the companys ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable.refer to the results of operations section on pages fs-7 through fs-9 for additional discussion of the companys upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas.refer

beginning june 2012, and higher consumer excise taxes in the united states. millions of dollars201420132012income tax expense$11,892$14,308$19,996effective income tax rates were 38 percent in 2014, 40

one-time and ongoing tax charges. the rate decreased between 2013 and 2012 primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in international upstream operations. the lower international upstream effective tax rate was driven by a greater portion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012 (equity income is included as part of before-tax income and is generally recorded net of income taxes) and foreign

marketable securities total balances were $13.2 billion and $16.5 billion at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was $31.5 billion, compared with $35.0 billion in 2013 and $38.8 billion in 2012. cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $0.4billion, $1.2billion and $1.2billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $5.7billion in 2014, $1.1billion in 2013, and $2.8billion in 2012.restricted cash of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at december31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. these amounts are generally associated with tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for asset acquisitions and capital investment projects. dividends dividends paid to common stockholders were $7.9billion in 2014, $7.5 billion in 2013 and $6.8billion in 2012. in april 2014, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 7percent to $1.07 per common share. debt and capital lease obligations total debt and capital lease obligations were $27.8billion at december31, 2014, up from $20.4billion at year-end 2013. the $7.4 billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2014 was primarily due to funding the companys capital investment program, which included several large projects in the construction phase. the company completed a $4 billion bond issuance in november 2014, timed in part to take advantage of historically low interest rates. the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $11.8billion at december31, 2014, compared with $8.4billion at year-end 2013. of these amounts, $8.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at the end of both periods. at year-end 2014, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2015, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. chevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in november 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the companys debt, and the companys cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard & poors corporation and aa1 by moodys investors service. the companys u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard & poors and p-l by moodys. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. fs--12management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and with the intent to maintain the companys high-quality debt ratings. committed credit facilities information related to committed credit facilities is included in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, short-term debt, on page fs-49.common stock repurchase program in july2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. during 2014, the company purchased 41.5million common shares for $5.0 billion. from the inception of the program through 2014, the company had purchased 180.9 million shares for $20.0billion. given the change in market conditions, the company is suspending the share repurchase program for 2015.capital and exploratory expenditures capital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2014,

which did not require cash outlays by the company. in 2013 and 2012, expenditures were $41.9billion and $34.2billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $2.7billion and $2.1billion, respectively. the increase in expenditures between 2013 and 2012 included approximately $4 billion for major resource acquisitions in argentina, australia, the permian basin and the kurdistan region of iraq, along with the additional acreage in the duvernay shale and interests in the kitimat lng project. in addition, work progressed on a number of major capital projects, particularly two australian lng projects and two deepwater gulf of mexico projects. of the $40.3 billion of expenditures in 2014, 92percent, or $37.1 billion, was related to upstream activities. approximately, 90percent was expended for upstream operations in 2013 and 2012. international upstream accounted for 76percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2014, 78percent in 2013 and 72 percent in 2012. the company estimates that 2015 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $35.0billion, including $4.0billion of spending by affiliates. this planned reduction, compared to 2014 expenditures, is in large part a response to current market conditions.  approximately 90percent of the total, or $31.6billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. approximately $23.4billion, or 74 percent, of this amount is for projects outside the united states. spending in 2015 is primarily focused on major development projects in angola, argentina, australia, canada, kazakhstan, nigeria, republic of the congo, russia, the united kingdom and the u.s. also included is funding for enhancing recovery and mitigating natural field declines for currently-producing assets, development of shale and tight resources, and focused exploration and appraisal activities. the company will continue to monitor crude oil market conditions, and will further modify spending plans, as needed. worldwide downstream spending in 2015 is estimated at $2.8billion, with $2.0 billion for projects in the united states. about half of these investments are expected to be funded by cpchem for petrochemicals projects in the united states. additional capital outlays include projects at u.s. and international refineries.investments in technology companies and other corporate businesses in 2015 are budgeted at $0.6 billion. noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1.2 billion at december31, 2014 compared to $1.3 billion at year-end 2013. distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $47 million and $99 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. pension obligations information related to pension plan contributions is included on page fs-56 in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements under the heading cash contributions and benefit payments. fs--13management's discussion and analysis of financial condition

liabilities, which indicates the companys ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. the current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that chevrons inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. at year-end 2014, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $8.1 billion. interest coverage ratio  income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. this ratio indicates the companys ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. the companys interest coverage ratio in 2014 was lower than 2013 and 2012 due to lower income. debt ratio  total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders' equity, which indicates the companys leverage. the company's debt ratio in 2014 was higher than 2013 and 2012 as the company took on more debt to finance its ongoing investment program, partially offset by a higher stockholders' equity balance.off-balance-sheet arrangements, contractual obligations, guarantees and other contingencies long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2015  $3.6billion; 2016  $3.0billion; 2017  $2.3 billion; 2018  $2.1billion; 2019  $1.6billion; 2020 and after  $4.5billion. a portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under the agreements were approximately

affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee. indemnifications information related to indemnifications is included on page fs-57 in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements under the heading indemnifications. financial and derivative instrument market risk the market risk associated with the companys portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. the estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the companys projection of future market changes. the actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading risk factors in parti, item1a, of the companys 2014 annual report on form 10-k. derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. the results of these activities were not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2014. the companys market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal risk control group in accordance with the companys risk management policies, which are reviewed by the audit committee of the companys board of directors. derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. the change in fair value of chevrons derivative commodity instruments in 2014 was not material to the company's results of operations. the company uses the monte carlo simulation method with a 95 percent confidence level as its value-at-risk (var) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. a one-day holding period is used on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated or hedged within one day. based on these inputs, the var for the company's primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at december31, 2014 and 2013 was not material to the company's cash flows or results of operations. foreign currency the company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. the foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. there were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at december31, 2014.interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at year-end 2014, the company had no interest rate swaps. transactions with related parties chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. these arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. refer to other information in note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, page fs-41, for further discussion. management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party. fs--15management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationslitigation and other

issues. the liability balance of approximately $15.1 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2014 related primarily to upstream properties. for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. refer to

heading income taxes.other contingencies information related to other contingencies is included on page fs-58 in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements under the heading other contingencies. environmental matters virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. these regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. regulations intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change also continue to evolve and include those at the international or multinational (such as the mechanisms under the kyoto protocol and the european union's emissions trading system), national (such as the u.s. environmental protection agency's emission standards and renewable transportation fuel content requirements or domestic market-based programs such as those in effect in australia and new zealand), and state or regional (such as california's global warming solutions act) levels. regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve at the national and state levels.most of the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the company's liquidity or financial position.fs--16management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsaccidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2014 at approximately $2.6 billion for its consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were approximately $0.9 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.7 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites.for 2015, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.9 billion. these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.critical accounting estimates and assumptions management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein: 1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or operating performance is material.the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors. the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. variables impacting chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development and production costs. the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevron's consolidated financial statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:1.amortization - capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (uop) basis using proved developed reserves. acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a uop basis using total proved reserves. during 2014, chevron's uop depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) for oil and gas properties was $13.0 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2014 were 4.8 billion barrels for consolidated companies. if the estimates of proved reserves used in the uop calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, uop dd&a in 2014 would have increased by approximately $690 million.fs--17management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations2.impairment - oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. in assessing whether the property is impaired, the fair value of the property must be determined. frequently, a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value. proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. for a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see impairment of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates below.refer to table v, reserve quantity information, beginning on page fs-65, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending december 31, 2014, and to table vii, changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on page fs-71 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31, 2014. this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties, plant and equipment section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-28, which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.impairment of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions. refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in note 9 beginning on page fs-34 and to the section on properties, plant and equipment in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," beginning on page fs-28.the company routinely performs impairment reviews when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. that is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets associated carrying values.investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value. differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis. no material individual impairments of pp&e or investments were recorded for the three years ending december31, 2014. a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired. asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (aro), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2014 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some fs--18management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsassumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. refer to note 24 on page fs-59 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.pension and other postretirement benefit plans note 22, beginning on page fs-52, includes information on the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit (opeb) plans reflected on the consolidated balance sheet; the components of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income; and the related underlying assumptions.the determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for opeb plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. information related to the companys processes to develop these assumptions is included on page fs-54 in note 22 under the relevant headings. actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world's financial markets.for 2014, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent and a discount rate of 4.3 percent for u.s. pension plans. for the 10 years ending december 31, 2014, actual asset returns averaged 6.0 percent for the plan. the actual return for 2014 was more than 7.5 percent. additionally, with the exception of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.5 percent during each year.total pension expense for 2014 was $1.2 billion. an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the companys primary u.s. pension plan, which accounted for about 39 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2014 by approximately $98 million. a 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2014 by approximately $229 million. the aggregate funded status recognized at december 31, 2014, was a net liability of approximately $4.7 billion. an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. at december 31, 2014, the company used a discount rate of 3.7 percent to measure the obligations for the u.s. pension plans. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary u.s. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $403 million, which would have decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately $1.6 billion to $1.2 billion. for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2014 was $219 million, and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2014, was $3.7 billion. for the main u.s. opeb plan, the company used a 4.7 percent discount rate to measure expense in 2014, and a 4.1 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at december 31, 2014. discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2014 opeb expense and opeb liabilities at the end of 2014. for information on the sensitivity of the health care cost-trend rate, refer to fs-54 in note 22 under the heading other benefit assumptions. differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. refer to page fs-53 in note 22 for a description of the method used to amortize the $7.2 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december 31, 2014, and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2015. in addition, information related to company contributions is included on page fs-56 in note 22 under the heading cash contributions and benefit payments. contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. for example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally reports these losses as operating expenses or selling, fs--19management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsgeneral and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income. an exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to note 23 beginning on page fs-57. refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december31, 2014. an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. new accounting standards refer to note 19, on page fs-49 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for information regarding new accounting standards.quarterly results and stock market data unaudited 20142013millions of dollars, except per-share

company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/

summary of significant accounting policiesgeneral the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.  subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to 50percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity currently in income. investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. when appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values. derivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. for the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents. bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90days are reported as time deposits. the balance of short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income. inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials, supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost. properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. fs--28notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountscosts also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 20, beginning on page fs-49, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas properties in the united states, the company generally performs an impairment review on an individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession, development area or field basis, as appropriate. in downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. refer to note 9, beginning on page fs-34, relating to fair value measurements. the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. refer also to note 24, on page fs-59, relating to aros. depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets. gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as other income. expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. major replacements and renewals are capitalized. goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. for crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an aro is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. refer to note 24, on page fs-59, for a discussion of the companys aros.fs--29notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsfor federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the companys own internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured. currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. the cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in currency translation adjustment on the consolidated statement of equity. revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas production from properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized using the entitlement method. excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. the associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the consolidated statement of income, on page fs-23. purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in purchased crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income. stock options and other share-based compensation the company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. for equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. the company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the companys long-term incentive plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. the company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.note 2 changes in accumulated other comprehensive losses the change in accumulated other comprehensive losses (aocl) presented on the consolidated balance sheet

liability are as follows: level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted)in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. for the company, level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded. level 2: inputs other than level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. for the company, level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract. level 3: unobservable inputs. the company does not use level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair value measurements. level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities.the tables on the next page show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at december31, 2014, and december31, 2013. marketable securities the company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. the fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at december31, 2014. derivatives the company records its derivative instruments  other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale  on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the consolidated statement of income. derivatives classified as level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the new york mercantile exchange. derivatives classified as level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. the company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the level 2 instruments. since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. the company does not materially adjust this information. properties, plant and equipment the company reported impairments for certain oil and gas properties and a mining asset in 2014.  the company did not have any material long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2013.investments and advances the company did not have any material investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2014 or 2013. fs--34notes to the consolidated

bank time deposits in u.s. and non-u.s. portfolios. the instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90days or less and money market funds. cash and cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of $12,785 and $16,245 at december31, 2014, and december31, 2013, respectively. the instruments held in time deposits are bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90days, and had carrying/fair values of  $8 at both december31, 2014, and december31, 2013. the fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at december31, 2014. "cash and cash equivalents do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,474 and $1,210 at december31, 2014, and december31, 2013, respectively. at december31, 2014, these investments are classified as level 1 and include restricted funds related to upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges and asset acquisitions, and tax payments, which are reported in deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. long-term debt of $15,960 and $11,960 at december31, 2014, and december31, 2013, had estimated fair values of $16,450 and $12,267, respectively. long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. the fair value of corporate bonds is $15,727 and classified as level 1. the fair value of the other bonds is $723 and classified as level 2.   the carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet approximate their fair values. fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at december31, 2014 and 2013, were not material. note 10 financial and derivative instrumentsderivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. from time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. the companys derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. none of the companys derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the companys affiliates make such designation. the companys derivatives are not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. the company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. fs--35notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsthe company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the new york mercantile exchange and on electronic platforms of the inter-continental exchange and chicago mercantile exchange. in addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the over-the-counter markets, which are governed by international swaps and derivatives association agreements and other master netting arrangements. depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. derivative instruments measured at fair value at december31, 2014, december31, 2013, and december31, 2012, and their classification on the consolidated balance sheet

liabilities$793$704$89$$89derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. amounts not offset on the consolidated balance sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for "a right of offset." concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the companys short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. company investment policies limit the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the companys counterparties in derivative instruments. the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. as a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers. fs--36notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 11 earnings per share basic earnings per share (eps)is based upon net income attributable to chevron corporation (earnings) and includes

subsidiaries and their affiliates. the investments are grouped into two business segments, upstream and downstream, representing the companys reportable segments and operating segments. upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (lng); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. all other activities of the company include mining activities, power and energy services, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. the companys segments are managed by segment managers who report to the chief operating decision maker (codm). the segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.the companys primary country of operation is the united states of america, its country of domicile. other components of the companys operations are reported as "international (outside the united states). fs--37notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountssegment earnings the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. corporate administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. however, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in all other. earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table: year ended december 31201420132012segment

fs-34, for summarized financial information for 100 percent of tco. petropiar chevron has a 30 percent interest in petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project in venezuelas orinoco belt. at december31, 2014, the companys carrying value of its investment in petropiar was approximately $160 less than the amount of underlying equity in

additive. chevron is a party to seven pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. the companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. the company no longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states. ecuador chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit initiated in the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio, ecuador, in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of texaco inc., was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador. at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. after certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. with regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. in 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess $18,900, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment. in 2009, following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. in 2010, chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. in august2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days. chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement. in september2010, chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. the plaintiffs submission, which relied in part on the mining engineers report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000. the next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. in october2010, chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted. a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. on december17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. fs--42notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountson february14, 2011, the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. the court rejected chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. the judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900 as an award for the plaintiffs representatives. it also assessed an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment, which chevron did not do. on february17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on march11, 2011, chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. on january3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the february 14, 2011 decision and ordered that chevron pay additional attorneys fees in the amount of 0.10% of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment. the plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on january6, 2012, and the court issued a ruling in response on january13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its january3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling, or february3, 2012. chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. on january20, 2012, chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panels decision to ecuadors national court of justice. as part of the appeal, chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal. on february 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted chevrons cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the national court of justice to hear the appeal. the provincial court appellate panel denied chevrons request for suspension of the requirement that chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the first and second interim awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below. on march29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the national court of justice, and on november 22, 2012, the national court agreed to hear chevron's cassation appeal. on august 3, 2012, the provincial court in lago agrio approved a court-appointed liquidators report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be $19,100. on november 13, 2013, the national court ratified the judgment but nullified the $8,600 punitive damage assessment, resulting in a judgment of $9,500. on december 23, 2013, chevron appealed the decision to the ecuador constitutional court, ecuador's highest court, which agreed to consider the appeal on march 20, 2014.  on july 2, 2013, the provincial court in lago agrio issued an embargo order in ecuador ordering that any funds to be paid by the government of ecuador to chevron to satisfy a $96 award issued in an unrelated action by an arbitral tribunal presiding in the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law must be paid to the lago agrio plaintiffs. the award was issued by the tribunal under the united states-ecuador bilateral investment treaty in an action filed in 2006 in connection with seven breach of contract cases that texpet filed against the government of ecuador between 1991 and 1993. the government of ecuador has moved to set aside the tribunal's award. on september 26, 2014, the supreme court of the netherlands issued an opinion denying ecuadors set aside request. a federal district court for the district of columbia confirmed the tribunal's award, and the government of ecuador has appealed the district court's decision.chevron has no assets in ecuador and the lago agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt chevron's operations. on may30, 2012, the lago agrio plaintiffs filed an action against chevron corporation, chevron canada limited, and chevron canada finance limited in the ontario superior court of justice in ontario, canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the ecuadorian judgment. on may 1, 2013, the ontario superior court of justice held that the court has jurisdiction over chevron and chevron canada limited for purposes of the action, but stayed the action due to the absence of evidence that chevron corporation has assets in ontario. the lago agrio plaintiffs appealed that decision. on december 17, 2013, the court of appeals for ontario affirmed the lower courts decision on jurisdiction and set aside the stay,  allowing the recognition and enforcement action to be heard in the ontario superior court of justice. chevron appealed the decision concerning jurisdiction to the supreme court of canada and, on january 16, 2014, the court of appeals for ontario granted chevrons motion to stay the recognition and enforcement proceeding pending a decision on the admissibility of the supreme court appeal. on april 3, 2014, the supreme court of canada granted chevrons and chevron canada limiteds petitions to appeal the ontario court of appeals decision. on april 8, 2014, chevron and chevron canada limited filed their notices of appeal with the canada supreme court.on june27, 2012, the lago agrio plaintiffs filed an action against chevron corporation in the superior court of justice in brasilia, brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the ecuadorian judgment. on october 15, 2012, the provincial court in lago agrio issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate chevron subsidiaries in ecuador, argentina and colombia. on november 6, 2012, at the request of the lago agrio plaintiffs, a court in argentina issued a freeze order against chevron argentina s.r.l. and another chevron subsidiary, ingeniero norberto fs--43notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountspriu, requiring shares of both companies to be "embargoed," requiring third parties to withhold 40 percent of any payments due to chevron argentina s.r.l. and ordering banks to withhold 40 percent of the funds in chevron argentina s.r.l. bank accounts. on december 14, 2012, the argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the freeze order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments. the court also clarified that the freeze order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes. on january 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the freeze order, but on june 4, 2013 the supreme court of argentina revoked the freeze order in its entirety. on december 12, 2013, the lago agrio plaintiffs served chevron with notice of their filing of an enforcement proceeding in the national court, first instance, of argentina. chevron filed its answer on february 27, 2014. chevron intends to vigorously defend against the proceeding. chevron continues to believe the provincial courts judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in ecuador, the united states and other countries. the company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in ecuador or any enforcement action. chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions.chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september2009 against the republic of ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law. the claim alleges violations of the republic of ecuadors obligations under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty (bit)and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the bit. through the arbitration, chevron and texpet are seeking relief against the republic of ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation constitutes a violation of ecuadors obligations under the bit. on february9, 2011, the tribunal issued an order for interim measures requiring the republic of ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending further order of the tribunal. on january25, 2012, the tribunal converted the order for interim measures into an interim award. chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on january4, 2012, and the republic of ecuador opposed chevrons application and requested that the existing order for interim measures be vacated on january9, 2012. on february 16, 2012, the tribunal issued a second interim award mandating that the republic of ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without ecuador of the judgment against chevron and, in particular, to preclude any certification by the republic of ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against chevron. on february27, 2012, the tribunal issued a third interim award confirming its jurisdiction to hear chevron's arbitration claims. on february 7, 2013, the tribunal issued its fourth interim award in which it declared that the republic of ecuador has violated the first and second interim awards under the [bit], the uncitral rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the lago agrio judgment within and outside ecuador, including (but not limited to) canada, brazil and argentina. the republic of ecuador filed in the district court of the hague a request to set aside the tribunals interim awards and the first partial award (described below).  chevron filed its answer to the set aside request on december 31, 2014. the tribunal has divided the merits phase of the proceeding into three phases. on september 17, 2013, the tribunal issued its first partial award from phase one, finding that the settlement agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet applied to texpet and chevron, released texpet and chevron from claims based on "collective" or "diffuse" rights arising from texpet's operations in the former concession area and precluded third parties from asserting collective/diffuse rights environmental claims relating to texpet's operations in the former concession area but did not preclude individual claims for personal harm. chevron awaits a ruling from the tribunal about whether the claims of the lago agrio plaintiffs are individual or collective/diffuse. the tribunal had set phase two to begin on january 20, 2014 to hear chevron's denial of justice claims, but on january 2, 2014, the tribunal postponed phase two and held a procedural hearing on january 20-21, 2014. the tribunal held a hearing on april 29-30, 2014 to address remaining issues relating to phase one. it also set a hearing on april 20 to may 6, 2015 to address phase two issues. the tribunal has not set a date for phase three, which will be the damages phase of the arbitration.through a series of u.s. court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration, chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs. in february2011, chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws. through the civil lawsuit, chevron is seeking relief that includes a fs--44notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsdeclaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. on march7, 2011, the federal district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending resolution of chevrons civil lawsuit by the federal district court. on may 31, 2011, the federal district court severed claims one through eight of chevrons complaint from the ninth claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending a trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief. on september19, 2011, the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the preliminary injunction, stayed the trial on chevrons ninth claim, a claim for declaratory relief, that had been set for november14, 2011, and denied the defendants mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit. the second circuit issued its opinion on january26, 2012 ordering the dismissal of chevrons ninth claim for declaratory relief. on february 16, 2012, the federal district court lifted the stay on claims one through eight, and on october 18, 2012, the federal district court set a trial date of october 15, 2013. on march 22, 2013, chevron settled its claims against stratus consulting, and on april 12, 2013 sworn declarations by representatives of stratus consulting were filed with the court admitting their role and that of the plaintiffs' attorneys in drafting the environmental report of the mining engineer appointed by the provincial court in lago agrio. on september 26, 2013, the second circuit denied the defendants' petition for writ of mandamus to recuse the judge hearing the case and to collaterally estop chevron from seeking a declaration that the lago agrio judgment was obtained through fraud and other unlawful conduct. the trial commenced on october 15, 2013 and concluded on november 22, 2013. on march 4, 2014, the federal district court entered a judgment in favor of chevron, prohibiting the defendants from seeking to enforce the lago agrio judgment in the united states and further prohibiting them from profiting from their illegal acts. the defendants filed their notices of appeal on march 18, 2014.the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on chevron, remains uncertain. management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment, the 2008 engineers report on alleged damages and the september2010 plaintiffs submission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). note 16

the decrease primarily resulted from the impact of changes in jurisdictional mix and equity earnings, and the tax effects related to the 2014 sale of interests in chad and cameroon, partially offset by other one-time and ongoing tax charges.the company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet

net$18,065$17,589deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2014 increased by approximately $3,300 from year-end 2013. the increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and equipment. deferred tax assets increased by approximately $1,900 in 2014. increases primarily related to increased temporary differences for employee benefits. the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. it reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in managements assessment, more likely than not to be realized. at the end of 2014, the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $5,535 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,190, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2015 through 2029. u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $11,867 will expire between 2015 and 2024.at december31, 2014 and 2013, deferred taxes were classified on the consolidated balance sheet as follows: at december

unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $35,700 at december31, 2014. this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. at the end of 2014, deferred income taxes were recorded for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of the earnings is not planned. the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. uncertain income tax positions the company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. the term tax position in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. the following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. the term unrecognized tax benefits in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. interest and penalties are not included.

december 31, 2013, and december 31, 2014 was primarily due to the expiration of certain u.s. foreign tax credits in 2014, which had no impact on the company's results of operations.approximately 68 percent of the $3,552 of unrecognized tax benefits at december31, 2014, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. for the companys major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december31, 2014. for these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: united states  2008, nigeria  2000, angola  2001, saudi arabia  2012 and kazakhstan  2007. the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. however, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12months. given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.on the consolidated statement of income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. as of december31, 2014, accruals of $233 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance sheet, compared with accruals of $215 as of year-end 2013. income tax expense (benefit)associated with interest and penalties was $4, $(42) and $145 in 2014, 2013 and 2012,

liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date. the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. at december31, 2014, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. at december31, 2014, the company had $8,000 in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december2016, that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2014. at both december31, 2014 and 2013, the company classified $8,000 of short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. note 19 new accounting standardsrevenue recognition (topic 606), revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09) in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, which becomes effective for the company january 1, 2017. early adoption is not permitted. the standard provides that an entity should recognize revenue to align with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. the asu, which replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap, provides a five-step model for recognition of revenue, guidance on the accounting for certain costs of obtaining or fulfilling contracts with customers and specific disclosure requirements. transition guidance permits either retrospective application or presentation of the cumulative effect at the adoption date. the company is reviewing the requirements of the asu to determine the transition method it will apply and to update its assessments developed throughout the fasbs deliberation period. the company is evaluating the effect of the standard on the companys consolidated financial statements. note 20 accounting for suspended exploratory wells the company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when (a)the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b)the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. if either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. fs--49notes to the consolidated financial

projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly planned for the near future. the $1,213 balance is related to 30 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned for the near future. additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.the projects for the $1,213 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects economic viability: (a) $289 (six projects)  undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision

miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. while progress was being made on all 51 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. approximately half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years. the

and appreciation rights. these awards retained the same provisions as the original unocal plans. unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to expire through early 2015.the fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were measured on the date of grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model, with the following

company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards. as of december31, 2014, there was $226 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7years.at january1, 2014, the number of ltip performance units outstanding was equivalent to 2,531,270 shares. during 2014, 772,800 units were granted, 967,234 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 70,884 units were forfeited. at december31, 2014, units outstanding were 2,265,952. the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $212, and was measured using the monte carlo simulation method. in addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various ltip and former unocal programs totaled approximately 3.3 million equivalent shares as of december31, 2014. a liability of $78 was recorded for these awards. fs--51notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 22 employee benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the company does not typically fund u.s. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives. the company also sponsors other postretirement (opeb)plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. medical coverage for medicare-eligible retirees in the companys main u.s. medical plan is secondary to medicare (including partd) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet. the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans for 2014 and 2013 follows: pension benefits20142013other benefitsu.s.intl.u.s.intl.20142013change in benefit obligationbenefit obligation at

and opeb plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 12 and 15 years, respectively. these amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. the amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. during 2015, the company estimates actuarial losses of $356, $81 and $34 will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international pension and opeb plans, respectively. in addition, the company estimates an additional $216 will be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2015 related to lump-sum settlement costs from u.s. pension plans. fs--53notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsthe weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31, 2014, was approximately 5 and 9 years for u.s. and international pension plans, respectively, and 7 years for other postretirement benefit plans. during 2015, the company estimates prior service (credits)costs of $(9), $22 and $14 will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international pension and opeb plans, respectively. assumptions the following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net

companys estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. for 2014, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent for u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 72 percent of the companys pension plan assets. in both 2013 and 2012, the company used a long-term rate of return of 7.5 for                                this plan. the market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the u.s. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. at december31, 2014, the company used a 3.7 percent discount rate for the u.s. pension plans and 4.1 percent for the main u.s. opeb plan. the discount rates for these plans at the end of 2013 were 4.3 and 4.7 percent, respectively, while in 2012 they were 3.6 and 3.9 percent for these plans, respectively.other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december31, 2014, for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.0 percent in 2015 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. for this measurement at december31, 2013, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 7.3 percent in 2014 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. in both measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent. assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. the impact is mitigated by the 4 percent cap on the companys medical contributions for the primary u.s. plan. a 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects on worldwide plans: 1 percent increase1 percent decreaseeffect on total service and interest cost components$13$(10)effect on postretirement benefit obligation$226$(187)fs--54notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsplan assets and investment strategy the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided into three levels: level 1: fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability to access. level 2: fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data through correlation or other means. if the asset has a contractual term, the level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of the asset. the fair values for level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges.level 3: inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. valuation may be performed using a financial model incorporating estimated inputs. the fair value measurements of the companys pension plans for 2014 and 2013 are below:u.s.intl.total

potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management. the companys u.s. and u.k. pension plans comprise 91 percent of the total pension assets. both the u.s. and u.k. plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. to assess the plans investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. for the primary u.s. pension plan, the company's benefit plan investment committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: equities 4070 percent, fixed income and cash 2060 percent, real estate 015 percent, and other 05 percent. for the u.k. pension plan, the u.k. board of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed regularly: equities 30-50 percent, fixed income and cash 3565 percent and real estate 5-15 percent. the other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. to mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. the company does not prefund its opeb obligations. cash contributions and benefit payments in 2014, the company contributed $99 and $293 to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. in 2015, the company expects contributions to be approximately $350 to its u.s. plan and $250 to its international pension plans. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $198 in 2015; $200 was paid in 2014. the following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10years:pension

(esip). compensation expense for the esip totaled $316, $163 and $243 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the amounts for esip expense in 2013 and 2012 are net of $140 and $43, respectively, which reflect the value of common stock released from the former leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop). lesop debt was retired in 2013, and all remaining shares were released.benefit plan trusts prior to its acquisition by chevron, texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. at year-end 2014, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of chevron treasury stock. the trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. prior to its acquisition by chevron, unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. at december31, 2014 and 2013, trust assets of $38 and $40, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts. employee incentive plans the chevron incentive plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. charges to expense for cash bonuses were $965, $871 and $898 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. chevron also has the ltip for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. awards under the ltip consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in note 21, beginning on page fs-50. note 23 other contingencies and commitments income taxes the company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. refer to note 16, beginning on page fs-45, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination.guarantees the companys guarantee of $485 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. over the approximate 13-year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee. indemnificationsin the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. the acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at december31, 2009. under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, chevron is solely responsible until april2022, when the indemnification expires. the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997. although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. the aggregate fs--57notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsapproximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2015  $3,600; 2016  $3,000; 2017  $2,300; 2018  $2,100; 2019  $1,600; 2020 and after  $4,500. a portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under the agreements were approximately $3,700 in 2014, $3,600 in 2013 and $3,600 in 2012. environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or chemical companies. chevrons environmental reserve as of december31, 2014, was $1,683. included in this balance were remediation activities at approximately 164 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2014 was $456. the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. of the remaining year-end 2014 environmental reserves balance of $1,227, $868 related to the companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. the remaining $359 was associated with various sites in international downstream $79, upstream $275 and other businesses $5. liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants. the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2014 had a recorded liability that was material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. refer to note 24 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations. other contingencies on april 26, 2010, a california appeals court issued a ruling related to the adequacy of an environmental impact report (eir) supporting the issuance of certain permits by the city of richmond, california, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at chevron's refinery in richmond. settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and on march 3, 2011, the trial court entered a final judgment and peremptory writ ordering the city to set aside the project eir and conditional use permits and enjoining chevron from any further work. on may 23, 2011, the company filed an application with the city planning department for a conditional use permit for a revised project to complete construction of the hydrogen plant, certain sulfur removal facilities and related infrastructure. fs--58notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountson june 10, 2011, the city published its notice of preparation of the revised eir for the project, and on march 18, 2014, the revised draft eir was published for public comment.the public comment period closed in may 2014, the final eir was released on june 9, 2014, and on july 29, 2014, the richmond city council certified the eir and approved a conditional use permit. the company is now seeking to secure the further necessary approvals to resume construction. although the city council has certified the eir, management believes the outcomes associated with the project are uncertain.due to the uncertainty of the company's future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any, can be made at this time.chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve. the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses in future periods. note 24 asset retirement obligations the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (aro)as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control. this uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. recognition of the aro includes: (1)the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2)the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates. aros are primarily recorded for the companys crude oil and natural gas producing assets. no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. the following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2014, 2013 and 2012: 201420132012balance at january 1$14,298$13,271$12,767liabilities incurred13359133liabilities settled(1,291)(907)(966)accretion

reflect increasing costs for complex well abandonments and accelerated timing of abandonment. the long-term portion of the $15,053 balance at the end of 2014 was $14,246.note 25 other financial information earnings in 2014 included after-tax gains of approximately $3,000 relating to the sale of nonstrategic properties. of this amount, approximately $1,800, $1,000 and $200 related to upstream, downstream, and other assets, respectively.  earnings in 2013 included after-tax gains of approximately $500 relating to the sale of nonstrategic properties. of this amount, approximately $300 and $200 related to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. earnings in 2014 included after-tax charges of approximately $1,000 for impairments and other asset write-offs, of which $800 was related to upstream and $200 to a mining asset. earnings in 2013 included after-tax charges of approximately $400 for impairments and other asset write-offs, of which $300 was related to upstream and $100 to other assets and investments.  fs--59notes to the consolidated financial statements millions of dollars, except per-share amountsother financial information is as follows:year ended december

classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers, the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists. the system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting - three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all sec and company standards.proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.fs--65supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities - unauditedproved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a reserves advisory committee (rac) that is chaired by the manager of corporate reserves, a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and production activities. the manager of corporate reserves has more than 30 years experience working in the oil and gas industry and a master of science in petroleum engineering degree from stanford university. his experience includes more than 15 years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. he was chairman of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee, served on the united nations expert group on resources classification, and is a past member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training and the california conservation committee. he is an active member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers and serves on the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee.all rac members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. the reserves activities are managed by two operating company-level reserves managers. these two reserves managers are not members of the rac so as to preserve corporate-level independence.the rac has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.during the year, the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. major changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee, whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. the companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors. if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the board.rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the corporate reserves manual.technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2014, additions to chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates. both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2014, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 5.0 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (boe), a decrease of 174 million boe from year-end 2013. the decrease was due to the transfer of 646 million boe to proved developed and 2 million boe in sales, partially offset by increases of 277 million boe in extensions and discoveries, 169 million boe in revisions, and 28 million boe in improved recovery.during 2014, investments totaling approximately $15.4 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $2.9 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. australia accounted for about $7.1 billion of the total, mainly for development and construction activities at the gorgon and wheatstone lng projects. expenditures of about $3.4 billion in the united states related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the midcontinent region. in asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $3.3 billion, primarily related to development projects of the tco affiliate in kazakhstan, and in thailand. in africa, about $2.8 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria and angola. development activities in canada and brazil were primarily responsible for about $1.6 billion of expenditures in other americas.fs--66supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities - unauditedreserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. at year-end 2014, the company held approximately 2.5 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. the majority of these reserves are in three locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. in australia, approximately 700 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to the gorgon project. the company is currently constructing liquefaction and other facilities in australia to develop this natural gas. in africa, approximately 400 million boe have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects in nigeria. affiliates account for about 1.1 billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more, with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan. at tco, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion.annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. for 2014, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 44 percent and 46 percent. the consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period.proved reserve quantities for the three years ending december 31, 2014, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. apart from acquisitions, the companys ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, opec constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.at december 31, 2014, proved reserves for the company were 11.1 billion boe. the companys estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 are shown in the table on page fs-68. the companys estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page fs-69.noteworthy changes in liquids proved reserves for 2012 through 2014 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:revisions in 2012, improved field performance and drilling associated with gulf of mexico projects accounted for the majority of the 104 million barrel increase in the united states. in asia, drilling results across numerous assets drove the 97 million barrel increase. improved field performance from various nigeria and angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 66 million barrel increase in africa. improved plant efficiency for the tco affiliate was responsible for a large portion of the 59 million barrel increase.in 2013, improved field performance from various nigeria and angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 94 million barrel increase in africa. in asia, drilling performance across numerous assets resulted in an 84 million barrel increase. improved field performance and drilling associated with gulf of mexico projects and drilling in the midland and delaware basins accounted for the majority of the 55 million barrel increase in the united states. synthetic oil reserves in canada increased by 40 million barrels, primarily due to improved field performance.in 2014, drilling in the midland and delaware basins and improved field performance and drilling in california accounted for the majority of the 90 million barrel increase in the united states. improved field performance at various nigeria fields was primarily responsible for the 74 million barrel increase in africa. in asia, drilling performance across numerous assets, primarily in indonesia, resulted in the 80 million barrel increase.  improved recovery in 2012, improved recovery increased reserves by 77 million barrels, primarily due to secondary recovery performance in africa and in gulf of mexico fields in the united states.in 2013, improved recovery increased reserves by 57 million barrels due to numerous small projects, including expansions of existing projects in the united states, europe, asia, and africa.in 2014, improved recovery increased reserves by 34 million barrels, primarily due to secondary recovery projects in the united states, mostly related to steamflood expansions in california.fs--67supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities - unauditedextensions and discoveries in 2012, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 101 million barrels in other americas, primarily due to the initial booking of the hebron project in canada. in the united states, additions at several gulf of mexico projects and drilling activities in the mid-continent region were primarily responsible for the 77 million barrel increase.in 2013, extensions and discoveries in the midland and delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 55 million barrel increase in the united states.in 2014, extensions and discoveries in the midland and delaware basins and the gulf of mexico were primarily responsible for the 164 million barrel increase in the united states.purchases in 2014, the purchase of additional reserves in canada was responsible for the 26 million barrel increase in synthetic oil.sales in 2014, the sale of the companys interests in chad was responsible for the 20 million barrel

activities - unauditedtable vi - standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reservesthe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with sec and fasb requirements. this includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations, and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. the valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. the calculations are made as of december 31 each year and do not represent  managements estimate of the companys future cash flows or
