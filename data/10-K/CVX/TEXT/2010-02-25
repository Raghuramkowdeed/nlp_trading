SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON CORPORATION,* A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS

INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES

ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL, MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY

INTEGRATED PETROLEUM OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS, MINING

OPERATIONS, POWER GENERATION AND ENERGY SERVICES. EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR,

DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND ALSO

MARKETING NATURAL GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

(DOWNSTREAM) OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL AND

CONVERTING NATURAL GAS INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS;

MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM

PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL

CAR. CHEMICALS OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING

OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND

FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

A LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES

E-23

AND

E-24.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, CHEVRON HAD APPROXIMATELY

64,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 4,000 SERVICE STATION

EMPLOYEES). APPROXIMATELY 31,500 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT

3,500 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES), OR 49 PERCENT, WERE

EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, AND INDIVIDUAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

CONTROL OVER SOME OF THEM. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES, REGULATING HOW

COMPANIES ARE STRUCTURED AND WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT

THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME

CASES, LIMITING THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THESE COMMODITIES. HOWEVER,

SOME GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE PRICE CONTROLS ON REFINED PRODUCTS SUCH

AS GASOLINE OR DIESEL FUEL. THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE

WORLDS SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL, AND THEIR PRODUCTION

LEVELS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY.

DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS

LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL

ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO

OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. SEASONALITY

IS NOT A PRIMARY DRIVER OF CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

QUARTERLY EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON

COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR GLOBAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES,

AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES, FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS LEASES AND OTHER

PROPERTIES AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR REQUIRED TO DEVELOP

AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS,

CHEVRON ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM

COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION ENTITIES AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES IN THE

SALE OR ACQUISITION OF VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY

NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

CHEVRONS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE STOCKHOLDER VALUE

AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINED FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM ITS OPERATIONS THAT

WILL ENABLE IT TO OUTPERFORM ITS COMPETITORS. IN THE UPSTREAM,

THE COMPANYS STRATEGIES ARE TO GROW PROFITABLY IN CORE

AREAS, BUILD NEW LEGACY POSITIONS AND COMMERCIALIZE THE

COMPANYS EQUITY NATURAL-GAS RESOURCE BASE WHILE GROWING A

HIGH-IMPACT GLOBAL GAS BUSINESS. IN THE DOWNSTREAM, THE

STRATEGIES ARE TO IMPROVE RETURNS AND SELECTIVELY GROW, WITH A

FOCUS ON INTEGRATED VALUE CREATION. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES

TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, WITH AN OBJECTIVE OF

CAPTURING PROFITABLE POSITIONS.

(B)

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY

AND ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY,

WITH OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA,

THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA AND AUSTRALIA. TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES, EARNINGS AND INCOME TAXES

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND ASSETS AS

OF THE END OF 2009 AND 2008  FOR THE UNITED STATES

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2009 WERE $22.2 BILLION, INCLUDING

$1.6 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

EQUITY-AFFILIATE EXPENDITURES. IN 2008 AND 2007, EXPENDITURES

WERE $22.8 BILLION AND $20 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES

EXPENDITURES OF $2.3 BILLION IN BOTH PERIODS.

OF THE $22.2 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2009, ABOUT

THREE-FOURTHS, OR $17.1 BILLION, WAS RELATED TO UPSTREAM

ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED

FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2008 AND 2007. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN 2009 AND ABOUT 70 PERCENT IN 2008 AND 2007,

REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES

AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2010, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE $21.6 BILLION, INCLUDING

$1.6 BILLION OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. ABOUT

80 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, OR $17.3 BILLION, IS BUDGETED

FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH

$13.2 BILLION OF THAT AMOUNT FOR PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION, INCLUDING VOLUMES FROM OIL

SANDS (REFER TO FOOTNOTE 2 ABOVE), WAS 2.7 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY, UP ABOUT 7 PERCENT FROM 2008. THE INCREASE WAS

MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

START-UP

OF

THE BLIND FAITH AND TAHITI FIELDS IN THE U.S. GULF OF

MEXICO IN LATE 2008 AND THE SECOND QUARTER 2009, RESPECTIVELY,

THE COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2008 AT THE

KAZAKHSTAN. REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SECTION BEGINNING ON

FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE

2007-2009

CHANGES IN PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, AND

NATURAL GAS.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS AVERAGE WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN 2010 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 2.73 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES,

INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE PRICE EFFECT

ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND

FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS,

DURING 2009, THE AVERAGE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FROM CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN AUSTRALIA WAS 108,000 BARRELS PER DAY, COMPOSED OF 35,000 BARRELS OF LIQUIDS AND 434 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS.

CHEVRON HAS A 16.7 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST IN THE NORTH WEST SHELF (NWS) VENTURE OFFSHORE WESTERN AUSTRALIA. DAILY NET PRODUCTION FROM THE PROJECT DURING 2009 AVERAGED 26,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND CONDENSATE, 433 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS, AND 5,000 BARRELS OF LPG. APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT OF THE NATURAL GAS WAS SOLD IN THE FORM OF LNG TO MAJOR UTILITIES IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA, PRIMARILY UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACTS. THE REMAINING NATURAL GAS WAS SOLD TO THE WESTERN AUSTRALIA DOMESTIC MARKET.

THE NWS VENTURE CONTINUES TO PROGRESS TWO MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT ACHIEVED FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION IN 2008. FABRICATION OF PLATFORM TOPSIDES FOR THE NORTH RANKIN 2 PROJECT COMMENCED IN JUNE 2009. THE PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO RECOVER REMAINING LOW-PRESSURE NATURAL GAS FROM THE NORTH RANKIN AND PERSEUS NATURAL-GAS FIELDS TO MEET GAS SUPPLY NEEDS AND INCLUDES NECESSARY TIE-INS TO, AND REFURBISHMENT OF, THE NORTH RANKIN A PLATFORM. UPON COMPLETION, BOTH PLATFORMS ARE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESIGNED TO BE OPERATED AS A SINGLE INTEGRATED FACILITY. THE

PROJECT IS SCHEDULED TO START PRODUCTION IN 2013. PROVED

RESERVES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THE PROJECT.

THE NWS VENTURE IS ALSO ADVANCING PLANS TO EXTEND THE PERIOD OF

CRUDE-OIL PRODUCTION. THE NWS OIL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT IS

DESIGNED TO REPLACE THE PRESENT FLOATING PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND

OFFLOADING VESSEL AND A PORTION OF EXISTING SUBSEA

INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SERVICES PRODUCTION FROM THE COSSACK,

HERMES, LAMBERT AND WANAEA OFFSHORE FIELDS. IN 2009, WORK

COMMENCED ON CONVERSION OF THE REPLACEMENT VESSEL. THE PROJECT

IS EXPECTED TO

START-UP

IN

EARLY 2011 AND EXTEND PRODUCTION PAST 2020. THE CONCESSION FOR

THE NWS VENTURE EXPIRES IN 2034.

ON BARROW AND THEVENARD ISLANDS OFF THE NORTHWEST COAST OF

AUSTRALIA, CHEVRON OPERATES CRUDE-OIL PRODUCING FACILITIES THAT

HAD COMBINED NET PRODUCTION OF 4,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN

2009. CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN THESE OPERATIONS ARE

57.1 PERCENT FOR BARROW AND 51.4 PERCENT FOR THEVENARD.

SIGNIFICANT EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE LARGE NATURAL-GAS RESOURCE

OF THE GREATER GORGON AREA. THE COMPANY INITIALLY HELD A

50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA AND

IS THE OPERATOR OF THE GORGON PROJECT. CHEVRON AND ITS

JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE PROCEEDING WITH THE COMBINED

DEVELOPMENT OF GORGON AND NEARBY NATURAL-GAS FIELDS AS ONE

LARGE-SCALE PROJECT. ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVAL FROM THE AUSTRALIAN

COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT WAS ISSUED IN AUGUST 2009. IN SEPTEMBER

2009, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION AND

TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS FOR THE FIRST PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT

OF $37 BILLION (AU$ 43 BILLION). THE

PROJECTS SCOPE INCLUDES A THREE-TRAIN,

15 MILLION-METRIC-TON-PER-YEAR LNG FACILITY; A CARBON

SEQUESTRATION PROJECT; AND A DOMESTIC NATURAL-GAS PLANT. NATURAL

GAS FOR THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO BE SUPPLIED FROM THE GORGON

AND IO/JANSZ FIELDS.

IN 2009, LONG-TERM, BINDING AGREEMENTS WERE FINALIZED WITH FOUR

ASIAN CUSTOMERS FOR THE DELIVERY OF ABOUT 4.4 MILLION

METRIC TONS PER YEAR OF LNG FROM THE GORGON PROJECT. EQUITY

SALES AGREEMENTS WITH THREE OF THE CUSTOMERS REDUCED

CHEVRONS INTEREST IN THE PROJECT TO 47.3 PERCENT AT

THE END OF 2009. NONBINDING HEADS OF AGREEMENTS (HOA) FOR

DELIVERY OF AN ADDITIONAL 2.1 MILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR

OF LNG WERE ALSO SIGNED WITH THREE ADDITIONAL ASIAN CUSTOMERS IN

2009 AND EARLY 2010. NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE TO FINALIZE BINDING

SALES AGREEMENTS, WHICH WOULD BRING LNG DELIVERY COMMITMENTS TO

A COMBINED TOTAL OF ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF CHEVRONS

SHARE OF LNG FROM THE PROJECT. DURING 2009, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED PROVED RESERVES FOR THE GREATER GORGON AREA FIELDS

INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT. FIRST PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS FROM

THESE FIELDS IS EXPECTED IN 2014. THE PROJECTS ESTIMATED

ECONOMIC LIFE EXCEEDS 40 YEARS FROM THE TIME OF

START-UP.

CHEVRONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE

$603 MILLION, $702 MILLION AND $510 MILLION FOR

THE YEARS 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES IN THE AREAS DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS

PROCESSES, AND ULTIMATE TECHNICAL OR COMMERCIAL SUCCESSES ARE

NOT CERTAIN. THE COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA

IS NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND TO

SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND

REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS OPERATIONS ARE, OR ARE EXPECTED TO

BECOME, EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS.

IN 2009, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $887 MILLION, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES.

THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO

RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

NEW

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR- AND

WATER-QUALITY PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS

REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING

FACILITIES. FOR 2010, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $831 MILLION. THE FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS

ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

CHEVRON EXPECTS AN INCREASE IN ENVIRONMENT-RELATED REGULATIONS,

INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, IN THE

COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS OPERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, UNDER

CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT ENACTED IN 2006,

THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD (CARB), CHARGED WITH

IMPLEMENTING THE LAW, HAS ADOPTED A NEW LOW-CARBON FUEL STANDARD

INTENDED TO REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS,

WHICH IS EXPECTED TO APPLY BEGINNING IN 2011. ADDITIONALLY, CARB

IS EXPECTED TO PROPOSE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CAP

AND TRADE EMISSIONS REGULATION PROVISIONS OF THE LAW, FOR

ADOPTION IN THE SECOND HALF 2010. THE EFFECT OF ANY SUCH

REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS UNCERTAIN.

RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL,

WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

GEOPOLITICAL RISK.

DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF HISTORICALLY LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM EARNINGS AND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. THE IMPACT ON

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED-PRODUCT

SALES.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION OR THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING

AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE,

DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO

BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION

ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION

OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER

FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL

EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, EXPLOSIONS AND SYSTEM FAILURES, ANY

OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO

PEOPLE OR THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS FROM LITIGATION

OR GOVERNMENT ACTION.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. OFTEN THESE

OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES OVER WHICH THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY ARISING FROM PRIVATE

LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENT ACTION, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT SOCIETAL

PRESSURES OR POLITICAL OR OTHER FACTORS ARE INVOLVED, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE IMPOSED WITHOUT REGARD TO

THE COMPANYS CAUSATION OF OR CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASSERTED

DAMAGE OR TO OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL

TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, 26 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING

ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE

BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. TWENTY-TWO PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE

LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

CONTINUED POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING CLIMATE

CHANGE, THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT AND POTENTIAL

MITIGATION THROUGH REGULATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION

AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS ARE

CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. FOR

INSTANCE, THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, AUSTRALIAS PROPOSED

LEGISLATION AND CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT,

ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUAL OR PENDING FEDERAL, STATE AND PROVINCIAL

REGULATIONS, ENVISION A REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

THROUGH MARKET-BASED REGULATORY PROGRAMS, TECHNOLOGY-BASED OR

PERFORMANCE-BASED STANDARDS OR A COMBINATION OF THEM. THE

COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO EXISTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS

IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE SUCH REGULATION IS CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE,

INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NEW ZEALAND.

IN DECEMBER 2009, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) ISSUED A FINAL ENDANGERMENT FINDING FOR GREENHOUSE GASES,

WHICH SPECIFICALLY FOUND THAT EMISSIONS OF SIX GREENHOUSE GASES

THREATEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE AND THAT GREENHOUSE GASES

FROM NEW MOTOR VEHICLES AND ENGINES ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH

POLLUTION. THESE FINDINGS DO NOT THEMSELVES IMPOSE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, THE AGENCY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF

PROMULGATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS FOR LIGHT-DUTY

VEHICLES AND REGULATIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN STATIONARY

SOURCE FACILITIES THAT EXCEED AN AS-YET UNDETERMINED THRESHOLD

TO OBTAIN PERMITS IN ADVANCE, WHICH PERMITS COULD REQUIRE

IMPLEMENTATION OF SO-CALLED BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL

TECHNOLOGIES. IN JUNE 2009, THE U.S. HOUSE OF

REPRESENTATIVES APPROVED THE AMERICAN CLEAN ENERGY AND SECURITY

ACT. THIS IS KNOWN AS THE WAXMAN-MARKEY BILL, WHICH INCLUDES

PROVISIONS FOR A

CAP-AND-TRADE

PROGRAM, AIMED AT CONTROLLING AND REDUCING EMISSIONS OF

GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE UNITED STATES. AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHETHER OR WHEN THE U.S. SENATE MAY ACT

ON CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, HOW ANY BILL APPROVED BY THE

SENATE WILL BE RECONCILED WITH THE WAXMAN-MARKEY LEGISLATION OR

WHETHER ANY FEDERAL LEGISLATION WILL SUPERSEDE THE EPAS

REGULATORY ACTIONS.

THESE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS-RELATED LAWS, POLICIES

AND REGULATIONS, MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE,

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS UNCERTAIN

AND IS EXPECTED TO VARY BY JURISDICTION DEPENDING ON THE LAWS

ENACTED IN EACH JURISDICTION, THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES IN

IT AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS MINERALS SUCH AS COAL; THE UPGRADING OF PRODUCTION FROM

OIL SANDS INTO SYNTHETIC OIL; POWER GENERATION; THE CONVERSION

OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INTO REFINED PRODUCTS; THE

PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION AND REGASIFICATION OF NATURAL GAS; THE

TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS

AND CONSUMERS OR CUSTOMERS USE OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS RESULT IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT COULD WELL BE

REGULATED. SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CONSUMERS AND

CUSTOMERS USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS

ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS IN RESPONSE TO

SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL.

THE EFFECT OF REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, THE SECTORS COVERED, THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON WOULD BE

ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS OR NEED TO

PURCHASE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH

AUCTIONS, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF EMISSION ALLOWANCES AND

CREDITS, AND THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR OTHER REGULATION ON

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER THE COSTS INCURRED THROUGH

THE PRICING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. MATERIAL PRICE

INCREASES OR INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE OR USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY

SOURCES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

SELLS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS SALES VOLUMES,

REVENUES AND MARGINS.

CHANGES

IN MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD.

IN PREPARING THE COMPANYS PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INCLUDING ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, CHEVRONS MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER

APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS AS OF A SPECIFIED DATE. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

EXPERIENCE AS OF THAT DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK

AND UNCERTAINTY. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

AREAS REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BY

MANAGEMENT INCLUDE MEASUREMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS; ESTIMATES OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RECOVERABLE RESERVES; ACCRUALS FOR

ESTIMATED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVES; AND

IMPAIRMENTS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. CHANGES IN

ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE INFORMATION UNDERLYING THE

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

PLANS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES,

COULD AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR EXPENSES.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT

BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO, ECUADOR,

BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE

REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL

PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT

ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL

1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO

INC., WAS A MINORITY MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH

PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, AS THE

MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED

SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND

FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE

CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE

SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO

TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO

THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION

PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40 MILLION. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE

SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET

AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND

ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM

OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS

LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER

CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT BE APPLIED

RETROACTIVELY; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE

OF LIMITATIONS IN ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO

BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO TEXPET

BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR. WITH REGARD TO THE

FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT

TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE

REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS

FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND

PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL

OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO

IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO

SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT

RECOMMENDING THAT THE COURT ASSESS $8 BILLION, WHICH WOULD,

ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR

PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR,

AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE

SYSTEMS, AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PETROECUADOR. THE

ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL

$8.3 BILLION COULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST

ENRICHMENT. THE ENGINEERS REPORT IS NOT BINDING ON THE

COURT. CHEVRON ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE ENGINEERS WORK WAS

PERFORMED AND HIS REPORT PREPARED IN A MANNER CONTRARY TO LAW

AND IN VIOLATION OF THE COURTS ORDERS. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A

REBUTTAL TO THE REPORT IN WHICH IT ASKED THE COURT TO STRIKE THE

REPORT IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE ENGINEER REVISED

THE REPORT AND, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE, RECOMMENDED AN

INCREASE IN THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES TO

A TOTAL OF $18.9 BILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENT

FOR PURPORTED UNJUST ENRICHMENT TO A TOTAL OF $8.4 BILLION.

CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REVISED REPORT, WHICH THE

COURT DISMISSED. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY

CHEVRON OF EVIDENCE THAT THE JUDGE PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN

WHICH BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY

OUTCOME

,

THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE CASE PETITIONED TO

BE RECUSED. IN LATE SEPTEMBER 2009, THE JUDGE WAS RECUSED, AND

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FULL CHAMBER OF THE PROVINCIAL COURT

AFFIRMED THE RECUSAL, RESULTING IN THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW

JUDGE. CHEVRON FILED MOTIONS TO ANNUL ALL OF THE RULINGS MADE BY

THE PRIOR JUDGE, BUT THE NEW JUDGE DENIED THESE MOTIONS. THE

COURT HAS COMPLETED MOST OF THE PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE

AND COULD RENDER A JUDGMENT AT ANY TIME. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A

VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY.

IN THE EVENT OF AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT, CHEVRON WOULD EXPECT TO

PURSUE ITS APPEALS AND VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST ENFORCEMENT OF

ANY SUCH JUDGMENT; THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME 

AND ANY FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON  REMAINS

UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A

REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN

THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ENGINEERS REPORT, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE REPORT

HAS ANY UTILITY IN CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A

RANGE OF LOSS). MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT

SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO

ESTIMATE A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD (CARB)

PROPOSED A CIVIL PENALTY AGAINST THE COMPANYS SACRAMENTO,

CALIFORNIA, TERMINAL FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS BETWEEN AUGUST AND

DECEMBER 2007 OF CARBS REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE MINIMUM

CONCENTRATION OF ADDITIVES IN GASOLINE. DUE TO A COMPUTER

PROGRAMMING ERROR, THE SACRAMENTO TERMINALS AUTOMATIC

DISPENSERS HAD FAILED TO INJECT ADDITIVE DETERGENT INTO A

GASOLINE LINE.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, CARB PROPOSED A CIVIL PENALTY AGAINST THE

COMPANYS RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA, REFINERY FOR A NOTICE OF

VIOLATION RELATING TO GASOLINE THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY CERTIFIED

AS TO COMPOSITION. THE COMPANY CORRECTED THE COMPOSITION

CERTIFICATES FOR THE GASOLINE WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY CHANGE TO

THE COMPOSITION OF THE GASOLINE. IN JULY 2009, CARB ISSUED THE

REFINERY A NOTICE OF VIOLATION RELATING TO AN ERROR IN GASOLINE

BLENDING THAT CAUSED THE PRODUCT COMPOSITION CERTIFICATIONS TO

BE IN ERROR. THE COMPOSITION CERTIFICATIONS WERE CORRECTED

WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY CHANGE TO THE GASOLINE. DISCUSSIONS WITH

CARB OFFICIALS RELATING TO ALL OF THESE MATTERS TOOK PLACE IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009 AND CONTINUE IN 2010.

IN JULY 2009, THE HAWAII DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH)

ALLEGED THAT CHEVRON IS OBLIGATED TO PAY STIPULATED CIVIL

PENALTIES EXCEEDING $100,000 IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMMITMENTS THE

COMPANY UNDERTOOK TO INSTALL AND OPERATE CERTAIN AIR POLLUTION

ABATEMENT EQUIPMENT AT ITS HAWAII REFINERY PURSUANT TO CLEAN AIR

ACT SETTLEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY AND DOH. THE COMPANY HAS DISPUTED MANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS.

FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING

COUNTRIES: ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, AZERBAIJAN, BANGLADESH, BRAZIL, CAMBODIA, CANADA, CHAD,

CHINA, COLOMBIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, DENMARK, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN, MYANMAR, THE

NETHERLANDS, NIGERIA, NORWAY, THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, THE

PHILIPPINES, REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, SINGAPORE, SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTH KOREA, THAILAND, TRINIDAD AND

TOBAGO, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE UNITED STATES, VENEZUELA AND VIETNAM.

EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY DEPEND LARGELY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM (EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION) AND DOWNSTREAM (REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION) BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE

BIGGEST FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOTH SEGMENTS IS MOVEMENT IN THE

PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. IN THE DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE LARGEST COST COMPONENT OF REFINED

PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL TREND IN EARNINGS IS TYPICALLY LESS AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS

CHEMICALS BUSINESS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS. EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANY IN ANY PERIOD MAY

ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL IN NATURE.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY UPSTREAM, CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC,

REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE

UNITED STATES. CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND THE

COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS

HAVE AT TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY

CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES.

TO SUSTAIN ITS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MUST

DEVELOP AND REPLENISH AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS THAT OFFER ATTRACTIVE FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR THE

INVESTMENT REQUIRED. IDENTIFYING PROMISING AREAS FOR EXPLORATION, ACQUIRING THE NECESSARY RIGHTS TO

EXPLORE FOR AND TO PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, DRILLING SUCCESSFULLY, AND HANDLING THE MANY

TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS IN A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER ARE ALL IMPORTANT FACTORS IN

THIS EFFORT. PROJECTS OFTEN REQUIRE LONG LEAD TIMES AND LARGE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. FROM TIME TO

TIME, CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS HAVE SOUGHT TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACTS OR IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE

COMPANY. GOVERNMENTS MAY ATTEMPT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE

DEVELOPMENTS, TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHERWISE

SEEK TO MITIGATE ANY RISKS TO THE COMPANYS CURRENT OPERATIONS OR FUTURE PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE OR TO ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO

ITS ASSET BASE TO HELP AUGMENT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH. REFER TO THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON FS-6 FOR DISCUSSIONS OF NET GAINS ON ASSET SALES

DURING 2009. ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES.

IN RECENT YEARS, CHEVRON AND THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AT LARGE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN

CERTAIN COSTS THAT EXCEEDED THE GENERAL TREND OF INFLATION IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD. THIS

INCREASE IN COSTS AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATING EXPENSES AND CAPITAL PROGRAMS FOR ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR UPSTREAM. SOFTENING OF THESE COST PRESSURES STARTED IN LATE 2008 AND

CONTINUED THROUGH MOST OF 2009. COSTS BEGAN TO LEVEL OUT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE ITS SCHEDULE OF WORK,

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTRACTING, PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY-CHAIN ACTIVITIES TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE COSTS. (REFER TO THE

UPSTREAM SECTION BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE TREND IN CRUDE-OIL PRICES.)

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO CLOSELY MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, THE

LEVEL OF WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE IMPLICATIONS TO THE COMPANY OF MOVEMENTS IN PRICES FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. MANAGEMENT IS TAKING THESE DEVELOPMENTS INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CONDUCT OF

DAILY OPERATIONS AND FOR BUSINESS PLANNING. THE COMPANY REMAINS CONFIDENT OF ITS UNDERLYING

FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL CHALLENGES PRESENTED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. (REFER ALSO TO

THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SECTION BEGINNING ON FS-11.)

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS

FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL

FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL

PRICES, AND REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS OR FEARS THEREOF THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY

CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. MOREOVER, ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY

IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS, AND ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE RISKS IN

OPERATING ITS FACILITIES AND BUSINESSES. BESIDES THE IMPACT OF THE FLUCTUATION IN PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS, THE LONGER-TERM TREND IN EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ALSO A FUNCTION

OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OF CONTRACTS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL. EXTERNAL FACTORS

INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION BUT ALSO COMMODITY PRICES AND PRICES CHARGED BY THE

INDUSTRYS MATERIAL AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE

INDUSTRYS OWN SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH MATERIALS AND SERVICES. CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO CAN BE AFFECTED BY DAMAGE TO PRODUCTION

FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST.

THE CHART AT LEFT SHOWS THE TREND IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE

OIL AND U.S. HENRY HUB NATURAL GAS. INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL CONTINUED TO BE VOLATILE

DURING 2009, WITH PRICES FOR WTI RANGING FROM $34 TO $81 PER BARREL. THE WTI PRICE AVERAGED $62 PER

BARREL FOR THE FULL-YEAR 2009, COMPARED TO $100 IN 2008. THE DECLINE IN PRICES FROM 2008 WAS

LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAKENING IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND A REDUCTION IN THE DEMAND FOR

CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2010, THE WTI PRICE WAS ABOUT $77.

A DIFFERENTIAL IN CRUDE-OIL PRICES EXISTS BETWEEN HIGH-QUALITY (HIGH-GRAVITY, LOW-SULFUR)

CRUDES AND THOSE OF LOWER-QUALITY

(LOW-GRAVITY, HIGH-SULFUR). THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL IN ANY

PERIOD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLY OF HEAVY CRUDE AVAILABLE VERSUS THE DEMAND THAT IS A FUNCTION

OF THE NUMBER OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PROCESS THIS LOWER-QUALITY FEEDSTOCK INTO LIGHT

PRODUCTS

(MOTOR GASOLINE, JET FUEL, AVIATION GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL). THE DIFFERENTIAL REMAINED

NARROW THROUGH 2009 AS PRODUCTION DECLINES IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN MAINLY FOR LOWER-QUALITY

CRUDES.

CHEVRON PRODUCES OR SHARES IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN CALIFORNIA, CHAD,

INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, VENEZUELA AND IN CERTAIN FIELDS IN

ANGOLA, CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SECTOR OF THE NORTH SEA. (SEE PAGE FS-10 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

CRUDE-OIL REALIZATIONS.)

IN CONTRAST TO PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL

GAS IN MANY REGIONAL MARKETS ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS IN THOSE

MARKETS. IN THE UNITED STATES, PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED ABOUT $3.80 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET

(MCF) DURING 2009, COMPARED WITH ALMOST $9 DURING 2008. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND AS OF

MID-FEBRUARY 2010, THE HENRY HUB SPOT PRICE WAS ABOUT $5.70 AND $5.50 PER MCF, RESPECTIVELY.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER

DEMAND RELATIVE TO THE VOLUMES PRODUCED IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN UNDERGROUND

STORAGE. WEAKER U.S. DEMAND IN 2009 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN.

CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL NATURAL-GAS MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE DIFFERENT SUPPLY,

DEMAND AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER AVERAGE SALES PRICES

FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS IN THESE LOCATIONS. CHEVRON CONTINUES TO INVEST IN

LONG-TERM PROJECTS IN THESE LOCATIONS TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS

FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER TO OTHER MARKETS WHERE GREATER DEMAND RESULTS IN HIGHER PRICES.

INTERNATIONAL NATURAL-GAS REALIZATIONS AVERAGED ABOUT $4.00 PER MCF DURING 2009, COMPARED WITH

ABOUT $5.20 PER MCF DURING 2008. UNLIKE PRIOR YEARS, THESE REALIZATIONS COMPARED FAVORABLY WITH

THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES DURING 2009, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DETERIORATION OF U.S.

SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS RESULTING FROM THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN. (SEE PAGE FS-10 FOR THE

COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.)

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2009 AVERAGED 2.70 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY. ABOUT ONE-FIFTH OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2009 OCCURRED IN THE

OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI

ARABIA AND KUWAIT. FOR THE YEAR 2009, THE COMPANYS NET OIL PRODUCTION WAS REDUCED BY AN AVERAGE OF

20,000 BARRELS PER DAY DUE TO QUOTAS IMPOSED BY OPEC. ALL OF THE IMPOSED CURTAILMENTS TOOK PLACE

DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. AT THE DECEMBER 2009 MEETING, MEMBERS OF OPEC SUPPORTED

MAINTAINING PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN EFFECT SINCE DECEMBER 2008.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2010 WILL AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 2.73

MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

ADDITIONAL QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER

COST-RECOVERY AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY

PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR

RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS, DELAYS IN PROJECT STARTUPS, FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND

FOR NATURAL GAS IN VARIOUS MARKETS, WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY SHUT IN PRODUCTION, CIVIL UNREST,

CHANGING

GEOPOLITICS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IS ALSO

AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE

PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. INVESTMENTS IN

UPSTREAM PROJECTS GENERALLY BEGIN WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED CRUDE-OIL AND

NATURAL-GAS PRODUCTION. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF CHEVRONS UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IS MADE OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGES FS-6 THROUGH FS-7 FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM BUSINESS.

REFER TO TABLE V BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-69 FOR A TABULATION OF THE COMPANYS PROVED NET OIL AND

GAS RESERVES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AT THE BEGINNING OF 2007 AND EACH YEAR-END FROM 2007 THROUGH 2009,

AND AN ACCOMPANYING DISCUSSION OF MAJOR CHANGES TO PROVED RESERVES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO MARGINS ON THE REFINING AND

MARKETING OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE GASOLINE, DIESEL, JET FUEL, LUBRICANTS, FUEL OIL AND FEEDSTOCKS

FOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING. INDUSTRY MARGINS ARE SOMETIMES VOLATILE AND CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE

GLOBAL AND REGIONAL

SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND BALANCE FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF

CRUDE OIL USED FOR REFINERY FEEDSTOCK. INDUSTRY MARGINS CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY REFINED-PRODUCT

INVENTORY LEVELS, GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, COST OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES, REFINERY MAINTENANCE

PROGRAMS AND DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES RESULTING FROM UNPLANNED OUTAGES DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER,

FIRES OR OTHER OPERATIONAL EVENTS.

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY FOR DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY AND

EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING NETWORK AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CRUDE-OIL

AND PRODUCT-SUPPLY FUNCTIONS. PROFITABILITY CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF

TANKER-CHARTER RATES FOR THE COMPANYS SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRYS

DEMAND FOR CRUDE-OIL AND PRODUCT TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL INCLUDE THE

GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE COMPANYS REFINERY AND DISTRIBUTION

NETWORK.

THE COMPANYS MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE U.S.

GULF COAST, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA, SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. CHEVRON OPERATES OR HAS

SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REFINERIES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS EXCEPT LATIN AMERICA. THE

COMPANY COMPLETED SALES OF MARKETING BUSINESSES DURING 2009 IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA

AND AFRICA. THE COMPANY PLANS TO DISCONTINUE, BY MID-2010, SALES OF CHEVRON- AND TEXACO-BRANDED MOTOR FUELS IN

THE MID-ATLANTIC AND OTHER EASTERN STATES, WHERE THE COMPANY SOLD TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS

THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 1,100 STATIONS AND TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS THROUGH SUPPLY

ARRANGEMENTS. SALES IN THESE MARKETS

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL U.S. RETAIL FUEL SALES VOLUMES. ADDITIONALLY, IN

JANUARY 2010, THE COMPANY SOLD THE RIGHTS TO THE GULF TRADEMARK IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS

TERRITORIES THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY LICENSED FOR USE IN THE U.S. NORTHEAST AND PUERTO RICO.

THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS IN 2009 WERE GENERALLY WEAK DUE TO

CHALLENGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING A SHARP DROP IN GLOBAL DEMAND REFLECTING THE ECONOMIC

SLOWDOWN, EXCESS REFINED-PRODUCT SUPPLIES AND SURPLUS REFINING CAPACITY. GIVEN THESE CONDITIONS, IN

JANUARY 2010 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED TO ITS EMPLOYEES THAT HIGH-LEVEL EVALUATIONS OF CHEVRONS

REFINING AND MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS HAD BEEN COMPLETED. THESE EVALUATIONS CONCLUDED THAT THE

COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE RESTRUCTURED TO IMPROVE OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND

ACHIEVE SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. DETAILS OF THE RESTRUCTURING WILL BE

FURTHER DEVELOPED OVER THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS AND MAY INCLUDE EXITS FROM ADDITIONAL MARKETS,

DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS, REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND OTHER ACTIONS, WHICH MAY RESULT

IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGES FS-7 AND FS-8 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

OF THE COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS IN THE PETROCHEMICALS BUSINESS ARE CLOSELY TIED TO GLOBAL CHEMICAL DEMAND,

INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS AND PLANT CAPACITY UTILIZATION. FEEDSTOCK AND FUEL COSTS, WHICH TEND TO

FOLLOW CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS PRICE MOVEMENTS, ALSO INFLUENCE EARNINGS IN THIS SEGMENT.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGE FS-8 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF

CHEMICAL EARNINGS.

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

KEY OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER EVENTS DURING 2009 AND EARLY 2010 INCLUDED THE

FOLLOWING.

UPSTREAM

ANGOLA

PRODUCTION BEGAN AT THE 39.2 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED MAFUMEIRA NORTE OFFSHORE

PROJECT IN BLOCK 0 AND THE

31 PERCENT-OWNED

AND OPERATED DEEPWATER TOMBUA-LANDANA PROJECT IN BLOCK

14. MAFUMEIRA NORTE IS EXPECTED TO REACH MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION OF 42,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE

OIL IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2010, AND THE TOMBUA-LANDANA PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO REACH ITS MAXIMUM

TOTAL PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 100,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER DAY IN 2011. THE COMPANY ALSO

DISCOVERED CRUDE OIL OFFSHORE IN THE 39.2 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED BLOCK 0 CONCESSION, EXTENDING

A TREND OF EARLIER DISCOVERIES IN THE GREATER VANZA/LONGUI AREA.

AUSTRALIA

THE COMPANY AND ITS PARTNERS REACHED FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION TO PROCEED WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE GORGON PROJECT, LOCATED OFFSHORE WESTERN AUSTRALIA, IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS A 47.3

PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED INTEREST AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY FINALIZED

LONG-TERM SALES AGREEMENTS FOR DELIVERY OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) FROM THE GORGON PROJECT WITH

FOUR ASIAN CUSTOMERS, THREE OF WHICH ALSO ACQUIRED AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. NONBINDING

HEADS OF AGREEMENT (HOAS) WITH THREE ADDITIONAL ASIAN CUSTOMERS WERE ALSO SIGNED IN LATE 2009 AND

EARLY 2010 FOR DELIVERY OF LNG FROM THE PROJECT. NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE TO FINALIZE BINDING

SALES AGREEMENTS, WHICH WOULD BRING LNG DELIVERY COMMITMENTS TO A COMBINED TOTAL OF ABOUT 90

PERCENT OF CHEVRONS SHARE OF LNG FROM THE PROJECT.

THE COMPANY AWARDED FRONT-END ENGINEERING AND DESIGN CONTRACTS FOR THE FIRST PHASE OF THE

WHEATSTONE NATURAL GAS PROJECT, ALSO LOCATED OFFSHORE NORTHWEST AUSTRALIA. THE 75

PERCENT-OWNED AND

OPERATED FACILITIES WILL HAVE LNG PROCESSING CAPACITY OF 8.6 MILLION METRIC TONS

PER YEAR AND A

CO-LOCATED DOMESTIC NATURAL-GAS PLANT. THE FACILITIES WILL SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF

CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN THE WHEATSTONE FIELD AND NEARBY IAGO FIELD. AGREEMENTS WERE SIGNED WITH TWO

COMPANIES TO JOIN THE WHEATSTONE PROJECT AS COMBINED 25 PERCENT OWNERS AND SUPPLIERS OF NATURAL GAS

FOR THE PROJECTS FIRST TWO LNG TRAINS. IN ADDITION, NONBINDING HOAS WERE SIGNED WITH TWO ASIAN

CUSTOMERS TO TAKE DELIVERY OF 4.9 MILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR OF LNG FROM THE PROJECT (ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF

THE TOTAL LNG AVAILABLE FROM THE FOUNDATION PROJECT) AND TO ACQUIRE A 16.8 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN THE WHEATSTONE FIELD LICENSES AND A 12.6 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE FOUNDATION NATURAL GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES AT THE FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION.

IN MAY 2009 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE SUCCESSFUL

COMPLETION OF A WELL AT THE CLIO PROSPECT TO

FURTHER EXPLORE AND APPRAISE THE 66.7 PERCENT-OWNED BLOCK WA-205-P. IN 2009 AND EARLY 2010, THE

COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED NATURAL-GAS DISCOVERIES AT THE KENTISH KNOCK PROSPECT IN THE 50

PERCENT-OWNED BLOCK WA-365-P, THE ACHILLES AND SATYR PROSPECTS IN THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED BLOCK

WA-374-P AND THE YELLOWGLEN PROSPECT IN THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED

WA-268-P BLOCK. ALL PROSPECTS ARE

CHEVRON-OPERATED. PROVED RESERVES HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THESE DISCOVERIES.

BRAZIL

PRODUCTION STARTED AT THE 51.7 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED DEEPWATER FRADE FIELD, WHICH

IS PROJECTED TO ATTAIN MAXIMUM TOTAL PRODUCTION OF 72,000 OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS PER DAY IN 2011.

ALSO, IN EARLY 2010 A FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION WAS REACHED TO DEVELOP THE 37.5 PERCENT-OWNED,

PARTNER-OPERATED PAPA-TERRA FIELD, WHERE FIRST PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED IN 2013. PROJECT FACILITIES ARE DESIGNED

WITH A CAPACITY TO HANDLE UP TO 140,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER DAY.

REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

CRUDE OIL WAS DISCOVERED IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE 31.5

PERCENT-OWNED, PARTNER-OPERATED MOHO-BILONDO DEEPWATER PERMIT AREA. THIS DISCOVERY FOLLOWS TWO

OTHERS MADE IN 2007 IN THE SAME PERMIT AREA.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MAJOR OPERATING AREAS

THE FOLLOWING SECTION PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS  UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS  AS WELL AS FOR ALL OTHER, WHICH

INCLUDES MINING, POWER GENERATION BUSINESSES, THE VARIOUS COMPANIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE

MANAGED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL, AND THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY PRIOR TO ITS SALE IN MAY

2007. EARNINGS ARE ALSO PRESENTED FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE UPSTREAM

AND DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS SEGMENTS. (REFER TO NOTE 11, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-40, FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING

EARNINGS

$2,216

$4,532

U.S UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $2.2 BILLION IN 2009 DECREASED $4.9 BILLION FROM 2008. LOWER

PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS REDUCED EARNINGS BY ABOUT $5.2 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS, AND

GAINS ON ASSET SALES DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE EFFECTS WAS

A BENEFIT OF ABOUT $1.3 BILLION RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION. AN

APPROXIMATE $600 MILLION BENEFIT TO INCOME FROM LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY

HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. THE BENEFIT FROM

LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES WAS LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH ABSENCE OF CHARGES FOR DAMAGES RELATED TO

THE 2008 HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

U.S UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $7.1 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED $2.6 BILLION FROM 2007. HIGHER AVERAGE

PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $3.1 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGHER EARNINGS WERE GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION ON ASSET SALES,

INCLUDING A $600 MILLION GAIN ON AN

ASSET-EXCHANGE TRANSACTION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS

WERE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ABOUT $1.6 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER

OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION AND

HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF EXPENSES RESULTING FROM

DAMAGE TO FACILITIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO CAUSED BY HURRICANES.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2009 WAS $54.36 PER

BARREL, COMPARED WITH $88.43 IN 2008 AND $63.16 IN 2007. THE AVERAGE NATURAL-GAS REALIZATION WAS

$3.73 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2009, COMPARED WITH $7.90 AND $6.12 IN 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

FS-6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2009 AVERAGED 717,000 BARRELS PER DAY, UP 6.9 PERCENT FROM

2008 AND DOWN 3.5 PERCENT FROM 2007. THE INCREASE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2009 WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE

START-UP OF THE BLIND FAITH FIELD IN LATE 2008 AND THE TAHITI FIELD IN THE

SECOND QUARTER 2009. THE DECREASE BETWEEN 2007 AND 2008 WAS MAINLY DUE TO NORMAL FIELD

DECLINES AND THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF THE HURRICANES. THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION FOR 2009 AVERAGED 484,000 BARRELS PER DAY, UP APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT FROM 2008 AND 5

PERCENT COMPARED WITH 2007. NET NATURAL-GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 1.4 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN

2009, DOWN APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT FROM 2008 AND ABOUT 18 PERCENT FROM 2007.

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $8.2 BILLION IN 2009 DECREASED $6.4 BILLION FROM 2008.

LOWER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $7.0 BILLION, WHILE FOREIGN-CURRENCY

EFFECTS AND HIGHER OPERATING AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES DECREASED INCOME BY A TOTAL OF $2.2 BILLION.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE ITEMS WERE BENEFITS OF $2.3 BILLION RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN SALES

VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND ABOUT $500 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES AND TAX ITEMS RELATED TO

THE GORGON PROJECT IN AUSTRALIA.

EARNINGS OF $14.6 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED $4.3 BILLION FROM 2007. HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $4.9 BILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER

PRICES WAS AN IMPACT OF ABOUT $1.8 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION OF

CRUDE-OIL SALES VOLUMES

DUE TO TIMING OF CERTAIN CARGO LIFTINGS AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND OPERATING EXPENSES.

FOREIGN-CURRENCY EFFECTS BENEFITED EARNINGS BY $873 MILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH A REDUCTION TO

EARNINGS OF $417 MILLION IN 2007.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2009 WAS $55.97 PER

BARREL, COMPARED WITH $86.51 IN 2008 AND $65.01 IN 2007. THE AVERAGE NATURAL-GAS REALIZATION WAS

$4.01 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2009, COMPARED WITH $5.19 AND $3.90 IN 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF 1.99 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2009 INCREASED ABOUT 7

PERCENT AND 6 PERCENT FROM 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE VOLUMES FOR EACH YEAR INCLUDED

PRODUCTION FROM OIL SANDS IN CANADA. ABSENT THE IMPACT OF PRICES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTION-SHARING AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY AGREEMENTS, NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION INCREASED 4 PERCENT IN 2009 AND 3

PERCENT IN 2008, WHEN COMPARED WITH PRIOR YEARS PRODUCTION.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS 1.4 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN

2009, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT FROM 2008 AND 5 PERCENT FROM

2007. NET NATURAL-GAS PRODUCTION OF 3.6 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2009 WAS DOWN 1 PERCENT AND

U.S DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS LOST $273 MILLION IN 2009, AN EARNINGS DECREASE OF

A NEGATIVE EARNINGS VARIANCE OF $1.7 BILLION.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING WERE LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH BENEFITED

EARNINGS BY $300 MILLION. EARNINGS OF $1.4 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED ABOUT $400 MILLION FROM 2007

DUE MAINLY TO IMPROVED

MARGINS ON

THE SALE OF REFINED PRODUCTS AND GAINS ON DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS. OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE HIGHER BETWEEN 2007 AND 2008.

SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED PRODUCTS WERE 1.40 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2009, A DECREASE OF 1

PERCENT FROM 2008. THE DECLINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED DEMAND FOR JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL,

PRINCIPALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOWNTURN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY. SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED PRODUCTS

WERE 1.41 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2008, A DECREASE OF 3 PERCENT FROM 2007. BRANDED GASOLINE

SALES VOLUMES OF 617,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN 2009 WERE UP ABOUT 3 PERCENT AND DOWN 2 PERCENT FROM

INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $838 MILLION IN 2009 DECREASED ABOUT $1.2 BILLION FROM

2008. AN APPROXIMATE $2.6 BILLION DECLINE BETWEEN PERIODS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH WEAKER MARGINS ON THE

SALE OF GASOLINE AND OTHER REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ABSENCE

OF GAINS RECORDED IN 2008 ON COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. FOREIGN-CURRENCY EFFECTS PRODUCED A

NEGATIVE VARIANCE OF $400 MILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE ITEMS WAS A $1.0 BILLION BENEFIT FROM

LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH CONTRACT LABOR,

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND ABOUT A $550 MILLION INCREASE IN GAINS ON ASSET

SALES PRIMARILY IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICA. EARNINGS IN 2008 OF $2.1 BILLION

DECREASED NEARLY $500 MILLION FROM 2007. EARNINGS IN 2007 INCLUDED GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $1

BILLION ON THE SALE OF ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDED

MARKETING ASSETS IN THE BENELUX REGION OF EUROPE AND AN INTEREST IN A  REFINERY.

THE $500 MILLION OTHER IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN YEARS WAS ASSOCIATED PRIMARILY

WITH A BENEFIT FROM GAINS ON DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS THAT WAS ONLY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

IMPACT OF LOWER MARGINS FROM SALES OF

REFINED PRODUCTS. FOREIGN-CURRENCY

EFFECTS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $193 MILLION IN 2008, COMPARED WITH $62 MILLION IN 2007.

REFINED-PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES WERE 1.85 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2009, ABOUT 8 PERCENT LOWER

THAN IN 2008 DUE MAINLY TO THE EFFECTS OF ASSET SALES AND LOWER DEMAND. REFINED-PRODUCT SALES

VOLUMES WERE 2.02 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2008, ABOUT LEVEL WITH 2007.

FROM 2008 TO 2009 REFLECTED LOWER UTILITY AND MANUFACTURING COSTS AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF AN

IMPAIRMENT RECORDED IN 2008. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER MARGINS ON THE SALE OF COMMODITY CHEMICALS. FOR ORONITE, EARNINGS INCREASED IN 2009 DUE TO

HIGHER MARGINS ON SALES OF LUBRICANT AND FUEL ADDITIVES, THE EFFECT OF WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE

IMPACT OF LOWER SALES VOLUMES. IN 2008, SEGMENT EARNINGS WERE $182 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $396

MILLION IN 2007. EARNINGS DECLINED IN 2008 DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUMES OF COMMODITY CHEMICALS BY

CPCHEM. HIGHER EXPENSES FOR PLANNED MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE EARNINGS

DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DURING 2009 INCLUDED THE NET EFFECT OF A $5 BILLION PUBLIC BOND

ISSUANCE, A $350 MILLION ISSUANCE OF TAX-EXEMPT GULF OPPORTUNITY ZONE BONDS, A $3.2 BILLION

DECREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND A $400 MILLION PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL FOR TEXACO CAPITAL INC. BONDS

THAT MATURED IN JANUARY 2009. THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR,

CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALED $4.6

BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, DOWN FROM $7.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2008. OF THESE AMOUNTS, $4.2 BILLION AND

$5.0 BILLION WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END

2009, SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN

2010, AS THE COMPANY HAD THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES,

TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

AT YEAR-END 2009, THE COMPANY HAD $5.1 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS

MAJOR BANKS, WHICH PERMIT THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE

FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING AND ALSO CAN BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS

UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT INTEREST RATES BASED ON LONDON INTERBANK

OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS

REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE

FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT THAT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2010 FOR AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES

ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO FILE A NEW

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHEN THE CURRENT ONE EXPIRES.

THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING PUBLIC BONDS ISSUED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION,

CHEVRON CORPORATION PROFIT SHARING/ SAVINGS PLAN TRUST FUND, TEXACO CAPITAL INC. AND UNION OIL

COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE THE OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, CHEVRON

CORPORATION AND ARE RATED AA BY STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND AA1 BY MOODYS INVESTORS

SERVICE. THE COMPANYS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND P-1 BY

MOODYS. ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY, INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE

CAPITAL-SPENDING PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS AND

THAT DURING PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR REFINED

PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY CHEMICALS, IT HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE BORROWINGS AND/OR MODIFY

CAPITAL-SPENDING PLANS TO CONTINUE PAYING THE COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE COMPANYS

HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY AUTHORIZED THE ACQUISITION OF

UP TO $15 BILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES AT PREVAILING PRICES, AS PERMITTED BY SECURITIES LAWS AND

OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE PROGRAM IS FOR A

PERIOD OF UP TO THREE YEARS (EXPIRING IN 2010) AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. THE COMPANY

DID NOT ACQUIRE ANY SHARES DURING 2009 AND DOES NOT PLAN TO ACQUIRE ANY SHARES IN THE FIRST

QUARTER 2010. FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED 119 MILLION SHARES AT A

COST OF $10.1 BILLION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2009 WERE $22.2 BILLION,

INCLUDING $1.6 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF EQUITY-AFFILIATE EXPENDITURES AND $2 BILLION FOR

THE EXTENSION OF AN UPSTREAM CONCESSION. IN 2008 AND 2007, EXPENDITURES WERE $22.8 BILLION AND

$20.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF

$2.3

BILLION IN BOTH PERIODS.

OF THE $22.2 BILLION OF EXPENDITURES IN 2009, ABOUT

THREE-FOURTHS, OR $17.1 BILLION, IS

RELATED TO UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED FOR UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS IN 2008 AND 2007. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IN 2009 AND ABOUT

70

PERCENT IN 2008 AND 2007, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IN 2010, CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WILL BE $21.6

BILLION, INCLUDING $1.6 BILLION OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, OR $17.3

BILLION, IS BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $13.2 BILLION OF THIS AMOUNT

FOR PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SPENDING IN 2010 IS PRIMARILY TARGETED FOR EXPLORATORY

PROSPECTS IN THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN ANGOLA, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL,

CANADA, CHINA, NIGERIA, THAILAND AND THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO. ALSO INCLUDED IS FUNDING FOR BASE

BUSINESS IMPROVEMENTS AND FOCUSED APPRAISALS IN CORE HYDROCARBON BASINS.

WORLDWIDE DOWNSTREAM SPENDING IN 2010 IS ESTIMATED AT $3.4 BILLION, WITH ABOUT $1.6 BILLION

FOR PROJECTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. MAJOR CAPITAL OUTLAYS INCLUDE PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT REFINERIES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA AND CONSTRUCTION OF GAS-TO-LIQUIDS FACILITIES IN SUPPORT OF

ASSOCIATED UPSTREAM PROJECTS.

INVESTMENTS IN CHEMICALS, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER CORPORATE BUSINESSES IN 2010 ARE BUDGETED AT

$900 MILLION. TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS INCLUDE PROJECTS RELATED TO UNCONVENTIONAL HYDROCARBON

TECHNOLOGIES, OIL AND GAS RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT, AND GAS-FIRED AND RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAD NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $647 MILLION AND $469

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. DISTRIBUTIONS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

TOTALED $71 MILLION AND $99 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS

IN 2009, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $1.7 BILLION

(INCLUDING $1.5 BILLION TO THE U.S. PLANS AND $200 MILLION TO THE INTERNATIONAL PLANS). THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2010 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION ($600 MILLION FOR THE

U.S. PLANS AND $300 MILLION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PLANS). ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE

DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND

OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE

INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS. REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION OF PENSION

ACCOUNTING IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-18.

THE COMPANYS GUARANTEE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PAYMENTS

UNDER A TERMINAL USE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY A COMPANY AFFILIATE. THE TERMINAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

OPERATIONAL BY 2012. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE

AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY OF ANY

AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON HAS RECORDED NO LIABILITY FOR ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THIS

GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON

AND MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE

INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO

MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300 MILLION. THROUGH THE END OF 2009, THE COMPANY HAD PAID $48 MILLION

UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION

PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGI-

NALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED DURING

THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE ENVIRONMENTAL

CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER

2001. CLAIMS HAD TO BE ASSERTED BY FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND MUST BE ASSERTED

NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE

IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2009, SHELL

DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE COMPANY PURPORTING TO PRESERVE UNMATURED CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN EQUILON

INDEMNITIES. THE LETTER ITSELF PROVIDES NO ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE CLAIM AMOUNT. MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS LETTER OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDES A BASIS TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT,

IF ANY, OF A RANGE OF LOSS OR POTENTIAL RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO EITHER THE EQUILON OR THE

MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER

THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ARE TO BE NET OF

AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY

EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO

CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. THE

ACQUIRER OF THOSE ASSETS SHARED IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM

OBLIGATION OF $200 MILLION, WHICH HAD BEEN REACHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. UNDER THE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT, AFTER REACHING THE $200 MILLION OBLIGATION, CHEVRON IS SOLELY

RESPONSIBLE UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR

EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE ASSETS

IN 1997.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY THAT ARE

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT

THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING

THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE

CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS, UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER

THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE: 2010  $7.5 BILLION; 2011

 $4.3 BILLION; 2012  $1.4

BILLION; 2013  $1.4 BILLION; 2014  $1.0 BILLION; 2015 AND AFTER  $4.1 BILLION. A PORTION

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD.

$4.2 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO REFINANCE IS

INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM DEBT. THE REPAYMENT SCHEDULE ABOVE REFLECTS THE PROJECTED REPAYMENT OF

THE ENTIRE AMOUNTS IN THE 20112012 PERIOD.

4

DOES NOT INCLUDE OBLIGATIONS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS

AND REGASIFIED NATURAL GAS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS OF THE 36.4 PERCENT-OWNED ANGOLA LNG

AFFILIATE. THE LNG PLANT IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN 2012 AND IS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE

5.2 MILLION METRIC TONS OF LNG AND RELATED NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PER YEAR. VOLUMES AND PRICES

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE NEITHER FIXED NOR DETERMINABLE.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS DISCUSSED BELOW. THE ESTIMATES OF FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK DISCUSSED BELOW

DO NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS PROJECTION OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE

MARKET CHANGES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING

THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A, OF THE COMPANYS 2009 ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO THE PRICE

VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS

AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF

ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND

STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY

REFINERIES.

THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF

THESE ACTIVITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

CASH FLOWS IN 2009.

THE COMPANYS MARKET EXPOSURE POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN

INTERNAL RISK CONTROL GROUP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, WHICH HAVE

BEEN APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING

ACTIVITIES CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND ON ELECTRONIC PLATFORMS OF THE INTER-CONTINENTAL EXCHANGE AND CHICAGO MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE. IN ADDITION, CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED-PRODUCT SWAP CONTRACTS AND OPTION

CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS

COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES

REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM PUBLISHED MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER

INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE FROM CHEVRONS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY

INSTRUMENTS IN 2009 WAS A QUARTERLY AVERAGE DECREASE OF $168 MILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS AND A

QUARTERLY AVERAGE DECREASE OF $104 MILLION IN TOTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY USES A VALUE-AT-RISK

(VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON A SINGLE DAY FROM THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE

CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS ON DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS HELD OR ISSUED, WHICH ARE RECORDED

ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES (ASC 815). VAR IS THE MAXIMUM LOSS NOT TO BE EXCEEDED WITHIN A

GIVEN PROBABILITY OR CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANYS VAR MODEL USES THE

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION METHOD THAT INVOLVES GENERATING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS FROM THE SPECIFIED

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION AND CONSTRUCTING A FULL DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTFOLIOS POTENTIAL VALUES.

THE VAR MODEL UTILIZES AN EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE FOR COMPUTING HISTORICAL

VOLATILITIES AND

CORRELATIONS, A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL, AND A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD. THAT IS, THE

COMPANYS 95 PERCENT, ONE-DAY VAR CORRESPONDS TO THE UNREALIZED LOSS IN PORTFOLIO VALUE THAT WOULD

NOT BE EXCEEDED ON AVERAGE MORE THAN ONE IN EVERY 20 TRADING DAYS, IF THE PORTFOLIO WERE HELD

CONSTANT FOR ONE DAY.

THE ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT MARKET-RISK POSITIONS CAN BE

LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED WITHIN ONE DAY. FOR HEDGING AND RISK MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY USES CONVENTIONAL

EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS AS WELL AS NON-EXCHANGE-TRADED SWAPS,

FS-14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOST OF WHICH CAN BE LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED EFFECTIVELY WITHIN ONE DAY. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE

95 PERCENT/ONE-DAY VAR FOR EACH OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY RISK EXPOSURES IN THE AREA OF DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. THE LOWER AMOUNTS IN 2009 WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN PRICE VOLATILITY FOR THESE COMMODITIES DURING THE YEAR.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN-CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO

MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED

PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN-CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS. THE

FOREIGN-CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH

RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. THERE WERE NO OPEN FOREIGN-CURRENCY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS

OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. HISTORICALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS WERE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE

INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS

RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR 

VALUE HEDGES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE

ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT YEAR-END 2009, THE

COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON FLOATING-RATE DEBT. THE COMPANYS ONLY INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON

FIXED-RATE DEBT MATURED IN JANUARY 2009 AND THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON

FIXED-RATE

DEBT AT YEAR-END 2009.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS AND LONG-TERM

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. REFER TO OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN NOTE 24 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, PAGE FS-61, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN

NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY

BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO 50 PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS,

THE MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS. RESOLUTION OF THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE,

INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE

RELATED TO PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN

ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED

STATES.

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN

LAGO AGRIO, ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN

RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT

ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL

HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY

OF TEXACO INC., WAS A MINORITY MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN

STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, AS THE MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED

SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT

THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH

THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO

REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE

OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION PROGRAM AT

A COST OF $40 MILLION. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT

GRANTED TEXPET AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR

FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION

OVER CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT

BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN

ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY

GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE

REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS AND PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING

THAT THE COURT ASSESS $8 BILLION, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL

COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER

ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

PETROECUADOR. THE ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL $8.3 BILLION COULD BE ASSESSED

AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. THE ENGINEERS REPORT IS NOT BINDING ON THE COURT. CHEVRON

ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE ENGINEERS WORK

FS-15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

WAS PERFORMED AND HIS REPORT PREPARED IN A MANNER CONTRARY TO LAW AND IN VIOLATION OF

THE COURTS ORDERS. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REPORT IN WHICH IT ASKED THE COURT TO

STRIKE THE REPORT IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE ENGINEER REVISED THE REPORT AND, WITHOUT

ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE, RECOMMENDED AN INCREASE IN THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES TO

A TOTAL OF $18.9 BILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENT FOR PURPORTED UNJUST ENRICHMENT TO A

TOTAL OF $8.4 BILLION. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REVISED REPORT, WHICH THE COURT

DISMISSED. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY CHEVRON OF EVIDENCE THAT THE JUDGE

PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN WHICH BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY OUTCOME, THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE CASE

PETITIONED TO BE RECUSED. IN LATE SEPTEMBER 2009, THE JUDGE WAS RECUSED, AND IN OCTOBER 2009, THE

FULL CHAMBER OF THE PROVINCIAL COURT AFFIRMED THE RECUSAL, RESULTING IN THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW

JUDGE. CHEVRON FILED MOTIONS TO ANNUL ALL OF THE RULINGS MADE BY THE PRIOR JUDGE, BUT THE NEW JUDGE

DENIED THESE MOTIONS. THE COURT HAS COMPLETED MOST OF THE PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE AND COULD

RENDER A JUDGMENT AT ANY TIME. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION

OF LIABILITY.

IN THE EVENT OF AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT, CHEVRON WOULD EXPECT TO PURSUE ITS APPEALS AND VIGOROUSLY

DEFEND AGAINST ENFORCEMENT OF ANY SUCH JUDGMENT; THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME  AND ANY

FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON  REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A

REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENGINEERS REPORT, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE REPORT HAS ANY UTILITY IN

CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS). MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL

ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE A REASONABLY POSSIBLE

LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO LAWS, REGULATIONS,

PRIVATE CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL

SETTLEMENTS OR THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE

THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING

MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES,

CRUDE-OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS,

WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH

FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD

PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS

THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE

COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY

ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS

TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES

HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO

OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2009 WAS $185 MILLION. THE FEDERAL

SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON TO ASSUME

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT EXPECTED

TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION

OR LIQUIDITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2009 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,515 MILLION, $820 MILLION

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS,

MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), AND PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $695

MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($107 MILLION), UPSTREAM

($369 MILLION), CHEMICALS ($149 MILLION) AND OTHER BUSINESSES ($70 MILLION). LIABILITIES AT ALL

SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS

AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF

CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND

VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF

THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE AND

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2009 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(ASC 410), THE FAIR VALUE OF A

LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THE LIABILITY BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $10.2 BILLION FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END

2009 RELATED PRIMARILY TO UPSTREAM PROPERTIES.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS FACILITIES,

NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS REACH THE

END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS BEEN

MADE, AS THE INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

REFER ALSO TO NOTE 23 ON PAGE FS-60, RELATED TO THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND

THE DISCUSSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ON PAGE FS-18.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED.

REFER TO NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-46 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH TAX RETURNS HAVE

BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR ALL TAX JURISDICTIONS

OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A FINAL

DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS FIELDS. THE

ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITY OR

DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION OF

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AN INCREASE OF $317

MILLION FROM 2008. THE 2008 BALANCE REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $458 MILLION FROM 2007.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED

WITH WELL WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS

TO WHETHER THE WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. THE EFFECT ON

EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE $2.4 BILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END 2009 IS

UNCERTAIN PENDING FUTURE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NORMAL PROJECT EVALUATION AND ADDITIONAL DRILLING.

REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-50, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUSPENDED WELLS.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE

FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS RESERVES.

THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO

EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK HILLS,

CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES.

FOR THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT

APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRON IS

ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS

RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING

PARTNERS; U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND

SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND

TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS

AND MAY CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR

STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY

OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE

EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY

OWNED FACILITIES AND AT

THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION

MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT

NON-CHEVRON

SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE

BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO

FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED

ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT

STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON

ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2009 AT APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION FOR ITS

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1.8 BILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION,

CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR

DIVESTED SITES, AND THE ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR 2010, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $2.1 BILLION.

THESE CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS AND THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR

EXISTING FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE TO.

PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY

WITH EXIST-

ING AND

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY PRIOR RELEASES

OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY

SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER DIFFERENT

REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING

TO THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF

SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE

SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE; AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH

NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

RULES THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER

EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES, WHICH, EFFECTIVE

DECEMBER 31, 2009, REQUIRE ...BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING DATA, (THE RESERVES) CAN BE

ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE...UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS WHERE EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDE PRICES BASED ON THE AVERAGE PRICE DURING THE

FS-18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

12-MONTH PERIOD. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-69,

FOR THE CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND TO TABLE VII,

CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FROM PROVED RESERVES ON

PAGE FS-77 FOR ESTIMATES OF

PROVED-RESERVE VALUES FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32, INCLUDES A

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE

TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-20, INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS

UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES. THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO ESTIMATES,

UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32. THE

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED

CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT

WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE

COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION-PLAN OBLIGATIONS

AND EXPENSE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN

OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE

AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING OPEB OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES.

NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-52, INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AT THE END OF 2009 AND 2008; THE COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE FOR

THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009; AND THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THOSE PERIODS.

PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS OPERATING

EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE YEAR-END 2009 AND 2008 FUNDED STATUS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS AND

OBLIGATIONS, OF EACH OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IS RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET. THE

DIFFERENCES RELATED TO OVERFUNDED PENSION PLANS ARE REPORTED AS A LONG-TERM ASSET IN DEFERRED

CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERFUNDED OR UNFUNDED PENSION AND OPEB

PLANS ARE REPORTED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR RESERVES FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. AMOUNTS YET

TO BE RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF PENSION OR OPEB EXPENSE ARE REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THE COMPANY USES A PROCESS THAT

INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE

AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS

ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 69 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8 PERCENT SINCE 2002. FOR THE 10 YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2009, ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS AVERAGED 3.7 PERCENT FOR THIS PLAN. THE ACTUAL RETURN FOR 2009 WAS 15.7

PERCENT AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROAD RECOVERY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS

OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY

MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET

VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY

FIXED-INCOME

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 5.3

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN AND 5.8 PERCENT FOR ITS OPEB PLAN. THESE

RATES WERE SELECTED BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO

THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF

YEAR-END

2009. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF

2008 AND 2007 WERE 6.3 PERCENT FOR BOTH YEARS FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND OPEB PLANS.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE

PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2009 WAS $1.1 BILLION. AS AN

INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. PENSION

PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2009 BY APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION. A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 61 PERCENT OF

THE

FS-19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2009

BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION.

AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION OBLIGATION, THUS CHANGING THE

FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE TOTAL PENSION LIABILITY ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, FOR UNDERFUNDED PLANS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.8

BILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION, A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S.

PENSION PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION, WHICH WOULD HAVE

DECREASED THE PLANS UNDERFUNDED STATUS FROM APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION TO $1.3 BILLION. OTHER

PLANS WOULD BE LESS UNDERFUNDED AS DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE. THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN

THE WORLDS FINANCIAL MARKETS.

IN 2009, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $1.7 BILLION (INCLUDING $1.5 BILLION TO

THE U.S. PLANS). IN 2010, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION.

ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON

PLAN-INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2009 WAS $164 MILLION AND THE TOTAL LIABILITY,

WHICH REFLECTED THE UNFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AT THE END OF 2009, WAS $3.1 BILLION.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2009, A

1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED

FOR ABOUT 69 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE DECREASED OPEB EXPENSE BY

APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION. A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE SAME PLAN, WHICH

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 84 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE DECREASED TOTAL OPEB

LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2009 BY APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION.

FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS

LIMITED TO 4 PERCENT PER YEAR. FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES UNDER AGE 65 WHOSE CLAIMS

EXPERIENCES ARE COMBINED FOR RATING PURPOSES, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES START WITH 7

PERCENT IN 2010 AND GRADUALLY DROP TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2018 AND BEYOND. AS AN INDICATION OF THE HEALTH

CARE COST-TREND RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE

IN  2009, A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE RATES FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 84 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYWIDE OPEB LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE INCREASED OPEB EXPENSE $8 MILLION.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE EXPENSE AND THE FUNDED STATUS OF

EACH PLAN AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN BENEFIT PLAN COSTS IN THE YEAR THE DIFFERENCE

OCCURS. INSTEAD, THE DIFFERENCES ARE INCLUDED IN ACTUARIAL GAIN/LOSS AND UNAMORTIZED AMOUNTS HAVE

BEEN REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. REFER

TO NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-52, FOR INFORMATION ON THE $6.7 BILLION OF BEFORE-TAX ACTUARIAL

LOSSES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009; A DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD USED TO

AMORTIZE THOSE COSTS; AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EXPENSE DURING 2010.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY

ASSESSES ITS PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND,

FOR CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED

PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF

THE ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL

MARKET SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED

PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

NO MAJOR INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E AND INVESTMENTS WERE RECORDED FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF

OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT

PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN

THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR

ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS, WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN

NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED.

FS-20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS

WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS

DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME.

IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE.

DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES WHETHER ANY

WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN

SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD

OR CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET

REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY

PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE

ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED

OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A

DECISION IS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS. THAT IS, THE ASSETS WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THEY ARE CLASSIFIED

AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, LESS COSTS TO SELL, ARE LESS THAN THE

ASSETS ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS

REQUIRED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR GOODWILL (ASC 350), THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT THE

REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT

BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR

CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY

FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON

CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION,

THE DETERMINATION OF

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS GENERALLY RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES

IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY REPORTS

THESE LOSSES AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS HANDLING IS FOR INCOME TAX MATTERS, FOR

WHICH BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT (I.E., LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION. FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES, REFER TO NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-46. REFER

ALSO TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS SECTION FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE THREE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN

USED IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT

MUST BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE

THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE

OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON

A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR

AUDIT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED

RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT

OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND MARKETING NATURAL GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR.

CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR

INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES SUBJECT THE

COMPANY TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT

IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS

ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH

THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURES AND

CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO

AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO

50 PERCENT OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY

DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY

CURRENTLY IN INCOME.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND

THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A

DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE

DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY

AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY

ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE

EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING

EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE

DIFFERENCE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED

QUARTERLY TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL

BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED

TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY,

GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT

TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS

COMMODITY TRADING ACTIVITY AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. INTEREST RATE SWAPS  HEDGING A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT  ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS

RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. WHERE CHEVRON IS A

PARTY TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, FAIR VALUE RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE OFFSET ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE IN

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND IS

MARKED-TO-MARKET, WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST, USING A

LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET. MATERIALS,

SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED

PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED

PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE CAPITALIZED FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT HAVE

FOUND CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED WHEN

THE DRILLING IS COMPLETED, PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF

RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. ALL OTHER

EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-50, FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS PROPERTIES,

ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR

A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN

INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION,

DEVELOPMENT AREA OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN THE REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND

CHEMICALS AREAS, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE GENERALLY DONE ON THE BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A

MARKETING AREA OR MARKETING ASSETS BY COUNTRY. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE

EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE

LOWER VALUE.

AS REQUIRED UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS

(ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 410), THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS RECORDED

AS AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A

LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 23, ON PAGE FS-60, RELATING TO AROS.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS

PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD

GENERALLY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD, AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES

FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION

PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR MINING ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD AS THE PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE

DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO

AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES AND FROM SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE (INCLUDING THOSE FOR

PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS), REPAIRS AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN OPERATING

CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED

BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR GOODWILL (ASC 350), THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING

UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT

BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS OR TO

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR

CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR

CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND

CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE

REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR CRUDE-OIL, NATURAL-GAS AND MINERAL-PRODUCING

PROPERTIES, A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS MADE,

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS. REFER TO NOTE

23, ON PAGE FS-60, FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS AROS.

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A

LIABILITY FOR ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER

PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF

FUTURE COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE

COMPANYS OWN INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR

REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL, PETROLEUM AND

CHEMICALS PRODUCTS, AND ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, NET OF

ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FROM

PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON THE

ENTITLEMENT METHOD. EXCISE, VALUE-ADDED AND SIMILAR TAXES ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY ON A

REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTION BETWEEN A SELLER AND A CUSTOMER ARE PRESENTED ON A GROSS BASIS. THE

ASSOCIATED AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN AS A FOOTNOTE TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ON PAGE FS-27.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION

OF ONE ANOTHER (INCLUDING BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS) ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED ON A NET BASIS AND

REPORTED IN PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ISSUES STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND ACCOUNTS FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (ASC 718). FOR EQUITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS, TOTAL

COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE

AND FOR LIABILITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, TOTAL COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON

THE SETTLEMENT VALUE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL AWARDS OVER

THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO EARN THE AWARD, WHICH IS THE SHORTER OF THE VESTING PERIOD OR THE

TIME PERIOD AN EMPLOYEE BECOMES ELIGIBLE TO RETAIN THE AWARD AT RETIREMENT. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE GRADED VESTING

PROVISIONS BY WHICH ONE-THIRD OF EACH AWARD VESTS ON THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF

THE DATE OF GRANT. THE COMPANY AMORTIZES THESE GRADED AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

NOTE 2

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

THE COMPANY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (ASC 810) IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, AND RETROACTIVE TO THE EARLIEST PERIOD

PRESENTED. OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES HELD BY PARTIES OTHER THAN THE PARENT

ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM

THE PARENTS EQUITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE AMOUNT OF CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PARENT AND THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE BOTH PRESENTED ON THE FACE OF THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE TERM EARNINGS IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CHEVRON CORPORATION.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR CASH-FLOW CLASSIFICATIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS (ASC

718), THE NET (INCREASE) DECREASE IN OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES REDUCTIONS OF $25, $106

AND $96 FOR EXCESS INCOME TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2009, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE OFFSET BY AN EQUAL AMOUNT IN NET SALES (PURCHASES) OF

TREASURY SHARES.

THE NET SALES (PURCHASES) OF TREASURY SHARES REPRESENTS THE COST OF COMMON SHARES PURCHASED LESS

THE COST OF SHARES ISSUED FOR

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. PURCHASES TOTALED $6, $8,011 AND

$7,036 IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. PURCHASES IN 2008 AND 2007 INCLUDED SHARES PURCHASED

UNDER THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.

IN 2009, NET SALES (PURCHASES) OF OTHER SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSISTED OF $123 IN

RESTRICTED CASH ASSOCIATED WITH

CAPITAL-INVESTMENT PROJECTS AT THE COMPANYS PASCAGOULA,

MISSISSIPPI REFINERY AND THE ANGOLA LIQUEFIED-NATURAL-GAS PROJECT THAT WAS INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM

SECURITIES AND RECLASSIFIED FROM CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TO DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY ISSUED $350 AND $650, IN 2009 AND 2007 RESPECTIVELY,

OF TAX EXEMPT MISSISSIPPI GULF OPPORTUNITY ZONE BONDS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR PASCAGOULA REFINERY

PROJECTS.

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR 2009 EXCLUDES CHANGES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET THAT DID NOT AFFECT CASH. IN 2008, NET SALES (PURCHASES) OF TREASURY SHARES EXCLUDES $680 OF TREASURY

SHARES ACQUIRED IN EXCHANGE FOR A U.S. UPSTREAM PROPERTY AND $280 IN CASH. THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THIS PROPERTY IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WAS NOT

SIGNIFICANT. IN 2008, A $2,450 INCREASE IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE TO

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AT COST WERE CONSIDERED NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS AND EXCLUDED FROM

NET (INCREASE) DECREASE IN OPERATING

WORKING

CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. IN 2009, THE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE ACCRUED

LIABILITIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM NET (INCREASE) DECREASE IN OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL AND WERE

REPORTED AS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE AMOUNT IS RELATED TO UPSTREAM OPERATING AGREEMENTS OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2008 EXCLUDES A $1,400 INCREASE IN PROPERTIES, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AN ADDITIONAL INTEREST IN AN EQUITY AFFILIATE THAT

REQUIRED A CHANGE TO THE CONSOLIDATED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE INVESTMENT DURING 2008. THIS

ADDITION WAS OFFSET PRIMARILY BY REDUCTIONS IN INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES AND WORKING CAPITAL AND

AN INCREASE IN NON-CURRENT DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 23, ON PAGE FS-60,

FOR A DISCUSSION OF REVISIONS TO THE COMPANYS AROS THAT ALSO DID NOT INVOLVE CASH RECEIPTS OR

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL DATA  CHEVRON U.S.A. INC.

CHEVRON U.S.A. INC. (CUSA) IS A MAJOR SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON CORPORATION. CUSA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGE AND OPERATE MOST OF CHEVRONS U.S. BUSINESSES. ASSETS INCLUDE THOSE RELATED TO THE

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND THOSE ASSOCIATED

WITH THE REFINING, MARKETING, SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM, EXCLUDING

MOST OF THE REGULATED PIPELINE OPERATIONS OF CHEVRON. CUSA ALSO HOLDS THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

THE CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC JOINT VENTURE, WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY

METHOD.

DURING 2008, CHEVRON IMPLEMENTED LEGAL REORGANIZATIONS IN WHICH CERTAIN CHEVRON SUBSIDIARIES

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENT (ASC 820) ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR

VALUE AND STIPULATE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARDS APPLY TO RECURRING AND

NONRECURRING FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR-VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. ASC 820 BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR CHEVRON ON JANUARY 1, 2008, FOR ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND RECURRING NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON JANUARY 1, 2009, THE STANDARD

BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR NONRECURRING NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMONG THE REQUIRED

DISCLOSURES IS THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE COMPANY USES TO VALUE AN ASSET OR A

LIABILITY. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1: QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR THE

COMPANY, LEVEL 1 INPUTS INCLUDE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR WHICH THE PARTIES ARE WILLING

TO TRANSACT AT THE EXCHANGE-QUOTED PRICE AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY TRADED.

LEVEL 2: INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. FOR THE

COMPANY, LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, PRICES OBTAINED

THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES, AND PRICES THAT CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS

FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE COMPLETE TERM OF A CONTRACT.

LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE LEVEL 3 INPUTS FOR ANY OF ITS RECURRING

FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENTS. LEVEL 3 INPUTS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN NONRECURRING MEASUREMENTS OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN 2009,

THE COMPANY USED LEVEL 3 INPUTS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN NONRECURRING NONFINANCIAL

ASSETS.

THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY FOR RECURRING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES FAIR VALUE FOR ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES BASED ON

QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE CASH THAT

WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SOLD AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR.

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS  OTHER THAN ANY COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE  ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AT FAIR VALUE, WITH VIRTUALLY ALL THE OFFSETTING AMOUNT TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR PROVISIONS AS CONTRACTS THAT ARE PUBLICLY TRADED

ON A REGULAR BASIS, THE COMPANY USES THE MARKET VALUES OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS AS AN

INPUT FOR FAIR-VALUE CALCULATIONS.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PRINCIPALLY INCLUDE CRUDE-OIL, NATURAL-GAS AND

REFINED-PRODUCT FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1

INCLUDE FUTURES, SWAPS AND OPTIONS CONTRACTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS SUCH AS THE NEW YORK

MERCANTILE EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INCLUDE SWAPS, OPTIONS, AND FORWARD CONTRACTS PRINCIPALLY

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES, THE FAIR VALUES FOR WHICH ARE OBTAINED

FROM THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES, INDUSTRY PRIC-

ING SERVICES AND EXCHANGES.  THE COMPANY OBTAINS MULTIPLE SOURCES OF PRICING INFORMATION FOR THE

LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS. SINCE THIS PRICING INFORMATION IS GENERATED FROM OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, IT

HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY CONSISTENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT MATERIALLY ADJUST THIS INFORMATION. THE

COMPANY INCORPORATES INTERNAL REVIEW, EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES, INCLUDING A COMPARISON

OF LEVEL 2 FAIR VALUES DERIVED FROM THE COMPANYS INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORWARD CURVES (ON A SAMPLE

BASIS) WITH THE PRICING INFORMATION TO DOCUMENT REASONABLE, LOGICAL AND SUPPORTABLE FAIR-VALUE

DETERMINATIONS AND PROPER LEVEL OF CLASSIFICATION.

IMPAIRMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

DURING 2009 AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING

STANDARD FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (ASC 360), LONG-LIVED ASSETS

HELD AND

USED WITH A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $949 WERE WRITTEN DOWN TO A FAIR VALUE OF $490, RESULTING IN A

BEFORE-TAX LOSS OF $459. THE FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED FROM INTERNAL CASH-FLOW MODELS, USING

DISCOUNT RATES CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED BY THE COMPANY TO EVALUATE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS OF

A SIMILAR NATURE. LONG-LIVED ASSETS

HELD FOR SALE WITH A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $160 WERE WRITTEN

DOWN TO A FAIR VALUE OF $68, RESULTING IN A BEFORE-TAX LOSS OF $92. THE FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED

BASED ON BIDS RECEIVED FROM PROSPECTIVE BUYERS.

MONEY MARKET FUNDS. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE

INSTRUMENTS WERE SETTLED AT

YEAR-END.

CASH EQUIVALENTS HAD CARRYING/FAIR VALUES OF $6,396 AND

$7,058 AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND AVERAGE MATURITIES UNDER 90 DAYS. THE

BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, INCLUDES $123 OF INVESTMENTS FOR RESTRICTED FUNDS RELATED TO AN

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND PASCAGOULA REFINERY PROJECTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN

DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. LONG-TERM DEBT OF $5,705 AND

$1,221 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $6,229 AND $1,414 AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT THE END OF 2009 AND 2008 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

NOTE 10

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO PRICE

VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS

AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF

ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PUR-

CHASE, SALE AND STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND

FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY REFINERIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY

INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS PRINCIPALLY INCLUDE CRUDE-OIL, NATURAL-GAS AND

REFINED-PRODUCT FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. NONE OF THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS DESIGNATED AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS AFFILIATES

MAKE SUCH DESIGNATION. THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVES ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS NO MATERIAL MARKET OR

CREDIT RISKS TO ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF ITS COMMODITIES AND

OTHER DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY USES INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS TO GOVERN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE

OF THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE

COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY

AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE

NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND IS A REASONABLE MEASURE

OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO USES OTHER NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE SOME OF

ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED PURCHASE

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS. THE CURRENCY

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS

AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. THERE WERE NO OPEN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31,

2009.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS

OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. HISTORICALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS WERE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE

INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS

RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON

THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT YEAR-END 2009, THE

COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. THE COMPANYS ONLY INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON FIXED-RATE DEBT

MATURED IN JANUARY 2009.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE

PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED

INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

RISK. SIMILAR STANDARDS OF DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE

DISPERSED AMONG THE COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF

ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, REQUIRING

LETTERS OF CREDIT IS A PRINCIPAL METHOD USED TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 11

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ALTHOUGH EACH SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN AFFAIRS, CHEVRON CORPORATION

MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE

INVESTMENTS ARE GROUPED AS FOLLOWS: UPSTREAM  EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION; DOWNSTREAM  REFINING,

MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION; CHEMICALS; AND ALL OTHER. THE FIRST THREE OF THESE GROUPINGS

REPRESENT THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND OPERATING SEGMENTS AS DEFINED IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING (ASC 280).

THE SEGMENTS ARE SEPARATELY MANAGED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES UNDER A STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES

SEGMENT MANAGERS WHO REPORT TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM)

(TERMS AS

DEFINED IN ASC 280). THE CODM IS THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, A COMMITTEE OF SENIOR OFFICERS

THAT INCLUDES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THAT, IN TURN, REPORTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

CHEVRON CORPORATION.

THE OPERATING SEGMENTS REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY, AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING (ASC 280), THAT ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES (A) FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE

EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM,

WHICH MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS AND TO ASSESS THEIR

PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT MANAGERS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO AND MAINTAIN REGULAR

CONTACT WITH THE COMPANYS CODM TO DISCUSS THE SEGMENTS OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. THE CODM APPROVES ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS AT THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT

LEVEL, AS WELL AS REVIEWS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY FUNDING FOR MAJOR PROJECTS AND APPROVES MAJOR

CHANGES TO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS. HOWEVER, BUSINESS-UNIT MANAGERS WITHIN THE

OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND

ALL OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH DAILY OPERATIONS. COMPANY OFFICERS WHO ARE

MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND

PARTICIPATE IN OTHER COMMITTEES FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN ACTING AS THE CODM.

ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE MINING OPERATIONS, POWER GENERATION BUSINESSES, WORLDWIDE CASH

MANAGEMENT AND DEBT FINANCING ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS,

REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES, ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, AND THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN

DYNEGY

(THROUGH MAY 2007, WHEN CHEVRON SOLD ITS INTEREST).

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY COUNTRY OF OPERATION IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ITS COUNTRY OF

DOMICILE. OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED AS INTERNATIONAL

(OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES).

SEGMENT EARNINGS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ON AN AFTER-TAX

BASIS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF DEBT FINANCING INTEREST EXPENSE OR INVESTMENT INTEREST

INCOME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE COMPANY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS AND ASSETS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE

BILLED FOR THE DIRECT USE OF CORPORATE SERVICES. NONBILLABLE COSTS REMAIN AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL IN

DESCRIPTIONS OF MAJOR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATES,

ARE AS FOLLOWS.

TENGIZCHEVROIL

CHEVRON HAS A 50 PERCENT EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TENGIZCHEVROIL

(TCO), A JOINT VENTURE FORMED IN 1993 TO DEVELOP THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV CRUDE-OIL FIELDS IN

KAZAKHSTAN OVER A 40-YEAR PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

INVESTMENT IN TCO WAS ABOUT $200 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN TCOS NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE RESULTS FROM

CHEVRON ACQUIRING

A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN TCO AT A VALUE GREATER THAN THE UNDERLYING BOOK VALUE FOR THAT PORTION

OF TCOS NET ASSETS. SEE NOTE 7, ON PAGE FS-36, FOR SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR 100

PERCENT OF TCO.

PETROPIAR

CHEVRON HAS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST IN PETROPIAR, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2008 TO

OPERATE THE HAMACA HEAVY-OIL PRODUCTION AND UPGRADING PROJECT. THE PROJECT, LOCATED IN VENEZUELAS

ORINOCO BELT, HAS A 25-YEAR CONTRACT TERM. PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF PETROPIAR, CHEVRON HAD A 30

PERCENT INTEREST IN THE HAMACA PROJECT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

INVESTMENT IN PETROPIAR WAS APPROXIMATELY $195 LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

PETROPIARS NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF CHEVRONS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

PETROPIARS NET ASSETS OVER THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE VENTURE.

PETROBOSCAN

CHEVRON HAS A 39 PERCENT INTEREST IN PETROBOSCAN, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2006

TO OPERATE THE BOSCAN FIELD IN VENEZUELA UNTIL 2026. CHEVRON PREVIOUSLY OPERATED THE FIELD UNDER AN

OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT

IN PETROBOSCAN WAS APPROXIMATELY $275 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCANS

NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REFLECTS THE EXCESS OF THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY

CHEVRON OVER ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCANS NET ASSETS.

ANGOLA LNG LTD.

CHEVRON HAS A 36 PERCENT INTEREST IN

ANGOLA LNG LTD., WHICH WILL PROCESS AND

LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS PRODUCED IN ANGOLA FOR DELIVERY TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

CHEVRON OWNS AN APPROXIMATE 23 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COLONIAL

PIPELINE COMPANY. THE COLONIAL PIPELINE SYSTEM RUNS FROM TEXAS TO NEW JERSEY AND TRANSPORTS

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN A 13-STATE MARKET.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

INVESTMENT IN COLONIAL PIPELINE WAS APPROXIMATELY $550 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY

IN COLONIAL PIPELINE NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE PRIMARILY RELATES TO PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS

NOTE 14

LITIGATION

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO 50 PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS. RESOLUTION OF THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE

FUTURE. THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT DETERMINABLE,

BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES MTBE IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO

AGRIO, ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN

RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT

ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE

ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH

MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO INC., WAS

A MINORITY MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, AS

THE MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE

CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE

CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND

PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO

TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A

THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY

REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM

ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR

FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION

OVER CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT

BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN

ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE

LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY

LITIGATION - CONTINUED

GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE REMAINING

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND

PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING

THAT THE COURT ASSESS $8,000, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL

COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER

ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

PETROECUADOR. THE ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL $8,300 COULD BE ASSESSED

AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. THE ENGINEERS REPORT IS NOT BINDING ON THE COURT. CHEVRON

ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE ENGINEERS WORK WAS PERFORMED AND HIS REPORT PREPARED IN A MANNER CONTRARY

TO LAW AND IN VIOLATION OF THE COURTS ORDERS. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REPORT IN WHICH

IT ASKED THE COURT TO STRIKE THE REPORT IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE ENGINEER REVISED THE

REPORT AND, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE, RECOMMENDED AN INCREASE IN THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR

PURPORTED DAMAGES TO A TOTAL OF $18,900 AND AN INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENT FOR PURPORTED UNJUST

ENRICHMENT TO A TOTAL OF $8,400. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REVISED REPORT, WHICH THE

COURT DISMISSED. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY CHEVRON OF EVIDENCE THAT THE JUDGE

PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN WHICH BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY OUTCOME, THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE CASE

PETITIONED TO BE RECUSED. IN LATE SEPTEMBER 2009, THE JUDGE WAS RECUSED, AND IN OCTOBER 2009, THE

FULL CHAMBER OF THE PROVINCIAL COURT AFFIRMED THE RECUSAL, RESULTING IN THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW

JUDGE. CHEVRON FILED MOTIONS TO ANNUL ALL OF THE RULINGS MADE BY THE PRIOR JUDGE, BUT THE NEW JUDGE

DENIED THESE MOTIONS. THE COURT HAS COMPLETED MOST OF THE PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE AND COULD

RENDER A JUDGMENT AT ANY TIME. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION

OF LIABILITY.

IN THE EVENT OF AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT, CHEVRON WOULD EXPECT TO PURSUE ITS APPEALS AND VIGOROUSLY

DEFEND AGAINST ENFORCEMENT OF ANY SUCH JUDGMENT; THEREFORE, THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME  AND ANY

FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON  REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A

REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS

CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENGINEERS REPORT, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE

REPORT HAS ANY UTILITY IN CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS). MOREOVER,

THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO

ESTIMATE A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

TAXES - CONTINUED

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 44.2 PERCENT IN 2008 TO 43.0

PERCENT IN 2009. THE RATE WAS LOWER IN 2009 MAINLY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF DEFERRED TAX BENEFITS AND

RELATIVELY LOW TAX RATES ON ASSET SALES, BOTH RELATED TO AN INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM PROJECT. IN

ADDITION, A GREATER PROPORTION OF BEFORE-TAX INCOME WAS EARNED IN 2009 BY EQUITY AFFILIATES THAN IN

2008. (EQUITY-AFFILIATE INCOME IS REPORTED AS A SINGLE AMOUNT ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.) PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE ITEMS WAS THE EFFECT OF A GREATER

PROPORTION OF INCOME EARNED IN 2009 IN TAX JURISDICTIONS WITH HIGHER TAX RATES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS DEFERRED TAXES ON A TAX-JURISDICTION BASIS AND CLASSIFIES THOSE NET

AMOUNTS AS CURRENT OR NONCURRENT BASED ON THE BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR

$7,912

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2009 INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $400 FROM

YEAR-END 2008. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED IN 2009. INCREASES RELATED TO ADDITIONAL

FOREIGN TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM EARNINGS IN HIGH-TAX-RATE INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS (WHICH WERE

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY VALUATION ALLOWANCES) AND TO INVENTORY-RELATED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES. THESE

EFFECTS WERE OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN DEFERRED CREDITS AND TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS PRIMARILY

RESULTING FROM THE USAGE OF TAX BENEFITS IN INTERNATIONAL TAX JURISDICTIONS.

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS,

TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES. IT REDUCES THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO

AMOUNTS THAT ARE, IN MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TAX LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS EXIST IN MANY INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. WHEREAS SOME OF THESE TAX LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS DO NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE, OTHERS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES FROM 2010 THROUGH

2036. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $5,387 WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, DEFERRED TAXES WERE CLASSIFIED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES FOR WHICH NO DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE

FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE REMITTANCES TOTALED $20,458 AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS

TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT MIGHT BE PAYABLE ON THE EVENTUAL REMITTANCE OF EARNINGS THAT

ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. AT THE END OF 2009, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WERE RECORDED

FOR THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY NO LONGER

INTENDS TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THE EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE INCURRING

SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL TAXES ON REMITTANCES OF EARNINGS THAT ARE NOT INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES (ASC

740-10), A COMPANY RECOGNIZES A TAX BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITION ONLY IF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A

LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION BASED SOLELY ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TERM TAX POSITION IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR INCOME

TAXES (ASC 740-10-20) REFERS TO A POSITION IN A PREVIOUSLY FILED TAX RETURN OR A POSITION EXPECTED

TO BE TAKEN IN A FUTURE TAX RETURN THAT IS REFLECTED IN MEASURING CURRENT OR DEFERRED INCOME TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIODS.

APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF THE $3,195 OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WOULD

HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED.

TAX POSITIONS FOR CHEVRON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX AUDITS

AFTER TAX), $132 ($86 AFTER TAX) AND $205 ($133 AFTER TAX) FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

NO SIGNIFICANT STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST WAS CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008.

CASH RECEIVED IN PAYMENT FOR OPTION EXERCISES UNDER ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR

2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $147, $404 AND $445, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS REALIZED FOR THE TAX

DEDUCTIONS FROM OPTION EXERCISES WERE $25, $103 AND $94 FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH PAID TO SETTLE PERFORMANCE UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS WAS $89, $136 AND $88 FOR

CHEVRON LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)

AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND NONSTOCK GRANTS. FROM APRIL 2004 THROUGH JANUARY 2014, NO MORE THAN 160

MILLION SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP, AND NO MORE THAN 64 MILLION OF THOSE SHARES MAY BE IN

A FORM OTHER THAN A STOCK OPTION, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT OR AWARD REQUIRING FULL PAYMENT FOR

SHARES BY THE AWARD RECIPIENT.

TEXACO STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (TEXACO SIP)

ON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF TEXACO IN OCTOBER

2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRON OPTIONS. THESE

OPTIONS, WHICH HAVE 10-YEAR CONTRACTUAL LIVES EXTENDING INTO 2011, RETAINED A PROVISION FOR BEING

RESTORED. THIS PROVISION ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISES A STOCK OPTION TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS

EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WHO HAS SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING

OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE

RESTORED OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE

IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED OPTION IS GRANTED. BEGINNING IN

2007, RESTORED OPTIONS WERE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP. NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE

FORMER TEXACO PLANS.

UNOCAL SHARE-BASED PLANS (UNOCAL PLANS)

WHEN CHEVRON ACQUIRED UNOCAL IN AUGUST 2005, OUTSTANDING

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS UNOCAL PLANS WERE EXCHANGED FOR

FULLY VESTED CHEVRON OPTIONS AND APPRECIATION RIGHTS. THESE AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME PROVISIONS AS

THE ORIGINAL UNOCAL PLANS. IF NOT EXERCISED, THESE AWARDS WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN EARLY 2010 AND EARLY

2015.

THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE (I.E., THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXERCISE PRICE AND THE

MARKET PRICE) OF OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $91, $433 AND $423, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING THIS PERIOD, THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS PRACTICE OF ISSUING TREASURY SHARES UPON EXERCISE OF

THESE AWARDS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WAS $233 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED BEFORE-TAX COMPENSATION COST

RELATED TO NONVESTED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS GRANTED OR RESTORED UNDER THE PLANS.

THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.8 YEARS.

AT JANUARY 1, 2009, THE NUMBER OF LTIP PERFORMANCE UNITS OUTSTANDING WAS EQUIVALENT TO

2,400,555 SHARES. DURING 2009, 992,800 UNITS WERE GRANTED, 668,953 UNITS VESTED WITH CASH PROCEEDS

DISTRIBUTED TO RECIPIENTS AND 45,294 UNITS WERE FORFEITED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, UNITS OUTSTANDING

WERE 2,679,108, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS $233. IN

ADDITION, OUTSTANDING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS

LTIP AND FORMER TEXACO AND UNOCAL PROGRAMS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION EQUIVALENT SHARES AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. A LIABILITY OF $45 WAS RECORDED FOR THESE AWARDS.

IN MARCH 2009, CHEVRON GRANTED ALL ELIGIBLE LTIP EMPLOYEES RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN LIEU OF

ANNUAL CASH BONUS. THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SPECIAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WAS RECOGNIZED

AT THE TIME OF THE GRANTS. A TOTAL OF 453,965 UNITS WERE GRANTED AT $69.70 PER UNIT AT THE TIME OF

THE GRANT. TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE SPECIAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WAS $32 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

ALL OF

THE SPECIAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WILL BE PAYABLE IN NOVEMBER 2010.

NOTE 21

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY

PREFUNDS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS AS REQUIRED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS OR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE

PREFUNDING PROVIDES ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL QUALIFIED PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

TYPICALLY FUND U.S. NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER

LAWS AND REGULATIONS BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS ECONOMIC AND

INVESTMENT RETURNS MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT (OPEB) PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL

BENEFITS, AS WELL AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS ARE

UNFUNDED, AND THE COMPANY AND RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE

RETIREES IN THE COMPANYS MAIN U.S. MEDICAL PLAN IS SECONDARY TO MEDICARE (INCLUDING PART D), AND

THE INCREASE TO THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 4

PERCENT PER YEAR. CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY.

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (ASC 715), THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE

OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF EACH OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB AS AN ASSET OR

LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS FOR 2009 AND

2008 IS ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER

31, 2009, FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB PLANS ARE BEING AMORTIZED

ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER APPROXIMATELY 11, 13 AND 10 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMORTIZATION

PERIODS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS

UNDER THE PLANS. THESE LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE HIGHER OF

THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO

AMORTIZATION IS DETERMINED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS. DURING 2010, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ACTUARIAL

LOSSES OF $318, $102 AND $26 WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S.

PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, RESPEC-

TIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES AN

ADDITIONAL $220 WILL BE RECOGNIZED FROM ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS DURING 2010 RELATED TO LUMP-SUM SETTLEMENT COSTS FROM U.S. PENSION PLANS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR RECOGNIZING PRIOR SERVICE COSTS (CREDITS)

RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, WAS APPROXIMATELY EIGHT

AND 12 YEARS FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND EIGHT YEARS FOR OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. DURING 2010, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES PRIOR SERVICE (CREDITS) COSTS OF

$(7), $27 AND $(74) WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S. PENSION,

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON

PENSION ASSETS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF

EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIFIC

ASSET-CLASS RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN

ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH

THESE STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002

FOR U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 69 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8 PERCENT.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF

PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE YEAR-END

MEASUREMENT DATE, AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING

RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF

DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR.

FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 5.3

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN AND 5.8 PERCENT FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLAN. THIS RATE WAS BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO

THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END 2009. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF

2008 AND 2007 WERE 6.3 PERCENT FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN AND THE OPEB PLAN.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES START WITH 7 PERCENT IN 2010 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2018 AND

BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES STARTED

WITH 7 PERCENT IN 2009 AND GRADUALLY DECLINED TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2017 AND BEYOND. IN BOTH

MEASUREMENTS, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS WAS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR

PLAN ASSETS AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED THE

EXPANDED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PLAN ASSETS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS (ASC

715) TO PROVIDE USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF: HOW INVESTMENT ALLOCATION

DECISIONS ARE MADE; THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS; THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED

TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS; THE EFFECT OF FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS ON CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PERIOD; AND SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN

ASSETS.

THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE COMPANY USES TO VALUE THE PENSION ASSETS IS DIVIDED

INTO THREE LEVELS.

LEVEL 1: FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS ARE MEASURED USING UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES

FOR THE ASSETS OR THE PRICES OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE PLANS HAVE THE ABILITY

TO ACCESS.

LEVEL 2: FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS ARE MEASURED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS IN

ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS IN INACTIVE MARKETS; INPUTS OTHER

THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET; AND INPUTS THAT ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM

OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BY CORRELATION OR OTHER MEANS. IF THE

ASSET HAS A CONTRACTUAL TERM, THE LEVEL 2 INPUT IS OBSERVABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF

THE ASSET. THE FAIR VALUES FOR LEVEL 2 ASSETS ARE GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY BROKER

QUOTES, INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND EXCHANGES.

LEVEL 3: INPUTS TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ARE UNOBSERVABLE FOR THESE ASSETS. VALUATION MAY

NOTE 21

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - CONTINUED

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE PENSION PLANS ARE TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST

RATE OF TOTAL RETURN WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS OF RISK AND LIQUIDITY, TO DIVERSIFY AND MITIGATE

POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR

BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANYS U.S. AND U.K. PENSION PLANS COMPRISE 84 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PENSION ASSETS.

BOTH THE U.S. AND U.K. PLANS HAVE AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE THAT REGULARLY MEETS DURING THE YEAR TO

REVIEW THE ASSET HOLDINGS AND THEIR RETURNS. TO ASSESS THE PLANS INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, LONG-TERM

ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE CHEVRON BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED THE

FOLLOWING APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES 40-70 PERCENT, FIXED INCOME AND CASH 20-60

PERCENT, REAL ESTATE 0-15 PERCENT, AND OTHER 0-5 PERCENT. FOR THE U.K. PENSION PLAN, THE U.K. BOARD

OF TRUSTEES HAS ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING ASSET ALLOCATION GUIDELINES, WHICH ARE REVIEWED

REGULARLY: EQUITIES 60-80 PERCENT AND FIXED INCOME AND CASH 2040 PERCENT. THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES THAT

VARY BY PLAN. ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION WITHIN APPROVED RANGES IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF CURRENT

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET CATEGORY RISK. THERE ARE NO

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK IN PLAN ASSETS DUE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENT

CATEGORIES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT PREFUND ITS OPEB OBLIGATIONS.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

IN 2009, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $1,494 AND $245 TO ITS

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2010, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO

BE APPROXIMATELY $600 AND $300 TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL

CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PAYING OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $208 IN 2010,

AS COMPARED WITH $187 PAID IN 2009.

THE FOLLOWING BENEFIT PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE ESTIMATED FUTURE SERVICE, ARE EXPECTED TO BE

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF CHEVRON AND CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP).

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE

FUNDED EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE

RELEASE OF COMMON STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (LESOP), WHICH IS

DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION THAT FOLLOWS. TOTAL COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS

WITHIN THE ESIP WERE $257, $231 AND $206 IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS

REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF SHARES RELEASED FROM THE LESOP TOTALING $184, $40 AND $33 IN 2009, 2008 AND

2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING AMOUNTS, TOTALING $73, $191 AND $173 IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENT OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRON ESIP IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP).

IN 1989, CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LESOP AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES PARTIAL

PREFUNDING OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

AS PERMITTED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (ASC 718), THE DEBT OF THE

LESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED COMPENSATION

AND BENEFIT PLAN TRUST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE. INTEREST ACCRUED ON LESOP DEBT IS

RECORDED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF

RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL LESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE COMPUTATIONS.

TOTAL CREDITS TO EXPENSE FOR THE LESOP WERE $3, $1 AND $1 IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THE NET CREDIT FOR THE RESPECTIVE YEARS WAS COMPOSED OF CREDITS TO COMPENSATION

EXPENSE OF $15, $15 AND $17 AND CHARGES TO INTEREST EXPENSE FOR LESOP DEBT OF $12, $14 AND $16.

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES, $110, $35 AND $8 WERE USED IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED IN 2009, 2008 OR 2007 AS

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY THE LESOP WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE.

BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, TEXACO ESTABLISHED A BENEFIT PLAN

TRUST FOR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS. AT YEAR-END 2009, THE TRUST

CONTAINED 14.2 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRON TREASURY STOCK. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE SHARES OR USE THE

DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT PAY SUCH

BENEFITS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS. THE

TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUSTS BENEFICIARIES. THE

SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE PURPOSES UNTIL

DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD BY THE TRUST IN PAYMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, UNOCAL ESTABLISHED VARIOUS GRANTOR TRUSTS TO FUND

OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS, INCLUDING THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL

RETIREMENT PLANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, TRUST ASSETS OF $57 AND $60, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

INVESTED PRIMARILY IN INTEREST-EARNING ACCOUNTS.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED THE CHEVRON INCENTIVE PLAN

(CIP), A SINGLE ANNUAL CASH BONUS PLAN FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES THAT LINKS AWARDS TO CORPORATE, UNIT

AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS PLAN REPLACED OTHER CASH BONUS PROGRAMS, WHICH

PRIMARILY INCLUDED THE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN (MIP) AND THE CHEVRON SUCCESS SHARING PROGRAM. IN

2009 AND 2008, CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR CASH BONUSES WERE $561 AND $757, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2007,

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR MIP WERE $184 AND CHARGES FOR OTHER CASH BONUS PROGRAMS WERE $431. CHEVRON

ALSO HAS THE LTIP FOR OFFICERS AND OTHER REGULAR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP CONSIST OF

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 20, ON PAGE FS-51.

NOTE 22

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE

AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT

TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED. REFER TO

NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-46 FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH TAX RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX

JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR ALL TAX JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF

TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN

A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

GUARANTEES

THE COMPANYS GUARANTEE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER

A TERMINAL USE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY A COMPANY AFFILIATE. THE TERMINAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

OPERATIONAL BY 2012. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE

AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY OF ANY

AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON HAS RECORDED NO LIABILITY FOR ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THIS

GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE

INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO

MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300. THROUGH THE END OF 2009, THE COMPANY PAID $48 UNDER THESE

INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS HAD TO BE ASSERTED BY FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND MUST BE

ASSERTED NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES,

THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2009, SHELL

DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE COMPANY PURPORTING TO PRESERVE UNMATURED CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN EQUILON

INDEMNITIES. THE LETTER ITSELF PROVIDES NO ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE CLAIM AMOUNT. MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT BELIEVE THIS LETTER OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDES A BASIS TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY,

OF A RANGE OF LOSS OR POTENTIAL RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO EITHER

THE EQUILON OR THE MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO

PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

FS-58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 22

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS - CONTINUED

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ARE TO BE NET OF

AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR

MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. THE ACQUIRER OF THOSE

ASSETS SHARED IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF $200, WHICH

HAD BEEN REACHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT, AFTER REACHING THE $200

OBLIGATION, CHEVRON IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

THE SALE OF THE ASSETS IN 1997.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY THAT ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY

PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS, UTILITIES, AND

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE

AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE: 2010 

$7,500; 2011  $4,300; 2012  $1,400; 2013  $1,400; 2014  $1,000; 2015 AND AFTER  $4,100. A

PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SHARED WITH PROJECT PARTNERS. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER

THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $8,100 IN 2009, $5,100 IN 2008 AND $3,700 IN 2007.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO LAWS, REGULATIONS, PRIVATE

CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

OR THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE

COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE-OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT

AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS,

WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

CHEVRONS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WAS $1,700. INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE

WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT APPROXIMATELY 250 SITES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY

HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A

POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR

ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2009 WAS $185.

THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON

TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2009 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,515, $820 RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS

(I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), AND PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $695 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($107), UPSTREAM ($369), CHEMICALS ($149) AND OTHER

BUSINESSES ($70). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION

OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL

EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF

PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND

MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS - CONTINUED

STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2009

HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

REFER TO NOTE 23 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR

PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS RESERVES. THESE

ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO

EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK HILLS,

CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES.

FOR THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT

APPROXIMATELY $200, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED

AT ABOUT $150. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE

UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS;

U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS.

THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY

PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 23

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (ASC 410), THE

COMPANY RECORDS THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) WHEN THERE

IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE

LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM THE ASSET RETIREMENT

ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY MAY EXIST ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF

SETTLEMENT THAT MAY BE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL. THIS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR

METHOD OF SETTLEMENT IS FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION

EXISTS TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF

THE TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS REQUIRE RECOGNITION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING: (1) THE

PRESENT VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING ASSET FOR AN ARO, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT

LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION OF THE ASSET, AND (3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES

AND DISCOUNT RATES.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

ACCOUNTING FOR CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS PRODUCING ASSETS. NO SIGNIFICANT AROS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) AND CHEMICAL

LONG-LIVED ASSETS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED, AS INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS

PREVENT ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS

OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE INDICATES THE CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS BEFORE-TAX ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE

CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM

ENGINEERS, THE WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS. THE

SYSTEM CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS AT THE TIME OF

REPORTING  THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND THREE NONCOMMERCIAL. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL CLASSIFICATION

ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES OF UNPROVED: PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE NONCOMMERCIAL

CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA

DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE IN THE FUTURE FROM KNOWN

RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS, AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. NET

PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

THE QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF RESERVES

ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. AS

PART OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COM-

PANY MAINTAINS A RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE RESERVES

MANAGER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF A CORPORATE DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE CORPORATE

RESERVES MANAGER HAS MORE THAN 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND A

MASTERS OF SCIENCE IN PETROLEUM ENGINEERING. ALL RAC MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN SEC GUIDELINES

FOR PROVED RESERVES CLASSIFICATION. THE RAC MANAGES ITS ACTIVITIES THROUGH TWO OPERATING

COMPANY-LEVEL RESERVES MANAGERS. THESE TWO RESERVES MANAGERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE RAC SO AS TO

PRESERVE THE CORPORATE-LEVEL INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OF THE BUSINESS

UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVE CHANGES; CONFIRM THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND APPROPRIATE

STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH PROVIDES

STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON RESERVES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM BUSINESS

UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR CHANGES

ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND PLANNING COMMITTEE AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,

WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANYS

ANNUAL RESERVE ACTIVITY IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IF MAJOR CHANGES TO RESERVES

WERE TO OCCUR BETWEEN THE ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE BOARD.

REVISED OIL AND GAS REPORTING

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE SEC ISSUED ITS FINAL RULE,

MODERNIZATION

OF OIL AND GAS REPORTING

(RELEASE NOS. 33-8995; 34-59192; FR-78). THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER

THE FINAL RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY WITH ITS FORM 10-K FILING FOR THE YEAR ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FINAL RULE CHANGES A NUMBER OF OIL AND GAS RESERVE ESTIMATION AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS UNDER SEC REGULATIONS S-K AND S-X. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FASB UPDATED

EXTRACTIVE

INDUSTRIES  OIL AND GAS

(TOPIC 932) TO ALIGN THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES ESTIMATION AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS WITH THE SECS FINAL RULE.

AMONG THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES IN THE FINAL RULE ARE REQUIREMENTS TO USE A PRICE BASED ON A 12-MONTH

AVERAGE FOR RESERVE ESTIMATION AND DISCLOSURE INSTEAD OF A SINGLE END-OF-YEAR PRICE; EXPANDING THE

DEFINITION OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES TO INCLUDE NONTRADITIONAL SOURCES SUCH AS BITUMEN

EXTRACTED FROM OIL SANDS; PERMITTING THE USE OF NEW RELIABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO ESTABLISH REASONABLE

CERTAINTY OF PROVED RESERVES; ALLOWING OPTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES;

MODIFYING THE DEFINITION OF GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR DISCLOSURE OF RESERVE ESTIMATES AND PRODUCTION;

AMENDING

DISCLOSURES OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES TO INCLUDE SEPARATE DISCLOSURES OF SYNTHETIC OIL AND GAS;

EXPANDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES DISCLOSURES, INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES THAT HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE; AND DISCLOSURE OF THE

QUALIFICATIONS OF THE CHIEF TECHNICAL PERSON WHO OVERSEES THE COMPANYS OVERALL RESERVES ESTIMATION

PROCESS.

EFFECT OF NEW RULES

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF THE COMPANYS ADOPTING THE NEW GUIDANCE WAS THE

INCLUSION OF CANADIAN OIL SANDS AS SYNTHETIC OIL IN THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES RESERVES. AS

INDICATED IN TABLE V, ON PAGE FS-72, AN ADDITIONAL 460 MILLION BOE WERE INCLUDED AT YEAR-END 2009.

THE SYNTHETIC OIL REPORTED FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES REPRESENTS VOLUMES RECLASSIFIED FROM

HEAVY CRUDE OIL TO SYNTHETIC OIL, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT ADDITIONAL RESERVES. IT WAS

IMPRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE REMAINING IMPACT OF THE NEW RULES BECAUSE OF THE COST AND RESOURCES

REQUIRED TO PREPARE DETAILED FIELD-LEVEL CALCULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE USE OF THE 12-MONTH AVERAGE

PRICE HAD AN UPWARD EFFECT ON RESERVES RELATED TO PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY CONTRACTS

AS THE 12-MONTH AVERAGE PRICE FOR CRUDE OIL AND

FS-70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

NATURAL GAS FOR 2009 WAS LOWER THAN THE 2009 YEAR-END SPOT PRICES APPLICABLE UNDER THE OLD

RULES. THE ABILITY TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN RESERVES DETERMINATION DID NOT IMPACT RESERVES

SIGNIFICANTLY, AS MOST RESERVE ADDITIONS AND REVISIONS WERE BASED ON CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT THE END OF 2009, PROVED UNDEVELOPED OIL-EQUIVALENT

RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES TOTALED 3.1 BILLION BARRELS. APPROXIMATELY 58 PERCENT OF THE

RESERVES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO NATURAL GAS, OF WHICH ABOUT HALF WERE LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA IN THE OTHER

REGIONS. CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE AND NGLS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 33 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH THE

LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF THESE RESERVES IN AFRICA, ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES. SYNTHETIC OIL

ACCOUNTED FOR THE BALANCE OF THE RESERVES AND WERE LOCATED IN CANADA IN THE OTHER REGIONS.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES OF EQUITY AFFILIATES AMOUNTED TO 1.3 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS. AT

YEAR-END, CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE AND NGLS REPRESENTED 58 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RESERVES, WITH THE TCO

AFFILIATE ACCOUNTING FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE AMOUNT. NATURAL GAS REPRESENTED 26 PERCENT OF THE

TOTAL, WITH OVER HALF OF THESE RESERVES AT TCO. THE BALANCE IS ATTRIBUTED TO SYNTHETIC OIL IN

VENEZUELA IN THE OTHER REGIONS.

IN 2009, WORLDWIDE PROVED UNDEVELOPED OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES INCREASED BY 480 MILLION BARRELS FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND DECREASED 19 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE LARGEST

INCREASE FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES WAS IN THE OTHER REGIONS, RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM INITIAL

RECOGNITION OF RESERVES FOR THE GORGON PROJECT IN AUSTRALIA AND ADDITION OF SYNTHETIC OIL

RESERVES RELATED TO CANADIAN OIL SANDS WITH ADOPTION OF THE NEW DEFINITION OF OIL AND GAS ACTIVITY.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES DECREASED IN ASIA, AFRICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, AS A RESULT OF

DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES, WHICH RECLASSIFIED RESERVES TO PROVED DEVELOPED.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES DECREASED FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. THIS WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH

A 146 MILLION BARREL RECLASSIFICATION TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF THE TCO PRODUCTION

CAPACITY ADDED WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE SOUR GAS INJECTION/SECOND GENERATION PLANT PROJECTS

(SGI/SGP). THE DECREASE AT TCO WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN

VENEZUELA AND FOR ANGOLA LNG DUE TO RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND ADDITIONAL DRILLING OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE WERE NO MATERIAL DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED OR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

INVESTMENT TO CONVERT PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

DURING 2009, INVESTMENTS

TOTALING ABOUT $6.9 BILLION WERE MADE BY CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES TO ADVANCE

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. IN THE AFRICA REGION, $2.5 BILLION WAS EXPENDED ON

VARIOUS PROJECTS, INCLUDING OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN NIGERIA AND ANGOLA, WHICH ADVANCED

DEVELOPMENT DRILLING, AND THE COMPLETION OF A NIGERIAN NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PROJECT. IN THE ASIA

REGION, EXPENDITURES DURING THE YEAR TOTALED $1.5 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED CONSTRUCTION ON A GAS

PROCESSING

FACILITY IN THAILAND AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AT A STEAM-FLOOD PROJECT IN INDONESIA. IN THE UNITED

STATES, EXPENDITURES TOTALED $1.7 BILLION FOR THREE OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO AND VARIOUS SMALLER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. IN THE OTHER REGIONS, DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

TOTALED $1.2 BILLION FOR A VARIETY OF PROJECTS INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN AUSTRALIA AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM.

DURING

THE YEAR, EIGHT MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WERE PLACED INTO SERVICE RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR 5 YEARS OR MORE

RESERVES THAT REMAIN PROVED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE OR

MORE YEARS ARE A RESULT OF SEVERAL PHYSICAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT OPTIMAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND

EXECUTION, SUCH AS THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN ADVERSE AND REMOTE LOCATIONS,

PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS OF INFRASTRUCTURE OR PLANT CAPACITIES THAT DICTATE PROJECT TIMING, COMPRESSION

PROJECTS THAT ARE PENDING RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES, AND CONTRACTUAL LIMITATIONS THAT DICTATE

PRODUCTION LEVELS.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES TOTALED 4.4

BILLION BARRELS AT YEAR-END 2009. OF THIS TOTAL, 1.7 BILLION BARRELS CORRESPONDS TO PROVED

UNDEVELOPED

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES THAT HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE.

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES HELD APPROXIMATELY 700 MILLION BARRELS OF THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

OVER FIVE YEARS. IN AFRICA, APPROXIMATELY 400 MILLION BARRELS WERE RELATED TO DEEPWATER PROJECTS

UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THE ASIA REGION HELD APPROXIMATELY 100 MILLION BARRELS RELATED TO COMPRESSION

AND CONTRACT RESTRICTIONS. THE OTHER REGIONS HELD ABOUT 100 MILLION BARRELS RELATED TO COMPRESSION

PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA. THE BALANCE RELATES TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AND VARIOUS PROJECTS IN

THE UNITED STATES.

AT YEAR END, AFFILIATED COMPANIES HELD ABOUT 1.0 BILLION BARRELS OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

OVER FIVE YEARS. TCO ACCOUNTED FOR 800 MILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS OF RESERVES, WHICH WAS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO PLANT CAPACITY LIMITATIONS. THE BALANCE RELATED TO CAPACITY LIMITATIONS AT A

SYNTHETIC OIL PROJECT IN VENEZUELA.

ANNUALLY,

THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER ANY CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS CHANGES TO

DEVELOPMENT PLANS, REGULATIONS OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES, WHICH WOULD WARRANT A REVISION TO RESERVE

ESTIMATES. FOR 2009, THIS ASSESSMENT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN RESERVES CLASSIFIED

AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE RATIO OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO TOTAL

PROVED RESERVES HAS RANGED BETWEEN 35 AND 39 PERCENT. THE CONSISTENT COMPLETION OF MAJOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS HAS KEPT THE RATIO IN A NARROW RANGE OVER THIS TIME PERIOD.

PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS WERE 8.3 BILLION BARRELS. (REFER TO THE TERM RESERVES ON PAGE E-42 FOR

THE DEFINITION OF OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.) APPROXIMATELY 22 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RESERVES WERE

LOCATED

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUITY AFFILIATES, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES

WERE 3.0 BILLION BARRELS, 80 PERCENT OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT

OWNERSHIP IN TCO.

ASIDE FROM THE TENGIZ FIELD IN THE TCO AFFILIATE, NO SINGLE PROPERTY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. ABOUT 25 OTHER INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES

IN THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS EACH CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT AND 5 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

48

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL PROVED RESERVES. THESE PROPERTIES WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED,

LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, SOUTH AMERICA, WEST AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, SOUTHEAST ASIA,

AND AUSTRALIA.

IN THE UNITED STATES, TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2009 WERE 1.8 BILLION BARRELS.

CALIFORNIA PROPERTIES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 44 PERCENT OF THE U.S. RESERVES, WITH MOST

CLASSIFIED AS HEAVY OIL. BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE NEED TO EMPLOY ENHANCED

RECOVERY METHODS, THE PRODUCING OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE IN NATURE. MOST OF THE COMPANYS

HEAVY-OIL FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOY

A CONTINUOUS STEAMFLOODING PROCESS. THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION CONTAINS ABOUT 22 PERCENT OF THE U.S. RESERVES,

WITH LIQUIDS REPRESENTING ABOUT 15 PERCENT OF RESERVES. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE

AND, AS A RESULT, ARE ALSO CAPITAL INTENSIVE. OTHER U.S. AREAS REPRESENT THE REMAINING 34 PERCENT

OF U.S. RESERVES, WHICH ARE ABOUT EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS. FOR PRODUCTION OF

CRUDE OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, INCLUDING WATER-FLOOD AND CO

2

INJECTION.

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EVENTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE COMPANYS CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT PERMITTING,

PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, DECLINES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS,

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND CHANGES THERETO FOR THE

YEARS 2007, 2008 AND 2009 ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE AND ON PAGE FS-74.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF LIQUIDS PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2007 THROUGH 2009

ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2007, NET REVISIONS DECREASED RESERVES BY 146 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND INCREASED RESERVES BY 103 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE LARGEST DOWNWARD NET REVISIONS WERE 89 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA AND 54

MILLION BARRELS IN ASIA.

IN 2008, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 536 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES AND INCREASED RESERVES BY 267 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS IN THE ASIA REGION, WHICH ADDED 574 MILLION BARRELS. THE

MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE WAS IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE, AS A RESULT OF A CONCESSION EXTENSION, AND

INDONESIA, DUE TO LOWER YEAR-END PRICES. UPWARD

REVISIONS WERE ALSO RECORDED IN KAZAKHSTAN AND AZERBAIJAN AND WERE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

EFFECT OF LOWER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-SHARING

AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY CONTRACTS. IN INDONESIA, RESERVES INCREASED DUE MAINLY TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER

YEAR-END PRICES ON THE RESERVE CALCULATIONS FOR

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS A RESULT

OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND IMPROVED WATERFLOOD AND STEAM-FLOOD PERFORMANCE. THESE INCREASES WERE

OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER REGIONS. FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, THE

249 MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR TCO WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF LOWER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE ROYALTY

DETERMINATION AND FACILITY OPTIMIZATION AT THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV FIELDS.

IN 2009, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 355 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES AND DECREASED RESERVES BY 187 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS 460 MILLION BARRELS IN THE OTHER REGIONS DUE TO THE INCLUSION

OF SYNTHETIC OIL RELATED TO CANADIAN OIL SANDS. IN THE UNITED STATES, RESERVES INCREASED 63

MILLION BARRELS AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND PERFORMANCE REVISIONS. THE INCREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES OF 121 MILLION BARRELS IN ASIA AND 46 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA. IN

ASIA, DECREASES IN INDONESIA AND AZERBAIJAN WERE DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER 12-MONTH AVERAGE

PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS AND THE EFFECT

OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE REVISIONS. IN AFRICA, RESERVES IN NIGERIA DECLINED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS AND RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, TCO DECLINED BY 184 MILLION-BARRELS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF

HIGHER 12-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION. FOR OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES, 266

MILLION BARRELS OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL WERE RECLASSIFIED TO SYNTHETIC OIL FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN

VENEZUELA.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN 2007, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 20 MILLION BARRELS

WORLDWIDE. NO ADDITION WAS INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

IN 2008, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED WORLDWIDE LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 37 MILLION BARRELS. FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE LARGEST ADDITION WAS IN THE ASIA REGION RELATED TO GAS REINJECTION IN

KAZAKHSTAN. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 10 MILLION BARRELS DUE TO IMPROVED SECONDARY

RECOVERY AT BOSCAN.

IN 2009, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 86 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE.

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR 50 MILLION BARRELS. THE LARGEST ADDITION WAS RELATED TO

IMPROVED SECONDARY RECOVERY IN NIGERIA. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 36 MILLION BARRELS

DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS RELATED TO THE TCO SGI/SGP FACILITIES.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2007, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 60

MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE. THE LARGEST ADDITIONS WERE 36 MILLION BARRELS IN THE UNITED STATES,

MAINLY FOR THE DEEPWATER TAHITI AND MAD DOG FIELDS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

IN 2008, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED CONSOLIDATED COMPANY RESERVES 33 MILLION BARRELS

WORLDWIDE. THE UNITED STATES INCREASED RESERVES 17 MILLION BARRELS, PRIMARILY IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO. THE AFRICA, ASIA, AND OTHER REGIONS INCREASED RESERVES 16 MILLION BARRELS WITH NO ONE

COUNTRY RESULTING IN ADDITIONS GREATER THAN 5 MILLION BARRELS.

IN 2009, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 52 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE.

THE LARGEST ADDITIONS WERE 33 MILLION BARRELS IN OTHER REGIONS RELATED TO THE GORGON PROJECT IN

AUSTRALIA AND DELINEATION DRILLING IN ARGENTINA. AFRICA AND THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR 10

MILLION BARRELS AND 6 MILLION BARRELS, RESPECTIVELY.

PURCHASES

IN 2007, ACQUISITIONS OF 316 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES RELATED TO THE

FORMATION OF A NEW HAMACA EQUITY AFFILIATE IN VENEZUELA.

PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2007 THROUGH

2009 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2007, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY 395 BCF AND

INCREASED RESERVES FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES BY 73 BCF. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET INCREASES OF

346 BCF IN ASIA AND 209 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF 160

BCF IN AFRICA AND OTHER REGIONS. IN THE ASIA REGION, DRILLING ACTIVITIES IN THAILAND ADDED 360 BCF,

WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS IN AZERBAIJAN AND KAZAKHSTAN DUE TO THE IMPACT OF

HIGHER PRICES. IN THE UNITED STATES, IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE FOR MANY FIELDS CONTRIBUTED TO

THE INCREASE WITH THE LARGEST PORTION IN THE

MID-CONTINENT AREAS. DECREASES IN AFRICA WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO A 136 BCF DOWNWARD REVISION IN NIGERIA RESULTING FROM FIELD PERFORMANCE. THE OTHER

REGIONS HAD NET DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF 19 BCF. A 185 BCF DOWNWARD REVISION IN AUSTRALIA DUE TO

DRILLING RESULTS AND OTHER SMALLER DECLINES

WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO WHICH ADDED 188 BCF.

TCO HAD AN UPWARD REVISION OF 75 BCF ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THIS UPWARD REVISION WAS NET OF A NEGATIVE IMPACT DUE TO HIGHER YEAR-END

PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION.

IN 2008, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY 1,166 BCF AND

INCREASED RESERVES FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES BY 1,130 BCF. IN THE ASIA REGION, POSITIVE REVISIONS

TOTALED 1,073 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. ALMOST HALF OF THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE

KARACHAGANAK FIELD IN KAZAKHSTAN, DUE MAINLY TO THE EFFECTS OF LOW YEAR-END PRICES ON THE

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT AND THE RESULTS OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND IMPROVED RECOVERY. OTHER

LARGE UPWARD REVISIONS WERE RECORDED FOR THE PATTANI FIELD IN THAILAND DUE TO A SUCCESSFUL DRILLING

CAMPAIGN.

FOR THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, AN INCREASE OF 498 BCF REFLECTED THE IMPACTS OF LOWER

YEAR-END PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND FACILITY OPTIMIZATION. RESERVES ASSOCIATED

FS-74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES

WITH THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE

632 BCF

INCREASE IN OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

IN 2009, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 569 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND DECREASED

RESERVES BY 44 BCF FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET INCREASES WERE 493 BCF

IN ASIA PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF RESERVOIR STUDIES IN BANGLADESH AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN

THAILAND. THESE RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DOWNWARD REVISION DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN MYANMAR. THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER REGIONS INCREASED

RESERVES 39 BCF AND 33 BCF, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE UNITED STATES, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PERFORMANCE REVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA AND MID-CONTINENT AREAS. IN

OTHER REGIONS, IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND COMPRESSION IN AUSTRALIA WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN TRINIDAD.

FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES, A DOWNWARD REVISION OF 237 BCF AT TCO WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND AN INCREASE IN GAS INJECTION FOR SGI/SGP FACILITIES. THIS

DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PERFORMANCE AND DRILLING OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO THE ANGOLA LNG

PROJECT.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2007, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF

518 BCF WORLDWIDE. THE LARGEST ADDITION WAS 330 BCF IN BANGLADESH, THE RESULT OF DRILLING

ACTIVITIES. OTHER ADDITIONS WERE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

IN 2009, WORLDWIDE EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES OF 4,387 BCF WERE ATTRIBUTED TO CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES. THE GORGON PROJECT IN AUSTRALIA ACCOUNTED FOR ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE 4,277 BCF ADDITIONS

IN THE OTHER REGIONS. IN ASIA, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN THAILAND ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE

INCREASE. IN THE UNITED STATES, DELINEATION DRILLING IN CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

THE INCREASE.

PURCHASES

IN 2007, PURCHASES OF NATURAL GAS RESERVES WERE 141 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

WHICH INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF AN ADDITIONAL INTEREST IN THE BIBIYANA FIELD IN BANGLADESH.

AFFILIATED COMPANY PURCHASES OF 211 BCF RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW HAMACA EQUITY AFFILIATE

IN VENEZUELA AND AN INITIAL BOOKING RELATED TO THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT.

SALES

IN 2007, SALES WERE 76 BCF AND 175 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES,

RESPECTIVELY. THE AFFILIATED COMPANY SALES RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF A HAMACA EQUITY AFFILIATE

IN VENEZUELA.

IN 2009, WORLDWIDE SALES OF 117 BCF WERE RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. FOR THE OTHER

REGIONS, THE SALE OF PROPERTIES IN ARGENTINA ACCOUNTED FOR 84 BCF. THE SALE OF PROPERTIES IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE 33 BCF DECREASE IN THE UNITED STATES.

TABLE VI

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING PROVED

OIL AND GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FASB. ESTIMATED

FUTURE CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING

12 MONTH-AVERAGE PRICES FOR OIL AND

GAS TO YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE LIMITED TO

THOSE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND

PRODUCE YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF

YEAR-END ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END STATUTORY TAX RATES.

THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PRETAX

NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE

CALCULATED USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR

ESTIMATE OF WHEN FUTURE EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES

ARE IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND

POSSIBLE RESERVES, WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE

ARBITRARY VALUATION PRESCRIBED BY THE FASB REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND

SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL

AND GAS RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED MEASURE NET CASH FLOWS REFERS TO THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS.
