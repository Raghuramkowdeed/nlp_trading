cautionary
statement relevant to forward-looking information
for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the
private securities litigation reform act of 1995
this annual report on
form10-k
of chevron corporation contains forward-looking statements
relating to chevrons operations that are based on
managements current expectations, estimates and
projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
energy-related industries. words such as
anticipates, expects,
intends, plans, targets,
projects, believes, seeks,
schedules, estimates,
budgets and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. these statements are
not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
the companys control and are difficult to predict.
therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
statements. the reader should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. unless legally required, chevron undertakes no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.
among the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
are: changing crude-oil and natural-gas prices; changing
refining, marketing and chemical margins; actions of competitors
or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of
crude-oil liftings; the competitiveness of
alternate-energy
sources or product substitutes; technological developments; the
results of operations and financial condition of equity
affiliates; the inability or failure of the companys
joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and
development activities; the potential failure to achieve
expected net production from existing and future crude-oil and
natural-gas development projects; potential delays in the
development, construction or
start-up of
planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of
the companys net production or manufacturing facilities or
delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents,
political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude-oil
production quotas that might be imposed by the organization of
petroleum exporting countries; the potential liability for
remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment
or product changes under existing or future environmental
statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability
resulting from other pending or future litigation; the
companys future acquisition or disposition of assets and
gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments;
government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations,
industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions
on scope of company operations; foreign-currency movements
compared with the u.s.dollar; the effects of changed
accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles
promulgated by
rule-setting
bodies; and the factors set forth under the heading risk
factors on pages 30 through 32 in this report. in
addition, such statements could be affected by general domestic
and international economic and political conditions.
unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report
could also have material adverse effects on
forward-looking
statements.

summary
description of chevron
chevron corporation,* a delaware corporation, manages its
investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides
administrative, financial, management and technology support to
u.s.and international subsidiaries that engage in fully
integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining
operations, power generation and energy services. exploration
and production (upstream) operations consist of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also
marketing natural gas. refining, marketing and transportation
(downstream) operations relate to refining crude oil and
converting natural gas into finished petroleum products;
marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail
car. chemicals operations include the manufacture and marketing
of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and
fuel and lubricant oil additives.
a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pages e-23
and e-24. as
of december31, 2009, chevron had approximately
64,000employees (including about 4,000 service station
employees). approximately 31,500employees (including about
3,500 service station employees), or 49percent, were
employed in u.s.operations.
overview
of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
control over some of them. governmental policies, particularly
in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a
significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
their operations and formulate their products and, in some
cases, limiting their profits directly. prices for crude oil,
natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
determined by supply and demand for these commodities. however,
some governments impose price controls on refined products such
as gasoline or diesel fuel. the members of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec) are typically the
worlds swing producers of crude oil, and their production
levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
other energy sources also play a significant part. seasonality
is not a primary driver of changes in the companys
quarterly earnings during the year.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron
competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies,
as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the
acquisition of crude-oil and natural-gas leases and other
properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop
and operate those properties. in its downstream business,
chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum
companies and other independent refining, marketing and
transportation entities and national petroleum companies in the
sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many
national and international markets.

form10-k
in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations for a discussion of the
companys current business environment and outlook.
*incorporated in delaware in
1926 as standard oil company of california, the company adopted
the name chevron corporation in 1984 and chevrontexaco
corporation in 2001. in 2005, chevrontexaco corporation changed
its name to chevron corporation. as used in this report, the
term chevron and such terms as the
company, the corporation, our,
we and us may refer to chevron
corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or
all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise, it
does not include affiliates of chevron
i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method
(generally owned 50percent or less) or investments
accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms are used
for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.

strategic direction
chevrons primary objective is to create stockholder value
and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
will enable it to outperform its competitors. in the upstream,
the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core
areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
companys equity natural-gas resource base while growing a
high-impact global gas business. in the downstream, the
strategies are to improve returns and selectively grow, with a
focus on integrated value creation. the company also continues
to invest in renewable-energy technologies, with an objective of
capturing profitable positions.

description
of business and properties
the upstream, downstream and chemicals activities of the company
and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically,
with operations in north america, south america, europe, africa,
the middle east, asia and australia. tabulations of segment
sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes
for the three years ending december31, 2009, and assets as
of the end of 2009 and 2008 for the united states
and the companys international geographic
areas are in note11 to the consolidated
financial statements beginning on
pagefs-40.
similar comparative data for the companys investments in
and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
equipment are in notes12 and 13 on pages fs-43 through
fs-45.
capital
and exploratory expenditures
total expenditures for 2009 were $22.2billion, including
$1.6billion for the companys share of
equity-affiliate expenditures. in 2008 and 2007, expenditures
were $22.8billion and $20billion, respectively,
including the companys share of affiliates
expenditures of $2.3billion in both periods.
of the $22.2billion in expenditures for 2009, about
three-fourths, or $17.1billion, was related to upstream
activities. approximately the same percentage was also expended
for upstream operations in 2008 and 2007. international upstream
accounted for about 80percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in 2009 and about 70percent in 2008 and 2007,
reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities
available outside the united states.
in 2010, the company estimates capital and exploratory
expenditures will be $21.6billion, including
$1.6billion of spending by affiliates. about
80percent of the total, or $17.3billion, is budgeted
for exploration and production activities, with
$13.2billion of that amount for projects outside the
united states.

respectively.
worldwide oil-equivalent production, including volumes from oil
sands (refer to footnote 2 above), was 2.7million barrels
per day, up about 7percent from 2008. the increase was
mostly associated with the
start-up of
the blind faith and tahiti fields in the u.s.gulf of
mexico in late 2008 and the second quarter 2009, respectively,
the commencement of operations in the third quarter 2008 at the
agbami field in nigeria, and the expansion at tengiz in
kazakhstan. refer to the results of operations
section beginning on
pagefs-6
for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
2007-2009
changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and
natural gas.
the company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent
production in 2010 will be approximately 2.73million
barrels per day. this estimate is subject to many uncertainties,
including quotas that may be imposed by opec, the price effect
on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in
fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
delays in project
start-ups,
fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, and
production that may have to be shut in due to weather
conditions, civil unrest,

changing geopolitics or other disruptions to operations. future
production levels also are affected by the size and number of
economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale
projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the
beginning of production. refer to the review of ongoing

delivery
commitments
the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
operations under a variety of contractual obligations. most
contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
on production from specified properties, but some natural-gas
sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
quantities, as discussed below.
in the united states, the company has no fixed and determinable
delivery commitments to third-parties or affiliates.
outside the united states, the company is contractually
committed to deliver to third parties a total of
821billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2010 through
2012 from australia, colombia, denmark and the philippines. the
sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
delivery. the company believes it can satisfy these contracts
from quantities available from production of the companys
proved developed reserves in australia, colombia, denmark and
the philippines.

equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas or, in
the case of a dry well, the reporting of abandonment to the
appropriate agency. some exploratory wells are not drilled with
the intention of producing from the well bore. in such cases,
completion refers to the completion of drilling.
further categorization of productive or dry is based on the
determination as to whether hydrocarbons in a sufficient
quantity were found to justify completion as a producing well,
whether or not the well is actually going to be completed as a
producer.
represents wells that are in the
process of drilling but have been neither abandoned nor
completed as of the last day of the year, including wells for
which drilling was not completed and which were temporarily
suspended at the end of 2009. gross wells include the total
number of wells in which the company has an interest. net wells
include wholly owned wells and the sum of the companys
fractional interests in gross wells.

274,000barrels per day, composed of 226,000barrels
of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 289million cubic
feet of natural gas.
in 2009, tco continued
ramp-up of
the sour gas injection (sgi) and second generation plant (sgp)
facilities. the sgi facility injects approximately one-third of
the sour gas separated from the crude oil back into the
reservoir. the injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure
and displaces oil towards producing wells. tco is evaluating
options for another expansion project based on sgi/sgp
technologies.
during 2009, the majority of tcos crude-oil production was
exported through the caspian pipeline consortium (cpc) pipeline
that runs from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities
at novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black sea. the
balance was shipped via other export routes, which included
shipment via tanker to baku for transport by the btc pipeline to
ceyhan or by rail to black sea ports. (refer to

vietnam:the company operates off the southwest
coast and has a 42.4percent interest in a psc that
includes blocks b and 48/95, and a 43.4percent interest in
another psc for block52/97. in august 2009, chevron
reduced its ownership interest in a third operated psc to
20percent in block b122 offshore eastern vietnam. no
production occurred in these areas during 2009.
in the blocks off the southwest coast, the vietnam gas project
is aimed at developing an area in the malay basin to supply
natural gas to state-owned petrovietnam. the project includes
installation of wellhead and hub platforms, a floating storage
and offloading vessel, field pipelines and a central processing
platform. the project is expected to enter front-end engineering
and design (feed) in the first quarter 2010, and a final
investment decision is expected in 2011. maximum total
production is planned to be about 500 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day. at the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
been recognized for this project.
in conjunction with the vietnam gas project, a
petrovietnam-operated pipeline will be required to support the
offshore development. chevron will have a 28.7percent
interest in the pipeline, which is planned to transport natural
gas from the offshore development to customers in southern
vietnam.
during the year, the company continued to analyze well results
and seismic processing from block b and block52/97. in
block122,
2-d seismic
data processing and geologic studies were completed. an
exploration well is planned for 2011. proved reserves had not
been recognized as of the end of 2009. future activity in
block122may be affected by an ongoing territorial
dispute between vietnam and china.
china:chevron has one operated and three nonoperated working interests in several areas. net oil-equivalent production from the nonoperated areas in 2009 averaged 19,000barrels per day, composed of 17,000barrels of crude oil and condensate and 16million cubic feet of natural gas.the company holds a 49percent-owned and operated interest in the chuandongbei area in the onshore sichuan basin, where the company entered into a 30-year psc effective february 2008 to develop natural-gas resources. project plans included two sour-gas purification plants with an aggregate design capacity of 740million cubic feet per day. during 2009, general infrastructure for the plant site and well pads progressed. development drilling and the construction and installation of additional processing facilities and gathering systems are expected to start in 2010. proved reserves have been recognized for this project. the psc for chuandongbei expires in 2038.in the south china sea, the company has nonoperated working interests of 32.7percent in blocks 16/08 and 16/19 located in the pearl river delta mouth basin, 24.5percent in the qhd-32-6 field in bohai bay, and 16.2percent in the unitized and producing bz 25-1 and bz 19-4 crude-oil fields in bohai bay block11/19. in
november 2009, a storm damaged the floating production, storage
and offloading (fpso) vessel utilized by the companys
nonoperated assets in block11/19. temporary and permanent
recovery options are under development and production is
expected to fully resume in 2012.
the joint development of the hz25-3 and hz25-1 crude-oil fields
in block 16/19 continued through the end of 2009. first
production was delayed from the third quarter 2009 and is
expected to be fully restored in the fourth quarter 2010
following damage to the fpso vessel caused by a typhoon that

chevron advanced its development plans for the gendalo and gehem
deepwater natural-gas fields located in the kutei basin. feed
started in december 2009, with completion dependent upon
achieving project milestones and receipt of government
approvals. the bangka deepwater natural-gas project was
progressed during the year under a revised, lower-cost
development plan. the project is expected to enter feed in the
second quarter 2010. under the terms of the pscs for both
projects, the companys 80percent-owned and operated
interest is expected to be reduced to 72percent in 2010
with the farm-in of an indonesian company. at the end of 2009,
the company had not recognized proved reserves for either of
these projects.
also in the kutei basin, first production at the seturian field
occurred in september 2009, which is providing natural gas to a
state-owned refinery. during 2009, evaluation of the
50percent-owned and operated sadewa project in the kutei
basin was suspended.
a drilling campaign continued through 2009 in south natuna sea
block b to provide additional supply for long-term natural-gas
sales contracts with additional development drilling planned for
2010. the north belut development project achieved first
production in november 2009. the south belut development project
was under review during the year.
a two-well exploration program was conducted in the central
sumatra basin in 2009. one commercial discovery was made in the
rokan block, and a second well in the siak block resulted in a
dry hole. chevrons working interests in two exploration
blocks in western papua, west papua i and west papua iii, are
expected to be reduced to 51percent interests in 2010.

57.1percent for barrow and 51.4percent for thevenard.
also off the northwest coast of australia, chevron holds
significant equity interests in the large natural-gas resource
of the greater gorgon area. the company initially held a
50percent ownership interest across most of the area and
is the operator of the gorgon project. chevron and its
joint-venture partners are proceeding with the combined
development of gorgon and nearby natural-gas fields as one
large-scale project. environmental approval from the australian
commonwealth government was issued in august 2009. in september
2009, the company announced the final investment decision and
total estimated project costs for the first phase of development
of $37billion (au$43billion). the
projects scope includes a three-train,
15million-metric-ton-per-year lng facility; a carbon
sequestration project; and a domestic natural-gas plant. natural
gas for the project is expected to be supplied from the gorgon
and io/jansz fields.
in 2009, long-term, binding agreements were finalized with four
asian customers for the delivery of about 4.4million
metric tons per year of lng from the gorgon project. equity
sales agreements with three of the customers reduced
chevrons interest in the project to 47.3percent at
the end of 2009. nonbinding heads of agreements (hoa) for
delivery of an additional 2.1million metric tons per year
of lng were also signed with three additional asian customers in
2009 and early 2010. negotiations continue to finalize binding
sales agreements, which would bring lng delivery commitments to
a combined total of about 90percent of chevrons
share of lng from the project. during 2009, the company
recognized proved reserves for the greater gorgon area fields
included in the project. first production of natural gas from
these fields is expected in 2014. the projects estimated
economic life exceeds 40years from the time of
start-up.
development of the companys majority-owned and operated
wheatstone and iago fields, located offshore western australia,
continued with the project entering front-end engineering and
design (feed) in july 2009. chevron operates the project and

average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2009
was 91percent, compared with 87percent in 2008,
largely a result of improved utilization at the refineries in
mississippi, canada and thailand. at the u.s.fuel
refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged
96percent in 2009, compared with 95percent in 2008,
and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged
85percent and 86percent in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. cracking and coking units are the primary
facilities used in fuel refineries to convert heavier feedstocks
into gasoline and other light products.
the companys refineries in the united states, the united
kingdom, canada, south africa and australia produce low-sulfur
fuels. during 2009, gs caltex, the companys

complex. project completion is expected in 2010. modifications
were completed in 2009 that enable the companys
50percent-owned singapore refining companys refinery
to meet regional specifications for clean diesel fuels.
at the pascagoula refinery, construction progressed on a
continuous catalytic reformer that is expected to improve
refinery reliability. planning continued for a premium base-oil
facility at the companys pascagoula refinery. the facility
is being designed to produce approximately 25,000barrels
per day of premium base oil for use in manufacturing
high-performance lubricants, such as motor oils for consumer and
commercial applications. at the refinery in el segundo,
california, design, engineering and construction work advanced
during 2009 on projects that will reduce feedstock costs and
improve yields.
at the beginning of 2009, chevron held a 5percent interest
in reliance petroleum limited, a company formed by reliance
industries limited to construct a new refinery in jamnagar,
india. during the year, the company sold its 5percent
interest to reliance industries limited.
chevron processes imported and domestic crude oil in its
u.s.refining operations. imported crude oil accounted for
about 85percent and 88percent of chevrons
u.s.refinery inputs in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

64percent ownership interest in southcap pipeline company,
which included chevrons 13.4percent ownership
interest in the capline pipeline.
chevron has a 15percent interest in the caspian pipeline
consortium (cpc) affiliate. cpc operates a crude-oil export
pipeline from the tengiz field in kazakhstan to the russian
black sea port of novorossiysk. during 2009, cpc transported an
average of approximately 743,000barrels of crude oil per
day, including 597,000barrels per day from kazakhstan and
146,000barrels per day from russia. in december 2009,
partners approved the expansion project implementation plan,
which is expected to increase the pipeline capacity to
1.4million barrels per day. a final investment decision is
expected in late 2010.
the company has an 8.9percent interest in the
baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc) affiliate that owns and operates a
pipeline that primarily transports crude oil produced by
azerbaijan international operating company (aioc) (owned
10.3percent by chevron) from baku, azerbaijan, through
georgia to deepwater port facilities in ceyhan, turkey. the btc
pipeline has a crude-oil capacity of 1.2million barrels
per day and transports the majority of the aioc production.
another production export route for crude oil is the western
route export pipeline, wholly owned by aioc, with capacity to
transport 145,000barrels per day from baku, azerbaijan, to
the marine terminal at supsa, georgia.
chevron is the largest shareholder, with a 37percent
interest, in the west african gas pipeline company limited

the federal oil pollution act of 1990 requires the phase-out by
year-end 2010 of all single-hull tankers trading to
u.s.ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
u.s.exclusive economic zone. as of the end of 2009, the
companys owned and chartered fleet was completely
double-hulled. the company is a member of many
oil-spill-response cooperatives in areas in which it operates
around the world.
chemicals
chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) is equally owned
with conocophillips corporation. at the end of 2009, cpchem
owned or had joint-venture interests in 34 manufacturing

businesses
mining
chevrons
u.s.-based
mining company produces and markets coal and molybdenum. sales
occur in both u.s.and international markets.
the company owns and is the operator of a surface coal mine in
kemmerer, wyoming, an underground coal mine, northriver,
in alabama, and a surface coal mine in mckinley, new mexico. the
company continues to actively market for sale its coal reserves
at the north river mine and elsewhere in alabama. the decision
was made in late 2009 to suspend production at the mckinley
mine, and conduct reclamation activities in 2010. the company
also owns a 50percent interest in youngs creek mining
company llc, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern
wyoming. coal sales from wholly owned mines in 2009 were
10million tons, down about 1million tons from 2008.
at year-end 2009, chevron controlled approximately
193million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in
the unitedstates, including reserves of low-sulfur coal.
the company is contractually committed to deliver between
7million and 9million tons of coal per year through
the end of 2012 and believes it will satisfy these contracts
from existing coal reserves.
table of contents
in addition to the coal operations, chevron owns and operates
the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico. at year-end 2009,
chevron controlled approximately 53million pounds of
proven molybdenum reserves at questa. underground development
and production plans at questa were scaled back in 2009 in
response to weakening prices for molybdenum.
power
generation
chevrons power generation business has interests in 13
power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100
megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the united states
and asia. twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and
gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize waste heat
recovery to produce electricity and support industrial thermal
hosts. the thirteenth facility is a wind farm, located in
casper, wyoming, that began operating in late 2009. the
100percent-owned and operated casper wind farm is a
small-scale wind power facility designed to optimize the
efficient use of a decommissioned refinery site for delivery of
clean, renewable energy to the local utility provider.
the company has major geothermal operations in indonesia and the
philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
technologies for use in oil-field operations as part of its
renewable-energy strategy. for additional information on the
companys geothermal operations and renewable energy
projects, refer to page 18 and research and

chevron
energy solutions
chevron energy solutions (ces) is a wholly owned subsidiary that
designs and implements sustainable solutions for public
institutions and businesses to increase energy efficiency and
reliability, reduce energy costs, and utilize renewable and
alternative-power technologies. since 2000, ces has developed
hundreds of projects that help governments, educational
institutions and other customers reduce their energy costs and
environmental impact. major projects completed by ces in 2009
included solar and energy-efficiency installations for the los
angeles county metropolitan transportation authority and the
sanjose unified school district, which were the largest
projects of their kind for a u.s.transit authority and
school district.
research
and technology
the companys energy technology organization supports
chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by providing
technology, services and competency development in earth
sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and
completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process
technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health,
environment and safety. the information technology organization
integrates computing, telecommunications, data management,
security and network technology to provide a standardized
digital infrastructure and enable chevrons global
operations and business processes.
chevron technology ventures (ctv) manages investments and
projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
into chevrons core businesses. as of the end of 2009, ctv
continued to explore technologies such as next-generation
biofuels and advanced solar.
chevrons research and development expenses were
$603million, $702million and $510million for
the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are
not certain. the companys overall investment in this area
is not significant to the companys consolidated financial
position.
environmental
protection
virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are
subject to various u.s.federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
similar laws and regulations in other countries. these
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to
become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business.
in 2009, the companys u.s.capitalized environmental
expenditures were approximately $887million, representing
approximately 15percent of the companys total
consolidated u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures.
these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with
new
table of contents
facilities. the expenditures relate mostly to air- and
water-quality projects and activities at the companys
refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
facilities. for 2010, the company estimates u.s.capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
approximately $831million. the future annual capital costs
are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
future changes to regulatory requirements.
chevron expects an increase in environment-related regulations,
including those that are intended to address concerns about
greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, in the
countries where it has operations. for instance, under
californias global warming solutions act enacted in 2006,
the california air resources board (carb), charged with
implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon fuel standard
intended to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels,
which is expected to apply beginning in 2011. additionally, carb
is expected to propose regulations to implement the cap
and trade emissions regulation provisions of the law, for
adoption in the second half 2010. the effect of any such
regulation on the companys business is uncertain.

item1a.
risk
factors
chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a
diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a
history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. nevertheless,
some inherent risks could materially impact the companys
financial results of operations or financial condition.
chevron
is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
prices.
chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the
companys results of operations is the price of crude oil,
which can be influenced by general economic conditions and
geopolitical risk.
during extended periods of historically low prices for crude
oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and
exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected.
upstream assets may also become impaired. the impact on
downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for
refined products and the associated margins on refined-product
sales.
the
scope of chevrons business will decline if the company
does not successfully develop resources.
the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron
is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
produces with good prospects for future production or through
acquisitions, the companys business will decline. creating
and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many
factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore,
develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to
bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion
on budget and schedule; and efficient and profitable operation
of mature properties.
the
companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human
factors.
chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
inhospitable regions. the companys operations and
facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes, including hurricanes, floods and other
forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political
events, fires, earthquakes, explosions and system failures, any
of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to
people or the natural environment.
table of contents
chevrons
business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation
or government action.
the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
companys business. chevron operations also produce
byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. often these
operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the
company may have limited influence and control. any of these
activities could result in liability arising from private
litigation or government action, either as a result of an
accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
on the effects of the companys operations on human health
or the environment. in addition, to the extent that societal
pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is
possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to
the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted
damage or to other mitigating factors.
political
instability could harm chevrons business.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
governments to increase public ownership of the companys
partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional
taxes or royalties.
in certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal
unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
government and the company or other governments may affect the
companys operations. those developments have, at times,
significantly affected the companys related operations and
results and are carefully considered by management when
evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries. at december31, 2009, 26percent of the
companys net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan.
the company also has significant interests in organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec)-member countries including
angola, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone
between saudi arabia and kuwait. twenty-two percent of the
companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were
located in opec countries at december31, 2009.
regulation
of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons
operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons
products.
continued political attention to issues concerning climate
change, the role of human activity in it and potential
mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on
the companys operations and financial results.
international agreements and national or regional legislation
and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are
currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. for
instance, the kyoto protocol, australias proposed
legislation and californias global warming solutions act,
along with other actual or pending federal, state and provincial
regulations, envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
through market-based regulatory programs, technology-based or
performance-based standards or a combination of them. the
company is subject to existing greenhouse gas emissions limits
in jurisdictions where such regulation is currently effective,
including the european union and new zealand.
in december 2009, the u.s.environmental protection agency
(epa) issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases,
which specifically found that emissions of six greenhouse gases
threaten the public health and welfare and that greenhouse gases
from new motor vehicles and engines also contribute to such
pollution. these findings do not themselves impose regulatory
requirements. however, the agency is currently in the process of
promulgating greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty
vehicles and regulations that would require certain stationary
source facilities that exceed an as-yet undetermined threshold
to obtain permits in advance, which permits could require
implementation of so-called best available control
technologies. in june 2009, the u.s.house of
representatives approved the american clean energy and security
act. this is known as the waxman-markey bill, which includes
provisions for a
cap-and-trade
program, aimed at controlling and reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases in the united states. at this time it is not
possible to predict whether or when the u.s.senate may act
on climate change legislation, how any bill approved by the
senate will be reconciled with the waxman-markey legislation or
whether any federal legislation will supersede the epas
regulatory actions.
these and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies
and regulations, may result in substantial capital, compliance,
operating and maintenance costs. the level of expenditure
required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain
and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws
enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in
it and market conditions. the companys exploration and
production of crude oil, natural gas and
table of contents
various minerals such as coal; the upgrading of production from
oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion
of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the
processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the
transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products
and consumers or customers use of the companys
products result in greenhouse gas emissions that could well be
regulated. some of these activities, such as consumers and
customers use of the companys products, as well as
actions taken by the companys competitors in response to
such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control.
the effect of regulation on the companys financial
performance will depend on a number of factors, including, among
others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions
reductions required by law, the extent to which chevron would be
entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or need to
purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through
auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and
credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on
the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through
the pricing of the companys products. material price
increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy
sources could reduce demand for products the company currently
sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes,
revenues and margins.
changes
in managements estimates and assumptions may have a
material impact on the companys consolidated financial
statements and financial or operations performance in any given
period.
in preparing the companys periodic reports under the
securities exchange act of 1934, including its financial
statements, chevrons management is required under
applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and
assumptions as of a specified date. these estimates and
assumptions are based on managements best estimates and
experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk
and uncertainty. materially different results may occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by
management include measurement of benefit obligations for
pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of

legal
proceedings
ecuadorchevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit
before the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio, ecuador,
brought in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be
representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil
production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit
alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and
production operations, and seeks unspecified damages to fund
environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged
environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. until
1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of texaco
inc., was a minority member of this consortium with
petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the
majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted
solely by petroecuador. at the conclusion of the consortium and
following an independent third-party environmental audit of the
concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the
republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate
specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to
texpets ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to
that agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation
program at a cost of $40million. after certifying that the
sites were properly remediated, the government granted texpet
and all related corporate entities a full release from any and
all environmental liability arising from the consortium
operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this
lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. as to matters of law, the
company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over
chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs
table of contents
bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied
retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute
of limitations in ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also
barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet
by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador. with regard to the
facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that
texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the
remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors
failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and
petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control
over the operations.
in april 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to
identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to
specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report
recommending that the court assess $8billion, which would,
according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for
purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for,
among other items, environmental remediation, health care
systems, and additional infrastructure for petroecuador. the
engineers report also asserted that an additional
$8.3billion could be assessed against chevron for unjust
enrichment. the engineers report is not binding on the
court. chevron also believes that the engineers work was
performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law
and in violation of the courts orders. chevron submitted a
rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to strike the
report in its entirety. in november 2008, the engineer revised
the report and, without additional evidence, recommended an
increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to
a total of $18.9billion and an increase in the assessment
for purported unjust enrichment to a total of $8.4billion.
chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, which the
court dismissed. in september 2009, following the disclosure by
chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in
which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
government officials discussed the case and its likely
outcome, the judge presiding over the case petitioned to
be recused. in late september 2009, the judge was recused, and
in october 2009, the full chamber of the provincial court
affirmed the recusal, resulting in the appointment of a new
judge. chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by
the prior judge, but the new judge denied these motions. the
court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case
and could render a judgment at any time. chevron will continue a
vigorous defense of any attempted imposition of liability.
in the event of an adverse judgment, chevron would expect to
pursue its appeals and vigorously defend against enforcement of
any such judgment; therefore, the ultimate outcome
and any financial effect on chevron remains
uncertain. management does not believe an estimate of a
reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in
this case. due to the defects associated with the
engineers report, management does not believe the report
has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a
range of loss). moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment
surrounding the case provides no basis for management to
estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).
government proceedings
in november 2008, the california air resources board (carb)
proposed a civil penalty against the companys sacramento,
california, terminal for alleged violations between august and
december 2007 of carbs regulations governing the minimum
concentration of additives in gasoline. due to a computer
programming error, the sacramento terminals automatic
dispensers had failed to inject additive detergent into a
gasoline line.
in november 2008, carb proposed a civil penalty against the
companys richmond, california, refinery for a notice of
violation relating to gasoline that was not properly certified
as to composition. the company corrected the composition
certificates for the gasoline without requiring any change to
the composition of the gasoline. in july 2009, carb issued the
refinery a notice of violation relating to an error in gasoline
blending that caused the product composition certifications to
be in error. the composition certifications were corrected
without requiring any change to the gasoline. discussions with
carb officials relating to all of these matters took place in
the fourth quarter 2009 and continue in 2010.
in july 2009, the hawaii department of health (doh)
alleged that chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil
penalties exceeding $100,000 in conjunction with commitments the
company undertook to install and operate certain air pollution
abatement equipment at its hawaii refinery pursuant to clean air
act settlement with the united states environmental protection
agency and doh. the company has disputed many of the allegations.

business environment and outlook
chevron is a global energy company with significant business activities in the following
countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad,
china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the
netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the
philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and
tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela and vietnam.
earnings of the company depend largely on the profitability of its upstream (exploration and
production) and downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) business segments. the single
biggest factor that affects the results of operations for both segments is movement in the
price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined
products. the overall trend in earnings is typically less affected by results from the companys
chemicals business and other activities and investments. earnings for the company in any period may
also be influenced by events or transactions that are infrequent or unusual in nature.
the companys operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic,
regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the
united states. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the
company or other governments may impact the companys operations or investments. those developments
have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully
considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries.
to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must
develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the
investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to
explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many
technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in
this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. from time to
time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the
company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. the company will continue to monitor these
developments, take them into account in evaluating future investment opportunities, and otherwise
seek to mitigate any risks to the companys current operations or future prospects.
the company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to
its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and growth. refer to the
results of operations section beginning on fs-6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales
during 2009. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could
result in significant gains or losses.
in recent years, chevron and the oil and gas industry at large experienced an increase in
certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. this
increase in costs affected the companys operating expenses and capital programs for all business
segments, but particularly for upstream. softening of these cost pressures started in late 2008 and
continued through most of 2009. costs began to level out in the fourth quarter 2009. the company
continues to actively manage its schedule of work,
fs-2
table of contents
contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. (refer to the
upstream section below for a discussion of the trend in crude-oil prices.)
the company continues to closely monitor developments in the financial and credit markets, the
level of worldwide economic activity and the implications to the company of movements in prices for
crude oil and natural gas. management is taking these developments into account in the conduct of
daily operations and for business planning. the company remains confident of its underlying
financial strength to address potential challenges presented in this environment. (refer also to
the liquidity and capital resources section beginning on fs-11.)
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as
follows:
upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. crude-oil and natural-gas prices are subject to external
factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global
economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel
prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military
conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit
the companys production capacity in an affected region. the company monitors developments closely
in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and attempts to manage risks in
operating its facilities and businesses. besides the impact of the fluctuation in prices for crude
oil and natural gas, the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function
of other factors, including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude
oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulations.
price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the
production of crude oil and
natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the companys control. external factors
include not only the general level of inflation but also commodity prices and prices charged by the
industrys material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the
industrys own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. capital and
exploratory expenditures and operating expenses also can be affected by damage to production
facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.
the chart at left shows the trend in benchmark prices for west texas intermediate (wti)crude
oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas. industry price levels for crude oil continued to be volatile
during 2009, with prices for wti ranging from $34 to $81 per barrel. the wti price averaged $62 per
barrel for the full-year 2009, compared to $100 in 2008. the decline in prices from 2008 was
largely associated with a weakening in global economic conditions and a reduction in the demand for
crude oil and petroleum products. as of mid-february2010, the wti price was about $77.
a differential in crude-oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur)
crudes and those of lower-quality
(low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any
period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand that is a function
of the number of refineries that are able to process this lower-quality feedstock into light
products
(motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the differential remained
narrow through 2009 as production declines in the industry have been mainly for lower-quality
crudes.

crude-oil realizations.)
in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural
gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those
markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged about $3.80 per thousand cubic feet
(mcf)during 2009, compared with almost $9 during 2008. at december31, 2009, and as of
mid-february2010, the henry hub spot price was about $5.70 and $5.50 per mcf, respectively.
fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer
demand relative to the volumes produced in north america and the level of inventory in underground
storage. weaker u.s. demand in 2009 was associated with the economic slowdown.
certain international natural-gas markets in which the company operates have different supply,
demand and regulatory circumstances, which historically have resulted in lower average sales prices
for the companys production of natural gas in these locations. chevron continues to invest in
long-term projects in these locations to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas
for transport by tanker to other markets where greater demand results in higher prices.
international natural-gas realizations averaged about $4.00 per mcf during 2009, compared with
about $5.20 per mcf during 2008. unlike prior years, these realizations compared favorably with
those in the united states during 2009, primarily as a result of the deterioration of u.s.
supply-and-demand conditions resulting from the economic slowdown. (see page fs-10 for the
companys average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)
the companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 2.70million barrels
per day. about one-fifth of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2009 occurred in the
opec-member countries of angola, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi
arabia and kuwait. for the year 2009, the companys net oil production was reduced by an average of
20,000 barrels per day due to quotas imposed by opec. all of the imposed curtailments took place
during the first half of the year. at the december2009 meeting, members of opec supported
maintaining production quotas in effect since december2008.
the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2010 will average approximately 2.73
million barrels per day. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including
additional quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on production volumes calculated under
cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in fiscal terms or
restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups, fluctuations in demand
for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest,
changing
geopolitics, or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also
affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale
projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in
upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude-oil and
natural-gas production. a significant majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the
united states.

discussion of the companys upstream business.

gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2007 and each year-end from 2007 through 2009,
and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the
three-year period ending december31, 2009.
downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining and
marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil and feedstocks
for chemical manufacturing. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the
global and regional
supply-and-demand balance for refined products and by changes in the price of
crude oil used for refinery feedstock. industry margins can also be influenced by refined-product
inventory levels, geopolitical events, cost of materials and services, refinery maintenance
programs and disruptions at refineries resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather,
fires or other operational events.
other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the companys refining and marketing network and the effectiveness of the crude-oil
and product-supply functions. profitability can also be affected by the volatility of
tanker-charter rates for the companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys
demand for crude-oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the companys control include the
general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the companys refinery and distribution
network.
the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s.
gulf coast, latin america, asia, southern africa and the united kingdom. chevron operates or has
significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas except latin america. the
company completed sales of marketing businesses during 2009 in certain countries in latin america
and africa. the company plans to discontinue, by mid-2010, sales of chevron- and texaco-branded motor fuels in
the mid-atlantic and other eastern states, where the company sold to retail customers
through approximately 1,100 stations and to commercial and industrial customers through supply
arrangements. sales in these markets
fs-4
table of contents
represent approximately 8percent of the companys total u.s. retail fuel sales volumes. additionally, in
january2010, the company sold the rights to the gulf trademark in the united states and its
territories that it had previously licensed for use in the u.s. northeast and puerto rico.
the companys refining and marketing margins in 2009 were generally weak due to
challenging industry conditions, including a sharp drop in global demand reflecting the economic
slowdown, excess refined-product supplies and surplus refining capacity. given these conditions, in
january2010 the company announced to its employees that high-level evaluations of chevrons
refining and marketing organizations had been completed. these evaluations concluded that the
companys downstream organization should be restructured to improve operating efficiency and
achieve sustained improvement in financial performance. details of the restructuring will be
further developed over the next three to six months and may include exits from additional markets,
dispositions of assets, reductions in the number of employees and other actions, which may result
in gains or losses in future periods.
refer to the results of operations section on pages fs-7 and fs-8 for additional discussion
of the companys downstream operations.
chemicals earnings in the petrochemicals business are closely tied to global chemical demand,
industry inventory levels and plant capacity utilization. feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to
follow crude-oil and natural-gas price movements, also influence earnings in this segment.
refer to the results of operations section on page fs-8 for additional discussion of
chemical earnings.
operating developments
key operating developments and other events during 2009 and early 2010 included the
following:
upstream
angola production began at the 39.2percent-owned and operated mafumeira norte offshore
project in block 0 and the 31percent-owned and operated deepwater tombua-landana project in block
14. mafumeira norte is expected to reach maximum total daily production of 42,000 barrels of crude
oil in the third quarter 2010, and the tombua-landana project is expected to reach its maximum
total production of approximately 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2011. the company also
discovered crude oil offshore in the 39.2percent-owned and operated block 0 concession, extending
a trend of earlier discoveries in the greater vanza/longui area.
australia the company and its partners reached final investment decision to proceed with the
development of the gorgon project, located offshore western australia, in which chevron has a 47.3
percent-owned and operated interest as of december31, 2009. in addition, the company finalized
long-term sales agreements for delivery of liquefied natural gas (lng)from the gorgon project with
four asian customers, three of which also acquired an ownership interest in the project. nonbinding
heads of agreement (hoas) with three additional asian customers were also signed in late 2009 and
early 2010 for delivery of lng from the project. negotiations continue to finalize binding
sales agreements, which would bring lng delivery commitments to a combined total of about 90
percent of chevrons share of lng from the project.
the company awarded front-end engineering and design contracts for the first phase of the
wheatstone natural gas project, also located offshore northwest australia. the 75
percent-owned and
operated facilities will have lng processing capacity of 8.6million metric tons
per year and a
co-located domestic natural-gas plant. the facilities will support development of
chevrons interests in the wheatstone field and nearby iago field. agreements were signed with two
companies to join the wheatstone project as combined 25percent owners and suppliers of natural gas
for the projects first two lng trains. in addition, nonbinding hoas were signed with two asian
customers to take delivery of 4.9million metric tons per year of lng from the project (about 60percent of
the total lng available from the foundation project) and to acquire a 16.8percent equity interest in the wheatstone field licenses and a 12.6percent
interest in the foundation natural gas processing facilities at the final investment decision.
in may2009 the company announced the successful
completion of a well at the clio prospect to
further explore and appraise the 66.7percent-owned block wa-205-p. in 2009 and early 2010, the
company also announced natural-gas discoveries at the kentish knock prospect in the 50
percent-owned block wa-365-p, the achilles and satyr prospects in the 50percent-owned block
wa-374-p and the yellowglen prospect in the 50percent-owned
wa-268-p block. all prospects are
chevron-operated. proved reserves have not been recognized for these discoveries.
brazil production started at the 51.7percent-owned and operated deepwater frade field, which
is projected to attain maximum total production of 72,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2011.
also, in early 2010 a final investment decision was reached to develop the 37.5percent-owned,
partner-operated papa-terra field, where first production is expected in 2013. project facilities are designed
with a capacity to handle up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
republic of the congo crude oil was discovered in the northern portion of the 31.5
percent-owned, partner-operated moho-bilondo deepwater permit area. this discovery follows two
others made in 2007 in the same permit area.

united states first oil was achieved at the 58percent-owned and operated tahiti field in the
deepwater gulf of mexico, reaching maximum total production of 135,000 barrels of oil-equivalent
per day. the company also discovered crude oil at the chevron-operated and 55percent-owned
buckskin prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico. the first appraisal well is scheduled to begin
drilling in the second quarter 2010.

u.s upstream earnings of $2.2billion in 2009 decreased $4.9billion from 2008. lower
prices for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by about $5.2billion between periods, and
gains on asset sales declined by approximately $900million. partially offsetting these effects was
a benefit of about $1.3billion resulting from an increase in net oil-equivalent production. an
approximate $600million benefit to income from lower operating expenses was more than offset by
higher depreciation expense. the benefit from
lower operating expenses was largely associated with absence of charges for damages related to
the 2008 hurricanes in the gulf of mexico.
u.s upstream earnings of $7.1billion in 2008 increased $2.6billion from 2007. higher average
prices for crude oil and natural gas increased earnings by $3.1billion between periods. also
contributing to the higher earnings were gains of approximately $1billion on asset sales,
including a $600million gain on an
asset-exchange transaction. partially offsetting these benefits
were adverse effects of about $1.6billion associated with lower oil-equivalent production and
higher operating expenses, which included approximately $400million of expenses resulting from
damage to facilities in the gulf of mexico caused by hurricanes.
the companys average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2009 was $54.36 per
barrel, compared with $88.43 in 2008 and $63.16 in 2007. the average natural-gas realization was
$3.73 per thousand cubic feet in 2009, compared with $7.90 and $6.12 in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

table of contents
net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 717,000 barrels per day, up 6.9percent from
2008 and down 3.5percent from 2007. the increase between 2008 and 2009 was mainly due to the
start-up of the blind faith field in late 2008 and the tahiti field in the
second quarter 2009. the decrease between 2007 and 2008 was mainly due to normal field
declines and the adverse impact of the hurricanes. the net liquids component of oil-equivalent
production for 2009 averaged 484,000 barrels per day, up approximately 15percent from 2008 and 5
percent compared with 2007. net natural-gas production averaged 1.4billion cubic feet per day in
2009, down approximately 7percent from 2008 and about 18percent from 2007.

international upstream earnings of $8.2billion in 2009 decreased $6.4billion from 2008.
lower prices for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by $7.0billion, while foreign-currency
effects and higher operating and depreciation expenses decreased income by a total of $2.2billion.
partially offsetting these items were benefits of $2.3billion resulting from an increase in sales
volumes of crude oil and about $500million associated with asset sales and tax items related to
the gorgon project in australia.
earnings of $14.6billion in 2008 increased $4.3billion from 2007. higher prices for crude
oil and natural gas increased earnings by $4.9billion. partially offsetting the benefit of higher
prices was an impact of about $1.8billion associated with a reduction of
crude-oil sales volumes
due to timing of certain cargo liftings and higher depreciation and operating expenses.
foreign-currency effects benefited earnings by $873million in 2008, compared with a reduction to
earnings of $417million in 2007.
the companys average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2009 was $55.97 per
barrel, compared with $86.51 in 2008 and $65.01 in 2007. the average natural-gas realization was
$4.01 per thousand cubic feet in 2009, compared with $5.19 and $3.90 in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
net oil-equivalent production of 1.99million barrels per day in 2009 increased about 7
percent and 6percent from 2008 and 2007, respectively. the volumes for each year included
production from oil sands in canada. absent the impact of prices on certain production-sharing and
variable-royalty agreements, net
oil-equivalent production increased 4percent in 2009 and 3
percent in 2008, when compared with prior years production.
the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production was 1.4million barrels per day in
2009, an increase of approximately 11percent from 2008 and 5percent from
2007. net natural-gas production of 3.6billion cubic feet per day in 2009 was down 1percent and
up 8percent from 2008 and 2007, respectively.

u.s downstream operations lost $273million in 2009, an earnings decrease of
approximately $1.6billion from 2008. a decline in refined product margins resulted in
a negative earnings variance of $1.7 billion.
partially offsetting were lower operating expenses, which benefited
earnings by $300million. earnings of $1.4billion in 2008 increased about $400million from 2007
due mainly to improved
margins on
the sale of refined products and gains on derivative commodity instruments. operating
expenses were higher between 2007 and 2008.
sales volumes of refined products were 1.40million barrels per day in 2009, a decrease of 1
percent from 2008. the decline was associated with reduced demand for jet fuel and fuel oil,
principally associated with the downturn in the u.s. economy. sales volumes of refined products
were 1.41million barrels per day in 2008, a decrease of 3percent from 2007. branded gasoline
sales volumes of 617,000 barrels per day in 2009 were up about 3percent and down 2percent from

international downstream earnings of $838million in 2009 decreased about $1.2billion from
2008. an approximate $2.6billion decline between periods was associated with weaker margins on the
sale of gasoline and other refined products and the absence
of gains recorded in 2008 on commodity derivative instruments. foreign-currency effects produced a
negative variance of $400million. partially offsetting these items was a $1.0billion benefit from
lower operating expenses associated mainly with contract labor,
professional services and transportation costs and about a $550million increase in gains on asset
sales primarily in certain countries in latin america and africa. earnings in 2008 of $2.1billion
decreased nearly $500million from 2007. earnings in 2007 included gains of approximately $1
billion on the sale of assets, which included
marketing assets in the benelux region of europe and an interest in a  refinery.
the $500million other improvement between years was associated primarily
with a benefit from gains on derivative commodity instruments that was only partially offset by the
impact of lower margins from sales of
refined products. foreign-currency
effects increased earnings by $193million in 2008, compared with $62million in 2007.
refined-product sales volumes were 1.85million barrels per day in 2009, about 8percent lower
than in 2008 due mainly to the effects of asset sales and lower demand. refined-product sales
volumes were 2.02million barrels per day in 2008, about level with 2007.

from 2008 to 2009 reflected lower utility and manufacturing costs as well as the absence of an
impairment recorded in 2008. these benefits were partially offset by
lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals. for oronite, earnings increased in 2009 due to
higher margins on sales of lubricant and fuel additives, the effect of which more than offset the
impact of lower sales volumes. in 2008, segment earnings were $182million, compared with $396

depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses increased in 2009 from 2008 due to
incremental production related to start-ups for upstream projects in the united states and africa
and higher depreciation rates for certain other oil and gas producing fields. the increase in 2008
from 2007 was largely due to higher depreciation rates for certain crude-oil and natural-gas
producing fields, reflecting completion of higher-cost development projects and asset-retirement
obligations.

effective income tax rates were 43percent in 2009, 44percent in 2008 and 42percent in
2007. the rate was lower in 2009 than in 2008 mainly due the effect in 2009 of deferred tax
benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales, both related to an international upstream
project. in addition, a greater proportion of before-tax income was earned in 2009 by equity
affiliates than in 2008. (equity-affiliate income is reported as a single amount on an
after-tax
basis on the consolidated statement of income.) partially offsetting these items was the effect of
a greater proportion of income earned in 2009 in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates. the rate
was higher in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a greater proportion of income earned in tax
jurisdictions with higher income tax rates. in addition, the 2007 period included a relatively low
effective tax rate on the sale of the companys investment in dynegy common stock and the sale of
downstream assets in europe. refer also to the discussion of income taxes in note 15 beginning on

liquidity and capital resources
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total balances were $8.8billion and $9.6
billion at december31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. cash provided by operating activities in 2009
was $19.4
billion, compared with $29.6billion in 2008 and $25.0billion in 2007.
cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
approximately $1.7billion, $800million and $300million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.6
billion in 2009, $1.5billion in 2008 and $3.3billion in 2007.
restricted cash of $123million and
$367million associated with various capital-investment projects at december31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, was invested in short-term marketable securities and recorded as deferred charges
and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
dividends dividends paid to common stockholders were approximately $5.3billion in 2009, $5.2
billion in 2008 and $4.8billion in 2007. in july2009, the company increased its quarterly common
stock dividend by 4.6percent to $0.68 per share.
debt and capital lease obligations total debt and capital lease obligations were $10.5billion
at december31, 2009, up from $8.9billion at year-end 2008.
the $1.6billion increase in total
debt and capital lease obligations during 2009 included the net effect of a $5billion public bond
issuance, a $350million issuance of tax-exempt gulf opportunity zone bonds, a $3.2billion
decrease in commercial paper, and a $400million payment of principal for texaco capital inc. bonds
that matured in january2009. the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year,
consisting primarily of commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $4.6
billion at
december31, 2009, down from $7.8billion at year-end 2008. of these amounts, $4.2billion and
$5.0billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. at year-end
2009, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in
2010, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities,
to refinance them on a long-term basis.
at year-end 2009, the company had $5.1billion in committed credit facilities with various
major banks, which permit the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these
facilities support commercial paper borrowing and also can be used for general corporate purposes.
the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on
substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings
under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on london interbank
offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms
reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these
facilities at december31, 2009. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration
statement that expires in march2010 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities
issued or guaranteed by the company. the company intends to file a new
shelf registration statement when the current one expires.
the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation,
chevron corporation profit sharing/ savings plan trust fund, texaco capital inc. and union oil
company of california. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron
corporation and are rated aa by standard and poors corporation and aa1 by moodys investors
service. the companys u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poors and p-1 by
moodys. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. the company
believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements and
that during periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined
products and commodity chemicals, it has the flexibility to increase borrowings and/or modify
capital-spending plans to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the companys
high-quality debt ratings.
common stock repurchase program in september2007, the company authorized the acquisition of
up to $15billion of its common shares at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and
other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. the program is for a
period of up to three years (expiring in 2010) and may be discontinued at any time. the company
did not acquire any shares during 2009 and does not plan to acquire any shares in the first
quarter 2010. from the inception of the program, the company has acquired 119million shares at a
cost of $10.1billion.

capital and exploratory expenditures total expenditures for 2009 were $22.2billion,
including $1.6billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures and $2billion for
the extension of an upstream concession. in 2008 and 2007, expenditures were $22.8billion and
$20.0billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of
$2.3
billion in both periods.
of the $22.2billion of expenditures in 2009, about
three-fourths, or $17.1billion, is
related to upstream activities. approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream
operations in 2008 and 2007. international upstream accounted for about 80percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2009 and about
percent in 2008 and 2007, reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities available
outside the united states.
the company estimates that in 2010, capital and exploratory expenditures will be $21.6
billion, including $1.6billion of spending by affiliates. about 80percent of the total, or $17.3
billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $13.2billion of this amount
for projects outside the united states. spending in 2010 is primarily targeted for exploratory
prospects in the u.s. gulf of mexico and major development projects in angola, australia, brazil,
canada, china, nigeria, thailand and the u.s. gulf of mexico. also included is funding for base
business improvements and focused appraisals in core hydrocarbon basins.
worldwide downstream spending in 2010 is estimated at $3.4billion, with about $1.6billion
for projects in the
united states. major capital outlays include projects under construction at refineries in the
united states and south korea and construction of gas-to-liquids facilities in support of
associated upstream projects.
investments in chemicals, technology and other corporate businesses in 2010 are budgeted at
$900million. technology investments include projects related to unconventional hydrocarbon
technologies, oil and gas reservoir management, and gas-fired and renewable power generation.
noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $647million and $469
million at december31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. distributions to noncontrolling interests
totaled $71million and $99million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
pension obligations in 2009, the companys pension plan contributions were $1.7billion
(including $1.5billion to the u.s. plans and $200million to the international plans). the
company estimates contributions in 2010 will be approximately $900million ($600million for the
u.s. plans and $300million for the international plans). actual contribution amounts are
dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and
other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are
insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. refer also to the discussion of pension
accounting in critical accounting estimates and assumptions, beginning on page fs-18.

the companys guarantee of approximately $600million is associated with certain payments
under a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. the terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon
and motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300million. through the end of 2009, the company had paid $48million
under these indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification
payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets origi-
nally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and environmental
conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred during
the period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the environmental
conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to december
2001. claims had to be asserted by february 2009 for equilon indemnities and must be asserted
no later than february2012 for motiva indemnities. under the terms of these indemnities, there
is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. in february2009, shell
delivered a letter to the company purporting to preserve unmatured claims for certain equilon
indemnities. the letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount. management
does not believe this letter or any other information provides a basis to estimate the amount,
if any, of a range of loss or potential range of loss with respect to either the equilon or the
motiva indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under
the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by
equilon or motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to
contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. the
acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum
obligation of $200million, which had been reached at december31, 2009. under the
indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200million obligation, chevron is solely
responsible until april2022, when the indemnification expires. the environmental conditions or
events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets
in 1997.
although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are
probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to
results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect
these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent
liabilities relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including
throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing
arrangements. the agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage
capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary
course of the companys business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under
these various commitments are: 2010  $7.5billion; 2011
$4.3billion; 2012  $1.4
billion; 2013  $1.4billion; 2014  $1.0billion; 2015 and after  $4.1billion. a portion
of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project

does not include amounts related to the companys income tax liabilities associated
with uncertain tax positions. the company is unable to make reasonable estimates for the
periods in which these liabilities may become payable. the company does not expect settlement
of such liabilities will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity in any single period.
$4.2billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is
included in long-term debt. the repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of
the entire amounts in the 20112012 period.
does not include obligations to purchase the companys share of natural gas liquids
and regasified natural gas associated with operations of the 36.4percent-owned angola lng
affiliate. the lng plant is expected to commence operations in 2012 and is designed to produce
5.2million metric tons of lng and related natural gas liquids per year. volumes and prices
associated with these purchase obligations are neither fixed nor determinable.
financial and derivative instruments
the market risk associated with the companys portfolio of financial and derivative
instruments is discussed below. the estimates of financial exposure to market risk discussed below
do not represent the companys projection of future market changes. the actual impact of future
market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including
those set forth under the heading risk factors in parti, item1a, of the companys 2009 annual
report on form 10-k.
derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company
refineries.
the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. the results of
these activities were not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or
cash flows in 2009.
the companys market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal risk control group in accordance with the companys risk management policies, which have
been approved by the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
the derivative commodity instruments used in the companys risk management and trading
activities consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the new york mercantile
exchange and on electronic platforms of the inter-continental exchange and chicago mercantile
exchange. in addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined-product swap contracts and option
contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas
companies in the over-the-counter markets.
virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other
independent third-party quotes. the change in fair value from chevrons derivative commodity
instruments in 2009 was a quarterly average decrease of $168million in total assets and a
quarterly average decrease of $104million in total liabilities.
the company uses a value-at-risk
(var) model to estimate the potential loss in fair value on a single day from the effect of adverse
changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued, which are recorded
on the balance sheet at
december31, 2009, as derivative commodity instruments in accordance with
accounting standards for derivatives (asc 815). var is the maximum loss not to be exceeded within a
given probability or confidence level over a given period of time. the companys var model uses the
monte carlo simulation method that involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified
probability distribution and constructing a full distribution of a portfolios potential values.
the var model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average for computing historical
volatilities and
correlations, a 95percent confidence level, and a one-day holding period. that is, the
companys 95percent, one-day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that would
not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were held
constant for one day.
the one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be
liquidated or hedged within one day. for hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options as well as non-exchange-traded swaps,
fs-14
table of contents
most of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. the table below presents the
95percent/one-day var for each of the companys primary risk exposures in the area of derivative
commodity instruments at december31, 2009 and 2008. the lower amounts in 2009 were primarily
associated with a decrease in price volatility for these commodities during the year.

foreign currency the company may enter into foreign-currency derivative contracts to
manage some of its foreign-currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions, including foreign-currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. the
foreign-currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. there were no open foreign-currency derivative
contracts at december31, 2009.
interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. historically, under the terms of the
swaps, net cash settlements were based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps
related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair
value hedges. interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value
on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at year-end 2009, the
company had no interest rate swaps on floating-rate debt. the companys only interest rate swaps on
fixed-rate debt matured in january2009 and the company had no interest rate swaps on
fixed-rate
debt at year-end 2009.
transactions with related parties
chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. these arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term
purchase agreements. refer to other financial information in note 24 of the consolidated financial
statements, page fs-61, for further discussion. management believes these agreements have been
negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.
litigation and other contingencies
mtbe chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary
butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. chevron is a party to 50 pending lawsuits and claims,
the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of mtbe,
including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. the companys ultimate exposure
related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable, but could be material to net income in
any one period. the company no longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united
states.
ecuador chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in
lago agrio, ecuador, brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain
residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit
alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks
unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental
harm, plus a health monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary
of texaco inc., was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian
state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted
solely by petroecuador. at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent
third-party environmental audit of the concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with
the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to
remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership share
of the consortium. pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at
a cost of $40million. after certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government
granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental
liability arising from the consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously
given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador. with regard to the facts, the company
believes that the evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the
remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal
obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.
in april2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $8billion, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an additional $8.3billion could be assessed
against chevron for unjust enrichment. the engineers report is not binding on the court. chevron
also believes that the engineers work

financial condition and results of operations
was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law and in violation of
the courts orders. chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to
strike the report in its entirety. in november2008, the engineer revised the report and, without
additional evidence, recommended an increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to
a total of $18.9billion and an increase in the assessment for purported unjust enrichment to a
total of $8.4billion. chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, which the court
dismissed. in september2009, following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge
participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case
petitioned to be recused. in late september2009, the judge was recused, and in october2009, the
full chamber of the provincial court affirmed the recusal, resulting in the appointment of a new
judge. chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by the prior judge, but the new judge
denied these motions. the court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case and could
render a judgment at any time. chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition
of liability.
in the event of an adverse judgment, chevron would expect to pursue its appeals and vigorously
defend against enforcement of any such judgment; therefore, the ultimate outcome  and any
financial effect on chevron  remains uncertain. management does not believe an estimate of a
reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the defects
associated with the engineers report, management does not believe the report has any utility in
calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). moreover, the highly uncertain legal
environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible
loss (or a range of loss).
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations,
private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal
settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate
the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including
mtbe, by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including,
but not limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries,
crude-oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations,
whether operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such
factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the
corrective actions that may be required, the
determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible
parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third
parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations
that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future
costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they
are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will have a material
effect on its consolidated financial
position or liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations
to make such expenditures
have had, or will have, any significant impact on the companys competitive position relative to
other u.s. or international petroleum or chemical companies.
the following table displays the annual changes to the companys before-tax environmental
remediation reserves, including those for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state
laws.

included in the $1,700million year-end 2009 reserve balance were remediation activities
at approximately 250 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or
otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)or other
regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws. the
companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2009 was $185million. the federal
superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible
parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume
other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected
to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position
or liquidity.

of the remaining year-end 2009 environmental reserves balance of $1,515million, $820million
related to the companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants,
marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), and pipelines. the remaining $695
million was associated with various sites in international downstream ($107million), upstream
($369million), chemicals ($149million) and other businesses ($70million). liabilities at all
sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the companys plans
and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities
include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of
contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and
vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of
the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2009 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
under accounting standards for asset retirement obligations
(asc 410), the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when there is a legal obligation
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
the liability balance of approximately $10.2billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end
2009 related primarily to upstream properties.
for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities,
no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the
end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been
made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.
refer also to note 23 on page fs-60, related to the companys asset retirement obligations and
the discussion of environmental matters on page fs-18.
income taxes the company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated.
refer to note 15 beginning on page fs-46 for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have
been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions
of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and
the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the company does not expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a material
effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
suspended wells the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude-oil and natural-gas fields. the
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity or
development decisions or both. at december31, 2009, the company had approximately $2.4billion of
suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $317
million from 2008. the 2008 balance reflected an increase of $458million from 2007.
the future trend of the companys exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. the effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $2.4billion of suspended wells at year-end 2009 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.
refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-50, for additional discussion of suspended wells.
equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide
for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude-oil and natural-gas reserves.
these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve at elk hills,
california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the u.s.
department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
for this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200million, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to chevron is
estimated at about $150million. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this
range of estimates are uncertain.
other contingencies chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading
partners; u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and
suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and
take lengthy periods to resolve.

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations
and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or
strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually
or together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at
third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. an obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2009 at approximately $3.5billion for its
consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were approximately $1.7billion of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.8billion of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or
divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites.
for 2010, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $2.1billion.
these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental
regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with exist-
ing and
new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases
of hazardous materials. although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any
single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the companys
liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting
principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different
reporting periods. all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of
subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the
susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or
operating performance is material.
besides those meeting these critical criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. although
not associated with highly uncertain matters, these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be more likely than not. another
example is the estimation of crude-oil and natural-gas reserves under sec rules, which, effective
december31, 2009, require ...by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, (the reserves) can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible...under existing economic
conditions where existing economic conditions include prices based on the average price during the

12-month period. refer to table v, reserve quantity information, beginning on page fs-69,
for the changes in these estimates for the three years ending december31, 2009, and to table vii,
changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on
page fs-77 for estimates of
proved-reserve values for each of the three years ended december31,
2009. note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-32, includes a
description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities. the estimates of crude-oil and natural-gas reserves are important to the
timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical accounting policy for impairment of properties, plant and
equipment and investments in affiliates, beginning on page fs-20, includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and
gas properties. this commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. significant accounting policies are
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-32. the
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the audit committee of the board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension-plan obligations
and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. for other postretirement benefit (opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care
and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining opeb obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed
health care
cost-trend rates.
note 21, beginning on page fs-52, includes information on the funded status of the companys
pension and opeb plans at the end of 2009 and 2008; the components of pension and opeb expense for
the three years ending december31, 2009; and the underlying assumptions for those periods.
pension and opeb expense is reported on the consolidated statement of income as operating
expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses and applies to all business segments.
the year-end 2009 and 2008 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and
obligations, of each of the companys pension and opeb plans is recognized on the consolidated
balance sheet. the
differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a long-term asset in deferred
charges and other assets. the differences associated with underfunded or unfunded pension and opeb
plans are reported as accrued liabilities or reserves for employee benefit plans. amounts yet
to be recognized as components of pension or opeb expense are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive loss.
to estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses a process that
incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future performance
and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. asset allocations
are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the
companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. the expected
long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 69percent of the companys
pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8percent since 2002. for the 10years ending december31,
2009, actual asset returns averaged 3.7percent for this plan. the actual return for 2009 was 15.7
percent and was associated with the broad recovery in the financial markets.
the year-end market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market
value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2009, the company selected a 5.3
percent discount rate for the major u.s. pension plan and 5.8percent for its opeb plan. these
rates were selected based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the citigroup pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2009. the discount rates at the end of
2008 and 2007 were 6.3percent for both years for the u.s. pension and opeb plans.
an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2009 was $1.1billion. as an
indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1
percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the companys primary u.s. pension
plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2009 by approximately $50million. a 1
percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for about 61percent of
the
fs-19
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2009
by approximately $150million.
an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the
funded status of a plan reported on the consolidated balance sheet. the total pension liability on
the consolidated balance sheet at december31, 2009, for underfunded plans was approximately $3.8
billion. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary u.s.
pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $300million, which would have
decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately $1.6billion to $1.3billion. other
plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. the actual rates of return on plan
assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in
the worlds financial markets.
in 2009, the companys pension plan contributions were $1.7billion (including $1.5billion to
the u.s. plans). in 2010, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $900million.
actual contribution amounts are dependent upon
plan-investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2009 was $164million and the total liability,
which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2009, was $3.1billion.
as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2009, a
1percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary u.s. opeb plan, which accounted
for about 69percent of the companywide opeb expense, would have decreased opeb expense by
approximately $11million. a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 84percent of the companywide opeb liabilities, would have decreased total opeb
liabilities at the end of 2009 by approximately $65million.
for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4percent per year. for active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims
experiences are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7
percent in 2010 and gradually drop to 5percent for 2018 and beyond. as an indication of the health
care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense
in  2009, a 1percent
increase in the rates for the main u.s. opeb plan, which accounted for 84percent of the
companywide opeb liabilities, would have increased opeb expense $8million.
differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of
each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference
occurs. instead, the differences are included in actuarial gain/loss and unamortized amounts have
been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. refer
to note 21, beginning on page fs-52, for information on the $6.7billion of before-tax actuarial
losses recorded by the company as of december31, 2009; a description of the method used to
amortize those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2010.
impairment of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company
assesses its properties, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
such indicators include changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude-oil and natural-gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated
proved-reserve quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash
flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of
the asset over its estimated fair value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions.
no major individual impairments of pp&e and investments were recorded for the three years
ending december31, 2009. a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if
other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not
practicable, given the broad range of the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in
the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair
any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown
number of other assets to become impaired.
fs-20
table of contents
investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as
well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when
the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value. when such a decline is
deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the
difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time.
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company
considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial
performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that
will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of
the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.
from time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when
significant downward revisions to crude-oil and natural-gas reserves are made for any single field
or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. that is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified
as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets associated carrying values.
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as
required by accounting standards for goodwill (asc 350), the company tests such goodwill at the
reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.
contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. for example, the costs from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation,
the determination of
additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in
technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies
if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally reports
these losses as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of income. an exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than
not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. for
additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to note 15 beginning on page fs-46. refer
also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three
years ended december31, 2009.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.
new accounting standards
the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting
principles  a replacement of fasb statement no.162 (fas 168) in june2009, the fasb issued fas
168, which became effective for the company in the quarter ending september30, 2009. this standard
established the fasb accounting standards codification (asc)system as the single authoritative
source of u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap)and superseded existing literature
of the fasb, emerging issues task force, american institute of cpas and other sources. the asc did
not change gaap, but organized the literature into about 90 accounting topics. adoption of the asc
did not affect the companys accounting.
employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets (fsp fas 132(r)-1) in december
2008, the fasb issued fsp fas 132(r)-1, which was subsequently codified into asc 715, compensation
retirement benefits, and became effective with the companys reporting at december31, 2009. this
standard amended and expanded the disclosure requirements for the plan assets of defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans. refer to information beginning on page fs-52 in note 21,
employee benefits, for these disclosures.
transfers and servicing (asc 860), accounting for transfers of financial assets (asu 2009-16)
the fasb issued asu 2009-16 in december2009. this standard became effective for the company on
january1, 2010. asu 2009-16
fs-21
table of contents
changes how companies account for transfers of financial assets and eliminates the concept of
qualifying special-purpose entities. adoption of the guidance is not expected to have an impact on
the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
consolidation (asc 810), improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with
variable interest entities (asu 2009-17) the fasb issued asu 2009-17 in december2009. this
standard became effective for the company january1, 2010. asu 2009-17 requires the enterprise to
qualitatively assess if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable-interest entity (vie), and, if
so, the vie must be consolidated. adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material
impact on the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
extractive
industries  oil and gas (asc 932), oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures
(asu 2010-03) in january2010, the fasb issued asu 2010-03, which became effective for the company
on december31, 2009. the standard amends certain sections of
asc 932, extractive industries  oil

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevron corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of chevron corporation and its subsidiaries at december31, 2009
and december31, 2008 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended december31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2009 based on
criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over
financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on
the financial statement schedule, and on the companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our
audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude
oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car.
chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.
the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.
the nature of the companys operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. the company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent-owned and variable-interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to
50percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity
currently in income.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of
the investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the
duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability
and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in the investments market value. the new cost basis of investments in these
equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying
equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets
and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the
difference. when appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted
quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical
book values.
derivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and
changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. for the companys
commodity trading activity and foreign currency exposures, gains and losses from derivative
instruments are reported in current income. interest rate swaps  hedging a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt  are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps
relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
consolidated balance sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. where chevron is a
party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for
derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are offset on the balance sheet.
short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents.
the balance of the short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and is
marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income.
inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost, using a
last-in, first-out (lifo)method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials,
supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost.

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies - continued
properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude-oil and natural-gas
exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have
found crude-oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when
the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. all other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-50, for additional
discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude-oil and natural-gas properties,
are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude-oil and natural-gas
properties in the united states, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. in the refining, marketing, transportation and
chemicals areas, impairment reviews are generally done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a
marketing area or marketing assets by country. impairment amounts are recorded as incremental
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value.
as required under accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations
(accounting standards codification (asc)410), the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded
as an asset and a liability when there is a
legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. refer also to note 23, on page fs-60, relating to aros.
depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude-oil and natural-gas
producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method
generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. depletion expenses
for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production
method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation
provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses for mining assets are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. the capitalized costs of all other
plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the
straight-line method generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as other income.
expenditures for maintenance (including those for
planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating
condition are generally expensed as incurred. major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as required
by accounting standards for goodwill (asc 350), the company tests such goodwill at the reporting
unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.
environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and
canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future
remediation commitment will be required. for crude-oil, natural-gas and mineral-producing
properties, a liability for an aro is made,

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies - continued
following accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. refer to note
23, on page fs-60, for a discussion of the companys aros.
for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a
liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for
other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other
parties are not able to pay their respective shares.
the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of
future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
companys own internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all
gains and losses from currency translations are currently included in income. the cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in currency translation adjustment on the
consolidated statement of equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on the
entitlement method. excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. the
associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the consolidated statement of income on page fs-27.
purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation
of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and
reported in purchased crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income.
stock options and other share-based compensation the company issues stock options and other
share-based compensation to its employees and accounts for these transactions under the accounting
standards for share-based compensation (asc 718). for equity awards, such as stock options, total
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value
and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on
the settlement value. the company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over
the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the
time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. stock options and stock
appreciation rights granted under the companys long-term incentive plan have graded vesting
provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of
the date of grant. the company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.

in accordance with accounting standards for cash-flow classifications for stock options (asc
718), the net (increase) decrease in operating working capital includes reductions of $25, $106
and $96 for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively. these amounts are offset by an equal amount in net sales (purchases)of
treasury shares.
the net sales (purchases)of treasury shares represents the cost of common shares purchased less
the cost of shares issued for
share-based compensation plans. purchases totaled $6, $8,011 and
$7,036 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. purchases in 2008 and 2007 included shares purchased
under the companys common stock repurchase programs.
in 2009, net sales (purchases)of other short-term investments consisted of $123 in
restricted cash associated with
capital-investment projects at the companys pascagoula,
mississippi refinery and the angola liquefied-natural-gas project that was invested in short-term
securities and reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to deferred charges and other assets
on the consolidated balance sheet. the company issued $350 and $650, in 2009 and 2007 respectively,
of tax exempt mississippi gulf opportunity zone bonds as a source of funds for pascagoula refinery
projects.
the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2009 excludes changes to the consolidated balance
sheet that did not affect cash. in 2008, net sales (purchases)of treasury shares excludes $680 of treasury
shares acquired in exchange for a u.s. upstream property and $280 in cash. the carrying value of
this property in properties, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet was not
significant. in 2008, a $2,450 increase in accrued liabilities and a corresponding increase to
properties, plant and equipment, at cost were considered non-cash transactions and excluded from
net (increase)decrease in operating
working
capital and capital expenditures. in 2009, the payments related to these accrued
liabilities were excluded from net (increase)decrease in operating working capital and were
reported as capital expenditures. the amount is related to upstream operating agreements outside
the united states. capital expenditures in 2008 excludes a $1,400 increase in properties, plant
and equipment related to the acquisition of an additional interest in an equity affiliate that
required a change to the consolidated method of accounting for the investment during 2008. this
addition was offset primarily by reductions in investments and advances and working capital and
an increase in non-current deferred income tax liabilities. refer also to note 23, on page fs-60,
for a discussion of revisions to the companys aros that also did not involve cash receipts or
payments for the three years ending december31, 2009.

leasing arrangements involve tanker charters, crude-oil production and processing equipment,
service stations, office buildings, and other facilities. other leases are classified as operating
leases and are not capitalized. the payments on such leases are recorded as expense. details of the

fair value measurements
accounting standards for fair-value measurement (asc 820) establish a framework for measuring fair
value and stipulate disclosures about fair-value measurements. the standards apply to recurring and
nonrecurring financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that require or permit fair-value
measurements. asc 820 became effective for chevron on january1, 2008, for all financial assets and
liabilities and recurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities. on january1, 2009, the standard
became effective for nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities. among the required
disclosures is the fair-value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value an asset or a
liability. the three levels of the fair-value hierarchy are described as follows:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted)in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. for the
company, level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing
to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded.
level 2: inputs other than level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. for the
company, level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained
through third-party broker quotes, and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs
for substantially the complete term of a contract.

note 9 fair value measurements - continued
level 3: unobservable inputs. the company does not use level 3 inputs for any of its recurring
fair-value measurements. level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value
associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. in 2009,
the company used level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of certain nonrecurring nonfinancial
assets.
the fair-value hierarchy for recurring assets and liabilities measured at fair value at

marketable securities the company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on
quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. the fair values reflect the cash that
would have been received if the instruments were sold at december31, 2009. marketable securities
had average maturities of less than one year.
derivatives the company records its derivative
instruments  other than any commodity derivative
contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale  on the consolidated balance
sheet at fair value, with virtually all the offsetting amount to the consolidated statement of
income. for derivatives with identical or similar provisions as contracts that are publicly traded
on a regular basis, the company uses the market values of the publicly traded instruments as an
input for fair-value calculations.
the companys derivative instruments principally include crude-oil, natural-gas and
refined-product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. derivatives classified as level 1
include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the new york
mercantile exchange.
derivatives classified as level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts principally
with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values for which are obtained
from third-party broker quotes, industry pric-
ing services and exchanges.  the company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the
level 2 instruments. since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it
has historically been very consistent. the company does not materially adjust this information. the
company incorporates internal review, evaluation and assessment procedures, including a comparison
of level 2 fair values derived from the companys internally developed forward curves (on a sample
basis) with the pricing information to document reasonable, logical and supportable fair-value
determinations and proper level of classification.
impairments of properties, plant and equipment during 2009 and in accordance with the accounting
standard for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (asc 360), long-lived assets
held and
used with a carrying amount of $949 were written down to a fair value of $490, resulting in a
before-tax loss of $459. the fair values were determined from internal cash-flow models, using
discount rates consistent with those used by the company to evaluate cash flows of other assets of
a similar nature. long-lived assets
held for sale with a carrying amount of $160 were written
down to a fair value of $68, resulting in a before-tax loss of $92. the fair values were determined

assets and liabilities not required to be measured at fair value the company holds cash
equivalents in u.s. and non-u.s. portfolios. the instruments held are primarily time deposits and
money market funds. the fair values reflect the cash that would have been received or paid if the
instruments were settled at year-end. cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of $6,396 and
$7,058 at december31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and average maturities under 90days. the
balance at december31, 2009, includes $123 of investments for restricted funds related to an
international upstream development project and pascagoula refinery projects, which are included in
deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. long-term debt of $5,705 and
$1,221 had estimated fair values of $6,229 and $1,414 at december31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
fair values of other financial instruments at the end of 2009 and 2008 were not material.

financial and derivative instruments
derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the pur-
chase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and
feedstock for company refineries. from time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity
instruments for limited trading purposes.
the companys derivative commodity instruments principally include crude-oil, natural-gas and
refined-product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. none of the companys derivative
instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the companys affiliates
make such designation. the companys derivatives are not material to the companys financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. the company believes it has no material market or
credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodities and
other derivatives activities.
the company uses international swaps and derivatives association agreements to govern
derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. depending on the nature
of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. when the
company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty
and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market exposure represents the
netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and is a reasonable measure
of the companys credit risk exposure. the company also uses other netting agreements with certain
counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate credit risk.
derivative instruments measured at fair value at december31, 2009, and december31, 2008, and
their classification on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income are as
follows:

foreign currency the company may enter into currency derivative contracts to manage some of
its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase
transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. the currency
derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains
and losses reflected in income. there were no open currency derivative contracts at december 31,
2009.
interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. historically, under the terms of the
swaps, net cash settlements were based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps
related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value
hedges. interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on
the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at year-end 2009, the
company had no interest rate swaps. the companys only interest rate swaps on fixed-rate debt
matured in january2009.
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the companys short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. this diversified
investment policy limits the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit
risk. similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the companys
counterparties in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. as a result, the company believes
concentrations of credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers. when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring
letters of credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.

operating segments and geographic data
although each subsidiary of chevron is responsible for its own affairs, chevron corporation
manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. for this purpose, the
investments are grouped as follows: upstream  exploration and production; downstream  refining,
marketing and transportation; chemicals; and all other. the first three of these groupings
represent the companys reportable segments and operating segments as defined in accounting
standards for segment reporting (asc 280).
the segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
segment managers who report to the companys chief operating decision maker (codm)
(terms as
defined in asc 280). the codm is the companys executive committee, a committee of senior officers
that includes the chief executive officer and that, in turn, reports to the board of directors of
chevron corporation.
the operating segments represent components of the company, as described in accounting
standards for segment reporting (asc 280), that engage in activities (a)from which revenues are
earned and expenses are incurred; (b)whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm,
which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their
performance; and (c)for which discrete financial information is available.
segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the companys codm to discuss the segments operating activities and financial
performance. the codm approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and exploratory budgets. however, business-unit managers within the
operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and
all other matters connected with daily operations. company officers who are

note 11 operating segments and geographic data - continued
members of the executive committee also have individual management responsibilities and
participate in other committees for purposes other than acting as the codm.
all other activities include mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash
management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations,
real estate activities, alternative fuels and technology companies, and the companys interest in
dynegy
(through may2007, when chevron sold its interest).
the companys primary country of operation is the united states of america, its country of
domicile. other components of the companys operations are reported as international
(outside the
united states).
segment earnings the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. however, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in
all other. earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:

descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the companys
carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates,
are as follows:
tengizchevroil
chevron has a 50percent equity ownership interest in tengizchevroil
(tco), a joint venture formed in 1993 to develop the tengiz and korolev crude-oil fields in
kazakhstan over a 40-year period. at december31, 2009, the companys carrying value of its
investment in tco was about $200 higher than the amount of underlying equity in tcos net assets. this difference results from
chevron acquiring
a portion of its interest in tco at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion
of tcos net assets. see note 7, on page fs-36, for summarized financial information for 100
percent of tco.
petropiar chevron has a 30percent interest in petropiar, a joint stock company formed in 2008 to
operate the hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. the project, located in venezuelas
orinoco belt, has a 25-year contract term. prior to the formation of petropiar, chevron had a 30
percent interest in the hamaca project. at december31, 2009, the companys carrying value of its
investment in petropiar was approximately $195 less than the amount of underlying equity in
petropiars net assets. the difference represents the excess of chevrons underlying equity in
petropiars net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.
petroboscan chevron has a 39percent interest in petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006
to operate the boscan field in venezuela until 2026. chevron previously operated the field under an
operating service agreement. at december31, 2009, the companys carrying value of its investment
in petroboscan was approximately $275 higher than the amount of underlying equity in petroboscans
net assets. the difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by
chevron over its underlying equity in petroboscans net assets.
angola lng ltd. chevron has a 36percent interest in
angola lng ltd., which will process and
liquefy natural gas produced in angola for delivery to international markets.

litigation
mtbe chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. chevron is a party to 50 pending lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the
future. the companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable,
but could be material to net income in any one period. the company no longer uses mtbe in the
manufacture of gasoline in the united states.
ecuador chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago
agrio, ecuador, brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain
residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit
alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks
unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the
alleged environmental harm, plus a health
monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of texaco inc., was
a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as
the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador. at the
conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the
concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and
petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to
texpets ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a
three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. after certifying that the sites were properly
remediated, the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from
any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
ecuador; and, fourth, that the
lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously

note 14 litigation - continued
given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador. with regard to the facts, the company believes that the
evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining
environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and
petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.
in april2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $8,000, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an additional $8,300 could be assessed
against chevron for unjust enrichment. the engineers report is not binding on the court. chevron
also believes that the engineers work was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary
to law and in violation of the courts orders. chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which
it asked the court to strike the report in its entirety. in november2008, the engineer revised the
report and, without additional evidence, recommended an increase in the financial compensation for
purported damages to a total of $18,900 and an increase in the assessment for purported unjust
enrichment to a total of $8,400. chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, which the
court dismissed. in september2009, following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge
participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case
petitioned to be recused. in late september2009, the judge was recused, and in october2009, the
full chamber of the provincial court affirmed the recusal, resulting in the appointment of a new
judge. chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by the prior judge, but the new judge
denied these motions. the court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case and could
render a judgment at any time. chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition
of liability.
in the event of an adverse judgment, chevron would expect to pursue its appeals and vigorously
defend against enforcement of any such judgment; therefore, the ultimate outcome  and any
financial effect on chevron  remains uncertain. management does not believe an estimate of a
reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this
case. due to the defects associated with the engineers report, management does not believe the
report has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). moreover,
the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to
estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

the companys effective tax rate decreased from 44.2percent in 2008 to 43.0
percent in 2009. the rate was lower in 2009 mainly due to the effect of deferred tax benefits and
relatively low tax rates on asset sales, both related to an international upstream project. in
addition, a greater proportion of before-tax income was earned in 2009 by equity affiliates than in
2008. (equity-affiliate income is reported as a single amount on an after-tax basis on the
consolidated statement of income.) partially offsetting these items was the effect of a greater
proportion of income earned in 2009 in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates.
the company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net
amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or
liabilities. the reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:

deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2009 increased by approximately $400 from
year-end 2008. the increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for
properties, plant and equipment.
deferred tax assets were essentially unchanged in 2009. increases related to additional
foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions (which were
substantially offset by valuation allowances) and to inventory-related temporary differences. these
effects were offset by reductions in deferred credits and tax loss carryforwards primarily
resulting from the usage of tax benefits in international tax jurisdictions.
the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carryforwards,
tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. it reduces the deferred tax assets to
amounts that are, in managements assessment, more likely than not to be realized. tax loss
carryforwards exist in many international jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss
carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2010 through
2036. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,387 will expire between 2010 and 2019.

income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that
have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. undistributed earnings of international
consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made
for possible future remittances totaled $20,458 at december31, 2009. this amount represents
earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business. it is not practicable
to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of earnings that
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. at the end of 2009, deferred income taxes were recorded
for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations for which the company no longer
intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings. the company does not anticipate incurring
significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.
uncertain income tax positions under accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes (asc
740-10), a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a
likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the
technical merits of the position. the term tax position in the accounting standards for income
taxes (asc 740-10-20) refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected
to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax
assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.

although unrecognized tax benefits for individual tax positions may increase or decrease
during 2010, the company believes that no change will be individually significant during 2010.
approximately 90percent of the $3,195 of unrecognized tax benefits at december31, 2009, would
have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized.
tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits
by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. for the companys major tax jurisdictions,
examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december31,
2009. for these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been
finalized were as follows: united states  2005, nigeria  1994, angola  2001 and saudi arabia  2003.
on the consolidated statement of income, the company reports interest and penalties related to
liabilities for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. as of december31, 2009, accruals
of $232 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance
sheet,
compared with accruals of $276 as of year-end 2008. income tax (benefit)expense associated with
interest and penalties was $(20), $79 and $70 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

terms of specific agreements may be based on the london interbank offered rate or bank prime rate.
no amounts were outstanding under these credit agreements during 2009 or at year-end.
at december31, 2009 and 2008, the company classified $4,190 and $4,950, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital in 2010, as the company has both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt

accounting for suspended exploratory wells
accounting standards for the costs of exploratory
wells (asc 932) provide that exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized after the completion
of drilling when (a)the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as
a producing well and (b)the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
the economic and operating viability of the project. if either condition is not met or if an
enterprise obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational
viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net
of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. the accounting standards provide a number of
indicators that can assist an entity in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in
assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.

stock options and other share-based compensation
compensation expense for stock options for
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $182 ($119 after tax), $168 ($109 after tax) and $146 ($95 after tax),
respectively. in addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance units and restricted stock units was $170 ($110
after tax), $132 ($86 after tax) and $205 ($133 after tax) for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
no significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at december31, 2009 and 2008.
cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $147, $404 and $445, respectively. actual tax benefits realized for the tax
deductions from option exercises were $25, $103 and $94 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $89, $136 and $88 for
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
chevron long-term incentive plan (ltip) awards under the ltip may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. from april2004 through january2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the ltip, and no more than 64million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient.
texaco stock incentive plan (texaco sip) on the closing of the acquisition of texaco in october
2001, outstanding options granted under the texaco sip were converted to chevron options. these
options, which have 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. this provision enables a participant who exercises a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. the
restored options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price
is the market value of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. beginning in
2007, restored options were issued under the ltip. no further awards may be granted under the
former texaco plans.
unocal share-based plans (unocal plans) when chevron acquired unocal in august2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various unocal plans were exchanged for
fully vested chevron options and appreciation rights. these awards retained the same provisions as
the original unocal plans. if not exercised, these awards will expire between early 2010 and early
2015.

during this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of
these awards.
as of december31, 2009, there was $233 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans.
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8years.
at january1, 2009, the number of ltip performance units outstanding was equivalent to
2,400,555 shares. during 2009, 992,800 units were granted, 668,953 units vested with cash proceeds
distributed to recipients and 45,294 units were forfeited. at december31, 2009, units outstanding
were 2,679,108, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $233. in
addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various
ltip and former texaco and unocal programs totaled approximately 1.5million equivalent shares as
of december31, 2009. a liability of $45 was recorded for these awards.
in march2009, chevron granted all eligible ltip employees restricted stock units in lieu of
annual cash bonus. the expense associated with these special restricted stock units was recognized
at the time of the grants. a total of 453,965 units were granted at $69.70 per unit at the time of
the grant. total fair value of the special restricted stock units was $32 as of december31, 2009.
all of the special restricted stock units will be payable in november2010.
note 21
employee benefit plans
the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically
prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where
prefunding provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified plans are subject to
the employee retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the company does not
typically fund u.s. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under
laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and
investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives.
the company also sponsors other postretirement (opeb)plans that provide medical and dental
benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans are
unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. medical coverage for medicare-eligible
retirees in the companys main u.s. medical plan is secondary to medicare (including partd), and
the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4
percent per year. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
under accounting standards for postretirement benefits (asc 715), the company recognizes the
overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb as an asset or
liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
the funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans for 2009 and
2008 is on the following page:

net actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december
31, 2009, for the companys u.s. pension, international pension and opeb plans are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over approximately 11, 13 and 10years, respectively. these amortization
periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits
under the plans. these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10percent of the higher of
the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. the amount subject to
amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. during 2010, the company estimates actuarial
losses of $318, $102 and $26 will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s.
pension, international pension and opeb plans, respec-
tively. in addition, the company estimates an
additional $220 will be recognized from accumulated
other comprehensive loss during 2010 related to lump-sum settlement costs from u.s. pension plans.
the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits)
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31, 2009, was approximately eight
and 12years for u.s. and international pension plans, respectively, and eight years for other
postretirement benefit plans. during 2010, the company estimates prior service (credits)costs of
$(7), $27 and $(74) will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s. pension,
international pension and opeb plans, respectively.

expected return on plan assets the companys estimated long-term rates of return on
pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of
expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific
asset-class risk factors. asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan
asset/liability studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with
these studies.
there have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for u.s. plans, which account for 69percent of the companys pension plan assets. at december31,
2009, the estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.8percent.
the market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end
measurement date, as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting
rules. management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year.
for other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2009, the company selected a 5.3
percent discount rate for the u.s. pension plan and 5.8percent for the u.s. postretirement benefit
plan. this rate was based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the citigroup pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2009. the discount rates at the end of
2008 and 2007 were 6.3percent for the u.s. pension plan and the opeb plan.
other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
december31, 2009, for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care
cost-trend rates start with 7percent in 2010 and gradually decline to 5percent for 2018 and
beyond. for this measurement at december31, 2008, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started
with 7percent in 2009 and gradually declined to 5percent for 2017 and beyond. in both
measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4percent.
assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. the impact is mitigated by the 4percent cap on the companys medical
contributions for the primary u.s. plan. a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

plan assets and investment strategy effective december31, 2009, the company implemented the
expanded disclosure requirements for the plan assets of defined benefit pension and opeb plans (asc
715) to provide users of financial statements with an understanding of: how investment allocation
decisions are made; the major categories of plan assets; the inputs and valuation techniques used
to measure the fair value of plan assets; the effect of fair-value measurements using unobservable
inputs on changes in plan assets for the period; and significant concentrations of risk within plan
assets.
the fair-value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided
into three levels:
fs-55
table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note 21 employee benefit plans - continued
level 1: fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices
for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability
to access.
level 2: fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in
active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. if the
asset has a contractual term, the level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of
the asset. the fair values for level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker
quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges.
level 3: inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. valuation may
be performed using a financial model with estimated inputs entered into the model.

u.s. equities include investments in the companys common stock in the amount of
$29 at december31, 2009.
collective trusts/mutual funds for u.s. plans are entirely index funds; for
international plans, they are mostly index funds. for these index funds, the level 2
designation is based
on the restriction that advance notification of redemptions, typically two business days, is
required.
mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed income
instruments in order to diversify and lower risk.
the year-end valuations of the u.s. real estate assets are based on internal
appraisals by the real estate managers, which are updates of third-party appraisals that occur
at least once
a year for each property in the portfolio.
the other asset category includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet
settled (level 1); dividends, interest- and tax-related receivables (level 2); insurance
contracts
and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (level 3).

the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest
rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate
potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for
benefit payments and portfolio management.
the companys u.s. and u.k. pension plans comprise 84percent of the total pension assets.
both the u.s. and u.k. plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to
review the asset holdings and their returns. to assess the plans investment performance, long-term
asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
for the primary u.s. pension plan, the chevron board of directors has established the
following approved asset allocation ranges: equities 40-70percent, fixed income and cash 20-60
percent, real estate 0-15percent, and other 0-5percent. for the u.k. pension plan, the u.k. board
of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed
regularly: equities 60-80percent and fixed income and cash 2040percent. the other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that
vary by plan. actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current
economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset category risk. there are no
significant concentrations of risk in plan assets due to the diversification of investment
categories.
the company does not prefund its opeb obligations.
cash contributions and benefit payments in 2009, the company contributed $1,494 and $245 to its
u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. in 2010, the company expects contributions to
be approximately $600 and $300 to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $208 in 2010,

employee savings investment plan eligible employees of chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the chevron employee savings investment plan (esip).
charges to expense for the esip represent the companys contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop), which is
described in the section that follows. total company matching contributions to employee accounts
within the esip were $257, $231 and $206 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. this cost was
reduced by the value of shares released from the lesop totaling $184, $40 and $33 in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. the remaining amounts, totaling $73, $191 and $173 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, represent open market purchases.
employee stock ownership plan within the chevron esip is an employee stock ownership plan (esop).
in 1989, chevron established a lesop as a constituent part of the esop. the lesop provides partial
prefunding of the companys future commitments to the esip.
as permitted by accounting standards for share-based compensation (asc 718), the debt of the
lesop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of equity.
the company reports compensation expense equal to lesop debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the lesop for debt service. interest accrued on lesop debt is
recorded as interest expense. dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. all lesop shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.
total credits to expense for the lesop were $3, $1 and $1 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. the net credit for the respective years was composed of credits to compensation
expense of $15, $15 and $17 and charges to interest expense for lesop debt of $12, $14 and $16.
of the dividends paid on the lesop shares, $110, $35 and $8 were used in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, to service lesop debt. no contributions were required in 2009, 2008 or 2007 as
dividends received by the lesop were sufficient to satisfy lesop debt service.

benefit plan trusts prior to its acquisition by chevron, texaco established a benefit plan
trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. at year-end 2009, the trust
contained 14.2million shares of chevron treasury stock. the trust will sell the shares or use the
dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such
benefits. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the
trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the
shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until
distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
prior to its acquisition by chevron, unocal established various grantor trusts to fund
obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental
retirement plans. at december31, 2009 and 2008, trust assets of $57 and $60, respectively, were
invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.
employee incentive plans effective january2008, the company established the chevron incentive plan
(cip), a single annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, unit
and individual performance in the prior year. this plan replaced other cash bonus programs, which
primarily included the management incentive plan (mip)and the chevron success sharing program. in
2009 and 2008, charges to expense for cash bonuses were $561 and $757, respectively. in 2007,
charges to expense for mip were $184 and charges for other cash bonus programs were $431. chevron
also has the ltip for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its
subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. awards under the ltip consist of
stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in note 20, on page fs-51.
note 22
other contingencies and commitments
income taxes the company calculates its income tax expense
and liabilities quarterly. these liabilities generally are subject
to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. refer to
note 15 beginning on page fs-46 for a
discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the companys major tax
jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. the company does not expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
guarantees the companys guarantee of approximately $600 is associated with certain payments under
a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. the terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and
motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300. through the end of 2009, the company paid $48 under these
indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification payments in the
future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims had to be asserted by february2009 for equilon indemnities and must be
asserted no later than february2012 for motiva indemnities. under the terms of these indemnities,
there is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. in february2009, shell
delivered a letter to the company purporting to preserve unmatured claims for certain equilon
indemnities. the letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount. management does
not believe this letter or any other information provides a basis to estimate the amount, if any,
of a range of loss or potential range of loss with respect to either
the equilon or the motiva indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no
payments under the indemnities.
fs-58
table of contents
note 22 other contingencies and commitments - continued
the amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or
motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. the acquirer of those
assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which
had been reached at december31, 2009. under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200
obligation, chevron is solely responsible until april2022, when the indemnification expires. the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
the sale of the assets in 1997.
although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable
and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. the
aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2010
$7,500; 2011  $4,300; 2012  $1,400; 2013  $1,400; 2014  $1,000; 2015 and after  $4,100. a
portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under
the agreements were approximately $8,100 in 2009, $5,100 in 2008 and $3,700 in 2007.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private
claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements
or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects
on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the
company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude-oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development
areas, and mining operations,
whether operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.
chevrons environmental reserve as of december31, 2009, was $1,700. included in this balance
were remediation activities at approximately 250 sites for which the company
had been identified as a
potentially
responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection
agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or
analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2009 was $185.
the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron
to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2009 environmental reserves balance of $1,515, $820 related to the
companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations
(i.e., service stations and terminals), and pipelines. the remaining $695 was associated with
various sites in international downstream ($107), upstream ($369), chemicals ($149) and other
businesses ($70). liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,

states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2009
had a recorded liability that was material to the companys results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
refer to note 23 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations.
equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude-oil and natural-gas reserves. these
activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve at elk hills,
california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the u.s.
department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
for this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to chevron is estimated
at about $150. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this range of estimates are
uncertain.
other contingencies chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners;
u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers.
the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy
periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
note 23
asset retirement obligations
in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (asc 410), the
company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (aro)when there
is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement
activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of
settlement that may be beyond the companys control. this uncertainty about the timing and/or
method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information
exists to reasonably estimate fair value. the legal obligations associated with the retirement of
the tangible long-lived assets require recognition in certain circumstances including: (1)the
present value of a liability and offsetting asset for an aro, (2)the subsequent accretion of that
liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates
and discount rates.
accounting standards for asset retirement obligations primarily affect the companys
accounting for crude-oil and natural-gas producing assets. no significant aros associated with any
legal obligations to retire refining, marketing and transportation (downstream)and chemical
long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements
prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews
of its downstream and chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that
might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2009, 2008 and 2007:

salary and other compensation awards that are invested in chevron stock units by certain officers
and employees of the company and the companys share of stock transactions of affiliates, which,
under the applicable accounting rules, may be recorded directly to the companys retained earnings
instead of net income. diluted eps includes the effects of these items as well as the
dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the companys stock option programs
(refer to note 20, stock options and other
share-based compensation, beginning on page fs-51).

table v reserve quantity information
reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource
classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum
engineers, the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists. the
system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting  three deemed commercial and three noncommercial. within the commercial classification
are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. the noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all sec and company standards.
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known
reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. net
proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual
arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. proved developed reserves are
the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves
are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. as
part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the com-
pany maintains a reserves advisory committee (rac)that is chaired by the corporate reserves
manager, who is a member of a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman
responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and production activities. the corporate
reserves manager has more than 30years experience working in the oil and gas industry and a
masters of science in petroleum engineering. all rac members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines
for proved reserves classification. the rac manages its activities through two operating
company-level reserves managers. these two reserves managers are not members of the rac so as to
preserve the corporate-level independence.
the rac has the following primary responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the business
units recommended reserve changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with
sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate
standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which provides
standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
during the year, the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business
units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. major changes
are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee and the executive committee,
whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. the companys
annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors. if major changes to reserves
were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the board.

reserve quantity information - continued
rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have the
largest proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve
records and documentation of their alignment with the corporate reserves manual.

revised oil and gas reporting in december2008, the sec issued its final rule, modernization
of oil and gas reporting (release nos. 33-8995; 34-59192; fr-78). the disclosure requirements under
the final rule became effective for the company with its form 10-k filing for the year ending
december31, 2009. the final rule changes a number of oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure
requirements under sec regulations s-k and s-x. subsequently, the fasb updated extractive
industries  oil and gas (topic 932) to align the oil and gas reserves estimation and disclosure
requirements with the secs final rule.
among the principal changes in the final rule are requirements to use a price based on a 12-month
average for reserve estimation and disclosure instead of a single end-of-year price; expanding the
definition of oil and gas producing activities to include nontraditional sources such as bitumen
extracted from oil sands; permitting the use of new reliable technologies to establish reasonable
certainty of proved reserves; allowing optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves;
modifying the definition of geographic area for disclosure of reserve estimates and production;
amending
disclosures of proved reserve quantities to include separate disclosures of synthetic oil and gas;
expanding proved undeveloped reserves disclosures, including discussion of proved undeveloped
reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more; and disclosure of the
qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the companys overall reserves estimation
process.
effect of new rules the most significant effect of the companys adopting the new guidance was the
inclusion of canadian oil sands as synthetic oil in the consolidated companies reserves. as
indicated in table v, on page fs-72, an additional 460million boe were included at year-end 2009.
the synthetic oil reported for affiliated companies represents volumes reclassified from
heavy crude oil to synthetic oil, and does not represent additional reserves. it was
impracticable to estimate the remaining impact of the new rules because of the cost and resources
required to prepare detailed field-level calculations. however, the use of the 12-month average
price had an upward effect on reserves related to production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts
as the 12-month average price for crude oil and

natural gas for 2009 was lower than the 2009year-end spot prices applicable under the old
rules. the ability to use new technologies in reserves determination did not impact reserves
significantly, as most reserve additions and revisions were based on conventional technologies.
proved undeveloped reserve quantities at the end of 2009, proved undeveloped oil-equivalent
reserves for consolidated companies totaled 3.1billion barrels. approximately 58percent of the
reserves are attributed to natural gas, of which about half were located in australia in the other
regions. crude oil, condensate and ngls accounted for about 33percent of the total, with the
largest concentration of these reserves in africa, asia and the united states. synthetic oil
accounted for the balance of the reserves and were located in canada in the other regions.
proved undeveloped reserves of equity affiliates amounted to 1.3billion oil-equivalent barrels. at
year-end, crude oil, condensate and ngls represented 58percent of the total reserves, with the tco
affiliate accounting for the majority of the amount. natural gas represented 26percent of the
total, with over half of these reserves at tco. the balance is attributed to synthetic oil in
venezuela in the other regions.
in 2009, worldwide proved undeveloped oil-equivalent reserves increased by 480million barrels for
consolidated companies and decreased 19million barrels for equity affiliates. the largest
increase for consolidated companies was in the other regions, resulting primarily from initial
recognition of reserves for the gorgon project in australia and addition of synthetic oil
reserves related to canadian oil sands with adoption of the new definition of oil and gas activity.
proved undeveloped reserves decreased in asia, africa, and the united states, as a result of
development drilling and other activities, which reclassified reserves to proved developed.
proved undeveloped reserves decreased for affiliated companies. this was primarily associated with
a 146million barrel reclassification to proved developed as a result of the tco production
capacity added with the completion of the sour gas injection/second generation plant projects
(sgi/sgp). the decrease at tco was partially offset by increased proved undeveloped reserves in
venezuela and for angola lng due to reservoir performance and additional drilling opportunities.
there were no material downward revisions of proved undeveloped reserves for consolidated or
affiliated companies.
investment to convert proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves during 2009, investments
totaling about $6.9billion were made by consolidated companies and equity affiliates to advance
the development of proved undeveloped reserves. in the africa region, $2.5billion was expended on
various projects, including offshore development projects in nigeria and angola, which advanced
development drilling, and the completion of a nigerian natural gas processing project. in the asia
region, expenditures during the year totaled $1.5billion, which included construction on a gas
processing
facility in thailand and development drilling at a steam-flood project in indonesia. in the united
states, expenditures totaled $1.7billion for three offshore development projects in the gulf of
mexico and various smaller development projects. in the other regions, development expenditures
totaled $1.2billion for a variety of projects including development activities in australia and
the united kingdom.
during
the year, eight major development projects that were placed into service resulted in the
recognition of proved developed reserves.
proved undeveloped reserves for 5 years or more reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or
more years are a result of several physical factors that affect optimal project development and
execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations,
physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression
projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate
production levels.
proved undeveloped oil-equivalent reserves for consolidated and affiliated companies totaled 4.4
billion barrels at year-end 2009. of this total, 1.7billion barrels corresponds to proved
undeveloped
oil-equivalent reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more.
consolidated companies held approximately 700million barrels of the proved undeveloped reserves
over five years. in africa, approximately 400million barrels were related to deepwater projects
under development. the asia region held approximately 100million barrels related to compression
and contract restrictions. the other regions held about 100million barrels related to compression
projects in australia. the balance relates to capacity constraints and various projects in
the united states.
at year end, affiliated companies held about 1.0billion barrels of proved undeveloped reserves
over five years. tco accounted for 800million oil-equivalent barrels of reserves, which was
primarily related to plant capacity limitations. the balance related to capacity limitations at a
synthetic oil project in venezuela.
annually,
the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to
development plans, regulations or government policies, which would warrant a revision to reserve
estimates. for 2009, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified
as proved undeveloped. over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total
proved reserves has ranged between 35 and 39percent. the consistent completion of major capital
projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period.
proved reserve quantities at december31, 2009, oil-equivalent reserves for the companys
consolidated operations were 8.3billion barrels. (refer to the term reserves on page e-42 for
the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) approximately 22percent of the total reserves were
located

reserve quantity information - continued
in the united states. for the companys interests in equity affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves
were 3.0billion barrels, 80percent of which were associated with the companys 50percent
ownership in tco.
aside from the tengiz field in the tco affiliate, no single property accounted for more than 5
percent of the companys total oil-equivalent proved reserves. about 25 other individual properties
in the companys portfolio of assets each contained between 1percent and 5percent of the
companys oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for approximately
percent of the companys total proved reserves. these properties were geographically dispersed,
located in the united states, canada, south america, west africa, the middle east, southeast asia,
and australia.
in the united states, total oil-equivalent reserves at year-end 2009 were 1.8billion barrels.
california properties accounted for approximately 44percent of the u.s. reserves, with most
classified as heavy oil. because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced
recovery methods, the producing operations are capital intensive in nature. most of the companys
heavy-oil fields in california employ
a continuous steamflooding process. the gulf of mexico region contains about 22percent of the u.s. reserves,
with liquids representing about 15percent of reserves. production operations are mostly offshore
and, as a result, are also capital intensive. other u.s. areas represent the remaining 34percent
of u.s. reserves, which are about evenly split between liquids and natural gas. for production of
crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including water-flood and co2
injection.
for the three years ending december31, 2009, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. apart from acquisitions, the
companys ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and
circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, declines in oil and gas prices, opec constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest.
the companys estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes thereto for the
years 2007, 2008 and 2009 are shown in the following table and on page fs-74.

noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved-reserve changes for 2007 through 2009
are discussed below:
revisions in 2007, net revisions decreased reserves by 146million barrels for worldwide
consolidated companies and increased reserves by 103million barrels for equity affiliates. for
consolidated companies, the largest downward net revisions were 89million barrels in africa and 54
million barrels in asia.
in 2008, net revisions increased reserves by 536million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and increased reserves by 267million barrels for equity affiliates. for consolidated
companies, the largest increase was in the asia region, which added 574million barrels. the
majority of the increase was in the partitioned zone, as a result of a concession extension, and
indonesia, due to lower year-end prices. upward
revisions were also recorded in kazakhstan and azerbaijan and were mainly associated with the
effect of lower year-end prices on the calculation of reserves associated with production-sharing
and variable-royalty contracts. in indonesia, reserves increased due mainly to the impact of lower
year-end prices on the reserve calculations for
production-sharing contracts, as well as a result
of development drilling and improved waterflood and steam-flood performance. these increases were
offset by downward revisions in the united states and other regions. for affiliated companies, the
249million-barrel increase for tco was due to the effect of lower year-end prices on the royalty
determination and facility optimization at the tengiz and korolev fields.
in 2009, net revisions increased reserves by 355million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and decreased reserves by 187million barrels for equity affiliates. for consolidated
companies, the largest increase was 460million barrels in the other regions due to the inclusion
of synthetic oil related to canadian oil sands. in the united states, reserves increased 63
million barrels as a result of development drilling and performance revisions. the increases were
partially offset by decreases of 121million barrels in asia and 46million barrels in africa. in
asia, decreases in indonesia and azerbaijan were driven by the effect of higher 12-month average
prices on the calculation of reserves associated with
production-sharing contracts and the effect
of reservoir performance revisions. in africa, reserves in nigeria declined as a result of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts and reservoir performance.
for affiliated companies, tco declined by 184million-barrels primarily due to the effect of
higher 12-month average prices on royalty determination. for other affiliated companies, 266
million barrels of heavy crude oil were reclassified to synthetic oil for the activities in
venezuela.
improved recovery in 2007, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 20million barrels
worldwide. no addition was individually significant.
in 2008, improved recovery increased worldwide liquids volumes by 37million barrels. for
consolidated companies, the largest addition was in the asia region related to gas reinjection in
kazakhstan. affiliated companies increased reserves 10million barrels due to improved secondary
recovery at boscan.
in 2009, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 86million barrels worldwide.
consolidated companies accounted for 50million barrels. the largest addition was related to
improved secondary recovery in nigeria. affiliated companies increased reserves 36million barrels
due to improvements related to the tco sgi/sgp facilities.
extensions and discoveries in 2007, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 60
million barrels worldwide. the largest additions were 36million barrels in the united states,
mainly for the deepwater tahiti and mad dog fields in the gulf of mexico.
in 2008, extensions and discoveries increased consolidated company reserves 33million barrels
worldwide. the united states increased reserves 17million barrels, primarily in the gulf of
mexico. the africa, asia, and other regions increased reserves 16million barrels with no one
country resulting in additions greater than 5million barrels.
in 2009, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 52million barrels worldwide.
the largest additions were 33million barrels in other regions related to the gorgon project in
australia and delineation drilling in argentina. africa and the united states accounted for 10
million barrels and 6million barrels, respectively.
purchases in 2007, acquisitions of 316million barrels for equity affiliates related to the
formation of a new hamaca equity affiliate in venezuela.
sales in 2007, affiliated company sales of 432million barrels related to the dissolution of a
hamaca equity affiliate in venezuela.

noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas
proved-reserve changes for 2007 through
2009 are discussed below:
revisions in 2007, net revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by 395 bcf and
increased reserves for affiliated companies by 73 bcf. for consolidated companies, net increases of
346 bcf in asia and 209 bcf in the united states were partially offset by downward revisions of 160
bcf in africa and other regions. in the asia region, drilling activities in thailand added 360 bcf,
which were partially offset by downward revisions in azerbaijan and kazakhstan due to the impact of
higher prices. in the united states, improved reservoir performance for many fields contributed to
the increase with the largest portion in the
mid-continent areas. decreases in africa were
primarily due to a 136 bcf downward revision in nigeria resulting from field performance. the other
regions had net downward revisions of 19 bcf. a 185 bcf downward revision in australia due to
drilling results and other smaller declines
were mostly offset by improved reservoir performance in trinidad and tobago which added 188 bcf.
tco had an upward revision of 75 bcf associated with improved reservoir performance and
development activities. this upward revision was net of a negative impact due to higher year-end
prices on royalty determination.
in 2008, net revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by 1,166 bcf and
increased reserves for affiliated companies by 1,130 bcf. in the asia region, positive revisions
totaled 1,073 bcf for consolidated companies. almost half of the increase was attributed to the
karachaganak field in kazakhstan, due mainly to the effects of low year-end prices on the
production-sharing contract and the results of development drilling and improved recovery. other
large upward revisions were recorded for the pattani field in thailand due to a successful drilling
campaign.
for the tco affiliate in kazakhstan, an increase of 498 bcf reflected the impacts of lower
year-end prices on royalty determination and facility optimization. reserves associated
fs-74
table of contents
supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities
with the angola lng project accounted for a majority of the 632 bcf increase in other affiliated companies.
in 2009, net revisions increased reserves by 569 bcf for consolidated companies and decreased
reserves by 44 bcf for affiliated companies. for consolidated companies, net increases were 493 bcf
in asia primarily as a result of reservoir studies in bangladesh and development drilling in
thailand. these results were partially offset by a downward revision due to the impact of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts in myanmar. the united states and other regions increased
reserves 39 bcf and 33 bcf, respectively. in the united states, development drilling in the gulf of
mexico was partially offset by performance revisions in the california and mid-continent areas. in
other regions, improved reservoir performance and compression in australia was partially offset by
the effect of higher prices on production-sharing contracts in trinidad.
for equity affiliates, a downward revision of 237 bcf at tco was due to the effect of higher
prices on royalty determination and an increase in gas injection for sgi/sgp facilities. this
decline was partially offset by performance and drilling opportunities related to the angola lng
project.
extensions and discoveries in 2007, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of
518 bcf worldwide. the largest addition was 330 bcf in bangladesh, the result of drilling
activities. other additions were not individually significant.
in 2009, worldwide extensions and discoveries of 4,387 bcf were attributed to consolidated
companies. the gorgon project in australia accounted for essentially all of the 4,277 bcf additions
in the other regions. in asia, development drilling in thailand accounted for the majority of the
increase. in the united states, delineation drilling in california accounted for the majority of
the increase.
purchases in 2007, purchases of natural gas reserves were 141 bcf for consolidated companies,
which include the acquisition of an additional interest in the bibiyana field in bangladesh.
affiliated company purchases of 211 bcf related to the formation of a new hamaca equity affiliate
in venezuela and an initial booking related to the angola lng project.
sales in 2007, sales were 76 bcf and 175 bcf for consolidated companies and equity affiliates,
respectively. the affiliated company sales related to the dissolution of a hamaca equity affiliate
in venezuela.
in 2009, worldwide sales of 117 bcf were related to consolidated companies. for the other
regions, the sale of properties in argentina accounted for 84 bcf. the sale of properties in the
gulf of mexico accounted for the majority of the 33 bcf decrease in the united states.
table vi
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved
oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the fasb. estimated
future cash inflows from production are computed by applying
12month-average prices for oil and
gas to year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are limited to
those provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. future
development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and
produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of
year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations.
estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates.
these rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax
net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. discounted future net cash flows are
calculated using 10percent midperiod discount factors. discounting requires a year-by-year
estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.
the information provided does not represent managements estimate of the companys expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. estimates of proved-reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. the
arbitrary valuation prescribed by the fasb requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. the calculations are made as of december31 each year and
should not be relied upon as an indication of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil
and gas reserves. in the following table, standardized measure net cash flows refers to the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
