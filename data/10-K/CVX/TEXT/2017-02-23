GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON CORPORATION,

*

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL, MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN INTEGRATED ENERGY AND CHEMICALS OPERATIONS. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND REGASIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS; TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL EXPORT PIPELINES; TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS; AND A GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PLANT. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR; AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT ADDITIVES.

A LIST OF THE COMPANY’S MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON PAGE

E-5

. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2016

, CHEVRON HAD APPROXIMATELY 55,200 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 3,200 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES). APPROXIMATELY 26,500 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 3,100 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES), OR 48 PERCENT, WERE EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND. PRODUCTION LEVELS FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY. DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, AFFECT WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME CASES, LIMIT THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED, MAJOR GLOBAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES, FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LEASES AND OTHER PROPERTIES AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CHEVRON COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED, MAJOR PETROLEUM COMPANIES, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND CHEMICALS ENTITIES AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES, IN THE SALE OR ACQUISITION OF VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

THE COMPANY DESIGNS, OPERATES AND MAINTAINS ITS FACILITIES TO AVOID POTENTIAL SPILLS OR LEAKS AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THOSE THAT MAY OCCUR. CHEVRON REQUIRES ITS FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS TO HAVE OPERATING STANDARDS AND PROCESSES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANS THAT ADDRESS ALL CREDIBLE AND SIGNIFICANT RISKS IDENTIFIED THROUGH SITE-SPECIFIC RISK AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. CHEVRON ALSO REQUIRES THAT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES BE AVAILABLE TO EXECUTE THESE PLANS. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT A MAJOR SPILL OR LEAK OCCURS, CHEVRON ALSO MAINTAINS A WORLDWIDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE TRAINED IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE, INCLUDING POST-INCIDENT REMEDIATION.

TO COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY’S CAPABILITIES, CHEVRON MAINTAINS ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL OIL SPILL RESPONSE COOPERATIVES, INCLUDING THE MARINE SPILL RESPONSE CORPORATION, WHICH OPERATES IN U.S. TERRITORIAL WATERS, AND OIL SPILL RESPONSE, LTD., WHICH OPERATES GLOBALLY. THE COMPANY IS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE MARINE WELL CONTAINMENT COMPANY, WHOSE PRIMARY MISSION IS TO EXPEDIENTLY DEPLOY CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS TO CAPTURE AND CONTAIN CRUDE OIL IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF A FUTURE LOSS OF CONTROL OF A DEEPWATER WELL IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY AND ITS OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISKS ARE NOT WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CONTROL AND COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY PRICES

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS THAT HAS A HISTORY OF PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL, WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT MIGHT BE IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS. CHEVRON EVALUATES THE RISK OF CHANGING COMMODITY PRICES AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS PLANNING PROCESS. AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY CARRIES SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN GLOBAL CRUDE OIL PRICES.

EXTENDED PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY’S UPSTREAM EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS, AND CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, AS COULD ITS PRODUCTION AND PROVED RESERVES. UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BECAUSE THEY DEPEND UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCT SALES. A SIGNIFICANT OR SUSTAINED DECLINE IN LIQUIDITY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S CREDIT RATINGS, POTENTIALLY INCREASE FINANCING COSTS AND REDUCE ACCESS TO DEBT MARKETS. THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO REALIZE ANTICIPATED COST SAVINGS, EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS AND ASSET SALES THAT ARE INTENDED TO COMPENSATE FOR SUCH DOWNTURNS. IN SOME CASES, LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DIVESTED ASSETS MAY RETURN TO THE COMPANY WHEN AN ACQUIRER OF THOSE ASSETS SUBSEQUENTLY DECLARES BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION, EXTENDED PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY’S SUPPLIERS, VENDORS, PARTNERS AND EQUITY AFFILIATES UPON WHICH THE COMPANY’S OWN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION DEPENDS.

THE SCOPE OF CHEVRON’S BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF IT IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION OR THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON BUDGET AND ON SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES BEYOND ITS CONTROL

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES BEYOND ITS CONTROL, INCLUDING PHYSICAL RISKS FROM HURRICANES, SEVERE STORMS, FLOODS AND OTHER FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, ACCIDENTS, CIVIL UNREST, POLITICAL EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, SYSTEM FAILURES, CYBER THREATS AND TERRORIST ACTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRON'S RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO ASSESS POTENTIAL PHYSICAL AND OTHER RISKS TO ITS OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND TO PLAN FOR THEIR RESILIENCY. WHILE CAPITAL INVESTMENT REVIEWS AND DECISIONS INCORPORATE POTENTIAL RANGES OF PHYSICAL RISKS SUCH AS STORM SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY, SEA LEVEL RISE, AIR AND WATER TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, FRESH WATER ACCESS, WIND SPEED, AND EARTHQUAKE SEVERITY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE TIMING, FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF SUCH EVENTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CYBERATTACKS TARGETING CHEVRON’S PROCESS CONTROL NETWORKS OR OTHER DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THERE ARE NUMEROUS AND EVOLVING RISKS TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY FROM CYBER THREAT ACTORS, INCLUDING CRIMINAL HACKERS, STATE-SPONSORED INTRUSIONS, INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE AND EMPLOYEE MALFEASANCE. ALTHOUGH CHEVRON DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PREVENT UNWANTED INTRUSIONS AND TO PROTECT ITS SYSTEMS AND DATA, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE CYBER INCIDENTS OF VARYING DEGREES IN THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS. CYBER THREAT ACTORS COULD COMPROMISE THE COMPANY’S PROCESS CONTROL NETWORKS OR OTHER CRITICAL SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, RESULTING IN DISRUPTIONS TO ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INJURY TO PEOPLE, HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT OR ASSETS, ACCESS TO ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEMS, OR LOSS, MISUSE OR CORRUPTION OF CRITICAL DATA AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, BUSINESS INFORMATION AND THAT OF ITS EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES. CYBER EVENTS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES, LEGAL OR REGULATORY VIOLATIONS, REPUTATIONAL HARM, AND LEGAL LIABILITY AND COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS HAVE INHERENT RISKS AND HAZARDS THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AND CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT

CHEVRON’S RESULTS DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE THE RISKS AND HAZARDS INHERENT TO OPERATING IN THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

20

INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO MINIMIZE THESE OPERATIONAL RISKS BY CAREFULLY DESIGNING AND BUILDING ITS FACILITIES AND CONDUCTING ITS OPERATIONS IN A SAFE AND RELIABLE MANNER. HOWEVER, FAILURE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS EFFECTIVELY COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND RESULT IN UNEXPECTED INCIDENTS, INCLUDING RELEASES, EXPLOSIONS OR MECHANICAL FAILURES RESULTING IN PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF LIFE, ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF REVENUES, LEGAL LIABILITY AND/OR DISRUPTION TO OPERATIONS. CHEVRON HAS IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CORPORATE POLICIES, PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS, BEHAVIORS AND COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS TO MANAGE SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY RISKS; TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND POLICIES; AND TO RESPOND TO AND LEARN FROM UNEXPECTED INCIDENTS. IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE CHEVRON IS NOT THE OPERATOR, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL OVER THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE AND CONTROL SUCH RISKS.

CHEVRON’S BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS FROM LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENT ACTION

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. CHEVRON'S OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. OFTEN THESE OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL. ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN OPERATIONS ARISING FROM PRIVATE LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENT ACTION, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT SOCIETAL PRESSURES OR POLITICAL OR OTHER FACTORS ARE INVOLVED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE IMPOSED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE COMPANY’S CAUSATION OF OR CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASSERTED DAMAGE, OR TO OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS.

FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING SOME OF THE LITIGATION IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, INCLUDING INFORMATION RELATING TO ECUADOR MATTERS, SEE

NOTE 1

8

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-45.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT INSURE AGAINST ALL POTENTIAL LOSSES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE OR THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITIES TO FULLY COVER ALL OPERATIONAL RISKS OR POTENTIAL LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT OR SERIES OF INCIDENTS CAUSING CATASTROPHIC LOSS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY IS, TO A SUBSTANTIAL EXTENT, SELF-INSURED FOR SUCH EVENTS. THE COMPANY RELIES ON EXISTING LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS THAT WOULD ARISE FROM SUCH AN EVENT OR SERIES OF EVENTS. THE OCCURRENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT OR UNFORESEEN LIABILITY FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT FULLY INSURED OR FOR WHICH INSURANCE RECOVERY IS SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT COULD HARM CHEVRON’S BUSINESS

THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY’S PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES. IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE PROPOSED OR IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS, EXPORT AND EXCHANGE CONTROLS, BURDENSOME TAXES, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT MIGHT HARM THE COMPANY’S COMPETITIVENESS OR RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR THIRD PARTIES. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANY’S CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES, AND INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN NATIONAL, STATE OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR LAWS, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO STOP OR IMPEDE THE DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO THE USE OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING OR BANS ON DRILLING, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S CURRENT OR ANTICIPATED FUTURE OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY.

REGULATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRON’S OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRON’S HYDROCARBON AND OTHER PRODUCTS

IN THE YEARS AHEAD, COMPANIES IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY, LIKE CHEVRON, MAY BE CHALLENGED BY AN INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC REGULATION RELATING TO GHG EMISSIONS.  SUCH REGULATION COULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF CURTAILING PROFITABILITY IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR OR RENDERING THE EXTRACTION OF THE COMPANY’S OIL AND GAS RESOURCES ECONOMICALLY INFEASIBLE.  ALTHOUGH THE IEA’S WORLD ENERGY OUTLOOK SCENARIOS ANTICIPATE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OIL TO CONTINUE INCREASING UNTIL 2040, AND EVEN GHG-CONSTRAINED SCENARIOS (SUCH AS THE IEA’S 450 CASE) ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT DEMAND FOR PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS GIVEN THEIR RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES IN TRANSPORTATION AND POWER GENERATION, IF A NEW ONSET OF REGULATION CONTRIBUTES TO A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY AND ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS (E.G., THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL) AND NATIONAL (E.G., CARBON TAX, CAP-AND-TRADE OR EFFICIENCY STANDARDS), REGIONAL AND STATE LEGISLATION (E.G., CALIFORNIA AB32 AND SB32; LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS) AND REGULATORY MEASURES (E.G., THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S METHANE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS) THAT AIM TO LIMIT OR REDUCE GHG

21

EMISSIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PARIS AGREEMENT WENT INTO EFFECT IN NOVEMBER 2016, AND A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE ADOPTING POLICIES TO MEET THEIR PARIS AGREEMENT GOALS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COMPLYING WITH CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE FEDERAL RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD PROGRAM, AND RELATED VOLUME STANDARDS, AND STATE REGULATIONS SUCH AS CALIFORNIA AB32, INCLUDING THE CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM AND RELATED LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD OBLIGATIONS. FOLLOW-ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA AB32, KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA SB32, WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN 2016, WITH EFFECT IN 2020, AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE SCOPING PLAN PHASE. SEPARATELY, OTHER STATES AND LOCALITIES HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TO DIRECTLY REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS THROUGH MECHANISMS SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, A CARBON TAX. MANY OF THE FOREGOING ARE STILL IN A PROPOSAL STAGE AND OTHERS FACE LEGAL CHALLENGE OR LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO BE REPEALED OR SIGNIFICANTLY REFORMED. THUS, EVEN WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE LANDSCAPE CONTINUES TO BE IN A STATE OF CONSTANT RE-ASSESSMENT AND LEGAL CHALLENGE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE ULTIMATE IMPACT THAT SUCH REGULATIONS WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANY.

GHG EMISSIONS-RELATED LAWS AND RELATED REGULATIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF OPERATING IN A POTENTIALLY CARBON-CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT MAY RESULT IN INCREASED AND SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE, OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS AND COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS AND THE COMPANY’S HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS, MAKE THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF THE COMPANY’S RESOURCES, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S SALES VOLUMES, REVENUES AND MARGINS. GHG EMISSIONS (E.G., CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE) THAT COULD BE REGULATED INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF HYDROCARBONS SUCH AS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; THE UPGRADING OF PRODUCTION FROM OIL SANDS INTO SYNTHETIC OIL; POWER GENERATION; THE CONVERSION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INTO REFINED HYDROCARBON PRODUCTS; THE PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION AND REGASIFICATION OF NATURAL GAS; THE TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND CONSUMERS’ OR CUSTOMERS’ USE OF THE COMPANY’S HYDROCARBON PRODUCTS. MANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CONSUMERS’ AND CUSTOMERS’ USE OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMPANY’S COMPETITORS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY’S CONTROL. IN ADDITION, INCREASING ATTENTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASED POSSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS AND, POTENTIALLY, PRIVATE LITIGATION AGAINST THE COMPANY.

CONSIDERATION OF GHG ISSUES AND THE RESPONSES TO THOSE ISSUES THROUGH INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL, REGIONAL OR STATE LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE COMPANY’S STRATEGY AND PLANNING, CAPITAL INVESTMENT REVIEWS, AND RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND PROCESSES, WHERE APPLICABLE. THEY ARE ALSO FACTORED INTO THE COMPANY’S LONG-RANGE SUPPLY, DEMAND AND ENERGY PRICE FORECASTS. THESE FORECASTS REFLECT LONG-RANGE EFFECTS FROM RENEWABLE FUEL PENETRATION, ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, CLIMATE-RELATED POLICY ACTIONS, AND DEMAND RESPONSE TO OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ASSESSES CARBON PRICING RISKS BY CONSIDERING CARBON COSTS IN THESE FORECASTS. THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH NEW OR POTENTIAL CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY OR FACILITIES, SUCH AS CARBON DIOXIDE INJECTION, IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY AND IS EXPECTED TO VARY DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ENACTED IN A JURISDICTION, THE COMPANY’S ACTIVITIES IN IT AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND STATE LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GHG EMISSIONS ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE TIMING OF THESE EFFECTS, WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. SUCH FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE SECTORS COVERED, THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS REQUIRED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS OR WOULD NEED TO PURCHASE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH AUCTIONS, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF EMISSION ALLOWANCES AND CREDITS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO RECOVER THE COSTS INCURRED THROUGH THE PRICING OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS IN THE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. FURTHER, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF GHG EMISSIONS-RELATED AGREEMENTS, LEGISLATION AND MEASURES ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY, FOR A MULTITUDE OF INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS, THE OUTCOME OF POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AND THE VARIABLES AND TRADEOFFS THAT INEVITABLY OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PROCESSES.

CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD

IN PREPARING THE COMPANY’S PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INCLUDING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CHEVRON’S MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF A SPECIFIED DATE. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S BEST ESTIMATES AND EXPERIENCE AS OF THAT DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK AND UNCERTAINTY.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES: ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, AZERBAIJAN, BANGLADESH, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, COLOMBIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, DENMARK, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN, MYANMAR, NIGERIA, THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, THE PHILIPPINES, REPUBLIC OF CONGO, SINGAPORE, SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTH KOREA, THAILAND, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE UNITED STATES, AND VENEZUELA.

EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY DEPEND MOSTLY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE BIGGEST FACTOR AFFECTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL HAS FALLEN SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE MID-YEAR 2014, REFLECTING PERSISTENTLY HIGH GLOBAL CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES AND PRODUCTION. THE DOWNTURN IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL HAS IMPACTED, AND, DEPENDING UPON ITS DURATION, WILL CONTINUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, LEVERAGE, CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND PRODUCTION OUTLOOK. THE COMPANY IS RESPONDING WITH REDUCTIONS IN OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS, PACING AND RE-FOCUSING OF CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES , AND INCREASED ASSET SALES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT CRUDE OIL PRICES WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, AS CONTINUED GROWTH IN DEMAND AND A SLOWING IN SUPPLY GROWTH SHOULD BRING GLOBAL MARKETS INTO BALANCE; HOWEVER, THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH INCREASE IS UNKNOWN. IN THE COMPANY'S DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE LARGEST COST COMPONENT OF REFINED PRODUCTS. IT IS THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE TO DELIVER COMPETITIVE RESULTS AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE IN ANY BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE COMPANY CAN CHANGE SUBSTANTIALLY DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS VOLATILITY. THIS IS DUE TO THE MIX EFFECTS THAT ARE IMPACTED BOTH BY THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES AND WHETHER THEY ARISE IN HIGHER OR LOWER TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT, A DECLINE OR INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN ONE PERIOD MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF EXPECTED RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

FOR DISCUSSIONS OF NET GAINS ON ASSET SALES DURING

. ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES.

THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, THE LEVEL OF WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANY OF MOVEMENTS IN PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. MANAGEMENT TAKES THESE DEVELOPMENTS INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CONDUCT OF DAILY OPERATIONS AND FOR BUSINESS PLANNING.

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANY’S MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS OR OTHER ACTIONS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), ACTIONS OF REGULATORS, WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS OR FEARS THEREOF THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS, AND SEEKS TO MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING ITS FACILITIES AND BUSINESSES. THE LONGER-TERM TREND IN EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ALSO A FUNCTION OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OF CONTRACTS, AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE ITS SCHEDULE OF WORK, CONTRACTING, PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY-CHAIN ACTIVITIES TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE COSTS. HOWEVER, PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS CAN BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANY’S CONTROL INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION, COMMODITY PRICES AND PRICES CHARGED BY THE INDUSTRY’S MATERIAL AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE INDUSTRY’S OWN SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH MATERIALS AND SERVICES. AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN PRICES OF CRUDE OIL AND OTHER COMMODITIES SINCE MID-2014, THESE COSTS HAVE DECLINED. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY DAMAGE TO PRODUCTION FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST, DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION, OR OTHER FACTORS.

THE CHART ABOVE SHOWS THE TREND IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR BRENT CRUDE OIL, WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE OIL AND U.S. HENRY HUB NATURAL GAS. THE BRENT PRICE AVERAGED $44 PER BARREL FOR THE FULL-YEAR

2016

, COMPARED TO $52 IN

2015

. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY

2017

, THE BRENT PRICE WAS $55 PER BARREL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY’S EQUITY CRUDE PRODUCTION IS PRICED BASED ON THE BRENT BENCHMARK. CRUDE OIL PRICES REMAINED LOW THROUGH MUCH OF 2016, BUT INCREASED MODESTLY LATE IN THE YEAR AFTER OPEC ANNOUNCED PRODUCTION CUTS. ON NOVEMBER 30, 2016, OPEC AGREED TO CAP PRODUCTION AT 32.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY STARTING IN JANUARY 2017.

THE WTI PRICE AVERAGED $43 PER BARREL FOR THE FULL-YEAR

2016

, COMPARED TO $49 IN

2015

. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY

2017

, THE WTI PRICE WAS $53 PER BARREL. WTI TRADED AT A DISCOUNT TO BRENT FOR MUCH OF 2016 DUE TO HIGH INVENTORIES AND EXCESS CRUDE SUPPLY IN THE U.S. MARKET.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A DIFFERENTIAL IN CRUDE OIL PRICES EXISTS BETWEEN HIGH-QUALITY (HIGH-GRAVITY, LOW-SULFUR) CRUDES AND THOSE OF LOWER QUALITY (LOW-GRAVITY, HIGH-SULFUR). THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL IN ANY PERIOD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATIVE SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES FOR EACH CRUDE TYPE, WHICH ARE FUNCTIONS OF THE CAPACITY OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PROCESS EACH AS FEEDSTOCK INTO HIGH-VALUE LIGHT PRODUCTS (MOTOR GASOLINE, JET FUEL, AVIATION GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL). IN SECOND-HALF 2016, THE DIFFERENTIAL HELD GENERALLY STEADY IN NORTH AMERICA AS ROBUST REFINERY DEMAND SUPPORTED HEAVY CRUDE VALUES, WHILE LIGHT SWEET CRUDE PRICES IN THE U.S. WERE SUPPORTED BY SLOWING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION. OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, DIFFERENTIALS WERE STEADY TO SLIGHTLY WIDER AMID WELL-SUPPLIED LIGHT SWEET CRUDE MARKETS IN THE ATLANTIC BASIN, WHILE CONTINUED ROBUST MIDDLE EAST EXPORTS AND RISING IRANIAN PRODUCTION KEPT PRESSURE ON HEAVIER, MORE SOUR CRUDES. DIFFERENTIALS WIDENED IN DECEMBER AS LIGHT SWEET CRUDE VALUES BENEFITED MORE FROM THE ANNOUNCED OPEC DEAL.

CHEVRON PRODUCES OR SHARES IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN CALIFORNIA, INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, VENEZUELA AND IN CERTAIN FIELDS IN ANGOLA, CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM SECTOR OF THE NORTH SEA. (SEE PAGE

FS-12

FOR THE COMPANY’S AVERAGE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS.)

IN CONTRAST TO PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL GAS IN MANY REGIONAL MARKETS ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS IN THOSE MARKETS. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER DEMAND RELATIVE TO THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND STORED IN NORTH AMERICA. IN THE UNITED STATES, PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED $2.46 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET (MCF) DURING

2016

, COMPARED WITH $2.62 DURING

2015

. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY

2017

, THE HENRY HUB SPOT PRICE WAS $2.86 PER MCF.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL GAS DEPEND ON A WIDE RANGE OF SUPPLY, DEMAND AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES. CHEVRON SELLS NATURAL GAS INTO THE DOMESTIC PIPELINE MARKET IN MOST LOCATIONS. IN SOME LOCATIONS, CHEVRON CONTINUES TO INVEST IN LONG-TERM PROJECTS TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER TO OTHER MARKETS. THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM CONTRACT PRICES FOR LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) ARE TYPICALLY LINKED TO CRUDE OIL PRICES. MOST OF THE EQUITY LNG OFFTAKE FROM THE OPERATED AUSTRALIAN LNG PROJECTS IS COMMITTED UNDER BINDING LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, WITH THE REMAINDER TO BE SOLD IN THE ASIAN SPOT LNG MARKET.  THE ASIAN SPOT MARKET REFLECTS THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LNG IN THE PACIFIC BASIN AND IS NOT DIRECTLY LINKED TO CRUDE OIL PRICES. INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS AVERAGED $4.02 PER MCF DURING

2016

, COMPARED WITH $4.53 PER MCF DURING

2015

. (SEE PAGE

FS-12

FOR THE COMPANY’S AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.)

THE COMPANY’S WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN

2016

AVERAGED

2.594 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY. ABOUT ONE-SIXTH OF THE COMPANY’S NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN

2016

OCCURRED IN THE OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA. OPEC QUOTAS HAD NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S NET CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION IN

2016

OR

2015.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN

2017

WILL GROW 4 TO 9 PERCENT COMPARED TO 2016, ASSUMING A BRENT CRUDE OIL PRICE OF $50 PER BARREL AND BEFORE THE EFFECT OF ANTICIPATED ASSET SALES.  THE IMPACT OF 2017 ASSET SALES ON FULL-YEAR PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF 50,000 TO 100,000 BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY, DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF THE CLOSE OF INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE DURATION OF THE LOW PRICE ENVIRONMENT THAT BEGAN IN SECOND-HALF 2014; QUOTAS OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC; PRICE EFFECTS ON ENTITLEMENT VOLUMES; CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS; DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION, START-UP OR RAMP-UP OF PROJECTS; FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN VARIOUS MARKETS; WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY SHUT IN PRODUCTION; CIVIL UNREST; CHANGING GEOPOLITICS; DELAYS IN COMPLETION OF MAINTENANCE TURNAROUNDS; GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED DECLINES IN PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS; OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW, LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM PROJECTS GENERALLY BEGIN WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF CHEVRON’S UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IS MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, PRODUCTION WAS SHUT-IN BEGINNING IN MAY 2015 AS A RESULT OF DIFFICULTIES IN SECURING WORK AND EQUIPMENT PERMITS. NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE IN 2014 WAS 81,000 BARRELS PER DAY. DURING 2015, NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AVERAGED 28,000 BARRELS PER DAY. AS OF EARLY 2017, PRODUCTION REMAINS SHUT IN AND THE EXACT TIMING OF A PRODUCTION RESTART IS UNCERTAIN AND DEPENDENT ON DISPUTE RESOLUTION BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. THE FINANCIAL EFFECTS FROM THE LOSS OF PRODUCTION IN 2016 WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT IN 2017.

DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO MARGINS ON THE REFINING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE GASOLINE, DIESEL, JET FUEL, LUBRICANTS, FUEL OIL, FUEL AND LUBRICANT ADDITIVES, AND PETROCHEMICALS. INDUSTRY MARGINS ARE SOMETIMES VOLATILE AND CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND BALANCE FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL, OTHER REFINERY AND PETROCHEMICAL FEEDSTOCKS, AND NATURAL GAS. INDUSTRY MARGINS CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY INVENTORY LEVELS, GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES, REFINERY OR CHEMICAL PLANT CAPACITY UTILIZATION, MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS, AND DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES OR CHEMICAL PLANTS RESULTING FROM UNPLANNED OUTAGES DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER, FIRES OR OTHER OPERATIONAL EVENTS.

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY FOR DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANY’S REFINING, MARKETING AND PETROCHEMICAL ASSETS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT SUPPLY FUNCTIONS, AND THE VOLATILITY OF TANKER-CHARTER RATES FOR THE COMPANY’S SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRY’S DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANY’S CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE COMPANY’S REFINING, MARKETING AND PETROCHEMICAL ASSETS.

THE COMPANY’S MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE U.S. GULF COAST, ASIA AND SOUTHERN AFRICA. CHEVRON OPERATES OR HAS SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REFINERIES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS.

THE DECLINE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN 2016 OF $1.86 BILLION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DECLINE IN TOTAL INCOME BEFORE-TAX FOR THE COMPANY OF $7.00 BILLION.  U.S. LOSSES BEFORE TAX INCREASED FROM A LOSS OF $2.88 BILLION IN 2015 TO A LOSS OF $4.32 BILLION IN 2016. THIS $1.44 BILLION INCREASE IN LOSSES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF LOWER CRUDE OIL PRICES. THE INCREASE IN LOSSES HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S U.S. INCOME TAX BENEFIT, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE OF $624 MILLION BETWEEN YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERIODS, FROM A TAX BENEFIT OF $1.69 BILLION IN 2015 TO A TAX BENEFIT OF $2.32 BILLION IN 2016.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

SOURCES AND USES OF CASH

THE LOWER CRUDE OIL PRICE ENVIRONMENT THAT BEGAN IN SECOND-HALF 2014 AND CONTINUED THROUGH 2016 SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY RESPONDED WITH REDUCTIONS IN CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, REDUCTIONS IN ITS COST STRUCTURE, AND INCREASED ASSET SALES. PROGRESS ON THESE ACTIONS DURING 2016 INCLUDED.

•

REDUCING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO $18.1 BILLION, A 39 PERCENT DECREASE COMPARED TO 2015,

•

REDUCING OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES BY $2.5 BILLION, A 9 PERCENT DECREASE COMPARED TO 2015, AND

•

REALIZING NET PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES OF $2.8 BILLION DURING 2016, WITH ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN 2017.

THE STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY’S BALANCE SHEET ENABLED IT TO MEET THE REMAINING CASH OUTFLOWS THROUGH ADDITIONAL BORROWING.

2016

, SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CHEVRON HAS AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT EXPIRES IN AUGUST 2018 FOR AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY.

THE MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S DEBT, AND THE COMPANY’S COST OF BORROWING CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE DEPENDING ON THESE DEBT RATINGS. THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING PUBLIC BONDS ISSUED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION AND TEXACO CAPITAL INC. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE THE OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ARE RATED AA- BY STANDARD AND POOR’S CORPORATION AND AA2 BY MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANY’S U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POOR’S AND P-1 BY MOODY’S. ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY, INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY’S FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE CAPITAL PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. BASED ON ITS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS. DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY CHEMICALS, THE COMPANY CAN ALSO MODIFY CAPITAL SPENDING PLANS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE PAYING THE COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND ALSO REMAIN COMMITTED TO RETAINING THE COMPANY’S HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK

THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS DISCUSSED BELOW. THE ESTIMATES OF FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK DO NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANY’S PROJECTION OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING “RISK FACTORS” IN PART I, ITEM 1A, OF THE COMPANY’S

2016

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS. THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY REFINERIES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN

2016.

THE COMPANY’S MARKET EXPOSURE POSITIONS ARE MONITORED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN INTERNAL RISK CONTROL GROUP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY’S RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES. THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES ARE REVIEWED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PUBLISHED MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CHEVRON’S DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IN

2016

WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY USES THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION METHOD AS ITS VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, AT THE 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL WITH A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD, FROM THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS ON DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS HELD OR ISSUED. BASED ON THESE INPUTS, THE VAR FOR THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY RISK EXPOSURES IN THE AREA OF DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER 31,

2016

AND

2015

WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. THERE WERE NO OPEN FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31,

2016.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. INTEREST RATE SWAPS, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT YEAR-END

2016

, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS AND LONG-TERM PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. REFER TO “OTHER INFORMATION” ON PAGE

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND MARKET-BASED PROGRAMS. THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. FOR EXAMPLE, INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS (E.G., THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL) AND NATIONAL (E.G., CARBON TAX, CAP-AND-TRADE, OR EFFICIENCY STANDARDS), REGIONAL, AND STATE LEGISLATION (E.G., CALIFORNIA'S AB32 AND SB32; OTHER LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS) AND REGULATORY MEASURES (E.G., THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S METHANE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS) THAT AIM TO LIMIT OR REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION. CONSIDERATION OF GHG ISSUES AND THE RESPONSES TO THOSE ISSUES THROUGH INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL, REGIONAL OR STATE LEGISLATION OR REGULATION ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE COMPANY’S STRATEGY, PLANNING AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT REVIEWS, WHERE APPLICABLE. THEY ARE ALSO FACTORED INTO THE COMPANY’S LONG-RANGE SUPPLY, DEMAND AND ENERGY PRICE FORECASTS. THESE FORECASTS REFLECT LONG-RANGE EFFECTS FROM RENEWABLE FUEL PENETRATION, ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, CLIMATE-RELATED POLICY ACTIONS, AND DEMAND RESPONSE TO OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. IN ADDITION, LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS INTENDED TO ADDRESS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING ALSO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AT THE INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL AND STATE LEVELS. REFER TO “RISK FACTORS” IN PART I, ITEM 1A, ON PAGES

20 THROUGH 22

FOR A DISCUSSION OF SOME OF THE INHERENT RISKS OF INCREASINGLY RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATION THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MOST OF THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY OR FACILITIES OR THE AMOUNTS OF INCREASED OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE TO: PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; REMEDIATE AND RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY PRIOR RELEASES OF NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE, OR OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; OR COMPLY WITH NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT PRESENTLY EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY OWNED FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT NON-CHEVRON SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN

2016

AT APPROXIMATELY

$2.1 BILLION

FOR ITS CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY

$0.5 BILLION

OF ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND

$1.6 BILLION

OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION, CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED SITES, AND THE ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR

2017

, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT

$0.4 BILLION

. THESE CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER DIFFERENT REPORTING PERIODS. SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

FS-

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF “CRITICAL” ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING TO THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE; AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED “CRITICAL,” AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED “CRITICAL” ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PRODUCTION THAT IMPACT CERTAIN ASSET AND EXPENSE ACCOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS THAT GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE IN THE FUTURE UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED VOLUMES. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES REPRESENT VOLUMES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE VOLUMES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED PROVED ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION. VARIABLES IMPACTING CHEVRON'S ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES INCLUDE FIELD PERFORMANCE, AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY, COMMODITY PRICES, AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS.

THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED AND TO THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ASSETS. IMPACTS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON CHEVRON'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, USING THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

1.

AMORTIZATION - CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION (UOP) BASIS USING PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES. ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED ON A UOP BASIS USING TOTAL PROVED RESERVES. DURING

2016

, CHEVRON'S UOP DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION (DD&A) FOR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES WAS

$13.3 BILLION

, AND PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES AT THE BEGINNING OF

2016

WERE

5.4 BILLION

BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. IF THE ESTIMATES OF PROVED RESERVES USED IN THE UOP CALCULATIONS FOR CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS HAD BEEN LOWER BY 5 PERCENT ACROSS ALL OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, UOP DD&A IN

2016

WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

$700 MILLION.

2.

IMPAIRMENT - OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE USED IN ASSESSING OIL AND GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES FOR IMPAIRMENT. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATED RESERVES OF A PROPERTY WOULD TRIGGER AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW. PROVED RESERVES (AND, IN SOME CASES, A PORTION OF UNPROVED RESOURCES) ARE USED TO ESTIMATE FUTURE PRODUCTION VOLUMES IN THE CASH FLOW MODEL. FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS, SEE

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

BELOW.

REFER TO TABLE V, “RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION,” BEGINNING ON PAGE

FOR ESTIMATES OF PROVED RESERVE VALUES FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2016.

THIS OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT SECTION OF NOTE 1, BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-30

, WHICH INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE “SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS” METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY ASSESSES ITS PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL MARKET SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS. REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION OF IMPAIRMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN

NOTE 1

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS WHEN TRIGGERING EVENTS ARISE TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD OR CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET REMAINS RECOVERABLE. SIMILARLY, A SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE COMPANY'S CRUDE OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRICE OUTLOOK WOULD TRIGGER IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS FOR IMPACTED UPSTREAM ASSETS. IN ADDITION, IMPAIRMENTS COULD OCCUR DUE TO CHANGES IN NATIONAL, STATE OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR LAWS, INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO STOP OR IMPEDE THE DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A DECISION IS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS. THAT IS, THE ASSETS WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, LESS COSTS TO SELL, ARE LESS THAN THE ASSETS’ ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE. WHEN THIS OCCURS, A DETERMINATION MUST BE MADE AS TO WHETHER THIS LOSS IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, IN WHICH CASE THE INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS POTENTIALLY AFFECTING WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT, A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS NOT PRACTICABLE.

THE COMPANY REPORTED IMPAIRMENTS FOR CERTAIN OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES DURING 2016 DUE TO RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND LOWER CRUDE OIL PRICES. THE COMPANY REPORTED IMPAIRMENTS FOR CERTAIN OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES DURING 2015 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD REVISIONS IN THE COMPANY'S LONGER-TERM CRUDE OIL PRICE OUTLOOK. THE IMPAIRMENTS FOR THE YEARS 2016 AND 2015 WERE PRIMARILY IN

BRAZIL AND THE UNITED STATES. NO MATERIAL INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E OR INVESTMENTS WERE RECORDED FOR THE YEAR 2014. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANY’S PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS, WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED, OR RESULTED IN LARGER IMPACTS ON IMPAIRED ASSETS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO), THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING SUCH FACTORS AS THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION, ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF SETTLEMENTS, DISCOUNT AND INFLATION RATES, AND THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE ARO IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR

2016

IS NOT PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANY'S LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE REDUCED ESTIMATED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS, THEREBY LOWERING ACCRETION EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION COSTS, WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT.

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS. CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING EXPENSE AND OBLIGATIONS FOR OPEB PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES. INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S PROCESSES TO DEVELOP THESE ASSUMPTIONS IS INCLUDED ON PAGE

UNDER THE RELEVANT HEADINGS. ACTUAL RATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS.

FOR

7.25

PERCENT AND A DISCOUNT RATE FOR SERVICE COSTS OF

4.4

PERCENT AND A DISCOUNT RATE FOR INTEREST COST OF

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR

2016

WAS

$1.2 BILLION

. AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THIS ASSUMPTION FOR THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 67 PERCENT OF COMPANYWIDE PENSION EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR

2016

BY APPROXIMATELY $86 MILLION. A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THIS SAME PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED PENSION EXPENSE FOR

2016

BY APPROXIMATELY $297 MILLION.

THE AGGREGATE FUNDED STATUS RECOGNIZED AT DECEMBER 31,

2016

, WAS A NET LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY

$4.7 BILLION

. AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION OBLIGATION, THUS CHANGING THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN. AT DECEMBER 31,

2016

, THE COMPANY USED A DISCOUNT RATE OF

3.9

PERCENT TO MEASURE THE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION, A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 62 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $390 MILLION, AND WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE PLAN’S UNDERFUNDED STATUS FROM APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION TO $1.6 BILLION.

FOR THE COMPANY’S OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR

2016

WAS

$221 MILLION

, AND THE TOTAL LIABILITY, ALL UNFUNDED AT THE END OF

2016

, WAS

$2.5 BILLION

. FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN, THE COMPANY USED A DISCOUNT RATE FOR SERVICE COST OF 4.9 PERCENT AND A DISCOUNT RATE FOR INTEREST COST OF 3.6 PERCENT TO MEASURE EXPENSE IN

2016

, AND A 4.1 PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE TO MEASURE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31,

2016

. DISCOUNT RATE CHANGES, SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN THE PENSION SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, RESULTED IN AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON

2016

OF BEFORE-TAX ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2017

. IN ADDITION, INFORMATION RELATED TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS INCLUDED ON PAGE

IN

NOTE 2

UNDER THE HEADING “CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS.”

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FOR SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION, THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS GENERALLY RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY REPORTS THESE LOSSES AS “OPERATING EXPENSES” OR “SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS HANDLING IS FOR INCOME TAX MATTERS, FOR WHICH BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE TAX POSITION IS “MORE LIKELY THAN NOT” (I.E., LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES, REFER TO

NOTE 2

BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-61

. REFER ALSO TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS SECTION FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2016.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT MUST BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, AND ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT CLASSIFIES DEFERRED INCOME TAXES IN THE BALANCE SHEET.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN

50

PERCENT-OWNED AND ANY VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURES AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO 50 PERCENT, OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY DECISIONS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN CHANGES IN THE COMPANY’S PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATE’S EQUITY CURRENTLY IN INCOME.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEE’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANY’S ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENT’S MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANY’S ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY’S SHARE OF THE AFFILIATE’S REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATE’S HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE COMPANY USES TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY ARE AS FOLLOWS. LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY’S ACTIVITY IN DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY, GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANY’S COMMODITY TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S FIXED-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. WHERE CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, FAIR VALUE RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE GENERALLY OFFSET ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE IN HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANY’S CASH MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS “CASH EQUIVALENTS.” BANK TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN

90

DAYS ARE REPORTED AS “TIME DEPOSITS.” THE BALANCE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS “MARKETABLE SECURITIES” AND IS MARKED-TO-MARKET, WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN “OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.”

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST, USING A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET. “MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND OTHER” INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED PENDING

FS-

-30

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE CAPITALIZED FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT HAVE FOUND CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED WHEN THE DRILLING IS COMPLETED, PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. ALL OTHER EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO

NOTE 2

2

, BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-54, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED UNDISCOUNTED, FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET (INCLUDING CHANGES TO THE COMMODITY PRICE FORECAST), SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES, GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED, FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION, PSC, DEVELOPMENT AREA OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN DOWNSTREAM, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON THE BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A MARKETING/LUBRICANTS AREA OR DISTRIBUTION AREA, AS APPROPRIATE. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL “DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION” EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE LOWER VALUE. REFER TO

NOTE

10

, BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-37

, RELATING TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER ALSO TO

NOTE 2

6

, ON PAGE

FS-62

, RELATING TO AROS.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, GENERALLY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD, AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IS GENERALLY USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES, AND FROM SALES AS “OTHER INCOME.”

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE (INCLUDING THOSE FOR PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS), REPAIRS AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

EFFECTIVE IN THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO MOVE THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE GOODWILL BALANCE FROM THE THIRD TO FOURTH QUARTER TO BETTER ALIGN WITH THE PREPARATION AND REVIEW OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS PLAN, WHICH IS USED IN THE TEST. THE CHANGE DOES NOT DELAY, ACCELERATE OR AVOID AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS OR TO CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND MINERAL-PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS. REFER TO

NOTE 2

6

, ON PAGE

FS-62

, FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S AROS.

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY FOR ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS, AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE

FS-

-31

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES. THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE COMPANY’S BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE COMPANY’S OWN INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN “CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM AND CHEMICALS PRODUCTS, AND ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, NET OF ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FROM PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED USING THE ENTITLEMENT METHOD. EXCISE, VALUE-ADDED AND SIMILAR TAXES ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY ON A REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTION BETWEEN A SELLER AND A CUSTOMER ARE PRESENTED ON A GROSS BASIS. THE ASSOCIATED AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN AS A FOOTNOTE TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, ON PAGE

FS-25

. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER (INCLUDING BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS) ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED ON A NET BASIS AND REPORTED IN “PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ISSUES STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. FOR EQUITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS, TOTAL COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE, AND FOR LIABILITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, TOTAL COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON THE SETTLEMENT VALUE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL AWARDS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO EARN THE AWARD, WHICH IS THE SHORTER OF THE VESTING PERIOD OR THE TIME PERIOD AN EMPLOYEE BECOMES ELIGIBLE TO RETAIN THE AWARD AT RETIREMENT. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE GRADED VESTING PROVISIONS BY WHICH ONE-THIRD OF EACH AWARD VESTS IN THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING IN 2017, STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE GRADED VESTING BY WHICH ONE THIRD OF EACH AWARD VESTS ANNUALLY ON EACH JANUARY 31 ON OR AFTER THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. STANDARD RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS HAVE CLIFF VESTING BY WHICH THE TOTAL AWARD WILL VEST ON JANUARY 31 ON OR AFTER THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. THE COMPANY AMORTIZES THESE AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

IN JULY 2015, THE FASB APPROVED A ONE-YEAR DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASU 2014-09, WHICH BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY JANUARY 1, 2018. THE STANDARD PROVIDES A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE REVENUE RECOGNITION MODEL FOR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, ELIMINATES MOST INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO ADOPT THE STANDARD USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. "SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME INCLUDES EXCISE, VALUE-ADDED AND SIMILAR TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS. UPON ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD, REVENUE WILL EXCLUDE SALES-BASED TAXES COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES, WHICH WILL HAVE NO IMPACT TO EARNINGS. THE COMPANY'S IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DISCLOSURE UPDATES AND SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS NECESSARY TO MEET THE STANDARD'S REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTEREST - IMPUTATION OF INTEREST (TOPIC 835): SIMPLIFYING THE PRESENTATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, CHEVRON ADOPTED ASU 2015-03 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY BE PRESENTED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS A DIRECT DEDUCTION FROM THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THAT DEBT LIABILITY. THE EFFECTS OF RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION ON THE DECEMBER 31, 2015, CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WERE REDUCTIONS OF

$43

IN "DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS,"

$1

IN "SHORT-TERM DEBT" AND

$42

IN "LONG-TERM DEBT."

LEASES (TOPIC 842)

IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02 WHICH BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY JANUARY 1, 2019. THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT LESSEES PRESENT RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF THE STANDARD ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMPENSATION-STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING

IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-09 WHICH THE COMPANY ELECTED TO EARLY-ADOPT RETROSPECTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2016. THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AND TAX DEFICIENCIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE INCOME STATEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE BENEFIT REDUCES TAXES PAYABLE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, EXCESS TAX

BENEFITS ARE TO BE CLASSIFIED ALONG WITH OTHER INCOME TAX CASH FLOWS AS AN OPERATING ACTIVITY IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THE EFFECT OF THE EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326)

IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13, WHICH BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2020. THE STANDARD REQUIRES COMPANIES TO USE FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION TO CALCULATE CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES.  THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF THE STANDARD ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTANGIBLES - GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350)

IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04. THE STANDARD SIMPLIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, AND THE COMPANY HAS CHOSEN TO EARLY ADOPT BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2017. EARLY ADOPTION HAS NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SWAP CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES IN THE “OVER-THE-COUNTER” MARKETS, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANY’S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. COMPANY INVESTMENT POLICIES LIMIT THE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. SIMILAR POLICIES ON DIVERSIFICATION AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANY’S COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANY’S DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE DISPERSED AMONG THE COMPANY’S BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, ALTERNATIVE RISK MITIGATION MEASURES MAY BE DEPLOYED, INCLUDING REQUIRING PRE-PAYMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT OR OTHER ACCEPTABLE COLLATERAL INSTRUMENTS TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

TWO

BUSINESS SEGMENTS, UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM, REPRESENTING THE COMPANY’S “REPORTABLE SEGMENTS” AND “OPERATING SEGMENTS.” UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND REGASIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG); TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL EXPORT PIPELINES; PROCESSING, TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS; AND A GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PLANT. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REFINING OF CRUDE OIL INTO PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR; AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT ADDITIVES. ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE WORLDWIDE CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT FINANCING ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES, AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

THE COMPANY’S SEGMENTS ARE MANAGED BY “SEGMENT MANAGERS” WHO REPORT TO THE “CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER” (CODM). THE SEGMENTS REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY THAT ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES (A) FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM, WHICH MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS AND ASSESSES THEIR PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT EARNINGS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF DEBT FINANCING INTEREST EXPENSE OR INVESTMENT INTEREST INCOME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE COMPANY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ASSETS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE BILLED FOR THE DIRECT USE OF CORPORATE SERVICES. NONBILLABLE COSTS REMAIN AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL IN “ALL OTHER.” EARNINGS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA ARE PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

DESCRIPTIONS OF MAJOR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATES, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

TENGIZCHEVROIL

CHEVRON HAS A

50 PERCENT

EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO), WHICH OPERATES THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV CRUDE OIL FIELDS IN KAZAKHSTAN. AT DECEMBER 31,

2016

, THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN TCO WAS ABOUT

$140

HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN TCO’S NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE RESULTS FROM CHEVRON ACQUIRING A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN TCO AT A VALUE GREATER THAN THE UNDERLYING BOOK VALUE FOR THAT PORTION OF TCO’S NET ASSETS. IN JULY 2016, THE COMPANY MADE A

$2,000

LONG-TERM LOAN TO TCO TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUTURE GROWTH AND WELLHEAD PRESSURE MANAGEMENT PROJECT. SEE

30 PERCENT

INTEREST IN PETROPIAR, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY WHICH OPERATES THE HAMACA HEAVY-OIL PRODUCTION AND UPGRADING PROJECT IN VENEZUELA’S ORINOCO BELT. AT DECEMBER 31,

2016

, THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN PETROPIAR WAS APPROXIMATELY

$150

LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROPIAR’S NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF CHEVRON’S UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROPIAR’S NET ASSETS OVER THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE VENTURE.

15 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM, A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY, WHICH PROVIDES THE CRITICAL EXPORT ROUTE FOR CRUDE OIL FROM BOTH TCO AND KARACHAGANAK. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES TOTALING

$1,245

, WHICH INCLUDES LONG-TERM LOANS OF

$921

AT YEAR-END

2016

. THE LOANS WERE PROVIDED TO FUND

30 PERCENT

OF THE INITIAL PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION. THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE CONSORTIUM BECAUSE IT DOES NOT DIRECT ACTIVITIES OF THE CONSORTIUM AND ONLY RECEIVES ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE FINANCIAL RETURNS.

PETROBOSCAN

CHEVRON HAS A

39.2 PERCENT

INTEREST IN PETROBOSCAN, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY WHICH OPERATES THE BOSCAN FIELD IN VENEZUELA. AT DECEMBER 31,

2016

, THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN PETROBOSCAN WAS APPROXIMATELY

$120

HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCAN’S NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REFLECTS THE EXCESS OF THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY CHEVRON OVER ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCAN’S NET ASSETS. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS AN OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM LOAN TO PETROBOSCAN OF

$626

AT YEAR-END 2016.

BACKGROUND

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT INITIATED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO, ECUADOR, IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO INC., WAS A MINORITY MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, AS THE MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO TEXPET’S OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A

THREE

-YEAR REMEDIATION PROGRAM AT A COST OF

$40

. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR AND BY THE PERTINENT PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT TEXPET’S REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADOR’S FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND PETROECUADOR’S FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE OPERATIONS.

LAGO AGRIO JUDGMENT

IN 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING THAT THE COURT ASSESS

$18,900

, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PETROECUADOR. THE ENGINEER’S REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL

$8,400

COULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. IN 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY CHEVRON OF EVIDENCE THAT THE JUDGE PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN WHICH BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY OUTCOME, THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE CASE WAS RECUSED. IN 2010, CHEVRON MOVED TO STRIKE THE MINING ENGINEER’S REPORT AND TO DISMISS THE CASE BASED ON EVIDENCE OBTAINED THROUGH DISCOVERY IN THE UNITED STATES INDICATING THAT THE REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CONSULTANTS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS BEFORE BEING PRESENTED AS THE MINING ENGINEER’S INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL WORK AND SHOWING FURTHER EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT. IN AUGUST 2010, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER STATING THAT HE WAS NOT BOUND BY THE MINING ENGINEER’S REPORT AND REQUIRING THE PARTIES TO PROVIDE THEIR POSITIONS ON DAMAGES WITHIN

45 DAYS

. CHEVRON SUBSEQUENTLY PETITIONED FOR RECUSAL OF THE JUDGE, CLAIMING THAT HE HAD DISREGARDED EVIDENCE OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT AND THAT HE HAD FAILED TO RULE ON A NUMBER OF MOTIONS WITHIN THE STATUTORY TIME REQUIREMENT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2010, CHEVRON SUBMITTED ITS POSITION ON DAMAGES, ASSERTING THAT NO AMOUNT SHOULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST IT. THE PLAINTIFFS’ SUBMISSION, WHICH RELIED IN PART ON THE MINING ENGINEER’S REPORT, TOOK THE POSITION THAT DAMAGES ARE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY

$16,000

AND

$76,000

AND THAT UNJUST ENRICHMENT SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN AN AMOUNT BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY

$5,000

AND

$38,000

. THE NEXT DAY, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT. CHEVRON PETITIONED TO HAVE THAT ORDER DECLARED A NULLITY IN LIGHT OF CHEVRON’S PRIOR RECUSAL PETITION, AND BECAUSE PROCEDURAL AND EVIDENTIARY MATTERS REMAINED UNRESOLVED. IN OCTOBER 2010, CHEVRON’S MOTION TO RECUSE THE JUDGE WAS GRANTED. A NEW JUDGE TOOK CHARGE OF THE CASE AND REVOKED THE PRIOR JUDGE’S ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE. ON DECEMBER 17, 2010, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT.

ON FEBRUARY 14, 2011, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO RENDERED AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IN THE CASE. THE COURT REJECTED CHEVRON’S DEFENSES TO THE EXTENT THE COURT ADDRESSED THEM IN ITS OPINION. THE JUDGMENT ASSESSED APPROXIMATELY

$8,600

IN DAMAGES AND APPROXIMATELY

$900

AS AN AWARD FOR THE PLAINTIFFS’ REPRESENTATIVES. IT ALSO ASSESSED AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY

$8,600

IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNLESS THE COMPANY ISSUED A PUBLIC APOLOGY WITHIN

15 DAYS

OF THE JUDGMENT, WHICH CHEVRON DID NOT DO. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2011, THE PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE JUDGMENT, SEEKING INCREASED DAMAGES, AND ON MARCH 11, 2011, CHEVRON APPEALED THE JUDGMENT SEEKING TO HAVE THE JUDGMENT NULLIFIED. ON JANUARY 3, 2012, AN APPELLATE PANEL IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT AFFIRMED THE FEBRUARY 14, 2011 DECISION AND ORDERED THAT CHEVRON PAY ADDITIONAL ATTORNEYS’ FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF “

0.10%

OF THE VALUES THAT ARE DERIVED FROM THE DECISIONAL ACT OF THIS JUDGMENT.” THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION TO CLARIFY AND AMPLIFY THE APPELLATE DECISION ON JANUARY 6, 2012, AND THE COURT ISSUED A RULING IN RESPONSE ON JANUARY 13, 2012, PURPORTING TO CLARIFY AND AMPLIFY ITS JANUARY 3, 2012 RULING, WHICH INCLUDED CLARIFICATION THAT THE DEADLINE FOR THE COMPANY TO ISSUE A PUBLIC APOLOGY TO AVOID THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY

$8,600

IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES WAS WITHIN

15 DAYS

OF THE CLARIFICATION RULING, OR FEBRUARY 3, 2012. CHEVRON DID NOT ISSUE AN APOLOGY BECAUSE DOING SO MIGHT BE MISCHARACTERIZED AS AN ADMISSION OF LIABILITY AND WOULD BE CONTRARY TO FACTS AND EVIDENCE SUBMITTED AT TRIAL. ON JANUARY 20, 2012, CHEVRON APPEALED (CALLED A PETITION FOR CASSATION) THE APPELLATE PANEL’S DECISION TO ECUADOR’S NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE. AS PART OF THE APPEAL, CHEVRON REQUESTED THE SUSPENSION OF ANY REQUIREMENT THAT CHEVRON POST A BOND TO PREVENT ENFORCEMENT UNDER ECUADORIAN LAW OF THE JUDGMENT DURING THE CASSATION APPEAL. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2012, THE APPELLATE PANEL OF THE PROVINCIAL COURT ADMITTED CHEVRON’S CASSATION APPEAL IN A PROCEDURAL STEP NECESSARY FOR THE NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE TO HEAR THE APPEAL. THE PROVINCIAL COURT APPELLATE PANEL DENIED CHEVRON’S REQUEST FOR SUSPENSION OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT CHEVRON POST A BOND AND STATED THAT IT WOULD NOT COMPLY WITH THE FIRST AND SECOND INTERIM AWARDS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL DISCUSSED BELOW. ON MARCH 29, 2012, THE MATTER WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE PROVINCIAL COURT TO THE NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, AND ON NOVEMBER 22, 2012, THE NATIONAL COURT AGREED TO HEAR CHEVRON'S CASSATION APPEAL. ON AUGUST 3, 2012, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO APPROVED A COURT-APPOINTED LIQUIDATOR’S REPORT ON DAMAGES THAT CALCULATED THE TOTAL JUDGMENT IN THE CASE TO BE

$19,100

. ON NOVEMBER 13, 2013, THE NATIONAL COURT RATIFIED THE JUDGMENT BUT NULLIFIED THE

PUNITIVE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT, RESULTING IN A JUDGMENT OF

$9,500

. ON DECEMBER 23, 2013, CHEVRON APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE ECUADOR CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, ECUADOR'S HIGHEST COURT. THE REPORTING JUSTICE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THE APPEAL ON JULY 16, 2015.

ON JULY 2, 2013, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO ISSUED AN EMBARGO ORDER IN ECUADOR ORDERING THAT ANY FUNDS TO BE PAID BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR TO CHEVRON TO SATISFY A

$96

AWARD ISSUED IN AN UNRELATED ACTION BY AN ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL PRESIDING IN THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION IN THE HAGUE UNDER THE RULES OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW MUST BE PAID TO THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS. THE AWARD WAS ISSUED BY THE TRIBUNAL UNDER THE UNITED STATES-ECUADOR BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY IN AN ACTION FILED IN 2006 IN CONNECTION WITH

SEVEN

BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES THAT TEXPET FILED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR BETWEEN 1991 AND 1993. THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR HAS MOVED TO SET ASIDE THE TRIBUNAL'S AWARD. ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2014, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NETHERLANDS ISSUED AN OPINION DENYING ECUADOR’S SET ASIDE REQUEST. A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CONFIRMED THE TRIBUNAL'S AWARD, AND ON AUGUST 4, 2015, A PANEL OF THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2015, THE COURT OF APPEALS DENIED THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR'S REQUEST FOR FULL APPELLATE COURT REVIEW OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION. ON JUNE 6, 2016, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON JULY 22, 2016, THE GOVERNMENT OF ECUADOR PAID THE

LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS' ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

CHEVRON HAS NO ASSETS IN ECUADOR AND THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS HAVE STATED IN PRESS RELEASES AND THROUGH OTHER MEDIA THAT THEY WILL SEEK TO ENFORCE THE ECUADORIAN JUDGMENT IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND OTHERWISE DISRUPT CHEVRON'S OPERATIONS. ON MAY 30, 2012, THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS FILED AN ACTION AGAINST CHEVRON CORPORATION, CHEVRON CANADA LIMITED, AND CHEVRON CANADA FINANCE LIMITED IN THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE IN ONTARIO, CANADA, SEEKING TO RECOGNIZE AND ENFORCE THE ECUADORIAN JUDGMENT. ON MAY 1, 2013, THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE HELD THAT THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER CHEVRON AND CHEVRON CANADA LIMITED FOR PURPOSES OF THE ACTION, BUT STAYED THE ACTION DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE THAT CHEVRON CORPORATION HAS ASSETS IN ONTARIO. THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THAT DECISION AND ON DECEMBER 17, 2013, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR ONTARIO AFFIRMED THE LOWER COURT’S DECISION ON JURISDICTION AND SET ASIDE THE STAY, ALLOWING THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO BE HEARD IN THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE. CHEVRON APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA AND, ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2015, THE SUPREME COURT DISMISSED THE APPEAL AND AFFIRMED THAT THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE HAS JURISDICTION OVER CHEVRON AND CHEVRON CANADA LIMITED FOR PURPOSES OF THE ACTION. THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDING AND RELATED PRELIMINARY MOTIONS ARE PROCEEDING IN THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE. ON JANUARY 20, 2017, THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE GRANTED CHEVRON CANADA LIMITED’S AND CHEVRON CORPORATION’S MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, CONCLUDING THAT THE TWO COMPANIES ARE SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITIES WITH SEPARATE RIGHTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

AND OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE SUPERIOR COURT DISMISSED THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT CLAIM AGAINST CHEVRON CANADA LIMITED.  CHEVRON CORPORATION STILL REMAINS AS A DEFENDANT IN THE ACTION. ON FEBRUARY 3, 2017, THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE SUPERIOR COURT'S JANUARY 20, 2017 DECISION.

ON JUNE 27, 2012, THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST CHEVRON CORPORATION IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE IN BRASILIA, BRAZIL, SEEKING TO RECOGNIZE AND ENFORCE THE ECUADORIAN JUDGMENT. CHEVRON HAS ANSWERED THE COMPLAINT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH BRAZILIAN PROCEDURE, THE MATTER WAS REFERRED TO THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR FOR A NONBINDING OPINION OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE COMPLAINT. ON MAY 13, 2015, THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR ISSUED ITS NONBINDING OPINION AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE REJECT THE PLAINTIFFS' RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT REQUEST, FINDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE LAGO AGRIO JUDGMENT WAS PROCURED THROUGH FRAUD AND CORRUPTION AND CANNOT BE RECOGNIZED IN BRAZIL BECAUSE IT VIOLATES BRAZILIAN AND INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC ORDER.

ON OCTOBER 15, 2012, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO ISSUED AN EX PARTE EMBARGO ORDER THAT PURPORTS TO ORDER THE SEIZURE OF ASSETS BELONGING TO SEPARATE CHEVRON SUBSIDIARIES IN ECUADOR, ARGENTINA AND COLOMBIA. ON NOVEMBER 6, 2012, AT THE REQUEST OF THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS, A COURT IN ARGENTINA ISSUED A FREEZE ORDER AGAINST CHEVRON ARGENTINA S.R.L. AND ANOTHER CHEVRON SUBSIDIARY, INGENIERO NORBERTO PRIU, REQUIRING SHARES OF BOTH COMPANIES TO BE "EMBARGOED," REQUIRING THIRD PARTIES TO WITHHOLD

40 PERCENT

OF ANY PAYMENTS DUE TO CHEVRON ARGENTINA S.R.L. AND ORDERING BANKS TO WITHHOLD

40 PERCENT

OF THE FUNDS IN CHEVRON ARGENTINA S.R.L. BANK ACCOUNTS. ON DECEMBER 14, 2012, THE ARGENTINEAN COURT REJECTED A MOTION TO REVOKE THE FREEZE ORDER BUT MODIFIED IT BY ORDERING THAT THIRD PARTIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO WITHHOLD FUNDS BUT MUST REPORT THEIR PAYMENTS. THE COURT ALSO CLARIFIED THAT THE FREEZE ORDER RELATING TO BANK ACCOUNTS EXCLUDES TAXES. ON JANUARY 30, 2013, AN APPELLATE COURT UPHELD THE FREEZE ORDER, BUT ON JUNE 4, 2013 THE SUPREME COURT OF ARGENTINA REVOKED THE FREEZE ORDER IN ITS ENTIRETY. ON DECEMBER 12, 2013, THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS SERVED CHEVRON WITH NOTICE OF THEIR FILING OF AN ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDING IN THE NATIONAL COURT, FIRST INSTANCE, OF ARGENTINA. CHEVRON FILED ITS ANSWER ON FEBRUARY 27, 2014, TO WHICH THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS RESPONDED ON DECEMBER 29, 2015.

ON APRIL 19, 2016, THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR IN ARGENTINA ISSUED A NON-BINDING OPINION RECOMMENDING TO THE NATIONAL COURT, FIRST INSTANCE, OF ARGENTINA THAT IT REJECT THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS' REQUEST TO RECOGNIZE THE ECUADORIAN JUDGMENT IN ARGENTINA.

CHEVRON CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THE PROVINCIAL COURT’S JUDGMENT IS ILLEGITIMATE AND UNENFORCEABLE IN ECUADOR, THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE JUDGMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF FRAUD, AND CONTRARY TO THE LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. CHEVRON CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OR ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE APPEALS PROCESS IN ECUADOR OR ANY ENFORCEMENT ACTION. CHEVRON EXPECTS TO CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY IN THE ECUADORIAN COURTS AND TO CONTEST AND DEFEND ANY AND ALL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

COMPANY'S BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY ARBITRATION CLAIMS

CHEVRON AND TEXPET FILED AN ARBITRATION CLAIM IN SEPTEMBER 2009 AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR BEFORE AN ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL PRESIDING IN THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION IN THE HAGUE UNDER THE RULES OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW. THE CLAIM ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATES–ECUADOR BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT) AND BREACHES OF THE SETTLEMENT AND RELEASE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND TEXPET (DESCRIBED ABOVE), WHICH ARE INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS PROTECTED BY THE BIT. THROUGH THE ARBITRATION, CHEVRON AND TEXPET ARE SEEKING RELIEF AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR, INCLUDING A DECLARATION THAT ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF ECUADOR’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BIT. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2011, THE TRIBUNAL ISSUED AN ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES REQUIRING THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR TO TAKE ALL MEASURES AT ITS DISPOSAL TO SUSPEND OR CAUSE TO BE SUSPENDED THE ENFORCEMENT OR RECOGNITION WITHIN AND WITHOUT ECUADOR OF ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL. ON JANUARY 25, 2012, THE TRIBUNAL CONVERTED THE ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES INTO AN INTERIM AWARD. CHEVRON FILED A RENEWED APPLICATION FOR FURTHER INTERIM MEASURES ON JANUARY 4, 2012, AND THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR OPPOSED CHEVRON’S APPLICATION AND REQUESTED THAT THE EXISTING ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES BE VACATED ON JANUARY 9, 2012. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2012, THE TRIBUNAL ISSUED A SECOND INTERIM AWARD MANDATING THAT THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY (WHETHER BY ITS JUDICIAL, LEGISLATIVE OR EXECUTIVE BRANCHES) TO SUSPEND OR CAUSE TO BE SUSPENDED THE ENFORCEMENT AND RECOGNITION WITHIN AND WITHOUT ECUADOR OF THE JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON AND, IN PARTICULAR, TO PRECLUDE ANY CERTIFICATION BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR THAT WOULD CAUSE THE JUDGMENT TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST CHEVRON. ON FEBRUARY 27, 2012, THE TRIBUNAL ISSUED A THIRD INTERIM AWARD CONFIRMING ITS JURISDICTION TO HEAR CHEVRON'S ARBITRATION CLAIMS. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2013, THE TRIBUNAL ISSUED ITS FOURTH INTERIM AWARD IN WHICH IT DECLARED THAT THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR “HAS VIOLATED THE FIRST AND SECOND INTERIM AWARDS UNDER THE [BIT], THE UNCITRAL RULES AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IN REGARD TO THE FINALIZATION AND ENFORCEMENT SUBJECT TO EXECUTION OF THE LAGO AGRIO JUDGMENT WITHIN AND OUTSIDE ECUADOR, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) CANADA, BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA.” THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR SUBSEQUENTLY FILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE HAGUE A REQUEST TO SET ASIDE THE TRIBUNAL’S INTERIM AWARDS AND THE FIRST PARTIAL AWARD (DESCRIBED BELOW), AND ON JANUARY 20, 2016, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED THE REPUBLIC'S REQUEST.

ON APRIL 13, 2016, THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR APPEALED THE DECISION.

THE TRIBUNAL HAS DIVIDED THE MERITS PHASE OF THE PROCEEDING INTO THREE PHASES. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2013, THE TRIBUNAL ISSUED ITS FIRST PARTIAL AWARD FROM PHASE ONE, FINDING THAT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND TEXPET APPLIED TO TEXPET AND CHEVRON, RELEASED TEXPET AND CHEVRON FROM CLAIMS BASED ON "COLLECTIVE" OR "DIFFUSE" RIGHTS ARISING FROM TEXPET'S OPERATIONS IN THE FORMER CONCESSION AREA AND PRECLUDED THIRD PARTIES FROM ASSERTING COLLECTIVE/DIFFUSE RIGHTS ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS RELATING TO TEXPET'S OPERATIONS IN THE FORMER CONCESSION AREA BUT DID NOT PRECLUDE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL HARM. THE TRIBUNAL HELD A HEARING ON APRIL 29-30, 2014, TO ADDRESS REMAINING ISSUES RELATING TO PHASE ONE, AND ON MARCH 12, 2015, IT ISSUED A NONBINDING DECISION THAT THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS' COMPLAINT, ON ITS FACE, INCLUDES CLAIMS NOT BARRED BY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND TEXPET. IN THE SAME DECISION, THE TRIBUNAL DEFERRED TO PHASE TWO REMAINING ISSUES FROM PHASE ONE, INCLUDING WHETHER THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR BREACHED THE 1995 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE REMEDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CHEVRON AND TEXPET AS A RESULT OF THAT BREACH. PHASE TWO ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED AT A HEARING HELD IN APRIL AND MAY 2015. THE TRIBUNAL HAS NOT SET A DATE FOR PHASE THREE, THE DAMAGES PHASE OF THE ARBITRATION.

COMPANY'S RICO ACTION

THROUGH A SERIES OF U.S. COURT PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY CHEVRON TO OBTAIN DISCOVERY RELATING TO THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION AND THE BIT ARBITRATION, CHEVRON OBTAINED EVIDENCE THAT IT BELIEVES SHOWS A PATTERN OF FRAUD, COLLUSION, CORRUPTION, AND OTHER MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF SEVERAL LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND OTHERS ACTING FOR THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS. IN FEBRUARY 2011, CHEVRON FILED A CIVIL LAWSUIT IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGAINST THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND SEVERAL OF THEIR LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND SUPPORTERS, ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT AND OTHER STATE LAWS. THROUGH THE CIVIL LAWSUIT, CHEVRON IS SEEKING RELIEF THAT INCLUDES A DECLARATION THAT ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION IS THE RESULT OF FRAUD AND OTHER UNLAWFUL CONDUCT AND IS THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE. ON MARCH 7, 2011, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND PERSONS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THEM FROM TAKING ANY ACTION IN FURTHERANCE OF RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE PENDING RESOLUTION OF CHEVRON’S CIVIL LAWSUIT BY THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT. ON MAY 31, 2011, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT SEVERED CLAIMS

ONE THROUGH EIGHT

OF CHEVRON’S COMPLAINT FROM THE

NINTH

CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND IMPOSED A DISCOVERY STAY ON CLAIMS ONE THROUGH EIGHT PENDING A TRIAL ON THE NINTH CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2011, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT VACATED THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, STAYED THE TRIAL ON CHEVRON’S NINTH CLAIM, A CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2011, AND DENIED THE DEFENDANTS’ MANDAMUS PETITION TO RECUSE THE JUDGE HEARING THE LAWSUIT. THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED ITS OPINION ON JANUARY 26, 2012 ORDERING THE DISMISSAL OF CHEVRON’S NINTH CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2012, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT LIFTED THE STAY ON CLAIMS ONE THROUGH EIGHT, AND ON OCTOBER 18, 2012, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT SET A TRIAL DATE OF OCTOBER 15, 2013. ON MARCH 22, 2013, CHEVRON SETTLED ITS CLAIMS AGAINST STRATUS CONSULTING, AND ON APRIL 12, 2013 SWORN DECLARATIONS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF STRATUS CONSULTING WERE FILED WITH THE COURT ADMITTING THEIR ROLE AND THAT OF THE PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEYS IN DRAFTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT OF THE MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO. ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2013, THE SECOND CIRCUIT DENIED THE DEFENDANTS' PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS TO RECUSE THE JUDGE HEARING THE CASE AND TO COLLATERALLY ESTOP CHEVRON FROM SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT THE LAGO AGRIO JUDGMENT WAS OBTAINED THROUGH FRAUD AND OTHER UNLAWFUL CONDUCT.

THE TRIAL COMMENCED ON OCTOBER 15, 2013 AND CONCLUDED ON NOVEMBER 22, 2013. ON MARCH 4, 2014, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF CHEVRON, PROHIBITING THE DEFENDANTS FROM SEEKING TO ENFORCE THE LAGO AGRIO JUDGMENT IN THE UNITED STATES AND FURTHER PROHIBITING THEM FROM PROFITING FROM THEIR ILLEGAL ACTS. THE DEFENDANTS APPEALED THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION, AND, ON APRIL 20, 2015, A PANEL OF THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS.

ON AUGUST 8, 2016, THE SECOND CIRCUIT ISSUED A UNANIMOUS OPINION AFFIRMING IN FULL THE JUDGMENT OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN FAVOR OF CHEVRON. ON OCTOBER 27, 2016, THE SECOND CIRCUIT DENIED THE DEFENDANTS' PETITIONS FOR EN BANC REHEARING OF THE OPINION ON THEIR APPEAL.

MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE FOREGOING MATTERS, INCLUDING ANY FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON, REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ECUADORIAN JUDGMENT, THE 2008 ENGINEER’S REPORT ON ALLEGED DAMAGES AND THE SEPTEMBER 2010 PLAINTIFFS’ SUBMISSION ON ALLEGED DAMAGES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE ANY UTILITY IN CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS). MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES. IT REDUCES THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO AMOUNTS THAT ARE, IN MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. AT THE END OF

, ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. THE STANDARD PROVIDES THAT ALL DEFERRED INCOME TAXES BE CLASSIFIED AS NONCURRENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE PRIOR REQUIREMENT WAS TO CLASSIFY MOST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE DECEMBER 31, 2015, CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET HAS BEEN RESTATED AND THE EFFECTS ARE REDUCTIONS OF

INCOME TAXES ARE NOT ACCRUED FOR UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OR ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

2016

, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WERE RECORDED FOR THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS WHERE INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF THE EARNINGS IS NOT PLANNED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL TAXES ON REMITTANCES OF EARNINGS THAT ARE NOT INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A TAX BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POSITION IS “MORE LIKELY THAN NOT” (I.E., A LIKELIHOOD

GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT

) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION BASED SOLELY ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TERM “TAX POSITION” IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR INCOME TAXES REFERS TO A POSITION IN A PREVIOUSLY FILED TAX RETURN OR A POSITION EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A FUTURE TAX RETURN THAT IS REFLECTED IN MEASURING CURRENT OR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIODS.

OF THE

TAX POSITIONS FOR CHEVRON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX AUDITS BY MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE COMPANY’S MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS, EXAMINATIONS OF TAX RETURNS FOR CERTAIN PRIOR TAX YEARS HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2016

. FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE LATEST YEARS FOR WHICH INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS HAD BEEN FINALIZED WERE AS FOLLOWS: UNITED STATES –

2011

, NIGERIA –

2000

, ANGOLA –

2009

AND KAZAKHSTAN –

2007.

THE COMPANY ENGAGES IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES REGARDING THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. BOTH THE OUTCOME OF THESE TAX MATTERS AND THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE OF THE TAX AUDITS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. HOWEVER, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT DEVELOPMENTS ON TAX MATTERS IN CERTAIN TAX JURISDICTIONS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COMPANY’S TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE NEXT

12

MONTHS. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT STILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER OF MATTERS BEING EXAMINED IN THE VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THE COMPANY REPORTS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS “INCOME TAX EXPENSE.” AS OF DECEMBER 31,

. THESE FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING AND CAN ALSO BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANY’S PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT INTEREST RATES BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANY’S STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31,

NOTE 24

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY PREFUNDS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS AS REQUIRED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS OR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE PREFUNDING PROVIDES ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL QUALIFIED PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT TYPICALLY FUND U.S. NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAWS AND REGULATIONS BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT RETURNS MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANY’S OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS, AS WELL AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS ARE UNFUNDED, AND THE COMPANY AND RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. BEGINNING  IN 2017, MEDICAL COVERAGE  FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES IN THE COMPANY’S MAIN U.S. MEDICAL PLAN IS PROVIDED THROUGH A THIRD-PARTY PRIVATE EXCHANGE. THE INCREASE TO THE PRE-MEDICARE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN

4 PERCENT

EACH YEAR. CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF EACH OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET-CLASS RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES.

FOR

2016

, THE COMPANY USED AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF

7.25 PERCENT

FOR U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR

69 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANY’S PENSION PLAN ASSETS. IN BOTH

2015

AND

2014

, THE COMPANY USED A LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF

7.5

PERCENT FOR THIS PLAN.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAIN U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE

THREE

MONTHS PRECEDING THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE

THREE

-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE RATE AT WHICH BENEFITS COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED, AND ARE EQUAL TO THE EQUIVALENT SINGLE RATE RESULTING FROM YIELD CURVE ANALYSIS. THIS ANALYSIS CONSIDERED THE PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY'S PLANS AND THE YIELDS ON HIGH-QUALITY BONDS. BEGINNING WITH THE DECEMBER 31, 2015 MEASUREMENT DATE, THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS WERE DISCOUNTED TO THE VALUATION DATE USING THE YIELD CURVE FOR THE MAIN U.S. PENSION AND OPEB PLANS. THE EFFECTIVE DISCOUNT RATES DERIVED FROM THIS ANALYSIS AT THE END OF 2016 WERE

3.9 PERCENT

FOR THE MAIN U.S. PENSION PLAN AND

4.1 PERCENT

FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN. THE DISCOUNT RATES FOR THESE PLANS AT THE END OF

2015

WERE

4.0

AND

4.5 PERCENT

, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE IN

2014

THEY WERE

3.7

AND

4.1 PERCENT

FOR THESE PLANS, RESPECTIVELY.

BEGINNING WITH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S  MAIN U.S. PENSION AND OPEB PLANS. UNDER THE NEW METHOD, THESE COSTS ARE ESTIMATED BY APPLYING SPOT RATES ALONG THE YIELD CURVE TO THE RELEVANT PROJECTED CASH FLOWS. IN PRIOR YEARS, THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS WERE ESTIMATED UTILIZING A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE USED TO MEASURE THE DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES START WITH

6.9 PERCENT

IN

2017

AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO

4.5 PERCENT

FOR

2025

AND BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES STARTED WITH

FS-

-58

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

7.1 PERCENT

IN

2016

AND GRADUALLY DECLINED TO

4.5 PERCENT

FOR

2025

AND BEYOND. IN BOTH MEASUREMENTS, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO THE COMPANY'S PRE-MEDICARE CONTRIBUTIONS UPON RETIREMENT WAS CAPPED AT

4 PERCENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE IMPACT IS MITIGATED BY THE

4 PERCENT

CAP ON THE COMPANY’S PRE-MEDICARE MEDICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE MAIN U.S. PLAN. A 1-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE IN THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON WORLDWIDE PLANS.

COLLECTIVE TRUSTS/MUTUAL FUNDS FOR U.S. PLANS ARE ENTIRELY INDEX FUNDS; FOR INTERNATIONAL PLANS, THEY ARE MOSTLY INDEX FUNDS. FOR THESE INDEX FUNDS, THE LEVEL 2 DESIGNATION IS PARTIALLY BASED ON THE RESTRICTION THAT ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF REDEMPTIONS, TYPICALLY TWO BUSINESS DAYS, IS REQUIRED.

THE YEAR-END VALUATIONS OF THE U.S. REAL ESTATE ASSETS ARE BASED ON INTERNAL APPRAISALS BY THE REAL ESTATE MANAGERS, WHICH ARE UPDATES OF THIRD-PARTY APPRAISALS THAT OCCUR AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR FOR EACH PROPERTY IN THE PORTFOLIO.

THE “OTHER” ASSET CLASS INCLUDES NET PAYABLES FOR SECURITIES PURCHASED BUT NOT YET SETTLED (LEVEL 1); DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST- AND TAX-RELATED RECEIVABLES (LEVEL 2); INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE-EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS (LEVEL 3).

6

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS FOCUS ON MARKET-NEUTRAL STRATEGIES THAT HAVE A LOW EXPECTED CORRELATION TO TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES.  FOR THESE FUNDS, THE LEVEL 2 DESIGNATION IS MAINLY BASED ON THE RESTRICTION THAT ADVANCED NOTIFICATION OF REDEMPTIONS, TYPICALLY THIRTY DAYS OR LESS, IS REQUIRED.

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE PENSION PLANS ARE TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF TOTAL RETURN WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS OF RISK AND LIQUIDITY, TO DIVERSIFY AND MITIGATE POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY’S U.S. AND U.K. PENSION PLANS COMPRISE

90 PERCENT

OF THE TOTAL PENSION ASSETS. BOTH THE U.S. AND U.K. PLANS HAVE AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE THAT REGULARLY MEETS DURING THE YEAR TO REVIEW THE ASSET HOLDINGS AND THEIR RETURNS. TO ASSESS THE PLANS’ INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLAN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE HAS ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES

ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION WITHIN APPROVED RANGES IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING  MARKET CONDITIONS AND ILLIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS. TO MITIGATE CONCENTRATION AND OTHER RISKS, ASSETS ARE INVESTED ACROSS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES WITH ACTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND PASSIVE INDEX FUNDS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT PREFUND ITS OPEB OBLIGATIONS.

, THE TRUST CONTAINED

14.2 MILLION

SHARES OF CHEVRON TREASURY STOCK. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE SHARES OR USE THE DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT PAY SUCH BENEFITS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS. THE TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUST’S BENEFICIARIES. THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE PURPOSES UNTIL DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD BY THE TRUST IN PAYMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, UNOCAL ESTABLISHED VARIOUS GRANTOR TRUSTS TO FUND OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS, INCLUDING THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLANS. AT

SETTLEMENT OF OPEN TAX YEARS, AS WELL AS OTHER TAX ISSUES IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME AND FRANCHISE TAXES FOR ALL YEARS UNDER EXAMINATION OR SUBJECT TO FUTURE EXAMINATION.

GUARANTEES

THE COMPANY HAS TWO GUARANTEES TO EQUITY AFFILIATES TOTALING

$1,157

. OF THIS AMOUNT,

$749

IS ASSOCIATED WITH A FINANCING ARRANGEMENT WITH AN EQUITY AFFILIATE. OVER THE APPROXIMATE

5

-YEAR REMAINING TERM OF THIS GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED AS PAYMENTS ARE MADE BY THE AFFILIATE. THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF

$408

IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER A TERMINAL USE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY AN EQUITY AFFILIATE. OVER THE APPROXIMATE

11

-YEAR REMAINING TERM OF THIS GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON HAS RECORDED NO LIABILITY FOR EITHER GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. THE ACQUIRER OF THOSE ASSETS SHARED IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF

$200

, WHICH HAD BEEN REACHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT, AFTER REACHING THE

$200

OBLIGATION, CHEVRON IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE ASSETS IN 1997.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS’ FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

ON NOVEMBER 7, 2011, WHILE DRILLING A DEVELOPMENT WELL IN THE DEEPWATER FRADE FIELD ABOUT 75 MILES OFFSHORE BRAZIL, AN UNANTICIPATED PRESSURE SPIKE CAUSED OIL TO MIGRATE FROM THE WELL BORE THROUGH A SERIES OF FISSURES TO THE SEA FLOOR, EMITTING APPROXIMATELY

2,400

BARRELS OF OIL. THE SOURCE OF THE SEEP WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTAINED WITHIN FOUR DAYS AND THE WELL WAS PLUGGED AND ABANDONED. ON MARCH 14, 2012, THE COMPANY IDENTIFIED A SMALL, SECOND SEEP IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE FIELD. NO EVIDENCE OF ANY COASTAL OR WILDLIFE IMPACTS RELATED TO EITHER OF THESE SEEPS EMERGED. AS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY’S PREVIOUSLY FILED PERIODIC REPORTS, IT HAS RESOLVED CIVIL CLAIMS RELATING TO THESE INCIDENTS BROUGHT BY A BRAZILIAN FEDERAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR. AS ALSO REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR ALSO FILED CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CHEVRON AND

11

CHEVRON EMPLOYEES. THESE CHARGES WERE DISMISSED BY THE TRIAL COURT ON FEBRUARY 19, 2013, REINSTATED BY AN APPELLATE COURT ON OCTOBER 9, 2013, AND THEN, UPON CHEVRON’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, DISMISSED BY THE APPELLATE COURT ON AUGUST 27, 2015. THE FEDERAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR HAS APPEALED THE APPELLATE COURT’S DECISION.

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS; JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS; U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; SUPPLIERS; AND INDIVIDUALS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE, AND MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 26

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) AS AN ASSET AND LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM THE ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL, EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY MAY EXIST ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT THAT MAY BE BEYOND THE COMPANY’S CONTROL. THIS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT IS FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION EXISTS TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. RECOGNITION OF THE ARO INCLUDES: (1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING ASSET, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION OF THE ASSET, AND (3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND DISCOUNT RATES.

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS, THE WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS. THE SYSTEM CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS AT THE TIME OF REPORTING – THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND THREE POTENTIALLY RECOVERABLE. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL CLASSIFICATION ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES OF UNPROVED: PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE POTENTIALLY RECOVERABLE CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE IN THE FUTURE FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. NET PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THE QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. AS PART OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS CHAIRED BY THE MANAGER OF GLOBAL RESERVES, AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE UPSTREAM OPERATING ORGANIZATION. THE MANAGER OF GLOBAL RESERVES HAS MORE THAN 30 YEARS’ EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND HOLDS BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE DEGREES IN GEOSCIENCE. HIS EXPERIENCE INCLUDES VARIOUS TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT ROLES IN PROVIDING RESERVE AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES IN SUPPORT OF MAJOR CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION PROJECTS, AND MORE THAN 10 YEARS OF MANAGING OIL AND GAS RESERVES PROCESSES. HE HAS BEEN NAMED A DISTINGUISHED LECTURER BY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS AND IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF

FS-

-69

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES - UNAUDITED

THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS, THE SEPM SOCIETY OF SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGISTS AND THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS.

ALL RAC MEMBERS ARE DEGREED PROFESSIONALS, EACH WITH MORE THAN 10 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF RESERVES ESTIMATION RELATING TO RESERVOIR ENGINEERING, PETROLEUM ENGINEERING, EARTH SCIENCE OR FINANCE. THE MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN SEC GUIDELINES FOR PROVED RESERVES CLASSIFICATION AND RECEIVE ANNUAL TRAINING ON THE PREPARATION OF RESERVES ESTIMATES.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: ESTABLISH THE POLICIES AND PROCESSES USED WITHIN THE OPERATING UNITS TO ESTIMATE RESERVES; PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS AND OVERSIGHT OF THE BUSINESS UNITS’ RECOMMENDED RESERVES ESTIMATES AND CHANGES; CONFIRM THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND APPROPRIATE STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN THE

GLOBAL RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH PROVIDES STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON RESERVES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANY’S UPSTREAM BUSINESS UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR CHANGES ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANY’S STRATEGY AND PLANNING COMMITTEE, WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL RESERVE ACTIVITY IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IF MAJOR CHANGES TO RESERVES WERE TO OCCUR BETWEEN THE ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE BOARD.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE LARGE PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED-RESERVE RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE

GLOBAL RESERVES MANUAL.

IN ADDITION, THIRD-PARTY ENGINEERING CONSULTANTS ARE USED TO SUPPLEMENT THE COMPANY’S OWN RESERVES ESTIMATION CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY AUDITS OF SELECTED OIL AND GAS ASSETS.

TECHNOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS

IN 2016, ADDITIONS TO CHEVRON’S PROVED RESERVES WERE BASED ON A WIDE RANGE OF GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES. INFORMATION GENERATED FROM WELLS, SUCH AS WELL LOGS, WIRE LINE SAMPLING, PRODUCTION AND PRESSURE TESTING, FLUID ANALYSIS, AND CORE ANALYSIS, WAS INTEGRATED WITH SEISMIC DATA, REGIONAL GEOLOGIC STUDIES, AND INFORMATION FROM ANALOGOUS RESERVOIRS TO PROVIDE “REASONABLY CERTAIN” PROVED RESERVES ESTIMATES. BOTH PROPRIETARY AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ANALYTIC TOOLS, INCLUDING RESERVOIR SIMULATION, GEOLOGIC MODELING AND SEISMIC PROCESSING, HAVE BEEN USED IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SUBSURFACE DATA. THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN UTILIZED EXTENSIVELY BY THE COMPANY IN THE PAST, AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THEY PROVIDE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN ESTABLISHING RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT RESERVES ESTIMATES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

AT THE END OF 2016, PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TOTALED 3.6 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT (BOE), A DECREASE OF 656 MILLION BOE FROM YEAR-END 2015. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO THE TRANSFER OF 1.1 BILLION BOE TO PROVED DEVELOPED, 7 MILLION BOE IN REVISIONS AND 7 MILLION BOE IN SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES OF 277 MILLION BOE IN IMPROVED RECOVERY, 189 MILLION BOE IN EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES AND 10 MILLION BOE IN ACQUISITIONS.

DURING 2016, INVESTMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $8.8 BILLION IN OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES AND ABOUT $1.9 BILLION IN NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES WERE EXPENDED TO ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. AUSTRALIA ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT $2.3 BILLION OF THE TOTAL, MAINLY FOR DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AT THE WHEATSTONE LNG PROJECT. EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $2.3 BILLION IN THE UNITED STATES RELATED PRIMARILY TO VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE MIDCONTINENT REGION. IN ASIA, EXPENDITURES DURING THE YEAR TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OF THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, AND IN THAILAND. IN AFRICA, ABOUT $1.6 BILLION WAS EXPENDED ON VARIOUS OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT AND NATURAL GAS PROJECTS IN NIGERIA, ANGOLA AND REPUBLIC OF CONGO. DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN CANADA WERE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT $1.3 BILLION OF EXPENDITURES IN OTHER AMERICAS.

RESERVES THAT REMAIN PROVED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS ARE A RESULT OF SEVERAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT OPTIMAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION, SUCH AS THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN ADVERSE AND REMOTE LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS OF INFRASTRUCTURE OR PLANT CAPACITIES THAT DICTATE PROJECT TIMING, COMPRESSION PROJECTS THAT ARE PENDING RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES, AND CONTRACTUAL LIMITATIONS THAT DICTATE PRODUCTION LEVELS.

AT YEAR-END 2016, THE COMPANY HELD APPROXIMATELY 2.2 BILLION BOE OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES THAT HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE RESERVES ARE IN THREE LOCATIONS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF DEVELOPING MAJOR PROJECTS. IN AUSTRALIA, APPROXIMATELY 600 MILLION BOE HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE RELATED TO THE GORGON AND WHEATSTONE PROJECTS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING LIQUEFACTION AND OTHER FACILITIES IN AUSTRALIA TO DEVELOP THIS NATURAL GAS. IN AFRICA, APPROXIMATELY 400 MILLION BOE HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE, PRIMARILY DUE TO FACILITY CONSTRAINTS AT VARIOUS FIELDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESCRAVOS GAS PROJECTS IN NIGERIA.

AFFILIATES ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 1.4 BILLION BOE OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WITH ABOUT 1.0 BILLION BOE THAT HAVE

FS-

-70

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES - UNAUDITED

REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE, WITH THE MAJORITY RELATED TO THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN. AT TCO, FURTHER FIELD DEVELOPMENT TO CONVERT THE REMAINING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IS SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN LINE WITH RESERVOIR DEPLETION.

ANNUALLY, THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER ANY CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS CHANGES TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS, REGULATIONS OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES, THAT WOULD WARRANT A REVISION TO RESERVE ESTIMATES. IN 2016, FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE ECONOMIC LIMITS OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, RESULTING IN PROVED RESERVE DECREASES, AND POSITIVELY IMPACTED PROVED RESERVES DUE TO ENTITLEMENT EFFECTS. THE YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES HAVE BEEN UPDATED FOR THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE APPROPRIATE RESERVES SECTIONS. FOR 2016, THIS ASSESSMENT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN RESERVES CLASSIFIED AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE RATIO OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO TOTAL PROVED RESERVES HAS RANGED BETWEEN 32 PERCENT AND 45 PERCENT. THE CONSISTENT COMPLETION OF MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS HAS KEPT THE RATIO IN A NARROW RANGE OVER THIS TIME PERIOD.

PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2016

, THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES CAN BE AFFECTED BY EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE COMPANY’S CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT PERMITTING, PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CHANGES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS, GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, AND CIVIL UNREST.

AT DECEMBER 31,

TABLE VI - STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC AND FASB REQUIREMENTS. THIS INCLUDES USING THE AVERAGE OF FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH OIL AND GAS PRICES FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD, ESTIMATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ASSUMING THE CONTINUATION OF EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ESTIMATED COSTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDES COSTS TO RETIRE EXISTING WELLS AND FACILITIES IN ADDITION TO THOSE FUTURE WELLS AND FACILITIES NECESSARY TO PRODUCE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES), AND ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAXES BASED ON APPROPRIATE STATUTORY TAX RATES. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE CALCULATED USING 10 PERCENT MID-PERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS. ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES, WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE VALUATION REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND DO NOT REPRESENT  MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANY’S FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL AND GAS RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, THE CAPTION “STANDARDIZED MEASURE NET CASH FLOWS” REFERS TO THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS.
