summary description of
chevrontexaco
chevrontexaco corporation1, a delaware
corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and
affiliates, and provides administrative, financial and
management support to u.s. and foreign subsidiaries that engage
in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations,
coal mining, power and energy services. the company operates in
the united states and approximately 180 other countries.
petroleum operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas; refining crude oil into
finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil, natural gas
and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting
crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipelines,
marine vessels, motor equipment and rail car. chemicals
operations include the manufacture and marketing, by an
affiliate, of commodity petrochemicals and plastics for
industrial uses, and the manufacture and marketing, by a
consolidated subsidiary, of fuel and lubricating oil additives.
in this report, exploration and production of
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas may be referred
to as e&p or upstream activities.
refining, marketing and transportation may be referred to as
rm&t or downstream activities. a
list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pages e-4 to e-6 of this annual report on form10-k. as of
december31, 2002, chevrontexaco had 53,014 employees
(excluding 13,024 service station employees), down about 2,700
from year-end 2001. approximately 29,000, or 44 percent, of the
companys employees, including service station employees,
were employed in u.s. operations, of which approximately 3,700
were unionized.
overview of petroleum
industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability
are influenced by many factors, over some of which individual
petroleum companies have little control. governmental policies,
particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the
environment, have a significant impact on petroleum activities,
regulating where and how companies conduct their operations and
formulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their
profits directly. prices for crude oil and natural gas,
petroleum products and petrochemicals are determined by supply
and demand for these commodities. the members of the
organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec)are
typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil, and
their production levels are a major factor in determining
worldwide supply. demand for crude oil and its products and for
natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local,
national and worldwide economies, although weather patterns and
taxation relative to other energy sources also play a
significant part. natural gas is generally produced and consumed
on a country or regional basis. variations in the components of
refined products sales due to seasonality are not primary
drivers of changes in the companys overall earnings.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the
petroleum and petrochemical industries. there is competition
within the industries and also with other industries in
supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and
individual consumers. chevrontexaco competes with fully
integrated major

is stated otherwise, does not include affiliates of
chevrontexaco i.e., those companies accounted for by

investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms
are used for convenience only, and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.

petroleum companies, as well as independent and
national petroleum companies for the acquisition of oil and gas
leases and other properties, and for the equipment and labor
required to develop and operate those properties. in its
downstream business, chevrontexaco also competes with fully
integrated major petroleum companies and other independent
refining and marketing entities in the sale or purchase of
various goods or services in many national and international
markets.

and outlook.
texaco merger transaction
on october9, 2001, texaco inc. (texaco)
became a wholly owned subsidiary of chevron corporation
(chevron) pursuant to a merger transaction, and chevron changed
its name to chevrontexaco corporation. the combination was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, and each share of
texaco common stock was converted on a tax-free basis into the
right to receive 0.77 shares of chevrontexaco common stock. in
the merger, chevrontexaco issued approximately 425million
shares of common stock, representing about 40percent of
the outstanding chevrontexaco common stock after the merger.
further discussion of the
table of contents
texaco merger transaction, including
merger-related expenses, is contained on pagesfs-3 and
fs-27 of this annual report on form10-k.
chevrontexaco strategic
direction
chevrontexacos primary objective is to
achieve sustained financial returns that will enable it to
outperform its competitors. the company has set as a goal to
generate the highest total stockholder return among a designated
peer group for the five-year period 2000-2004. british
petroleum, exxonmobil and royal dutch shell among
the worlds largest integrated petroleum
companies comprise the companys designated
competitor peer group for this purpose. the company had the
second highest total stockholder return in this peer group for
the 2000-2002 period.
as a foundation for attaining this goal, the
company has established four key priorities:
operational
excellence
through safe, reliable, efficient and
environmentally sound operations;
cost reduction
by lowering unit costs through
innovation and technology;
capital
stewardship
by investing in the best project
opportunities and executing them successfully (safer, faster,
and at lower cost); and
profitable growth
through leadership in developing new
business opportunities in both existing and new markets.
supporting these four priorities is a focus on:
organizational
capability: having the right
people, processes and culture to achieve and sustain
industry-leading performance in the four priorities described
above.
the corporate strategic plan builds on this
framework with strategies focused on appropriately balancing
financial returns and growth. the company is currently
conducting a rigorous evaluation of its entire portfolio of
assets and expects to finalize this review later this year. as a
result of this evaluation, the company anticipates exploring
potential asset transactions to increase the efficiency and
profitability of continuing operations and enhancing the
economic value of its asset base. the company expects that its
worldwide exploration and production business will continue to
be its most important business, with development of its large
proved and unproved natural gas reserves constituting perhaps
the largest opportunity over time to expand the companys
base of production and to capture economic value from emerging
natural gas market opportunities. the company is also seeking to
deliver improved and competitive returns from its worldwide
downstream businesses.
(b)description
of business and properties
the companys largest business segments are
exploration and production, and refining, marketing and
transportation. chemicals is also a significant segment,
conducted mainly by the companys affiliate  chevron
phillips chemical company llc (cpchem). the petroleum activities
of the company are widely dispersed geographically. the company
has petroleum operations in north america, south america,
europe, africa, middle east, central and far east asia, and
australia.
cpchem has operations in the united states,
puerto rico, belgium, china, south korea, singapore, saudi
arabia, qatar and mexico. chevrontexacos wholly owned
oronite fuel and lube oil additives business has operations in
the united states, mexico, france, the netherlands, singapore,
india, japan and brazil.
an equity affiliate, dynegy inc. (dynegy), owns
operating divisions engaged in power generation, natural gas
liquids and regulated energy delivery. chevrontexaco owns
approximately 26percent of dynegys common stock and
also holds $1.5billion aggregate principal amount of
dynegys preferred stock. until recently, dynegy also
conducted a large electricity and natural gas trading and
marketing business, as well as broadband trading. chevrontexaco
sold essentially all of its u.s. natural gas production to
dynegy, which then sold it into the market. following the
collapse of the merchant energy sector in 2002, dynegy
experienced a marked reduction in liquidity. its debt ratings
were downgraded and a sharp decline in its stock price
table of contents
occurred. in 2002, dynegy announced its intent to
exit the energy trading business. as a result of those changes,
chevrontexaco is re-establishing a natural gas marketing
business to market the companys u.s. natural gas
production and to purchase supply for its requirements. refer to
pagefs-8 for further information relating to the
companys investment in dynegy.
tabulations of segment sales and other operating
revenues, earnings, income taxes and assets, by united states
and international geographic areas, for the years 2000 to 2002,
may be found in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements
beginning on page fs-31 of this annual report on form10-k.
in addition, similar comparative data for the companys
investments in and income from equity affiliates and property,
plant and equipment are contained in notes13 and 14 on
pages fs-34 to fs-36.
the companys worldwide operations can be
affected significantly by changing economic, tax, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates, including the united states. environmental regulations
and government policies concerning economic development, energy
and taxation may have a significant effect on the companys
operations. management evaluates the economic and political risk
of initiating, maintaining or expanding operations in any
geographical area. the company monitors political events
worldwide and the possible threat these may pose to its
activities particularly the companys oil and
gas exploration and production operations and the
safety of the companys employees. the company is carefully
monitoring the potential for disruption of its operations in the
event of hostilities in iraq. approximately five percent of the
companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production for 2002
came from the partitioned neutral zone (pnz), which is located
between the kingdom of saudi arabia and the state of kuwait.
capital and
exploratory expenditures

table of contents
in 2002, chevrontexaco conducted its exploration
and production operations in the united states and approximately
25 other countries. worldwide net crude oil and natural gas
liquids production, including that of affiliates but excluding
volumes produced under operating service agreements, decreased
by about 3percent from the 2001 levels. net worldwide
production of natural gas, including affiliates, decreased about
1percent in 2002.
net liquids and natural gas production in the
united states was down about 2percent and 11percent,
respectively. the decline in u.s. natural gas production in 2002
reflected decreases in the gulf of mexico, primarily
attributable to declines in mature fields. early in 2001,
production from a number of fields was accelerated via increased
drilling at a time of high natural gas prices. in addition to
normal field declines, production disruptions caused by tropical
storms in the gulf of mexico reduced net crude oil and natural
gas liquids production by 10,000 barrels per day and
60million cubic feet of natural gas per day on an
annualized basis.
international net liquids production, including
affiliates, decreased about 4percent, while net natural
gas production rose 15percent from 2001. in nigeria, the
decline in net liquids production between years was primarily
attributable to opec production constraints. in indonesia, about
25,000 barrels per day of the year to year decline was
attributable to changes in certain production-sharing contract
terms and 10,000 barrels per day was related to the expiration
of a production sharing agreement. the increase in international
natural gas volumes occurred primarily in the philippines, due
to a full year of new production from the malampaya field.
for the past five years, the companys
worldwide oil-equivalent production has followed a downward
trend with 2002 production at 91percent of 1998 levels,
equivalent to an average annual decline rate between 1 and
2percent. during this time period, increases in
international oil-equivalent production have been more than
offset by decreases in the united states.
for 2003, the company currently anticipates lower
oil-equivalent production rates in the united states as a result
of lower capital expenditures in recent years and natural field
declines. the company expects this to be more than offset by
capacity increases in international areas resulting in worldwide
oil-equivalent production capacity in 2003 slightly higher than
actual production levels achieved in 2002. the ultimate level of
production in 2003 remains uncertain due to unanticipated
production interruptions, opec constraints and other economic
factors.

table of contents
reserves and contract obligations
tablev on pagesfs-51 and fs-52 of
this annual report on form10-k sets forth the
companys net proved oil and gas reserves, by geographic
area, as of december31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. during 2003,
the company will file estimates of oil and gas reserves with the
department of energy, energy information agency. those estimates
are consistent with the reserve data reported on pagefs-52
of this annual report on form10-k.
in 2002, chevrontexacos worldwide oil and
equivalent-gas (oeg)barrels of net proved reserves
additions exceeded production, with a replacement rate of
114percent of net production, including sales and
acquisitions. excluding sales and acquisitions, the replacement
rate was 112percent of net production. in africa, the
reserves replacement rate increased to 521percent,
compared with 268percent in 2001, due primarily to
reserves additions in west africa. in the united states, the
addition of reserve quantities for the kern river field in
californias san joaquin valley, due to improved recovery
from reservoir management, was more than offset by downward
revisions in gas fields in the mid-continent, co2
projects in the permian basin, and a number of fields in the
gulf of mexico. the following table summarizes the
companys net additions to net proved reserves of crude oil
and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, compared with net

the company sells crude oil and natural gas from
its producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. most contracts generally commit the company to
sell quantities based on production from specified properties,
but certain gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and
determinable quantities. during 2002, dynegy purchased
substantially all natural gas and natural gas liquids produced
by the company in the united states, excluding alaska, and
supplied natural gas and natural gas liquids feedstocks to the
companys u.s. refineries and chemical plants. the company
reached an agreement with dynegy to terminate existing natural
gas purchase and sale contracts and other related contracts at
the end of january 2003. see pagefs-8 for further
information on dynegy. outside the united states, the company is
contractually committed to deliver approximately
400billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2005 from
australian, colombian and philippine reserves, and approximately
1,300billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2006 through
2020 from australian and philippine reserves. the company
believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities
available from production of the companys proved developed
australian, colombian and philippine reserves. the contracts
discussed above include variable-pricing terms.

exploration activities
the following table summarizes the companys
net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed
in each of the last three years and the number of exploratory
wells drilling at december31, 2002. exploratory
wells are wells drilled to find and produce oil or gas in
unproved areas and include delineation wells, which are wells
drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to
be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir or to extend a
known reservoir beyond the proved area. wells
drilling include wells temporarily suspended. the company
had $450million of suspended exploratory wells included in
properties, plant and equipment at year-end 2002, a decrease of
$238million from 2001. decreases in nigeria, angola and
china were partially offset by increases in the united states.
the wells are suspended pending a final determination of the
commercial potential of the related oil and gas deposits. the
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on:
(1)decisions on additional major capital expenditures,
(2)the results of additional exploratory drilling that is
underway or firmly planned, and in some cases, (3)securing
final regulatory approvals for development.

equivalent per day; (2)50percent-owned and operated
typhoon, which averaged 17,700 barrels of net oil equivalent per
day; and (3)50percent-owned and operated petronius,
which averaged 26,500 barrels of net oil equivalent per day.
exploration programs resulted in two significant discoveries,
for which evaluation continued into 2003:
(1)58percent-owned and operated tahiti; and
(2)33percent-owned great white. appraisal work is
ongoing at the 2001 trident and 2000 blind faith discoveries,
and production began at boris, a 2001 discovery, in february
2003.
in december, chevrontexaco submitted an
application to the u.s. department of transportation to
construct and operate a liquefied natural gas
(lng)receiving and regasification terminal located
approximately 50miles offshore in the gulf of mexico. the

upgraded to 180,000barrels of lighter, higher-value crude
per day. the general strike in venezuela did not materially
impact project construction, although oil production was halted
in december 2002 and january 2003. production has since resumed
and is ramping back up to pre-strike levels.
petroleum natural gas and natural
gas liquids
the company sells natural gas and natural gas
liquids from its producing operations under a variety of
contractual arrangements. during 2002, the companys equity
affiliate dynegy purchased substantially all natural gas and
natural gas liquids produced by the company in the united
states, excluding alaska, and supplied natural gas and natural
gas liquids feedstocks to the companys
u.s.refineries and chemical plants. following
dynegys decision to exit the gas marketing and trading
business, the company reached an agreement with dynegy to
terminate the existing natural gas purchase and sale contracts
at the end of january 2003. chevrontexaco formed a new unit,
chevrontexaco natural gas, with dynegy providing transitional
support until chevrontexaco natural gas becomes fully
operational, currently planned for april 2003 business. the
companys existing natural gas processing and liquids
arrangements with dynegy were not affected by the early
termination of natural gas purchase and sales contracts, and
will continue as an ongoing commercial relationship. refer to
page fs-8 of this annual report on form10-k in
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations for further comments on dynegy.
outside the united states, the majority of the
companys natural gas sales occur in the united kingdom,
australia, canada, latin america, and in the companys
affiliate operations in kazakhstan. international natural gas
liquids sales take place in the companys canadian upstream
operations, with lower sales levels in africa, australia and
europe.

federal law requires that cargo transported
between u.s.ports be carried in ships built and registered
in the united states, owned and operated by u.s.entities
and manned by u.s.crews. at year-end 2002, the
companys u.s.flag fleet was engaged primarily in
transporting refined products between the gulf coast and east
coast, and refined products from california refineries to
terminals on the west coast, alaska and hawaii.
the foreign flag vessels were engaged primarily
in transporting crude oil from the middle east, indonesia,
mexico and west africa to ports in the united states, europe and
asia. refined products also were transported by tanker worldwide.
the federal oil pollution act of 1990 requires
the scheduled phase-out, by year-end 2010, of all single hull
tankers trading to u.s.ports or transferring cargo in
waters within the u.s.exclusive economic zone. this has
resulted in the utilization of double-hull tankers. during 2002,
chevrontexaco operated a total of 19 double-hull tankers and
expects to take delivery of three additional double-hull tankers
in 2003, also to be operated under long-term bareboat charters.
the company is a member of many oil-spill response cooperatives
in areas in which it operates around the world.
chemicals

table of contents
facilities in the united states, france, the
netherlands, singapore, japan and brazil and has equity

coal
the companys coal mining and marketing
subsidiary, the pittsburg & midway coal mining co.
(p&m), owned and operated two surface mines and one
underground mine at year-end 2002. in addition, final
reclamation activities were underway at two mines prior to their
planned closure. p&m also owns an approximate 30 percent
interest in inter-american coal holding n.v., which has
interests in coal mining operations in venezuela. sales of coal
from p&ms wholly owned mines and from its affiliates
were 14.9million tons, a decrease of 8percent from
2001 primarily the result of reduced demand. at year-end 2002,
p&m controlled approximately 186million tons of
developed and undeveloped coal reserves, including significant
reserves of environmentally desirable low-sulfur fuel. the
company is contractually committed to deliver approximately
13million tons of coal per year through the end of 2005.
the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from
existing coal reserves.
other activities synthetic crude
oil
in canada, chevrontexaco has a 20percent
interest in the athabasca oil sands project where bitumen
production began in december 2002. production was temporarily
suspended in early 2003 and is expected to resume in late march.
the bitumen will be upgraded into synthetic crude oil using
hydroprocessing technology at a synthetic crude unit, expected
to begin operations in the second quarter 2003. bitumen
production is expected to reach an average rate of 155,000
barrels of per day in 2005.
power and gasification
chevrontexaco participates in its power and
gasification business through ownership, equity investments with
others and licensing of proprietary technology. the
companys electrical power business includes conventional
power generation projects, as well as cogeneration facilities.
cogeneration produces thermal energy, such as steam, and
electric power. chevrontexaco has used steam produced in
cogeneration in its upstream operations onshore california and
in indonesia. the company uses its proprietary gasification
technology to convert a wide variety of hydrocarbon feedstocks
into a clean synthesis gas. the synthetic gas can be used as a
feedstock for basic chemicals or to generate electricity in
low-emission power plants. chevrontexaco licenses this
technology, operates owned gasification facilities and invests
in projects using the technology. the company has licensed its
gasification technology to more than 70 plants worldwide.
research and technology
the companys core hydrocarbon technology
efforts support the upstream, downstream and power and
gasification businesses. these activities include heavy oil
recovery and upgrading, deepwater exploration and production,
shallow water production operations, gas-to-liquids processing,
hydrocarbon gasification to power, and new and improved refinery
processes.
additionally, chevrontexacos technology
ventures company focuses upon the identification, growth, and
commercialization of emerging technologies that have the
potential to change or transform the way that energy is produced
or consumed. the range of business spans early-stage venture
capital investing in emerging technologies to developing joint
venture companies in new energy systems such as advanced
batteries for distributed power and transportation systems and
hydrogen fuel storage.
the company has largely completed the
implementation of a new information technology infrastructure
encompassing computing, data management, security, and
connectivity of partners, suppliers, and employees. the
architecture, known as net ready, provides the
foundation for the company to cost effectively and rapidly
integrate advances in computing and network-based technology.
table of contents
chevrontexacos research and development
expenses were $221million, $209 million and
$211million for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
because some of the investments the company makes
in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies
and business processes, ultimate success is not certain.
although not all initiatives may prove to be economically
viable, the companys overall investment in this area is
not significant to the companys consolidated financial
position.
environmental protection
virtually all aspects of the companys
businesses are subject to various federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity, and govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. chevrontexaco expects more environmental-related
regulations in the countries where it has operations. most of
the costs of complying with the many laws and regulations
pertaining to its operations are embedded in the normal costs of
conducting its business.
in 2002, the companys u.s.capitalized
environmental expenditures were $271million, representing
approximately 8percent of the companys total
consolidated u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures.
these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
retrofit existing facilities, as well as those associated with
new facilities. the expenditures are predominantly in the
petroleum segment and relate mostly to air and water quality
projects and activities at the companys refineries, oil
and gas producing facilities and marketing facilities. for 2003,
the company estimates u.s.capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities will be $287million. the
future annual capital costs of fulfilling this commitment are
uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
future changes to regulatory requirements.

their impact on chevrontexaco, and the companys 2002

because of their nature and sufficiently large amounts, the special items in
the table above are identified separately to help explain the changes in net
income and segment income between
periods as well as to help distinguish the underlying trends for the companys
businesses. the categories merger-related expenses and extraordinary loss
from merger-related asset sales are amounts in 2001 and 2002 that are
described in detail in the texaco merger transaction section on page fs-3.
other special items are discussed in detail for each major operating area in
the results of operations section beginning on page fs-4.
business environment and outlook
as shown in the special items table, large special-item charges adversely
affected net income in 2002 and 2001. in 2002, $2.3billion of the $3.3billion
of net charges related to the companys
investment in its dynegy inc. affiliate. refer to pages fs-7 and fs-8 for
discussion of these matters. approximately one half of the $3.5billion of net
charges in 2001 related to asset impairments, primarily the result of downward
revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserve quantities. these items are
discussed in the u.s. and international exploration and production analyses of
segment income beginning on page fs-4. other major charges against earnings in
2002 and 2001 related to the texaco merger transaction, which is discussed on
page fs-3.
apart from the effects of special items, chevrontexacos earnings depend
largely on the profitability of its upstream  exploration and production  and
downstream  refining, marketing and transportation  businesses. overall
earnings trends are typically less affected by results from the companys
commodity chemicals sector and investments in other businesses. key components
of the companys competitive position, particularly given the capital-intensive
infrastructure and the commodity-based nature of many of its products, are the
ability to invest
capital in projects that provide adequate financial returns and managing
operating expenses successfully. the company also continuously evaluates
opportunities to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base
to help sustain the companys growth. during 2003, the company intends to
evaluate and determine which assets in its overall post-merger portfolio
are key to providing long-term value. accordingly, certain asset dispositions
may result.
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas
are as follows:
upstream year-to-year changes in exploration and production earnings
align most closely with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas.
crude oil and natural gas prices are
subject to certain external factors, over which the company has no control,
including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry
inventory levels, weather-related
damages and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and the regional supply
interruptions that may be caused by military conflicts or political
uncertainty. longer-term trends in earnings for this segment are also a
function of a range of factors in addition to price trends, including the
companys ability to find or acquire reserves and efficiently produce them.
average worldwide industry prices for crude oil in 2002 were little
changed from 2001. however, the companys average natural gas realization in
the united states fell about one third from the prior year and contributed to
the decline in the companys u.s segment income between periods. segment income
in 2002 for
fs-2
table of contents
international operations reflected relatively little change in prices
for both crude oil and natural gas.
during 2002, industry price levels for crude oil trended upward from the
$20 per-barrel level to about $30. in early march 2003, the spot price for west
texas intermediate (wti), a benchmark crude oil was quoted between $35 and $40
per barrel  a 12-year high. benchmark prices for henry hub u.s. natural gas
started 2002 in the low-$2 range per thousand cubic feet and also trended
upward during the year, to about the $5 level. through mid-march 2003, the
benchmark natural gas price was volatile and averaged about $7 per thousand
cubic feet for that period. the relatively strong prices for crude oil in
early 2003 in part reflected the geopolitical uncertainty in iraq and
venezuela. the higher u.s. natural gas price was primarily attributable to
falling inventory storage levels reflecting withdrawals to meet the demands of
a cold winter over much of the united states.
segment income during 2002 was also dampened by lower worldwide
oil-equivalent production  down 3percent from 2001 levels. part of the
production decline was the result of opec quotas, which accounted for a
decrease in nigeria of about 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2002.
storms in the gulf of mexico reduced 2002 oil-equivalent production by about
20,000 barrels per day. the impact of revised terms on a production-sharing
contract in indonesia lowered 2002 net oil-equivalent production by about
25,000 barrels per day. absent these effects, worldwide oil-equivalent
production was at about the same level in both years. the expected production
level in 2003 and beyond is uncertain, in part because of the possibility of
additional quota adjustments by opec and the potential for local civil unrest
and changing geopolitics that could cause production disruptions. capital
expenditures are weighted heavily to international areas due to the greater
number of economic opportunities.
downstream refining, marketing and transportation earnings are closely
tied to regional demand and industry refining and marketing margins. other,
company-specific, factors influencing the companys profitability in this
segment include the operating efficiencies of its refinery network, including
any downtime due to operating incidents and maintenance.
industry margins worldwide were strong in the early part of 2001 but
trended downward worldwide during the year, as worldwide demand for refined
products weakened. by early 2002,
chevrontexaco margins were at their lowest levels since the mid-1990s, as weak
market conditions would not allow feedstock costs to be fully recovered from
consumers of refined products. as a result, worldwide earnings plummeted
between 2001 and 2002 to below break-even. additionally, the decline in
earnings from 2001 included the absence of ongoing earnings from u.s.
downstream assets that were sold as a condition of the merger. into early 2003,
u.s. refined products margins strengthened on the combined effects of the
general strike in venezuela, colder-than-normal winter weather and low
inventory levels. based on current industry and economic conditions, the
company does not expect a rebound of earnings for this segment in 2003 to
levels similar to 2001 and 2000.
chemicals earnings for the companys oronite subsidiary improved in
2002, and losses from the 50percent-owned chevron phillips chemical co. llc
affiliate were lower. demand and margins for commodity chemicals have been at
low levels for a protracted period, and significant improvement is not expected
in the near future.
texaco merger transaction
basis of presentation on october9, 2001, texaco inc. (texaco) became a
wholly owned subsidiary of chevron corporation (chevron) pursuant to a merger
transaction, and chevron changed its name to chevrontexaco corporation. certain
operations that were jointly owned by the combining companies are consolidated
in the accompanying financial statements. these operations are primarily those
of the caltex group of companies, which was previously owned 50percent each by
chevron and texaco. the combination was accounted for as a pooling of
interests,
and the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for all periods
are presented as if chevron and texaco had always been combined.
merger effects under mandate of the federal trade commission (ftc)as a
condition to ftc approval of the merger, the company sold its interests in
equilon and motiva  joint ventures
engaged in u.s. downstream businesses  in february 2002, resulting in cash
proceeds of $2.2billion, including dividends due. indemnification by
chevrontexaco against certain equilon
and motiva contingent liabilities at the date of sale are discussed in the
guarantees, off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations, and
other contingencies section beginning
on page fs-10. other mandated asset dispositions were also completed during
2002. net income and cash proceeds from these other sales were not material.
net income during 2001 for all assets that were sold as a condition of the
merger was approximately $375million. the net loss on assets sold under the
ftc mandate is presented in the 2001 income statement as an extraordinary item.
the company incurred before-tax merger-related expenses of $1.563billion
($1.136billion after tax) and $576million ($386million after tax) in 2001
and 2002, respectively. major expenses
included employee severance payments; incremental pension and medical plan
benefit costs associated with workforce reductions; legal, accounting,
securities and exchange commission (sec)filing and investment banker fees;
employee and office relocations; and costs for the elimination of redundant
facilities and operations. no significant merger-related expenses are
anticipated for 2003.
included in merger-related expenses were accruals of $891million and $60
million in 2001 and 2002, respectively, for severance-related benefits for
approximately 4,500 employees and other merger-related expenses that will not
benefit future operations.

of the 4,500 employees to be terminated, approximately 450 remained on the
payroll at december31, 2002. the year-end 2002 accrual balance is not expected
to be extinguished for approximately two years, reflecting a severance payment
deferral option exercised by some employees.

operating developments
operating developments and events during 2002 and early 2003
included:
worldwide oil and gas reserves and production the company added
approximately 1.1billion barrels of oil-equivalent reserves during 2002. these
additions equated to 114percent of production for the year. included were
nearly 600million barrels of oil-equivalent from major discoveries and
extensions in africa, australia, europe and china. additionally, 500million
barrels were added through improved recovery and expansion projects, primarily
in africa, eurasia and california. worldwide oil-equivalent production declined
in 2002 about 3percent, compared with 2001 and about 4percent compared with
2000. the decreases between years reflect lower u.s. production levels,
partially offset by increased international production.
u.s. gulf of mexico two deepwater discoveries were made  tahiti and great
white  and are in the process of being evaluated. chevrontexaco, with a 58
percent interest, operates the tahiti
prospect. the company has a one-third non-operated interest in great white. in
december, the company submitted an application to construct and operate the
port pelican liquefied natural gas (lng)receiving and regasification terminal,
located approximately 50 miles offshore in the gulf of mexico. phase 1 of the
project is designed to process up to 800million cubic feet of natural gas per
day and will connect to existing infrastructure along the gulf coast.
chevrontexacos interest is 100percent. lng projects like port pelican can
help offset the effect of an expected
long-term decline in the industrys u.s. natural gas production.
angola the eighth and ninth discoveries  gabela and negage  were
announced in chevrontexaco-operated deepwater block 14. these latest
discoveries will be followed by geological and engineering studies to assess
their reserve potential. the company, as operator, holds a 31percent interest
in block 14.
nigeria a second oil discovery  usan  was made in the non-operated
deepwater nigeria block opl 222, where the company holds a 30percent interest.
the prospect is approximately 60 miles offshore in a water depth greater than
2,000 feet. the company also confirmed its deepwater block opl 213 aparo oil
discovery (100percent company interest) with a successful appraisal well. the
aparo discovery shares a structure with an adjacent concession and will likely
become part of a joint oil development.
u.k. north sea the company announced first oil from alba extreme south, the
latest phase in the fields development in which chevrontexaco, as operator,
has a 21percent interest. the phased development expansion is expected
near-term to add more than 50,000 barrels of oil per day to alba production
(100percent field basis), offsetting existing production declines and
maintaining a plateau rate of up to 100,000 barrels of oil per day.
the caledonia field produced first oil in february 2003 with total production
expected to average about 10,000 barrels of crude oil per day during 2003.
chevrontexaco is operator with a 27percent interest.
tengiz following a delay in late 2002, tengizchevroil (tco)announced in
early 2003 that its partners had approved the detailed engineering and
construction of the second generation program and sour gas injection project.
these two projects are expected to increase tcos oil production capacity from
the current rate of about 285,000 barrels per day to between 430,000 and
500,000 barrels per day. current development plans call for the two projects to
be completed mid-2006. chevrontexaco has a 50percent ownership interest in
tco.
australia the peoples republic of china selected the north
west shelf venture, in which chevrontexaco has a one-sixth
interest, as the sole supplier of lng to the proposed guangdong
lng project in southern china. a conditional 25-year lng sale
and purchase agreement for more than 3.9 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas (equivalent to about 400million cubic feet per day)
was signed in october.
china the company entered into a unitization agreement with china national
offshore oil corp (cnooc)in october to jointly develop the bozhong field in
bohai bay. this is the first
unitization agreement between cnooc and a foreign partner. chevrontexaco holds
an approximate 16percent interest.
u.s. refining an expansion project to produce low sulfur motor gasoline
and diesel at the companys pascagoula, mississippi, refinery will become
operational during the first quarter of 2003.
chemicals in qatar, a world-scale olefins and polyolefins complex is
currently being commissioned. the facility is owned and operated by qatar
chemical company, a joint venture
between chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem), the companys 50
percent-owned petrochemical affiliate, and its partner qatar general petroleum.
cpchem has signed agreements to develop a second petrochemical complex in
qatar. the project will include a world-scale olefins facility, along with
derivatives units. final approvals are anticipated in mid-2004.
u.s. natural gas marketing the companys natural gas purchase and sale
agreements with its 26percent-owned dynegy affiliate were terminated at the
end of january 2003. under the transition arrangements, dynegy is to act in an
agency role for the company until the contracts become managed by chevrontexaco
natural gas  a new wholesale natural gas marketing unit that is expected to be
fully operational in april 2003. the contract terminations followed dynegys
decision to exit the gas trading and marketing business as part of a
companywide restructuring plan. see page fs-8 for information related to the
companys investment in dynegy.
results of operations
major business areas the following section presents the results of operations
for the companys business segments as well as for the departments and
companies managed at the corporate level. to aid in the understanding of
changes in segment income between periods, the discussion is in two parts -
first, on underlying trends and second, for special items that tended to
obscure these trends.

segment income in 2002 reflected significantly lower natural gas
realizations and an 11percent decrease in natural gas production. also
contributing to the earnings decline was lower liquids production, which
dropped 2percent from 2001 levels. lower earnings in 2001 from 2000 partially
resulted from significantly lower liquids realizations and lower oil-equivalent
production, offset by higher natural gas prices.
fs-4
table of contents
the average natural gas realization was $2.89 per thousand cubic feet in
2002, compared with $4.38 and $3.87 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. the
companys average 2002 u.s. liquids realization was $21.34 per barrel, compared
with $21.33 in 2001 and $25.61 in 2000.
net
oil-equivalent production averaged 1.002million barrels per day in 2002,
down 6percent from 2001 and 13percent from 2000. the net liquids component
for 2002 averaged 602,000 barrels per day, down 2percent from 2001 and 10
percent from 2000. net natural gas production averaged 2.4billion cubic feet
per day in 2002, down 11percent from 2001 and 17percent from 2000. the
companys 2002 production of crude oil and natural gas was constrained by
tropical storms that occurred in september and october in the gulf of mexico.
the storms reduced the companys 2002 oil-equivalent production by about 20,000
barrels per day, split equally between liquids and natural gas. the negative
impact on the companys net income was about $100million, including casualty
losses for the uninsured portion of property damages and associated costs. in
addition to the impacts of the storms on 2002 production, the lower
oil-equivalent production reflected normal field declines and the absence of
production from assets sold in 2001, partially offset by new and enhanced
production in the deepwater and other areas of the gulf of
mexico. the reductions in net natural gas production reflected, in part, steep
decline rates in areas of the gulf of mexico shelf that were brought onto
production in late 2000 and early 2001
to take advantage of a period of high natural gas prices.
special items during the three years included asset write-offs and revaluations
resulting mainly from asset impairments caused by write-downs in proved oil and
gas reserve quantities for various fields. in 2001, a $1.0billion impairment
was recorded for the midway sunset field in californias san joaquin valley,
upon determining lower-than-projected oil recovery from the fields
steam-injection process.

the earnings improvement in 2002 versus 2001 was marginally affected by a
combination of higher liquids realizations and natural gas production and lower
exploration and income tax
expense, offset in part by lower liquids production and natural gas
realizations and higher depreciation expense. the earnings decline in 2001
versus 2000 reflected lower average liquids realizations, the effect of which
was partially offset by a 3percent increase in oil-equivalent production and
higher natural gas prices.
the average liquids realization, including equity affiliates, was $23.06
per barrel in 2002, compared with $22.17 in 2001 and $26.04 in 2000. the
average natural gas realization was $2.14 per thousand cubic feet in 2002,
compared with $2.36 in 2001 and $2.09 in 2000.
daily net liquids production of 1.295million barrels in 2002 decreased
about 4percent from 1.345million barrels in 2001 and about 3percent from
1.330million barrels in 2000. production
decreases during 2002 in indonesia, primarily due to changes in contractual
terms, and nigeria, primarily due to opec constraints, were slightly offset by
increased production in kazakhstan. during 2001, increases in kazakhstan more
than offset lower volumes from indonesia.
net natural gas production of 1.971billion cubic feet per day
in 2002 was up 15percent from 2001 and more than 26percent from 2000. a
major factor in the 2002 production increase was a full year of new production
from the malampaya field in the
philippines. other geographic areas with production increases were kazakhstan,
nigeria and australia. these increases were slightly offset by lower production
from mature fields in canada.
in 2001, areas with production increases were kazakhstan, trinidad and tobago,
south korea and canada.
special-item charges in 2002 for asset write-offs and revaluations were
for asset impairments associated with write-downs in quantities of proved oil
and gas reserves for fields in africa and canada. special items in 2001
included a $247million impairment of the ll-652 field in venezuela, as
slower-than-expected reservoir repressurization resulted in a reduction in the
projected volumes of oil recoverable during the companys remaining contract
period of operation.

the u.s. refining, marketing and transportation segment loss in 2002 was
primarily the result of significantly lower refined product margins. results
for 2001 and 2000 included earnings of
$375million and $215million, respectively, associated with assets sold as a
condition of the merger, which included the companys equilon and motiva joint
ventures. in addition, sales volumes for operations that were retained
following the merger were down in
2002, primarily due to lower fuel oil trading activity and jet fuel sales
volumes. the decline in jet fuel sales volumes reflected the weakened travel
industry. the earnings increase in 2001 reflected
significantly higher gasoline sales margins  especially early in the year -
partially offset by weaker distillate sales margins and higher operating
expenses. higher sales volumes also contributed to the improvement in 2001.
excluding the companys share of sales volumes associated with assets sold
as a condition of the merger, refined products sales volumes of 1.610million
barrels per day in 2002 decreased
about 4percent from 2001 and about 2percent from 2000. the average u.s.
refined products sales realization of $34.33 per barrel in 2002 was down from
the 2001 average of $36.26 per barrel and down from $39.32 per barrel in 2000.
special items in 2002 included environmental remediation provisions and
asset write-downs for certain refining and marketing assets and a $57million
charge connected with a lawsuit
related to groundwater contamination caused by mtbe (methyl tertiary butyl
ether), an additive used in the manufacture of certain gasoline.

the international refining, marketing and transportation segment includes
the companys consolidated refining and marketing businesses, international
marine operations, international
supply and trading activities, and equity earnings of affiliates, primarily in
the asia-pacific region.
earnings in 2002 included foreign currency losses of $176million,
compared with gains of $23million and $107million in 2001 and 2000,
respectively. currency losses in 2002 occurred
mainly in brazil, new zealand, australia, south korea and the united kingdom.
income in most of the companys operating areas declined in 2002, with the
exception of latin america, where earnings increased. in the areas with lower
earnings, supply-demand fundamentals did not allow the immediate recovery of
rising crude oil costs in the marketplace, with product price changes lagging
those for feedstock costs. this condition reflected weak demand, stiff
competition and, in some areas, regulated price environments. lower refining
margins in 2002 reflected continued excess refining capacity in these regions.
the improved results in latin america for 2002 were primarily from reduced
operating expenses, offset slightly
by lower product margins and lower volumes. results from the companys
international shipping operations also declined in 2002, compared with 2001,
primarily on lower freight rates.
after excluding the effects of foreign currency gains in both 2001 and
2000 for the segment as a whole, results for 2001 were significantly improved
because of improved marketing margins,
particularly early in the year. partially offsetting the marketing improvement
were higher operating costs and somewhat lower refining margins.
total international refined products sales volumes were 2.258million
barrels per day in 2002, down about 8percent from 2.454million in 2001 and
about 10percent from 2.521million in
2000. weak economic conditions continued to dampen demand in 2002.
the special item amount in 2002 was for a write-down of the companys
investment in its publicly traded caltex australia affiliate to its fair value,
as a result of protracted weak business conditions in the australian downstream
markets. the write-down was based on managements judgment that the decline in
the investments fair value below its carrying value was deemed to be other
than temporary. special items in 2001 included the impairment of refinery
assets in central america. the special item asset write-offs and revaluations
in 2000 included impairments of marketing assets in eastern europe and central
america.

chemicals includes the companys oronite subsidiary, the petrochemicals
business prior to its contribution to cpchem in july 2000 and equity earnings
in cpchem from that date. results
for all years reflect a protracted period of generally weak demand for
commodity chemicals and industry over-capacity. results for both cpchem and
the companys oronite subsidiary improved in 2002 primarily on lower feedstock
and utility costs.
special items in 2001 and 2000 included write-downs of the cpchem puerto
rico operations. there were no special items in 2002.

all other consists of the companys equity interest in dynegy, coal mining
operations, power and gasification ventures, worldwide cash management and debt
financing activities, corporate
administrative costs, insurance operations, real estate activities, and
technology companies.
aside from the effect of special items, the change between 2001 and 2002
reflected primarily the favorable effect of lower corporate charges, including
an increase in favorable tax adjustments of $245million and lower net interest
expense of $71million, offset, in part, by a decline in the companys share of
dynegys operating results.
during 2002, dynegy results were severely affected by a downturn in the
energy merchant sector, which was characterized by lower liquidity levels,
reduced power prices and credit concerns. special items in 2002 included
$2.306billion related to dynegy, composed of $1.626billion for the write-down
of the companys investment in dynegy common and preferred stock to their
estimated fair values and $680million for the companys share of items dynegy
classified as special for asset write-downs and revaluations and a loss on an
asset sale. refer to page fs-8 for further information relating to the
companys investments in dynegy.

special items by income statement category are shown to assist in the
explanation of changes in those categories between periods. in addition to the
effects of special items shown in the table, separately disclosed on the face

of investments in equity affiliates and the extraordinary after-tax loss on the
sale of assets mandated as a condition of the merger. these matters are
discussed elsewhere in this discussion and in note 2 to the consolidated

explanations are provided below of variations between years for the
amounts in the table above  after consideration of the effects of special
items  as well as for other income statement
categories.
sales and other operating revenues were $99billion in 2002, compared with
$104billion in 2001 and $117billion in 2000. revenues from worldwide
upstream operations decreased 27percent on lower prices for natural gas,
particularly in the united states. sales volumes of natural gas were also down
in the united states. downstream sales and other operating revenues were about
6percent higher in 2002, primarily on higher prices for refined products in
the fourth quarter of 2002. total sales and other operating revenues in 2001
declined from 2000 on lower
average realizations for crude oil and refined products.
income from equity affiliates declined in 2002, reflecting the absence of
earnings from assets sold as a condition of the merger and lower earnings from
dynegy. equity income increased marginally in 2001 on the strength of improved
earnings for equilon, motiva and dynegy, partially offset by lower earnings for
tco and lg-caltex and by larger losses from cpchem.
other income decreased in 2002 as a result of lower interest income,
changes in net foreign exchange gains and losses, and net gains and losses from
asset sales.
foreign currency losses in 2002 were $43million, compared with gains of
$191million and $182million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. in 2002, net
gains from fluctuations of the u.s. dollar against the argentine peso, which
began to float against the dollar during the year, were more than offset by
losses related to currencies of most other countries in which the company has
significant operations.
purchased crude oil and products costs of $57billion in 2002 were 5
percent lower than 2001  primarily due to lower natural gas prices and sales
volumes  and about 18percent lower than 2000  primarily due to lower crude
oil and natural gas prices and lower natural gas volumes.

table of contents
operating,
selling, general and administrative expenses benefited from
merger synergy savings, which were substantially offset by increases related to
pension expense, payroll and other employee benefits.
exploration expenses were $0.6billion in 2002, compared with $1.0billion
in 2001 and $0.9billion in 2000. in 2002, well write-offs and other
exploration expenses were $358million and $90
million lower, respectively, compared with 2001. the reduced expenses in 2002
reflect, in part, the high-grading of the companys exploration portfolio
following the merger. in 2001, well write-offs were $184million higher
compared with 2000, which more than offset declines in other exploration
expenses.
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased for
international upstream operations in 2002, but this effect was slightly offset
by lower expenses in the u.s. upstream segment. in 2001, the absence of
charges relating to chemicals assets contributed to the cpchem joint venture
that was formed in mid-2000 were essentially offset by increases in amounts for
other segments.
interest and debt expense was $0.6billion in 2002, compared with $0.8
billion in 2001 and $1.1billion in 2000. the declines between periods
primarily reflected lower average interest rates
on debt.
income tax expense for each year corresponded to effective tax rates of 45
percent in each year after taking into account the effect of special items. see
also note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements.
information related to investment in dynegy inc.
chevrontexaco owns approximately 26percent of the common stock of its dynegy
affiliate, an energy merchant engaged in power generation, natural gas liquids
and regulated energy delivery. the company also holds $1.5billion aggregate
principal amount of dynegy preferred stock, which is due to be redeemed at par
in november 2003.
as a result of a collapse of the u.s. merchant-energy sector during 2002,
dynegy experienced a significant reduction in the value of its common stock, as
well as a marked reduction in available liquidity. this resulted in limited
access by dynegy to the capital markets and an increasing use of its assets as
collateral for its liabilities. dynegy is also the subject of regulatory
investigations and is the defendant in a number of lawsuits seeking large
damage amounts. during 2002, debt ratings of dynegy securities were downgraded
below investment-grade level. dynegys ability to meet its obligations in a
timely fashion depends in part on completion of its announced plans for
recapitalization and restructuring of the business. the company does not
currently anticipate that dynegy will have sufficient liquidity to redeem the
preferred stock when due.
chevrontexacos net income for 2002 included special charges of $2.306
billion related to dynegy. these charges were composed of $1.626billion for
the companys write-down of the
combined investment in dynegy common and preferred stock, and $680million for
the companys share of dynegys own special items during the year. the
write-down of the companys investments in dynegy during 2002 was required
because the declines in the fair values of the common and preferred stock
investments below their respective carrying values were deemed to be other than
temporary.
additional write-downs of the investments in dynegy would be required to
the extent the fair values of the dynegy securities at the end of any
subsequent period were below their respective
carrying values at that time, and the declines in value were deemed to be other
than temporary. in the event dynegy records losses in future periods, the
companys share of those losses
would be recorded first against any remaining carrying value of the common
stock and then against the carrying value of the preferred stock.
at december31, 2002, the remaining book value of the companys investment
in dynegy was $347million  composed of $300million for the preferred stock
and $47million for the common stock. the market value of chevrontexacos share
of dynegy common stock was $114million, based on equivalent closing market
prices. no quoted market price exists for the preferred
stock. refer to dynegy preferred stock investment on page fs-12 for a
description of the methodology used to estimate the fair value at december31,
2002.
for the common and preferred stock, if future declines in the fair value
are deemed other than temporary, a charge would be recorded against income.
however, the effect of a temporary
decline, or any increase, in fair value of the preferred stock would be
recorded in other comprehensive income and would be recognized in income at
the time of redemption or disposition of the security, or in the event of a
further other-than-temporary
decline in its fair value.
at december31, 2002, the carrying value of the common stock investment
was approximately $500million below the companys proportionate amount of
dynegy net equity. this difference will be accreted to income over the
estimated economic life of the underlying net assets in the absence of any
future impairment of the investment.
at the request of dynegy, its independent accountant is conducting a
re-audit of the
1999-2001 financial statements, which has resulted thus far in certain
restatements of prior periods. to date, chevrontexacos share of the known
restatements has not been material and, accordingly, prior periods in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been restated. upon
conclusion of the audit, the independent accountants will perform reviews of
the 2002 quarterly financial statements. the results of these audits and
reviews may require further restatements by dynegy. chevrontexaco will evaluate
the effects on its consolidated financial statements at that time.
liquidity and capital resources
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3.8billion and $3.2
billion at december31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. cash provided by operating
activities in 2002 was $9.9billion, compared with $11.5billion in 2001 and
$13.5billion in 2000. the 2002 decline in cash provided by operating
activities mainly reflected lower earnings in the u.s. upstream and worldwide
downstream businesses. cash provided by asset sales was $2.3billion in 2002,
$0.3billion in 2001 and $1.2billion in 2000. in february 2002, the company
received proceeds of $2.2billion, including dividends due, from the
ftc-mandated sale of the companys investments in equilon and motiva. in 2002,
these proceeds and cash provided by operating activities generated
sufficient funds for the companys capital and exploratory expenditure program,
the payment of dividends to stockholders, and a reduction in overall debt
levels.
fs-8
table of contents
dividends chevrontexaco made payments of $2.991billion, $2.858billion
and $2.789billion for dividends or distributions for common stock, preferred
stock and minority interests in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
debt, lease and minority interest obligations chevrontexacos total debt and
capital lease obligations were $16.3billion at december31, 2002, down from
$17.4billion at year-end 2001. the company also had minority interest
obligations of $303million, up from
$283million at december31, 2001.
the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year,
consisting primarily of commercial paper and the current portion of long-term
debt, totaled $9.5billion at december31,
2002, down from $11.6billion at the end of 2001. of these totals, $4.1billion
and $3.2billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period,
respectively. settlement of these obligations is
not expected to require the use of working capital in 2003, as the company has
the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to
refinance them on a long-term basis. the
companys practice has been to continually refinance its commercial paper,
maintaining levels it believes appropriate.
at year-end 2002, chevrontexaco had $4.1billion in committed credit
facilities with various major banks, which permit the refinancing of short-term
obligations on a long-term basis. these
facilities support commercial paper borrowings and also can be used for general
credit requirements. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities
during the year or at
year-end 2002.
during 2002, the company increased the total value of shelf
registrations on file with the securities and exchange commission (sec)by $2.0
billion, to $4.8billion. at december31, 2002, the company had three existing
effective shelf registrations on file with the sec that together would permit
additional registered debt offerings up to an aggregate of $2.8billion of
securities.
the company issued $2.0billion of 3.5percent guaranteed notes due 2007
under a shelf registration in 2002. the proceeds from this issue are expected
to be used to retire commercial
paper. repayments of long-term debt in 2002 included $250million of texaco
north sea u.k. notes, $285million of texaco capital inc. bonds, $192million
of new zealand debt, $120million of philippine debt, $114 of south african debt
and $100million of chevrontexaco corporation 8.11percent notes. the change in
long-term debt during 2002 also included a noncash reduction of $100million in
the company-guaranteed employee stock ownership plan (esop)debt.
in february 2003, the company redeemed $200million of texaco capital inc.
bonds originally due in 2033. under a shelf registration also in february, the
company issued $750million of
3.375percent bonds due in february 2008. the company plans to use the proceeds
from this issuance to pay down outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
chevrontexacos senior debt is rated aa by standard and poors corporation
and aa2 by moodys investor service. bonds issued by texaco inc. are rated aa3.
chevrontexacos u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poors and
prime 1 by moodys, and the companys canadian commercial paper is rated r-1
(middle)by dominion bond rating service. all of these ratings denote
high-quality, investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of
operations, the capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from
asset dispositions. the company believes
it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements,
and during periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow
margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, it has the flexibility to
increase borrowings and/or modify capital-spending plans to continue paying the
common stock dividend and maintain the companys high-quality debt ratings.
pension obligations based on the expected changes in plan asset values and
pension obligations in 2003, the company does not believe any significant
funding of its pension plans will be required during the year. additional
funding may ultimately be required in subsequent periods if investment returns
are insufficient to offset increases in the plans obligations. refer also to
the
discussion of pension accounting in application of critical accounting
policies beginning on page fs-15.
capital and exploratory expenditures for 2002 totaled $9.3billion,
including the companys equity share of affiliates expenditures. capital and
exploratory expenditures were $12.0billion in 2001 and $9.5billion in 2000.
the companys equity share of affiliates expenditures, which did not require
cash outlays by the company, were $1.4billion, $1.7billion and $1.2billion
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. expenditures of $6.3billion in 2002 for
exploration and production activities represented 68percent of total outlays
in 2002, compared with 59percent in 2001 and 66percent in 2000.
international exploration and production spending of $4.4billion was 70
percent of worldwide exploration and production expenditures in 2002, compared
with 66percent in 2001 and 62percent in 2000, reflecting the companys
continuing focus on international exploration and production activities.
expenditures in 2002 included lower additional investments in equity affiliates
than in 2001, reflecting the absence of the companys share of expenditures in
its equilon and motiva investments, which were sold as a condition of the
merger. the 2001 expenditures included additional investments in tco and
dynegy, including the purchase of $1.5billion of dynegy preferred stock.
the company estimates 2003 capital and exploratory expenditures will be
$8.5billion, which is about 8percent lower than expenditures in 2002.
included in this amount is about $1.6billion in affiliates expenditures.
about $6.4billion, or 75percent of the total, is budgeted for exploration and
production activities, with $4.7billion of that outside the united states.
worldwide exploration and production expenditures will target the most
promising exploratory prospects in nigeria, angola and deepwater gulf of mexico
and major development projects in kazakhstan,
venezuela and africa. worldwide downstream spending is estimated to be $1.3
billion, with about $1.1billion of the amount on refining and marketing and
$200million on transportation projects. investments in chemicals are budgeted
at $300million. estimates for power and related businesses are $300million,
down from about $600million in 2002. the remaining $200million is primarily
for emerging technologies and information technology infrastructure.

financial ratios
current ratio  current assets divided by current liabilities. generally, two
items adversely affect chevrontexacos current ratio, but in the companys
opinion do not affect its liquidity. first, current assets in all years
included inventories valued on a lifo basis, which at year-end 2002 were lower
than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by
nearly $1.6billion. second, the company benefits from lower interest rates
available on short-term debt by continually refinancing its commercial paper;
however, the companys proportionately large amount of short-term debt keeps
its current ratio at relatively low levels.
interest coverage ratio  income before income tax expense, plus interest
and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, divided by
before-tax interest costs. chevrontexacos interest coverage ratio was lower in
2002, primarily due to lower before-tax income partially offset by lower
interest expense as a result of lower interest rates.
debt ratio  total debt divided by total debt plus equity. this ratio was
34percent at december31, 2002, compared to 33.9percent a year earlier.

*the above amounts exclude indemnifications of contingencies associated with the sales of the companys interests in equilon and motiva.
at december31, 2002, the company and its subsidiaries provided
guarantees, either directly or indirectly, of $1.038billion for notes and
other contractual obligations of affiliated companies and $806million for
third parties, as discussed by major category below. there are no amounts being
carried as liabilities for the companys obligations under these guarantees.
of the guarantees issued in regard to affiliates operations, $775million
relates to borrowings for capital projects or general corporate purposes. these
guarantees were undertaken to achieve lower interest rates and generally cover
the construction period of the capital projects. approximately 50percent of
the amounts guaranteed will expire within the 20032006 period, with the
remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. under the terms of the
guarantees, the company would be required to perform should an affiliate be in
default of its loan terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. there are
no provisions for recourse to third parties, and no assets are held as
collateral for these guarantees.
the company provides guarantees of $263million relating to obligations in
connection with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of its
cogeneration affiliates. under the terms of these guarantees, the company may
be required to make payments under certain conditions if the affiliates do not
perform under the agreements. there are no provisions for recourse to third
parties, and no assets are held as collateral for these pricing guarantees.
guarantees of $437million have been issued in regard to obligations of
third parties, including approximately $100million of construction loans to
host governments in the companys international upstream operations. the
remaining guarantees of $337million were provided principally as conditions of
sale of the companys interest in certain operations, to provide a source of
liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with company marketing
programs. no amounts of the companys obligations under these guarantees are
recorded as liabilities. approximately half of the total amounts guaranteed
will expire in 2003, with the remainder expiring after 2007. the company would
be required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in
default of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts
disclosed. approximately $200million of the guarantees have recourse
provisions, which enable the company to recover any payments made under the
terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties
assets.
guarantees of $369million relate to equilon debt and leases. in
connection with the february 2002 disposition of its interest in equilon, shell
oil company agreed to indemnify the company against any claims arising out of
these guarantees. the company has not recorded a liability for these
guarantees. guarantees on approximately 30percent of the debt and leases will
expire within the 20032007 period, with the guarantees of the remaining
amounts expiring by 2024.
indemnities the company also provided certain indemnities of contingent
liabilities of equilon and motiva to shell oil com-
fs-10
table of contents
pany and saudi refining inc.
in connection with the february 2002 sale of the companys interests in those
investments. the indemnities cover contingent general liabilities, certain
contingent environmental liabilities and liabilities associated with the unocal
patent litigation. the company would be required to perform should the
contingent general liabilities become actual liabilities within 18months of
the sale and could be required to make maximum future payments of $300million.
the company has not recorded liabilities for these contingencies. there are no
recourse provisions enabling recovery of any amounts from third parties nor are
any assets held as collateral. within five years of the february 2002 sale, at
the buyers option, the company also may be required to purchase certain assets
from shell oil company for their net book value, as determined at the time of
the companys purchase.
the indemnities pertaining to the contingent environmental liabilities
relate to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva
joint ventures and environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation
of equilon and motiva or that occurred during the periods of chevrontexacos
ownership interests in the joint ventures. in general, the environmental
conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen
prior to december12, 2001. claims relating to equilon must be asserted no
later than february13, 2009, and claims relating to motiva must be asserted no
later than february13, 2012. under the terms of the indemnities, there is no
maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. the company has not
recorded any liabilities for possible claims under these indemnities. the
amounts indemnified are to be net of amounts recovered from insurance carriers
and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or motiva prior to
september30, 2001, for any applicable incident. the company holds no assets as
collateral. during 2002, the company made no payments under the above
indemnities.
securitization in other off-balance-sheet arrangements, the company
securitizes certain retail and trade accounts receivable in its u.s. downstream
business through the use of qualifying special purpose entities (spes). at
december31, 2002, approximately $1billion, representing about 11percent of
chevrontexacos total current accounts receivable balance, were securitized.
chevrontexacos total estimated financial exposure under these arrangements at
december31, 2002, was approximately $75million. these arrangements have the
effect of accelerating chevron-texacos collection of the securitized amounts.
in the event of the spes experiencing major defaults in the collection of
receivables, chevrontexaco believes that it would have no loss exposure
connected with third-party investments in these securitization arrangements.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput
agreements and take-or-pay agreements. the company and its subsidiaries have
entered into long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments,
throughput agreements, and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to
suppliers financing arrangements. these agreements typically provide goods and
services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum
products to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business.
the aggregate amounts of estimated payments that will be required over the life
of the agreements is approximately $9billion. the most significant take-or-pay
agreement calls for the company to purchase approximately 55,000 barrels per
day of refined products from an equity affiliate refiner in thailand. this
purchase agreement is in conjunction with the financing of a refinery owned by
the affiliate, which is due in 2009. the future estimated commitments under
this contract are: 2003  $800million; 2004  $800million; 2005  $900
million; 2006  $900million; 2007  $900million; 2008 and 2009  $1.8
billion.

1 includes $4.110billion of short-term debt that the company expects to continually refinance and will not have to repay until after 2007.
2 includes guarantees of $385million of lesop debt, $25million due in 2004 and $360million due after 2007.
minority interests preferred shares issued by subsidiary companies to
third parties are accounted for as minority interest. mvp production inc., a
subsidiary, has variable rate cumulative preferred shares of $75million owned
by one minority holder. the shares are voting and are redeemable in 2003.
texaco capital llc, a wholly owned finance subsidiary, has issued $65million
of deferred preferred shares. dividends of $59million, equivalent to an
interest rate of 7.17percent compounded annually, will be paid at the
redemption date of february28, 2005, unless earlier redemption occurs.
financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instruments chevrontexaco is exposed to market risks
related to the volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and
refinery feedstock prices. the company uses derivative commodity instruments to
manage its exposure to price volatility on a small portion of its activity,
including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase or
sale of crude oil, feedstock purchases for company refineries, crude oil and
refined products inventories, and fixed-price contracts to sell natural gas and
natural gas liquids.
chevrontexaco also uses derivative commodity instruments for trading
purposes, and the results of this activity were not
fs-11
table of contents
material to the companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2002.
the companys positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal risk control group to ensure compliance with the companys risk
management policy that has been approved by the companys board of directors.
the derivative instruments used in the companys risk management and
trading activities consist mainly of futures contracts traded on the new york
mercantile exchange and the international petroleum exchange, crude oil and
natural gas swap contracts, options, and other derivative products entered into
principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies.
virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal
sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet
with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. fair values are derived
principally from market quotes and other independent third-party quotes.
the aggregate effect on derivative activity of a hypothetical 15percent
change in prices for natural gas, crude oil and petroleum products would not be
material to the companys financial position, net income or cash flows. the
hypothetical loss on the related commodity contracts was estimated by
calculating the cash value of the contracts as the difference between the
hypothetical and contract delivery prices, multiplied by the contract amounts.
foreign currency the company enters into forward exchange contracts,
generally with terms of 180days or less, to manage some of its foreign
currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase
transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange contracts
are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting
gains and losses reflected in income.
the aggregate effect on foreign currency swaps of a hypothetical adverse
change of 10percent to year-end exchange rates (a weakening of the u.s.
dollar) would not be material to the companys financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
interest rates the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms
of the swaps, net cash settlements are based on the difference between
fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed
notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas
interest rate swaps relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt
are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting
gains and losses reflected in income. during 2002, no new swaps were initiated
in connection with debt issues in the year. at year-end 2002, the weighted
average maturity of interest rate swaps was approximately 5.6years.
a hypothetical 10percent increase in interest rates upon the interest
rate swaps would cause the fair value of the receive fixed swaps to decline.
the aggregate effect of these changes would not be material to the companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
dynegy preferred stock investment the companys $1.5billion investment in
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock of dynegy was carried at an
estimated fair value of $300million at december31, 2002. because the
investment is not publicly traded, an estimate of its fair value was required.
this estimate was based on a comparison to the pricing of marketable dynegy
bonds and an added factor for an estimated liquidity discount. other
methodologies could have resulted in a higher or lower fair-value estimation.
see also page fs-8 for further information about dynegy.
transactions with related parties
chevrontexaco enters into a number of business arrangements with related
parties, principally its equity affiliates. these arrangements include
long-term supply or offtake agreements. in the united states, long-term
agreements have been in place with dynegy for the purchase of substantially all
natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by the company in the united
states, excluding alaska, and the supply of natural gas and natural gas liquids
feedstocks to the companys u.s. refineries and chemicals plants. in 2003,
chevrontexaco and dynegy agreed to terminate the natural gas sale and purchase
agreements at the end of january 2003. internationally, there are long-term
purchase agreements in place with the companys refining affiliate in thailand.
see page fs-11 for further discussion. management believes the foregoing
agreements and others have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that
would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.
litigation and other contingencies
unocal patent litigation chevron, texaco and four other oil companies
(refiners)filed suit in 1995 contesting the validity of a patent (393
patent) granted to unocal corporation (unocal) for certain reformulated
gasoline blends. chevrontexaco sells reformulated gasolines in california in
certain months of the year. in march 2000, the u.s. court of appeals for the
federal circuit upheld a september 1998 district court decision that unocals
patent was valid and enforceable and assessed damages of 5.75 cents per gallon
for gasoline produced during the summer of 1996, which infringed on the claims
of the patent. in february 2001, the u.s. supreme court concluded it would not
review the lower courts ruling, and the case was sent back to the district
court for an accounting of all infringing gasoline produced after august1,
1996. the district court has now ruled that the per-gallon damages awarded by
the jury are limited to infringement that occurs in california only.
additionally, the u.s. patent and trademark office (uspto)granted two
petitions by the refiners to re-examine the validity of unocals 393 patent
and has now twice rejected all of the claims in the 393 patent. the district
court judge requested further briefing and advised that she would not enter a
final judgment in this case until the uspto had completed its re-examination of
the 393 patent. during 2002, the uspto also rejected the validity of another
unocal patent, the 126 patent, which could affect a larger share of u.s.
gasoline production. separately, the ftc has issued an administrative complaint
alleging that unocals conduct in this matter represented an unfair method of
competition, which may make unocals patents unenforceable.
unocal has obtained additional patents that could affect a larger share of
u.s. gasoline production. chevrontexaco believes these additional patents are
invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. the companys financial exposure
in the event of unfavorable conclusions to the patent litigation and regulatory
reviews may include royalties, plus interest, for production of gasoline that
is proved to have infringed the patents. the competitive and financial effects
on the companys refining and marketing operations, while presently
indeterminable, could be material. chevrontexaco has been accruing in the
normal course of business any future estimated liability for potential
infringement of the 393 patent covered by the 1998 trial courts ruling. in
2000, prior to the merger, chevron and texaco made payments to
fs-12
table of contents
unocal totaling approximately $30million for the original court ruling,
including interest and fees.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the company
to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior
release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the company or
other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites including, but
not limited to: superfund sites and refineries, oil fields, service stations,
terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. the
following table displays the annual changes to the companys before-tax
environmental remediation reserves, including those for superfund sites. in
2002, the company recorded additional provisions for estimated remediation
costs at refined products marketing sites and various closed or divested
facilities in the united states.

under provisions of the superfund law, the environmental protection agency
(epa)has designated chevrontexaco a potentially responsible party, or has
otherwise involved the company, in the remediation of 420 hazardous waste
sites. the company made provisions or payments in 2002 and prior years for 293
of these sites. no single site is expected to result in a material liability
for the company. for the remaining sites, investigations are not yet at a stage
where the company is able to quantify a probable liability or determine a range
of reasonably possible exposures. the superfund law provides for joint and
several liability for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa
and other regulatory agencies to require chevrontexaco to assume other
potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are
not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial
position or liquidity. remediation reserves at year-end 2002, 2001 and 2000 for
superfund sites were $95million, $62million and $73million, respectively.
another issue involving the company is the petroleum industrys use of
methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive and its potential
environmental impact through seepage into groundwater. along with other oil
companies, the company is a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of
the chemical mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines. these actions may require
the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of
prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and
claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be
filed in the future. the companys ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits
and claims is not currently determinable, but could be material to net income
in any one period. chevrontexaco has worked to reduce the use of mtbe in
gasoline it manufactures in the united states. the state of california has
directed that mtbe be phased out of the manufacturing process by the end of
2003, and the company intends to comply with this mandate. by may 2003, the
company plans to market branded gasoline that uses ethanol as an oxygenate
instead of mtbe in southern california and will complete the changeover in
northern california later in the year.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional
liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental remediation relating to
past operations. these future costs are indeterminable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent
of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent
to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. while the amount of
future costs may be material to the companys results of operations in the
period in which they are recognized, the company does not expect these costs
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such
expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the companys
competitive position relative to other petroleum or chemicals companies.
the company maintains additional reserves for dismantlement, abandonment
and restoration of its worldwide oil and gas and coal properties at the end of
their productive lives. many of these costs are related to environmental
issues. expense provisions are recognized on a unit-of-production basis. the
reserves balance at year-end 2002 was $2.3billion and is included in
accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization in the companys
consolidated balance sheet. please refer to pages fs-16 to fs-17 for information relating
to the companys 2003 implementation of financial accounting standards board
(fasb)standard no.143, accounting for asset
retirement obligations.
for the
companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals
facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be
required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives, unless a
decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made.
see environmental matters on page fs-14 for additional information
related to environmental matters.
income taxes the company estimates its income tax expense and liabilities
annually. these liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual
taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for
which income taxes have been estimated. the u.s. federal income tax liabilities
have been settled through 1996 for chevrontexaco (formerly chevron), through
1993 for chevrontexaco global energy inc. (formerly caltex), and through 1991
for texaco. california franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991
for chevron and through 1987 for texaco. settlement of open tax years, as well
as tax issues in other countries where the company conducts its businesses, is
not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position
or liquidity of the company, and in the opinion of management, adequate
provision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all years under
examination or subject to future examination.
equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership
agreements may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in
estimated oil and gas reserves. these activities, individually or together, may
result in gains or losses that could be material to earnings in any given
period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrontexacos interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum
reserve at elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in
these zones were owned by the u.s. department of energy. a wide range of
estimates exist for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
chevrontexaco currently estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability
at approximately $200million. at the same time, a possible maximum net amount
that could be owed to chevrontexaco is
fs-13
table of contents
estimated at about $50million. the
timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this range of estimates
are uncertain.
global operations areas in which the company and its affiliates have major
operations include the united states of america, canada, australia, the united
kingdom, norway, denmark, france, partitioned neutral zone between kuwait and
saudi arabia, republic of congo, democratic republic of congo, angola, nigeria,
chad, equatorial guinea, indonesia, papua new guinea, china, thailand,
venezuela, argentina, brazil, colombia, trinidad and tobago, south korea, the
philippines, singapore, and south africa. the companys tco affiliate operates
in kazakhstan. the companys cpchem affiliate manufactures and markets a wide
range of petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis, with manufacturing
facilities in existence or under construction in the united states, puerto
rico, singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and belgium.
the companys dynegy affiliate has operations in the united states, canada, and
the united kingdom and other european countries.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be
affected by other changing economic, regulatory and political environments in
the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. for
instance, in december 2002, caltex oil (sa)(pty) limited (caltex oil (sa))
announced the signing of a shareholders agreement with a south african
consortium of black economic empowerment partners. the agreement is intended to
ultimately provide the consortium a 25percent equity interest in all aspects
of caltexs operations in south africa. it is uncertain as to whether any
additional actions will be taken by host governments in other countries to
increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned
businesses.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls
and taxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten
the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those
countries. internal unrest or strained relations between a host government and
the company or other governments may affect the companys operations. those
developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related
operations and results and are carefully considered by management when
evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.
suspended wells the company also suspends the costs of exploratory wells
pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the related oil
and gas fields. the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on
the results of future drilling activity and/or development decisions. if the
company decides not to continue development, the costs of these wells are
expensed. at december31, 2002, the company had $450million of suspended
exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, a decrease of
$238million from 2001 and $332million from 2000.
other contingencies chevrontexaco receives claims from and submits claims
to customers, trading partners, u.s. federal, state and local regulatory
bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers, and suppliers. the amounts of
these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and may
take lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their
operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure
assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve
competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together,
may result in gains or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are
subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations. these regulatory requirements continue to increase in
both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of
the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company
operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary
course of business. in addition to the costs for environmental protection
associated with its ongoing operations and products, the company may incur
expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned
facilities and at third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company.
an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at
non-chevrontexaco sites where company products have been handled or disposed
of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities
and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were
considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative and/or remedial
work to meet current standards. using definitions and guidelines established by
the american petroleum institute, chevrontexaco estimated its worldwide
environmental spending in 2002 at $1.324billion for its consolidated
companies. included in these expenditures were $399million of environmental
capital expenditures and $925million of costs associated with the control and
abatement of hazardous substances and pollutants from ongoing operations.
for 2003, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated
at $458million. these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of
complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously
contaminated sites.
application of critical accounting policies
in may 2002, the sec issued a proposed rule: disclosure in managements
discussion and analysis about the application of critical accounting policies.
although the sec had not issued a final rule by mid-march 2003, the following
discussion has been prepared on the basis of the guidelines in the sec rule
proposal.
if adopted as proposed, the rule would require disclosures connected with
estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies. however, such
discussion would be limited to critical accounting estimates, or those that
management believes meet two criteria in the proposal: first, the accounting
estimate must require a company to make assumptions about matters that are
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made. second, different
estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting
estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are
reasonably likely to occur from period to period, must have a material impact
on the presentation of the companys financial condition, changes in financial
condition or results of operations.
beside estimates that meet the critical
estimate criteria, the company makes many other accounting estimates in
preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates,
whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results
can occur as circumstances
fs-14
table of contents
change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates not
deemed critical under the sec rule proposal.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment
under the accounting rules that the future realization of the associated tax
benefits be more likely than not. another example is the estimation of oil
and gas reserves under sec rules that require ... geological and engineering
data (that)demonstrate with reasonable certainty (reserves)to be recoverable
in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. refer
to table v reserve quantity information on pages fs-51 and fs-52 for the
changes in these estimates for the three years ending december31, 2002, and to
table vii changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows from proved reserves on page fs-54 for estimates of proved-reserve
values for each year-end 20002002, which were based on year-end prices at the
time.
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements includes a description of
the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities. the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are
important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.
the upcoming discussion of the critical accounting policy for impairment
of property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates includes
reference to conditions under which downward revisions of proved reserve
quantities could result in impairments of oil and gas properties.
the commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in
this discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
related to estimates, uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting
standards. significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs-25. the development and selection
of accounting estimates, including those deemed critical, and the associated
disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit
committee of the board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates made by
the company are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of
pension plan expense and the requirements for funding the companys major
pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical
assumptions are the rate of return on pension plan assets and the discount rate
applied to pension plan obligations. for other postretirement employee benefit
(opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance for
qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical assumptions in
determining opeb expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations
and the assumed health care cost-trend rates used in the calculation of benefit
obligations.
note 19 to the consolidated financial statements on page fs-39 includes
information for the three years ending december31, 2002, on the components of
pension and opeb expense and the underlying discount rate assumptions as well
as the funded status for the companys pension plans at the end of 2002 and
2001.
to determine the estimate of long-term rate of return on pension assets,
the company employs a process that incorporates actual historical asset-class
returns and an assessment of expected future performance, which takes into
consideration external actuarial advice. for example, at december31, 2002, the
estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets, which accounted
for the majority of the companys pension plan assets, was 7.8percent, as
compared with rates of 8.8percent and 10.0percent at the end of 2001 and
2000, respectively. the year-end market-related value of the u.s. pension plan
assets used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market
values in the preceding three months, as opposed to the maximum allowable
period of five years under the pension accounting rules. management considers
the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions
from day-to-day market volatility and yet still be contemporaneous to the end
of the year.
the discount rate used in the determination of pension benefit obligations
and pension expense is based on high-quality fixed income investment interest
rates. at december31, 2002, the company calculated the u.s. pension
obligations using a 6.8percent discount rate. the discount rates used at the
ends of 2001 and 2000 were 7.3percent and 7.5percent, respectively.
an increase in the expected return on pension plan assets or the discount
rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa. total pension expense
for 2002 was $457million. as an indication of interest-rate sensitivity to the
determination of pension expense, a 1percent increase in the expected return
on assets of the companys main u.s. pension plan, which accounted for a
significant majority of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced
total pension plan expense for 2002 by approximately $30million. a 1percent
increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced total
benefit plan expense by approximately $130million. the actual rates of return
on plan assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because
of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial markets.
based on the expected changes in pension plan asset values and pension
obligations in 2003, the company does not believe any significant funding of
the pension plans will be required during the year. for the u.s. plans, this
determination was made in accordance with the minimum funding standard of the
employee retirement income security act (erisa).
pension expense is included on the consolidated statement of income in
operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses and
applies to all business segments. depending upon the funding status of the
different plans, either a long-term prepaid asset or long-term liability is
recorded for plans with overfunding or underfunding, respectively. any unfunded
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of recorded liabilities is recorded in
other comprehensive income. see note 19 to the consolidated financial
statements on page fs-40 for the pension-related balance sheet effects at the
end of 2002 and 2001.
for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2002 was $199million and was
also recorded as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative
expenses in all business segments. the discount rate applied to the companys
opeb obligations at december31, 2002, was 6.75percent  the same discount
rate used for u.s. pension obligations. the assumed health care cost-trend
rates used to calculate opeb obligations at december31, 2002, start with a 12
percent cost increase over the previous year in 2002, gradually dropping over
five years to a long-term ultimate rate-increase assumption of 4.5percent for
2007 and thereafter. the 12percent rate assumption for 2002 was provided by
external consultants. the 4.5percent rate-increase assumption and duration to
reach that rate is a company estimate.
as an indication of discount-rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb
expense in 2002, the impact of a 1percent increase in the discount rate for
the companys main u.s. opeb plan, which accounted for the significant majority
of the companywide opeb obligation, would not have been significant. the
sensitivity of opeb expense to discount rate changes may vary in
fs-15

the future
depending on the combination of factors that enter into the determination of
opeb expense in any one period.
impairment of property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates
the company assesses its property, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such indicators include
changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and for
oil and gas properties significant downward revisions of estimated proved
reserve quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future
undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is
recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its fair value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves
management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as future commodity
prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating
expenses, production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market
supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals
and refined products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are
based on assumptions that are consistent with the companys business plans and
long-term investment decisions.
the amount and income statement classification of major impairments of
pp&e for the three years ending december31, 2002, are included in the
commentary on the business segments elsewhere in this discussion, as well as in
note 4 to the consolidated financial statements on page fs-28. an estimate as
to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in the impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable,
given the broad range of the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions
involved in the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions might
have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas
unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other
assets to become impaired.
investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the
equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity
investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment
falls below the companys carrying value. when such a decline is deemed to be
other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference
between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value at the
time. in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than
temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the
decline the investees financial performance and the companys ability and
intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to
allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
in 2002, the company recorded impairments of its investments in dynegy and
caltex australia. the impairment of dynegy is discussed in md&a in the
explanation of 2002 results for all other on page fs-7, in information
related to investment in dynegy inc. on page fs-8, and in notes 4 and 13 to
the consolidated financial statements. the impairment of caltex australia is
discussed in the explanation of 2002 results for international downstream on
page fs-6 and is included in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
the impairment charges taken in 2002 for dynegy and caltex australia
common stock investments were based on fair values determined from publicly
quoted prices. the impairment charges recorded for the companys investment in
dynegy preferred stock was based upon the companys own estimate of the
instruments fair value at the time, since chevrontexaco was the sole preferred
stock shareholder and the instrument was not publicly traded. in making its
estimate, reference was made to, among other things, the pricing of marketable
dynegy bonds and an added factor for an estimated liquidity discount. see also
page fs-12 for further information relating to the companys investment in
dynegy preferred stock.
different effects on company earnings would have resulted from making
different assumptions related to the investments in dynegy and caltex
australia. while the qualitative factors considered in making the assessments
as to whether declines in fair value were other than temporary were not
subject to sensitivity analysis, different assumptions might have resulted in
no impairments being recorded, a greater or lesser amount of impairment charge,
and/or a difference in the timing of any impairment charges.
contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in
recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental
remediation. actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of
reasons. for example, the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can
vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities
for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws,
regulations and their interpretation; the determination of additional
information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in
technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is recorded for these types of
contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and
estimable. the company generally records these losses as operating expenses
or selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement
of income. refer to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this
discussion and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements on page fs-28
for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation and
environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december
31, 2002.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other
assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical
because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of
underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both
in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.
new accounting standards
in june 2001, the fasb issued statement no.143, accounting for asset
retirement obligations (fas 143). this new standard was adopted effective
january1, 2003, and applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets. adoption of fas 143 primarily affects
the companys accounting for oil and gas producing assets. fas 143 differs in
several significant respects from current accounting under fas 19, financial
accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies. adoption of fas
143 affects future accounting and reporting of the assets, liabilities and
expenses related to these obligations. in the first quarter 2003, the company
will report an after-tax loss of $200million to $250million for the
cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle, including the
companys share of the effect of adoption by its equity affiliates. the effect
of adoption also included an increase of total assets and total liabilities of
$2.6billion and $2.8billion, respectively.
fs-16
table of contents
other than the cumulative-effect change, the effect of the new accounting
standard on 2003 net income is not expected to be materially different from
what the result would have been under fas 19 accounting. upon adoption, legal
obligations, if any, to retire downstream and chemical,
long-lived assets generally were not recognized because of indeterminate
settlement dates for the asset retirement. therefore, insufficient information
exists to estimate the potential settlement dates and to apply the
net-present-value techniques to estimate the fair value of the retirement
obligation.
in july 2002, the fasb issued statement no.146, accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities (fas 146). the standard requires
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when
they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. examples of costs covered by the standard include lease
termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with
a restructuring, discontinued operations, a plant closing, or other exit or
disposal activity. the statement replaces eitf (emerging issues task force of
the fasb) issue no.94-3, liability recognition for certain employee
termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity (including certain
costs incurred in a restructuring). fas 146 is to be applied prospectively to
exit or disposal activities initiated after december31, 2002.
in november 2002, the fasb issued interpretation no.45, guarantors
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect
guarantees of indebtedness of others (fin 45). the disclosure provisions of
fin 45 are effective for fiscal years ending after december15, 2002, and are
included in note 21, other contingencies and commitments, whereas the
recognition and measurement requirements are to be applied on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued or modified after december31, 2002. as these
requirements relate to future events, the effect cannot be determined.
in december 2002, the fasb issued statement no.148, accounting for
stock-based compensation  transition and disclosure (fas 148), which amends
fasb statement no.123, accounting for stock-based compensation. fas 148
permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the
fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and
amends the disclosure requirements in both annual and interim financial
statements. chevrontexaco will continue to apply accounting principles board
(apb)opinion no.25, accounting for stock issued to employees, and related
interpretations in accounting for stock options. the amended disclosure
requirements of fas 148 have been incorporated into note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements.
in january 2003, the fasb issued interpretation no.46, consolidation of
variable interest entities (fin 46). fin 46 amended arb 51, consolidated
financial statements, and established standards for determining under what
circumstances a variable interest entity (vie)should be consolidated with its
primary beneficiary. fin 46 also requires disclosures about vies that the
company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant
variable interest. the consolidation requirements of fin 46 apply immediately
to vies created after january31, 2003. the consolidation requirements apply to
older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june
15, 2003. certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial
statements issued after january31, 2003, regardless of when the vie was
established. the company does not expect that adoption of fin 46 will have a
significant impact on its results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.

note 1.
summary of significant accounting policies
basis of presentation  merger of chevron and texaco on october9, 2001, texaco
inc. (texaco) became a wholly owned subsidiary of chevron corporation (chevron)
pursuant to a merger transaction, and chevron changed its name to chevrontexaco
corporation (chevrontexaco). the combination was accounted for as a pooling of
interests.
these consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the
merger, with all periods presented as if chevron and texaco had always been
combined. certain reclassifications have been made to conform the separate
presentations of chevron and texaco. the reclassifications had no impact on the
amount of net income or stockholders equity.
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries after the elimination of significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. included in the consolidation are the
accounts of the caltex group of companies (caltex), a joint venture owned 50
percent each by chevron and texaco prior to the merger and accounted for under
the equity method by both companies.
general chevrontexaco manages its investments in and provides administrative,
financial and management support to u.s. and foreign subsidiaries and
affiliates that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals
operations and coal mining activities. in addition, chevrontexaco holds
investments in power generation and gasification businesses. collectively,
these companies operate in approximately 180 countries. petroleum operations
consist of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas;
refining crude oil into finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil,
natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting
crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipelines, marine vessels,
motor equipment and rail car. chemicals operations include the manufacture and
marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel
and lube oil additives.
in preparing its consolidated financial statements, the company follows
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. this
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements as well
as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure
of contingent liabilities. while the company uses its best estimates and
judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future
confirming events occur.
the nature of the companys operations and the many countries in which it
operates subject it to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions.
the company does not believe it is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe
impact as a result of any concentration of its activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent
owned. investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a
substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to 50percent, or
for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over
policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that
accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the
issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the companys
proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity currently in
income. deferred income taxes are provided for these gains and losses.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when there are
indications that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys
carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the
carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the
amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination
as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such
factors as the duration and extent of decline, the investees financial
performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment
for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
the investments market value. the new cost basis of investments in the common
stock of equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair
value. subsequent recoveries in the carrying value of other investments are
reported in other comprehensive income.
for other than goodwill, differences
between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying
equity in the net assets of the affiliate are amortized to income generally
over the estimated economic life of the underlying net assets. differences
attributable to goodwill are subject to assessment for impairment.
derivatives the majority of the companys activity in commodity derivative
instruments is intended to manage the price risk posed by physical
transactions. for some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large,
discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply
fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative
instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts and
their limited use, the company has elected not to apply hedge accounting, and
changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income.
for the companys trading activity, gains and losses from the derivative
instruments are reported in current income. for derivative instruments relating
to foreign currency exposures, gains and losses are reported in current income.
interest rate swaps  hedging a portion of the companys fixed rate debt  are
accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps relating to a
portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available
for sale and are in highly liquid debt or equity securities. those investments
that are part of the companys cash management portfolio with original
maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents. the
balance of the short-term investments is reported as marketable securities.
short-term investments are marked-to-market with any unrealized gains or losses
included in other comprehensive income.

note 1. summary of significant accounting policies  continued
inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at
cost, using a last-in, first-out (lifo)method. in the aggregate, these costs
are below market. materials, supplies and other inventories generally are
stated at average cost.
properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for oil
and gas exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells,
related plant and equipment, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas
properties are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that
are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. costs also are capitalized for
wells that find commercially producible reserves that cannot be classified as
proved, pending one or more of the following: (1)decisions on additional major
capital expenditures, (2)the results of additional exploratory wells that are
under way or firmly planned, and (3)securing final regulatory approvals for
development. otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination as to
whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following
completion of drilling. all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed.
long-lived assets, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed
for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with the
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger
assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves
based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an
asset, and significant change in the extent or manner of use or physical change
in an asset. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved oil and
gas properties in the united states, the company generally performs the
impairment review on an individual field basis. outside the united states,
reviews are performed on a country, concession or field basis, as appropriate.
impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense.
depreciation and depletion (including provisions for future abandonment
and restoration costs) of all capitalized costs of proved oil and gas producing
properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production
method by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced.
depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are
recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the
related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation provisions for
impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses for coal are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. the capitalized
costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their
estimated useful lives. in general, the declining-balance method is used to
depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the straight-line method
generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties,
plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation.
gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses and from
sales as other income.
expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals to maintain
facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. major
replacements and renewals are capitalized.
environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing
operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed.
expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue
generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when
environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of
these accruals are generally based on the companys commitment to a formal plan
of action, such as an approved remediation plan or the sale or disposal of an
asset. for the companys u.s. and canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is
based on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required.
for oil, gas and coal producing properties, a provision is made through
depreciation expense for anticipated abandonment and restoration costs at the
end of a propertys useful life. see also note 18 related to financial
accounting standards board statement no.143, accounting for asset retirement
obligations, which became effective for chevrontexaco on january1, 2003.
for superfund sites, the company records a liability for its share of
costs when it has been named as a potentially responsible party (prp)and when
an assessment or cleanup plan has been developed. this liability includes the
companys own portion of the costs and also the companys portion of amounts
for other prps when it is probable that they will not be able to pay their
share of the cleanup obligation.
the company records the gross amount of its liability based on its best
estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying
current regulations as well as the companys own internal environmental
policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or reimbursements are
recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for
substantially all of the companys consolidated operations and those of its
equity affiliates. for those operations, all gains or losses from currency
translations are currently included in income. the cumulative translation
effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using
functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in the currency
translation adjustment in stockholders equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas,
coal, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when
title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as
applicable. revenues from natural gas production from properties in which
chevrontexaco has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on
the basis of the companys net working interest (entitlement method).
stock compensation at december31, 2002, the company had stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in note 20. the company
accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of
accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.25, accounting for stock issued
to employees, and related interpretations. the following table illustrates the

1 includes certain reclassification adjustments to conform to historical chevron presentation.
2 consolidation of former equity operations and intercompany eliminations.
3 loss associated with the sales of the companys interests in equilon and motiva.
at the time of the merger, each share of texaco common stock was converted, on
a tax-free basis, into the right to receive 0.77 shares of chevrontexaco common
stock. approximately 425million additional shares of common stock were issued,
representing about 40percent of the outstanding chevrontexaco common stock
after the merger.
as a condition of approving the merger, the u.s. federal trade commission
(ftc)required the divestment of certain texaco assets: texacos investments in
its u.s. refining, marketing and transportation affiliates, equilon enterprises
llc (equilon) and motiva enterprises llc (motiva), as well as other interests
in
u.s. natural gas processing and transportation facilities and general aviation
fuel marketing.
at the time of the merger, texaco placed its interests in equilon and
motiva in trust, as required by the ftc. because the company no longer
exercised significant influence over these investments, the associated
accounting method was changed from equity to cost basis.
net income for 2001 included a loss of $643, net of a tax benefit of $144
($0.61 per common share  diluted), related to the disposition of assets that
were required as a condition of the ftc approval of the merger and other assets
that were made duplicative by the merger. the after-tax loss on these
dispositions was reported as an extraordinary item in accordance with
pooling-of-interests accounting requirements.
included in the total after-tax loss was a loss of $564 connected with the
sale of interests in equilon and motiva. proceeds from the sale, which closed
in february 2002, were approximately $2,200.
for both assets that were being sold by order of the ftc and other assets
that were being disposed of because they were made duplicative by the merger,
the total net book value at year-end 2001 was $2,181. this amount was included
in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december31, 2001, as
assets held for sale  merger related. net income for 2001 associated with
all such assets sold as a result of the merger was approximately $375. the
corresponding amount in 2002 was not significant.
note 3.
employee termination benefits and other restructuring costs
in connection with the merger, the company incurred significant incremental
expenses, which included: employee severance payments; incremental pension and
medical plan benefits associated with workforce reductions; legal, accounting,
sec filing and investment banker fees; employee and office relocations; and the
elimination of redundant facilities and operations. in 2002, before-tax
merger-related expenses were $576 ($386 after tax). in 2001, such expenses were
$1,563 ($1,136 after tax). included in these amounts were accruals of $891 and
$60 in 2001 and 2002, respectively, for severance-related benefits for
approximately 4,500 employees and other merger-related expenses that will not
benefit future operations.
activity for this merger-related accrual balance is summarized in the
table below:

of the 4,500 employees, approximately 450 remained on the payroll at december
31, 2002. about 130 of the remaining employees are expected to terminate their
employment in the first quarter 2003. the year-end 2002 accrual balance is not
expected to be extinguished for approximately two years, reflecting a severance
payment deferral option exercised by certain employees. the company does not
expect to incur significant amounts for merger-related expenses in 2003.

in 2002, the company recorded write-downs of $1,626 of its investment in
dynegy common and preferred stock and $136 of its investment in its publicly
traded caltex australia affiliate to their respective estimated fair values.
the write-downs were required because the declines in the fair values of the
investments below their carrying values were deemed to be other than temporary.
refer to note 13 for additional information on the companys investment in
dynegy and caltex australia.
also in 2002, impairments of $183 were recorded for various u.s.
exploration and production properties and $100 for international projects,
reflecting lower expected recovery of proved oil reserves. impairments in 2001
included $1,022 for the midway sunset field in california  the result of a
write-down in proved oil reserve quantities  upon determination of a
lower-than-projected oil recovery from the fields steam injection process. a
$247
impairment of the ll-652 field in venezuela was also recorded in 2001  as
slower-than-expected reservoir repressurization resulted in a reduction in the
projected volumes of oil recoverable during the companys remaining contract
period of operation. asset impairments included in asset write-offs and
revaluations were for assets held for use.

stockholders equity
retained earnings at december31, 2002 and 2001, included approximately $1,559
and $ 2,015, respectively, for the companys share of undistributed earnings of
equity affiliates.
upon the merger of chevron and texaco, the authorized common stock of
chevrontexaco was increased from 2billion shares of $0.75 par value to 4
billion shares of $0.75 par value. under the terms of the merger agreement,
approximately 425million shares of chevrontexaco common stock were issued in
exchange for all of the outstanding shares of texaco common stock based upon an
exchange ratio of 0.77 of a chevrontexaco share for each texaco share. texacos
common stock held in treasury was canceled at the effective time of the merger.
in 1998, in connection with the renewal of chevrons stockholder rights
plan, chevron declared a dividend distribution on each outstanding share of its
common stock of one right to purchase participating preferred stock. since this
distribution in 1998, all newly issued shares of the corporations common stock
have been accompanied by a preferred stock purchase right, including the shares
issued in connection with the merger between chevron and texaco. following the
merger, the chevron stockholder rights plan has continued as the stockholder
rights plan of chevrontexaco. the rights issued under the plan become
exercisable, unless redeemed earlier by chevrontexaco, if a person or group
acquires or obtains the right to acquire 10percent or more of the outstanding
shares of common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that would
result in that person or group acquiring 10percent or more of the outstanding
shares of common stock, either event occurring without the prior consent of
chevrontexaco. the chevrontexaco seriesa participating preferred stock that
the holder of a right is entitled to receive and the purchase price payable
upon exercise of the chevrontexaco right are both subject to adjustment. the
person or group who acquired 10percent or more of the outstanding shares of
common stock without the prior consent of chevrontexaco would not be entitled
to this purchase.
in november 2002, the stockholder rights agreement was amended so that the
rights will expire in november 2003, five years earlier than the initial
expiration date in november 2008.
the rights may be redeemed by the company at 1 cent per right prior to the
expiration date. the rights do not have voting or dividend rights and until
they become exercisable have no dilutive effect on the earnings per share of
the company. five million shares of the companys preferred stock were
designated seriesa participating preferred stock and reserved for issuance
upon exercise of the rights. no event during 2002 made the rights exercisable.
until june 2001, there were 1,200 shares of texaco cumulative variable
rate preferred stock, called market auction preferred shares (maps),
outstanding, with an aggregate value of $300. the maps were redeemed in june
2001, at a liquidation preference of $250,000 per share, plus premium and
accrued and unpaid dividends.
at december31, 2002, 30million shares of chevrontexacos authorized but
unissued common stock were reserved for issuance under the chevrontexaco
corporation long-term incentive plan (ltip), which was approved by the
stockholders in 1990. to date, all of the plans common stock requirements have
been met from the companys treasury stock, and there have been no issuances of
reserved shares.
note 9.
financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instruments chevrontexaco is exposed to market risks
related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and
refinery feedstock.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage this exposure
on a small portion of its activity, including: firm commitments and anticipated
transactions for the purchase or sale of crude oil; feedstock purchases for
company refineries; crude oil and refined products inventories; and fixed price
contracts to sell natural gas and natural gas liquids.
the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading
purposes.
the company maintains a policy of requiring that an international swaps
and derivatives association agreement govern derivative contracts with certain
counterparties to mitigate credit risk. depending on the nature of the
derivative transaction, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.
when the company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction
with the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement
with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market exposure represents the
netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a
reasonable measure of the companys credit risk. it is the companys policy to
use other netting agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts
significant transactions.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the
consolidated balance sheet as accounts and notes receivable, accounts
payable, long-term receivables  net, and deferred credits and other
noncurrent obligations. gains and losses on the companys risk management
activities are reported as either sales and other operating revenues or
purchased crude oil and products, whereas trading gains and losses are
reported as other income. these activities are reported under operating
activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
fs-30
table of contents
note 9. financial and derivative instruments  continued
foreign currency the company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally
with terms of 180days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency
exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase
transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange
contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains
and losses reflected in income.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the
consolidated balance sheet as accounts and notes receivable or accounts
payable, with gains and losses reported as other income. these activities
are reported under operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash
flows.
interest rates the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms
of the swaps, net cash settlements are based on the difference between
fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed
notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas
interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt
are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income.
during 2002, no new swaps were initiated. at year-end 2002, the interest
rate swaps outstanding related to fixed-rate debt, and their weighted average
maturity was approximately 5.6years.
fair values of the interest rate swaps are reported on the consolidated
balance sheet as accounts and notes receivables or accounts payable, with
gains and losses reported directly in income as part of interest and debt
expense. these activities are reported under operating activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows.
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are
exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash
equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade
receivables. the companys short-term investments are placed with a wide array
of financial institutions with high credit ratings. this diversified investment
policy limits the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations
of credit risk. similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied
to the companys counterparties in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified
sources of revenue, are dispersed among the companys broad customer base
worldwide. as a consequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. the
company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. when the
financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, letters of
credit are the principal security obtained to support lines of credit.
fair value fair values are derived either from quoted market prices or, if not
available, the present value of the expected cash flows. the fair values
reflect the cash that would have been received or paid if the instruments were
settled at year-end.
long-term debt of $7,296 and $6,599 had estimated fair values of $7,971
and $7,097 at december31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
for interest rate swaps, the notional principal amounts of $665 and $930
had estimated fair values of $70 and $2 at december31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
the company holds cash equivalents and u.s. dollar marketable securities
in domestic and offshore portfolios. eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes,
time deposits and commercial paper are the primary instruments held. cash
equivalents and marketable securities had fair values of $2,506 and $2,449 at
december31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. of these balances, $1,682 and $1,446
at the respective year-ends were classified as cash equivalents that had
average maturities under 90days. the remainder, classified as marketable
securities, had average maturities of approximately 3.9years.
the companys $1,500 investment in redeemable, convertible preferred stock
of its dynegy affiliate had an estimated fair value of $300 at december31,
2002.
note 10.
operating segments and geographic data

marketing and transportation; and chemicals businesses. all other activities
include corporate administrative costs, worldwide cash management and debt
financing activities, the companys investment in dynegy, coal mining
operations, power and gasification operations, technology investments,
insurance operations, real estate activities, and expenses and net losses
associated with the merger. the companys primary country of operation is the
united states of america, its country of domicile. other components of the

financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are
managed by the company on a worldwide basis. corporate administrative costs and
assets are not allocated to the operating segments. however, operating segments

segment sales and other operating revenues operating segment sales and other
operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years 2002, 2001 and
2000 are presented in the following table. sales from the transfer of products
between segments are at prices that approximate market.
revenues for the exploration and production segment are derived primarily from
the production of crude oil and natural gas. revenues for the refining,
marketing and transportation segment are derived from the refining and
marketing of petroleum products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils,
kerosene, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude
oil. this segment also generates revenues from the transportation and trading
of crude oil and refined products. revenues for the chemicals segment are
derived from the manufacture and sale of additives for lubricants and fuel.
prior to the july 2000 formation of cpchem, chemicals segment revenues were
derived from the manufacture and sale of petrochemicals, plastic resins, and
lube oil and fuel additives. subsequent to the formation of the joint venture,
only revenues from the manufacture and sale of lube oil and fuel additives were
included. revenues from all other activities include coal mining operations,
power and gasification operations, technology investments, insurance operations
and real estate activities.
other than the united states, the only country where chevrontexaco
generates significant revenues is the united kingdom, which amounted to
$10,816, $10,350 and $12,101 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

litigation
unocal chevron, texaco and four other oil companies (refiners)filed suit in
1995 contesting the validity of a patent (393 patent) granted to unocal
corporation (unocal) for certain reformulated gasoline blends. chevrontexaco
sells reformulated gasolines in california in certain months of the year. in
march 2000, the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit upheld a
september 1998 district court decision that unocals patent was valid and
enforceable and assessed damages of 5.75 cents per gallon for gasoline produced
during the summer of 1996, which infringed on the claims of the patent. in
february 2001, the u.s. supreme court concluded it would not review the lower
courts ruling, and the case was sent back to the district court for an
accounting of all infringing gasoline produced after august1, 1996. the
district court has now ruled that the per-gallon damages awarded by the jury
are limited to infringement that occurs in california only. additionally, the
u.s. patent and trademark office (uspto)granted two petitions by the refiners
to re-examine the validity of unocals 393 patent and has twice rejected all
of the claims in the 393 patent. the district court judge requested further
briefing and advised that she would not enter a final judgment in this case
until the uspto also had completed its re-examination of the 393 patent.
during 2002, the uspto also rejected the validity of another unocal patent, the
126 patent, which could affect a larger share of u.s. gasoline production.
separately, the ftc has issued an administrative complaint alleging that
unocals conduct in this matter represented an unfair method of competition,
which may make unocals patents unenforceable.
unocal has obtained additional patents that could affect a larger share of
u.s. gasoline production. chevrontexaco believes these additional patents are
invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. the companys financial exposure
in the event of unfavorable conclusions to the patent litigation and regulatory
reviews may include royalties, plus interest, for production of gasoline that
is proved to have infringed the patents. the competitive and financial effects
on the companys refining and marketing operations, while presently
indeterminable, could be material. chevrontexaco has been accruing in the
normal course of business any future estimated liability for potential
infringement of the 393 patent covered by the 1998 trial courts ruling. in
2000, prior to the merger, chevron and texaco made payments to unocal totaling
approximately $30million for the original court ruling, including interest and
fees.
mtbe another issue involving the company is the petroleum industrys use of
methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive and its potential
environmental impact through seepage into groundwater. along with other oil
companies, the company is a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of
the chemical mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines. these actions may require
the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of
prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and
claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be
filed in the future. the companys ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits
and claims is not currently determinable, but could be material to net income
in any one period. chevrontexaco has worked to reduce the use of mtbe in
gasoline it manufactures in the united states. the state of california has

lease commitments
certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased
assets are included as part of properties, plant and equipment, at cost. such
leasing arrangements involve tanker charters, crude oil production and
processing equipment, service stations, and other facilities. other leases are
classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. the payments on such
leases are recorded as expense. details of the capitalized leased assets are as

renewal options ranging from one to 25years, and/or options to purchase the
leased property during or at the end of the initial or renewal lease period for
the fair market value or other specified amount at that time.

in 2002, the before-tax loss, including related corporate and other
charges, for u.s. operations was $2,140, compared with before-tax income of
$1,778 in 2001 and $5,823 in 2000. for international operations, before-tax
income was $6,296, $6,513 and $8,226 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. u.s.
federal income tax expense was reduced by $208, $202 and $165 in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively, for business tax credits.
the above table does not include a current u.s. tax benefit of $2 and a
u.s. deferred tax benefit of $142 associated with the extraordinary item in
2001.

the increase in the 2002 effective tax rate was due to a number of
factors. the primary reason was that u.s. before-tax income (generally subject
to a lower tax rate) was a significantly smaller percentage of overall
before-tax income in 2002 compared with 2001. prior-year tax adjustments arose
from revisions to deferred tax valuation allowances and other tax related
accruals. the impairment of the investments in dynegy and caltex australia were
capital losses for which no offsetting capital gains were available.
the company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and
classifies those net amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance
sheet classification of the related assets or liabilities.

it is the companys policy for subsidiaries included in the u.s.
consolidated tax return to record income tax expense as though they filed
separately, with the parent recording the adjustment to income tax expense for
the effects of consolidation. income taxes are accrued for retained earnings of
international subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures intended to be
remitted. income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international
operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and
affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for
possible future remittances totaled approximately $10,108 at december31, 2002.
substantially all of this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the
companys ongoing business. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of
taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. on
remittance, certain countries impose withholding

weighted-average interest rates at december31, 2002 and 2001, were 1.47
percent and 1.99percent, respectively, including the effect of interest rate
swaps.
redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt
variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they
become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following
the balance sheet date.
the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of
its short-term debt. see note 9 for information concerning the companys
debt-related derivative activities.
at december31, 2002, the company had $4,110 of committed credit
facilities with banks worldwide, which permit the company to refinance
short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the facilities support the
companys commercial paper borrowings. interest on borrowings under the terms
of specific
agreements may be based on the london interbank offered rate, the reserve
adjusted domestic certificate of deposit rate or bank prime rate. no amounts
were outstanding under these credit agreements during 2002 or at year-end.
at december31, 2002 and 2001, the company classified $4,110 and $3,200,
respectively, of short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these obligations
is not expected to require the use of working capital in 2003, as the company
has both the intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis.

new accounting standards
in june 2001, the fasb issued statement no.143, accounting for asset
retirement obligations (fas 143). this new standard was adopted effective
january1, 2003, and applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets. adoption of fas 143 primarily affects
the companys accounting for oil and gas producing assets. fas 143 differs in
several significant respects from current accounting under fas 19, financial
accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies. adoption of fas
143 affects future accounting and reporting of the assets, liabilities and
expenses related to these obligations. in the first quarter 2003, the company
will report an after-tax loss of $200 to $250 for the cumulative effect of this
change in accounting principle, including the companys share of the effect of
adoption by its equity affiliates. the effect of adoption also included an
increase of total assets and total liabilities of $2.6billion and $2.8
billion, respectively. other than the cumulative-effect change, the effect of
the new accounting standard on 2003 net income is not expected to be materially
different from what the result would have been under fas 19 accounting. upon
adoption, legal obligations, if any, to retire downstream and chemical long-lived assets generally were not recognized because of
indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirement. therefore,
insufficient information exists to estimate the potential settlement dates and
to apply the net-present-value techniques to estimate the fair value of the
retirement obligation.
in july, the fasb issued statement no.146, accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities (fas 146). the standard requires
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when
they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. examples of costs covered by the standard include lease
termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with
a restructuring, discontinued operations, a plant closing, or other exit or
disposal activity. the statement replaces eitf (emerging issues task force of
the fasb) issue no.94-3, liability recognition for certain employee
termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity (including certain
costs incurred in a restructuring). fas 146 is to be applied prospectively to
exit or disposal activities initiated after december31, 2002.
in november, the fasb issued interpretation no.45, guarantors
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect
guarantees of indebtedness of others (fin 45). the disclosure provisions of
fin 45 are effective for fiscal years ending after december15, 2002, and are
included in note 21. the recognition and measurement requirements are to be
applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december
31, 2002. as these requirements relate to future events, the effect cannot be
determined.
in december, the fasb issued statement no.148, accounting for
stock-based compensation  transition and disclosure (fas 148), which amends
fasb statement no.123, accounting for stock-based compensation. fas 148
permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the
fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and
amends the disclosure requirements in both annual and interim financial
statements. chevrontexaco will continue to apply accounting principles board
(apb)opinion no.25, accounting for stock issued to employees, and related
interpretations in accounting for stock options. the amended disclosure
requirements of fas 148 have been incorporated into note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements.
in january 2003, the fasb issued interpretation no.46, consolidation of
variable interest entities (fin 46). fin 46 amended arb 51, consolidated
financial statements, and established standards for determining under what
circumstances a variable interest entity (vie)should be consolidated with its
primary beneficiary. fin 46 also requires disclosures about vies that the
company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant
variable interest. the consolidation requirements of fin 46 apply immediately
to vies created after january31, 2003. the consolidation requirements apply to
older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june
15, 2003. certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial
statements issued after january31, 2003, regardless of when the vie was
established. the company does not expect that adoption of fin 46 will have a
significant impact on the results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.
note 19.
employee benefit plans
pension plans and other postretirement benefits the company has defined benefit
pension plans for many employees and provides for certain health care and life
insurance plans for some active and qualifying retired employees. the company
typically funds only those defined benefit plans where legal funding is
required. in the united states, this includes all qualified plans subject to
the employee retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard.
the company does not fund domestic nonqualified plans or international plans
that are not subject to any legal funding requirements. the aggregated funded
status for the funded and unfunded pension plans is depicted in the following
table.
the companys annual contribution for medical and dental benefits are
limited to the lesser of actual medical and dental claims or a defined fixed
per-capita amount. life insurance benefits are paid by the company, and annual
contributions are based on actual plan experience. nonfunded pension and
postretirement benefits are paid directly when incurred; accordingly, these
payments are not reflected as changes in plan assets in the following table.

for postretirement benefit measurement purposes, one set of health care
cost-trend rates was used for pre-age 65 and 65-and-over retirees. starting in
2002, with approximately a 12percent cost increase over the previous year, the
trend rates gradually drop to 4.5percent for 2007 and beyond. a

employee savings investment plan eligible employees of chevrontexaco and
certain of its subsidiaries participate in the chevrontexaco employee savings
investment plan (esip). in 2002, the employees thrift plan of texaco inc.,
employees savings plan of chevrontexaco global energy inc. (formerly caltex
corporation), stock plan of chevrontexaco global energy inc. and employees
thrift plan of fuel and marine marketing llc were merged into the chevrontexaco
esip. charges to expense for these plans were $161, $157 and $63 in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.
employee stock ownership plans (esop) within the chevrontexaco employee savings
investment plan, the company has established an employee stock ownership plan.
in december 1989, chevron established a leveraged employee stock ownership plan
(lesop)as a constituent part of the esop. the lesop provides partial
pre-funding of the companys future commitments to the esip, which will result
in annual income tax savings for the company.
in 1988, texaco established a leveraged employee stock ownership plan as a
component of the employees thrift plan of texaco inc. the thrift plan lesop
loan was satisfied in december 2000. during 2002 the employees thrift plan of
texaco inc. was subsumed into the chevrontexaco esip.
as permitted by american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa)
statement of position 93-6, employers accounting for employee stock ownership
plans, the company has elected to continue its practices, which are based on
statement of position 76-3, accounting practices for certain employee stock
ownership plans, and subsequent consensus of the emerging issues task force of
the financial accounting standards board. the debt of the lesops is recorded as
debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated
statement of stockholders equity. the company reports compensation expense
equal to lesop debt principal repayments less dividends received by the lesops.
interest incurred on the lesop debt is recorded as interest expense. dividends
paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. all
lesop shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.
expense recorded for the lesops was $98, $75 and $26 in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively, including $32, $43 and $48 of interest expense related to
lesop debt. all dividends paid on the lesop shares held are used to service the
lesop debt. the dividends used were $49, $86 and $77 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
the company made lesop contributions of $102, $75 and $1 in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively, to satisfy lesop debt service in excess of dividends
received by the lesop. the lesop shares were pledged as collateral for the
debt. shares are released from a suspense account and allocated to the accounts
of plan participants, based on the debt service deemed to be paid in the year
in proportion to the total of current-year and remaining debt service. the
charge (credit)to compensation expense was $66, $32 and $(22) in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. lesop shares as of december31, 2002 and 2001, were as

stock. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit
plans. the trust will sell the shares, or use the dividends from the shares, to
pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits.
the trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts
beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for
earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment
of benefit obligations.
management incentive plans chevrontexaco has two incentive plans, the
management incentive plan (mip)and the long-term incentive plan (ltip)for
officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its
subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. the plans were
expanded in 2002 to include former employees of texaco and caltex. the mip is
an annual cash incentive plan that links awards to performance results of the
prior year. the cash awards may be deferred by conversion to stock units or
other investment fund alternatives. awards under the ltip may take the form of,
but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, stock units and
nonstock grants. texaco also had a cash incentive program and a stock incentive
plan (sip)that included stock options, restricted stock and other incentive
awards for executives, directors and key employees. awards under the caltex
ltip were in the form of performance units and stock appreciation rights.
charges to expense for the combined management incentive plans, excluding
expense related to ltip and sip stock options and restricted stock awards, that
are discussed in note 20, were $48, $101 and $83 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
other incentive plans the company has a program that provides eligible
employees with an annual cash bonus if the company achieves certain financial
and safety goals. charges for the program were $158, $154 and $230 in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

stock options
the company applies apb opinion no.25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock-based compensation programs, which are described
below. stock-based compensation (credit)expense recognized in connection with
these programs was $(2), $111 and $23 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share, had the company
applied the fair-value-recognition provisions of fas no.123, are shown in note
1.
broad-based employee stock options in 1998, chevron granted to all its eligible
employees an option that varied from 100 to 300 shares of stock or equivalents,
dependent on the employees salary or job grade. these options vested after two
years in february 2000. options for 4,820,800 shares were awarded at an
exercise price of $76.3125 per share. outstanding option shares were 3,064,367
at year-end 2000. exercises of 653,096 and forfeitures of 44,960 reduced the
outstanding option shares to 2,366,311 at the end of 2001. in 2002, exercises
of 295,985 and forfeitures of 61,151 reduced the outstanding option shares to
2,009,175 at the end of the year. the options expire february11, 2008. the
company recorded (credit)expense of $(2), $1 and $(2) for these options in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
the fair value of each option share on the date of grant under fas no.123
was estimated at $19.08 using the average results of black-scholes models for
the preceding 10years. the 10-year averages of each assumption used by the
black-scholes models were: a risk-free interest rate of 7.0percent, a dividend
yield of 4.2percent, an expected life of seven years and a volatility of 24.7
percent.
long-term incentive plan stock options granted under the ltip extend for 10
years from the date of grant. effective with options granted in june 2002, one
third of the options vest on each of the first, second and third anniversaries
of the date of grant. prior to this change, options granted by chevron vested
one year after the date of grant, while options granted by texaco under its sip
vested over a two-year period at a rate of 50percent each year. the maximum
number of shares that may be granted each year is 1percent of the total
outstanding shares of common stock as of january 1 of such year.
on the closing of the merger on october9, 2001, outstanding options
granted under the texaco sip were converted to chevrontexaco options at the
merger exchange rate of 0.77. these options retained a provision for restored
options. this feature enables a participant who exercises a stock option by
exchanging previously acquired common stock or who has shares withheld to
satisfy tax withholding obligations to receive new options equal to the number
of shares exchanged or withheld. the restored options are fully exercisable six
months after the date of grant, and the exercise price is the fair market value
of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. restricted
shares granted under the former texaco plan contained a performance element
that had to be satisfied in order for all or a specified portion of the shares
to vest. upon the merger, all restricted shares became vested and converted to
chevrontexaco shares at the merger exchange ratio of 0.77. apart from the
restored options, no further awards may be granted under the former texaco
plans. amounts charged to compensation expense in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
including the former texaco plans, were $0, $110 and $25, respectively.

other contingencies and commitments
income taxes the company estimates its income tax expense and liabilities
annually. these liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual
taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for
which income taxes have been estimated. the u.s. federal income tax liabilities
have been settled through 1996 for chevrontexaco (formerly chevron),
1993 for chevrontexaco global energy inc. (formerly caltex), and 1991 for texaco.
california franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for chevron
and 1987 for texaco. settlement of open tax years, as well as tax issues in
other countries where the company conducts its businesses, is not expected to
have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of
the company, and in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made
for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to
future examination.
guarantees at december31, 2002, the company and its subsidiaries provide
guarantees, either directly or indirectly, of $1,038 for notes and other
contractual obligations of affiliated companies and $806 for third parties, as
discussed by major category below. there are no amounts being carried as
liabilities for the companys obligations under these guarantees.
of the guarantees provided to affiliates, $775 relate to borrowings for
capital projects or general corporate purposes. these guarantees were
undertaken to achieve lower interest rates and generally cover the construction
period of the capital projects. approximately 50percent of the amounts
guaranteed will expire within the 20032006 period, with the
remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. under the terms of the guarantees, the
company would be required to perform should an affiliate be in default of its
loan terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. there are no recourse
provisions, and no assets are held as collateral for these guarantees.
the company provides guarantees of $263 relating to obligations in
connection with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of its
cogeneration affiliates. under the terms of these guarantees, the company may
be required to make payments under certain conditions if the affiliates do not
perform under the agreements. there are no provisions for recourse to third
parties, and no assets are held as collateral for these pricing guarantees.
guarantees of $437 have been provided to third parties, including
approximately $100 of construction loans to host governments in the companys
international upstream operations. the remaining guarantees of $337 were
provided principally as conditions of sale of the companys interest in certain
operations, to provide a source of liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in
connection with company marketing programs. no amounts of the companys
obligations under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities. approximately
half of the total amounts guaranteed will expire in 2003, with the remainder
expiring after 2007. the company would be required to perform under the terms
of the guarantees should an entity be in default of its loan or contract terms,
generally for the full amounts disclosed. approximately $200 of the guarantees
have recourse provisions that enable the company to recover any payments made
under the terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed
parties assets.
guarantees of $369 relate to equilon debt and leases. in connection with
the february 2002 disposition of its interest in equilon, shell oil company
agreed to indemnify the company against any claims arising out of these
guarantees. the company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees.
guarantees on approximately 30percent of the debt and leases will expire
within the 20032007 period, with the guarantees of the remaining amounts
expiring by 2024.
indemnities the company also provided certain indemnities of contingent
liabilities of equilon and motiva to shell oil com-
fs-43
table of contents
note 21. other contingencies and commitments  continued
pany saudi refining inc. in connection with the february 2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the indemnities cover contingent
general liabilities, certain contingent environmental liabilities and
liabilities associated with the unocal patent litigation. the company would be
required to perform should the contingent general liabilities become actual
liabilities within 18months of the sale and could be required to make maximum
future payments of $300. the company has not recorded liabilities for these
contingencies. there are no recourse provisions enabling recovery of any
amounts from third parties nor are any assets held as collateral. within five
years of the february 2002 sale, at the buyers option, the company also may be
required to purchase certain assets from shell oil company for their net book
value, as determined at the time of the companys purchase.
the indemnities pertaining to the contingent environmental liabilities
relate to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva
joint ventures and environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation
of equilon and motiva or that occurred during the periods of chevrontexacos
ownership interests in the joint ventures. in general, the environmental
conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen
prior to december12, 2001. claims relating to equilon must be asserted no
later than february13, 2009, and claims relating to motiva must be asserted no
later than february13, 2012. under the terms of the indemnities, there is no
maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. the company has not
recorded any liabilities for possible claims under these indemnities. the
amounts indemnified are to be net of amounts recovered from insurance carriers
and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or motiva prior to
september30, 2001, for any applicable incident. the company holds no assets as
collateral. during 2002, the company made no payments under the indemnities.
securitization in other off-balance-sheet arrangements, the company
securitizes certain retail and trade accounts receivable in its downstream
business through the use of qualifying special purpose entities (spes). at
december31, 2002, approximately $1,000, representing about 11percent of
chevrontexacos total current accounts receivables balance, were securitized.
chevrontexacos total estimated financial exposure under these arrangements at
december31, 2002, was approximately $75. these arrangements have the effect of
accelerating chevrontexacos collection of the securitized amounts. in the
event of the spes experiencing major defaults in the collection of receivables,
chevrontexaco would have no loss exposure connected with third-party
investments in these securitization arrangements.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput
agreements and take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have
certain other contingent liabilities relating to long-term unconditional
purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements, and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the
agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage
capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary
course of the companys business. the aggregate amounts of required payments
under these various commitments are 2003  $1,320; 2004  $1,257; 2005
$1,274; 2006
$1,109; 2007  $1,096; 2008 and after  $2,798. total payments under the
agreements were $1,188 in 2002, $1,509 in 2001 and $1,506 in 2000. the most
significant take-or-pay agreement calls for the company to purchase
approximately 55,000 barrels per day of refined products from an equity
affiliate refiner in thailand. this purchase agreement is in conjunction with
the financing of a refinery owned by the affiliate and expires in 2009. the
future estimated commitments under this contract are: 2003  $800; 2004  $800;
2005  $900; 2006  $900; 2007  $900; 2008 and 2009  $1,800.
minority interests the company has commitments related to preferred shares
of subsidiary companies, which are accounted for as minority interest. mvp
production inc., a subsidiary, has variable rate cumulative preferred shares of
$75 owned by one minority holder. the shares are voting and are redeemable in
2003. texaco capital
llc, a wholly owned finance subsidiary, has issued $65 of deferred preferred
shares, seriesc. dividends amounting to $59 on seriesc, at a rate of 7.17
percent compounded annually, will be paid at the redemption date of february
28, 2005, unless earlier redemption occurs. early redemption may result upon
the occurrence of certain specific events.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the company
to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior
release of chemical or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the company or
other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including but
not limited to: superfund sites and refineries, oil fields, service stations,
terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. the
amount of such future cost is indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown
magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the
corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys
liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from third parties. while the company has provided
for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable,
the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations
in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these
costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such
expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the companys
competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemicals concerns.
the company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its
operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodities and
other derivatives activities, including forward exchange contracts and interest
rate swaps. however, the results of operations and the financial position of
certain equity affiliates may be affected by their business activities
involving the use of derivative instruments.
global operations areas in which the company and its affiliates have
significant operations include the united states of america, canada, australia,
the united kingdom, norway, denmark, france, partitioned neutral zone between
kuwait and saudi arabia, republic of congo, angola, nigeria, chad, equatorial
guinea, democratic republic of congo, south africa,
fs-44
table of contents
note 21. other contingencies and commitments  continued
indonesia, papua new guinea, the philippines, singapore, china, thailand, venezuela,
argentina, brazil, colombia, trinidad and tobago and south korea. the companys
tengizchevroil affiliate operates in kazakhstan. the companys chevron phillips
chemical company llc affiliate manufactures and markets a wide range of
petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis, with manufacturing facilities
in existence or under construction in the united states, puerto rico,
singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and belgium. the
companys dynegy affiliate has operations in the united states, canada, and the
united kingdom and other european countries.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be
affected by other changing economic, regulatory and political environments in
the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. for
instance, in december 2002, caltex oil (sa) (pty) limited (caltex oil (sa))
announced the signing of a shareholders agreement with a south african
consortium of black economic empowerment partners. the agreement is intended to
ultimately provide the consortium a 25percent equity interest in all aspects
of caltexs operations in south africa. it is uncertain as to whether any
additional actions will be taken by host governments in other countries to
increase public ownership of the companys partially- or wholly-owned
businesses.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls
and taxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten
the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those
countries. internal unrest or strained relations between a host government and
the company or other governments may affect the companys operations. those
developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related
operations and results, and are carefully considered by management when
evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.
equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership
agreements may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in
estimated oil and gas reserves. these activities, individually or together, may
result in gains or losses that could be material to earnings in any given
period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrontexacos interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum
reserve at elk hills in california, for the time when the remaining interests
in these zones were owned by the u.s. department of energy. a wide range
remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones. chevrontexaco
currently estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at less than
$200. at the same time, a possible maximum net amount that could be owed to
chevrontexaco is estimated at more than $50. the timing of the settlement and
the exact amount within this range of estimates are uncertain.
other contingencies chevrontexaco receives claims from and submits claims
to customers, trading partners, u.s. federal, state and local regulatory
bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers, and suppliers. the amounts of
these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take
lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their
operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure
assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve
competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together,
may result in gains or losses in future periods.
note 22.
earnings per share
basic earnings per share (eps)includes the effects of deferrals of salary and
other compensation awards that are invested in chevrontexaco stock units by
certain officers and employees of the company and is based upon net income less
preferred stock dividend requirements. diluted eps includes the effects of
these deferrals as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options
awarded under the companys stock option programs (see note 20, stock
options). the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted

table v  reserve quantity information
the companys estimated net proved underground oil and gas reserves and changes
thereto for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 are shown in the following table.
proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth
scientists and reservoir engineers. these proved reserve estimates are reviewed
annually by the companys reserves advisory committee to ensure that rigorous
professional standards and the reserves definitions prescribed by the u.s.
securities and exchange commission are consistently applied throughout the
company.
proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geologic and engineering
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. due to
the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates
of underground reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes
available.
proved reserves do not include additional quantities that may result from
extensions of currently proved areas or from applying secondary or tertiary
recovery processes not yet tested and determined to be economic.
proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
net reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect
contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the
estimate.

information on canadian oil sands net proved reserves not included above:
in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves,
chevrontexaco has significant interests in proved oil sands reserves in canada
associated with the athabasca project. for internal management purposes,
chevrontexaco views these reserves and their development as an integral part of
total upstream operations. however, u.s. securities and exchange commission
regulations define these reserves as mining-related and not a part of
conventional oil and gas reserves. net proved oil sands reserves were 183
million barrels as of december31, 2002. production began in late 2002.
the oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which
is found on page fs-53.
fs-52
table of contents
supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  continued
unaudited
table vi  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to
proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the
preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the
requirements of fas no.69. estimated future cash inflows from production are
computed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of
estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are limited to those
provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting
year. future development and production costs are those estimated future
expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved
reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end
economic conditions. estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying
appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. these rates reflect allowable
deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax net cash
flows, less the tax basis of related assets.
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10percent midperiod
discount factors. discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future
expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.
the information provided does not represent managements estimate of the
companys expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.
estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as
new information becomes available. moreover, probable and possible reserves,
which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. the
arbitrary valuation prescribed under fas no.69 requires assumptions as to the
timing and amount of future development and production costs. the calculations
are made as of december31 each year and should not be relied upon as an
indication of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil and gas
reserves.
