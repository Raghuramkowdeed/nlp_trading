, A DELAWARE

CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES, AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND

MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE

IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS,

COAL MINING, POWER AND ENERGY SERVICES. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN

THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 180 OTHER COUNTRIES.

PETROLEUM OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO

FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS

AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINES,

MARINE VESSELS, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY AN

AFFILIATE, OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS AND PLASTICS FOR

INDUSTRIAL USES, AND THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY A

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, OF FUEL AND LUBRICATING OIL ADDITIVES.

IN THIS REPORT, EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS MAY BE REFERRED

TO AS E&P OR UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

RM&T OR DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES. A

LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES E-4 TO E-6 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD 53,014 EMPLOYEES

(EXCLUDING 13,024 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES), DOWN ABOUT 2,700

FROM YEAR-END 2001. APPROXIMATELY 29,000, OR 44 PERCENT, OF THE

COMPANYS EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES,

WERE EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 3,700

WERE UNIONIZED.

OVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM

INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY

ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, OVER SOME OF WHICH INDIVIDUAL

PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE CONTROL. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE

ENVIRONMENT, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES,

REGULATING WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS AND

FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME CASES, LIMITING THEIR

PROFITS DIRECTLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS,

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE DETERMINED BY SUPPLY

AND DEMAND FOR THESE COMMODITIES. THE MEMBERS OF THE

ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE

TYPICALLY THE WORLDS SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL, AND

THEIR PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING

WORLDWIDE SUPPLY. DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR

NATURAL GAS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL,

NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND

TAXATION RELATIVE TO OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY A

SIGNIFICANT PART. NATURAL GAS IS GENERALLY PRODUCED AND CONSUMED

ON A COUNTRY OR REGIONAL BASIS. VARIATIONS IN THE COMPONENTS OF

REFINED PRODUCTS SALES DUE TO SEASONALITY ARE NOT PRIMARY

DRIVERS OF CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS OVERALL EARNINGS.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE

PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES. THERE IS COMPETITION

WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES IN

SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND

INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRONTEXACO COMPETES WITH FULLY

INTEGRATED MAJOR

AND OUTLOOK.

TEXACO MERGER TRANSACTION

ON OCTOBER 9, 2001, TEXACO INC. (TEXACO)

BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON CORPORATION

(CHEVRON) PURSUANT TO A MERGER TRANSACTION, AND CHEVRON CHANGED

ITS NAME TO CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION. THE COMBINATION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS, AND EACH SHARE OF

TEXACO COMMON STOCK WAS CONVERTED ON A TAX-FREE BASIS INTO THE

RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.77 SHARES OF CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK. IN

THE MERGER, CHEVRONTEXACO ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 425 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, REPRESENTING ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF

THE OUTSTANDING CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER.

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE

CHEVRONTEXACO STRATEGIC

DIRECTION

CHEVRONTEXACOS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO

ACHIEVE SUSTAINED FINANCIAL RETURNS THAT WILL ENABLE IT TO

OUTPERFORM ITS COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY HAS SET AS A GOAL TO

GENERATE THE HIGHEST TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN AMONG A DESIGNATED

PEER GROUP FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD 2000-2004. BRITISH

PETROLEUM, EXXONMOBIL AND ROYAL DUTCH SHELL  AMONG

THE WORLDS LARGEST INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

COMPANIES  COMPRISE THE COMPANYS DESIGNATED

COMPETITOR PEER GROUP FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE COMPANY HAD THE

SECOND HIGHEST TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN IN THIS PEER GROUP FOR

THE 2000-2002 PERIOD.

AS A FOUNDATION FOR ATTAINING THIS GOAL, THE

COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED FOUR KEY PRIORITIES.



OPERATIONAL

EXCELLENCE

THROUGH SAFE, RELIABLE, EFFICIENT AND

ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND OPERATIONS;



COST REDUCTION

BY LOWERING UNIT COSTS THROUGH

INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY;



CAPITAL

STEWARDSHIP

BY INVESTING IN THE BEST PROJECT

OPPORTUNITIES AND EXECUTING THEM SUCCESSFULLY (SAFER, FASTER,

AND AT LOWER COST); AND



PROFITABLE GROWTH

THROUGH LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING NEW

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN BOTH EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS.

SUPPORTING THESE FOUR PRIORITIES IS A FOCUS ON.



ORGANIZATIONAL

CAPABILITY.

HAVING THE RIGHT

PEOPLE, PROCESSES AND CULTURE TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN

INDUSTRY-LEADING PERFORMANCE IN THE FOUR PRIORITIES DESCRIBED

ABOVE.

THE CORPORATE STRATEGIC PLAN BUILDS ON THIS

FRAMEWORK WITH STRATEGIES FOCUSED ON APPROPRIATELY BALANCING

FINANCIAL RETURNS AND GROWTH. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

CONDUCTING A RIGOROUS EVALUATION OF ITS ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF

ASSETS AND EXPECTS TO FINALIZE THIS REVIEW LATER THIS YEAR. AS A

RESULT OF THIS EVALUATION, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES EXPLORING

POTENTIAL ASSET TRANSACTIONS TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND

PROFITABILITY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND ENHANCING THE

ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS ASSET BASE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ITS

WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO

BE ITS MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS, WITH DEVELOPMENT OF ITS LARGE

PROVED AND UNPROVED NATURAL GAS RESERVES CONSTITUTING PERHAPS

THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITY OVER TIME TO EXPAND THE COMPANYS

BASE OF PRODUCTION AND TO CAPTURE ECONOMIC VALUE FROM EMERGING

NATURAL GAS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SEEKING TO

DELIVER IMPROVED AND COMPETITIVE RETURNS FROM ITS WORLDWIDE

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES.

(B) DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

THE COMPANYS LARGEST BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, AND REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION. CHEMICALS IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT,

CONDUCTED MAINLY BY THE COMPANYS AFFILIATE  CHEVRON

PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM). THE PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMPANY ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY. THE COMPANY

HAS PETROLEUM OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA,

EUROPE, AFRICA, MIDDLE EAST, CENTRAL AND FAR EAST ASIA, AND

AUSTRALIA.

CPCHEM HAS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES,

PUERTO RICO, BELGIUM, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SINGAPORE, SAUDI

ARABIA, QATAR AND MEXICO. CHEVRONTEXACOS WHOLLY OWNED

ORONITE FUEL AND LUBE OIL ADDITIVES BUSINESS HAS OPERATIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES, MEXICO, FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE,

INDIA, JAPAN AND BRAZIL.

AN EQUITY AFFILIATE, DYNEGY INC. (DYNEGY), OWNS

OPERATING DIVISIONS ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION, NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS AND REGULATED ENERGY DELIVERY. CHEVRONTEXACO OWNS

APPROXIMATELY 26 PERCENT OF DYNEGYS COMMON STOCK AND

ALSO HOLDS $1.5 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

DYNEGYS PREFERRED STOCK. UNTIL RECENTLY, DYNEGY ALSO

CONDUCTED A LARGE ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS TRADING AND

MARKETING BUSINESS, AS WELL AS BROADBAND TRADING. CHEVRONTEXACO

SOLD ESSENTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION TO

DYNEGY, WHICH THEN SOLD IT INTO THE MARKET. FOLLOWING THE

COLLAPSE OF THE MERCHANT ENERGY SECTOR IN 2002, DYNEGY

EXPERIENCED A MARKED REDUCTION IN LIQUIDITY. ITS DEBT RATINGS

WERE DOWNGRADED AND A SHARP DECLINE IN ITS STOCK PRICE

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OCCURRED. IN 2002, DYNEGY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO

EXIT THE ENERGY TRADING BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THOSE CHANGES,

CHEVRONTEXACO IS RE-ESTABLISHING A NATURAL GAS MARKETING

BUSINESS TO MARKET THE COMPANYS U.S. NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION AND TO PURCHASE SUPPLY FOR ITS REQUIREMENTS. REFER TO

PAGE FS-8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY.

TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES, EARNINGS, INCOME TAXES AND ASSETS, BY UNITED STATES

AND INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, FOR THE YEARS 2000 TO 2002,

MAY BE FOUND IN NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-31 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

IN ADDITION, SIMILAR COMPARATIVE DATA FOR THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENTS IN AND INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES AND PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE CONTAINED IN NOTES 13 AND 14 ON

PAGES FS-34 TO FS-36.

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS CAN BE

AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, TAX, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES CONCERNING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ENERGY

AND TAXATION MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISK

OF INITIATING, MAINTAINING OR EXPANDING OPERATIONS IN ANY

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA. THE COMPANY MONITORS POLITICAL EVENTS

WORLDWIDE AND THE POSSIBLE THREAT THESE MAY POSE TO ITS

ACTIVITIES  PARTICULARLY THE COMPANYS OIL AND

GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS  AND THE

SAFETY OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY IS CAREFULLY

MONITORING THE POTENTIAL FOR DISRUPTION OF ITS OPERATIONS IN THE

EVENT OF HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ. APPROXIMATELY FIVE PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FOR 2002

CAME FROM THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE (PNZ), WHICH IS LOCATED

BETWEEN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THE STATE OF KUWAIT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2002, CHEVRONTEXACO CONDUCTED ITS EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY

25 OTHER COUNTRIES. WORLDWIDE NET CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS PRODUCTION, INCLUDING THAT OF AFFILIATES BUT EXCLUDING

VOLUMES PRODUCED UNDER OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS, DECREASED

BY ABOUT 3 PERCENT FROM THE 2001 LEVELS. NET WORLDWIDE

PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, DECREASED ABOUT

1 PERCENT IN 2002.

NET LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IN THE

UNITED STATES WAS DOWN ABOUT 2 PERCENT AND 11 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN U.S. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IN 2002

REFLECTED DECREASES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINES IN MATURE FIELDS. EARLY IN 2001,

PRODUCTION FROM A NUMBER OF FIELDS WAS ACCELERATED VIA INCREASED

DRILLING AT A TIME OF HIGH NATURAL GAS PRICES. IN ADDITION TO

NORMAL FIELD DECLINES, PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY TROPICAL

STORMS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REDUCED NET CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL

GAS LIQUIDS PRODUCTION BY 10,000 BARRELS PER DAY AND

60 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS PER DAY ON AN

ANNUALIZED BASIS.

INTERNATIONAL NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION, INCLUDING

AFFILIATES, DECREASED ABOUT 4 PERCENT, WHILE NET NATURAL

GAS PRODUCTION ROSE 15 PERCENT FROM 2001. IN NIGERIA, THE

DECLINE IN NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION BETWEEN YEARS WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPEC PRODUCTION CONSTRAINTS. IN INDONESIA, ABOUT

25,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF THE YEAR TO YEAR DECLINE WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN CERTAIN PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT

TERMS AND 10,000 BARRELS PER DAY WAS RELATED TO THE EXPIRATION

OF A PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT. THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL

NATURAL GAS VOLUMES OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE PHILIPPINES, DUE

TO A FULL YEAR OF NEW PRODUCTION FROM THE MALAMPAYA FIELD.

FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE COMPANYS

WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION HAS FOLLOWED A DOWNWARD

TREND WITH 2002 PRODUCTION AT 91 PERCENT OF 1998 LEVELS,

EQUIVALENT TO AN AVERAGE ANNUAL DECLINE RATE BETWEEN 1 AND

2 PERCENT. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, INCREASES IN

INTERNATIONAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION HAVE BEEN MORE THAN

OFFSET BY DECREASES IN THE UNITED STATES.

FOR 2003, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES LOWER

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION RATES IN THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT

OF LOWER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN RECENT YEARS AND NATURAL FIELD

DECLINES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THIS TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY

CAPACITY INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL AREAS RESULTING IN WORLDWIDE

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN 2003 SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN

ACTUAL PRODUCTION LEVELS ACHIEVED IN 2002. THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF

PRODUCTION IN 2003 REMAINS UNCERTAIN DUE TO UNANTICIPATED

PRODUCTION INTERRUPTIONS, OPEC CONSTRAINTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC

FACTORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESERVES AND CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS

TABLE V ON PAGES FS-51 AND FS-52 OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K SETS FORTH THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES, BY GEOGRAPHIC

AREA, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000. DURING 2003,

THE COMPANY WILL FILE ESTIMATES OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES WITH THE

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, ENERGY INFORMATION AGENCY. THOSE ESTIMATES

ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RESERVE DATA REPORTED ON PAGE FS-52

OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

IN 2002, CHEVRONTEXACOS WORLDWIDE OIL AND

EQUIVALENT-GAS (OEG) BARRELS OF NET PROVED RESERVES

ADDITIONS EXCEEDED PRODUCTION, WITH A REPLACEMENT RATE OF

114 PERCENT OF NET PRODUCTION, INCLUDING SALES AND

ACQUISITIONS. EXCLUDING SALES AND ACQUISITIONS, THE REPLACEMENT

RATE WAS 112 PERCENT OF NET PRODUCTION. IN AFRICA, THE

RESERVES REPLACEMENT RATE INCREASED TO 521 PERCENT,

COMPARED WITH 268 PERCENT IN 2001, DUE PRIMARILY TO

RESERVES ADDITIONS IN WEST AFRICA. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

ADDITION OF RESERVE QUANTITIES FOR THE KERN RIVER FIELD IN

CALIFORNIAS SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, DUE TO IMPROVED RECOVERY

FROM RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT, WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY DOWNWARD

REVISIONS IN GAS FIELDS IN THE MID-CONTINENT, CO

THE COMPANY SELLS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FROM

ITS PRODUCING OPERATIONS UNDER A VARIETY OF CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS. MOST CONTRACTS GENERALLY COMMIT THE COMPANY TO

SELL QUANTITIES BASED ON PRODUCTION FROM SPECIFIED PROPERTIES,

BUT CERTAIN GAS SALES CONTRACTS SPECIFY DELIVERY OF FIXED AND

DETERMINABLE QUANTITIES. DURING 2002, DYNEGY PURCHASED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PRODUCED

BY THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCLUDING ALASKA, AND

SUPPLIED NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS FEEDSTOCKS TO THE

COMPANYS U.S. REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS. THE COMPANY

REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH DYNEGY TO TERMINATE EXISTING NATURAL

GAS PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACTS AND OTHER RELATED CONTRACTS AT

THE END OF JANUARY 2003. SEE PAGE FS-8 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON DYNEGY. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS

CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY

400 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS THROUGH 2005 FROM

AUSTRALIAN, COLOMBIAN AND PHILIPPINE RESERVES, AND APPROXIMATELY

1,300 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS FROM 2006 THROUGH

2020 FROM AUSTRALIAN AND PHILIPPINE RESERVES. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE CONTRACTS FROM QUANTITIES

AVAILABLE FROM PRODUCTION OF THE COMPANYS PROVED DEVELOPED

AUSTRALIAN, COLOMBIAN AND PHILIPPINE RESERVES. THE CONTRACTS

DISCUSSED ABOVE INCLUDE VARIABLE-PRICING TERMS.

EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPANYS

NET INTERESTS IN PRODUCTIVE AND DRY EXPLORATORY WELLS COMPLETED

IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AND THE NUMBER OF EXPLORATORY

WELLS DRILLING AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. EXPLORATORY

WELLS ARE WELLS DRILLED TO FIND AND PRODUCE OIL OR GAS IN

UNPROVED AREAS AND INCLUDE DELINEATION WELLS, WHICH ARE WELLS

DRILLED TO FIND A NEW RESERVOIR IN A FIELD PREVIOUSLY FOUND TO

BE PRODUCTIVE OF OIL OR GAS IN ANOTHER RESERVOIR OR TO EXTEND A

KNOWN RESERVOIR BEYOND THE PROVED AREA. WELLS

DRILLING INCLUDE WELLS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED. THE COMPANY

HAD $450 MILLION OF SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AT YEAR-END 2002, A DECREASE OF

$238 MILLION FROM 2001. DECREASES IN NIGERIA, ANGOLA AND

CHINA WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE WELLS ARE SUSPENDED PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED OIL AND GAS DEPOSITS. THE

ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON.

(1) DECISIONS ON ADDITIONAL MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

(2) THE RESULTS OF ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY DRILLING THAT IS

UNDERWAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED, AND IN SOME CASES, (3) SECURING

FINAL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR DEVELOPMENT.

COAL

THE COMPANYS COAL MINING AND MARKETING

SUBSIDIARY, THE PITTSBURG & MIDWAY COAL MINING CO.

(P&M), OWNED AND OPERATED TWO SURFACE MINES AND ONE

UNDERGROUND MINE AT YEAR-END 2002. IN ADDITION, FINAL

RECLAMATION ACTIVITIES WERE UNDERWAY AT TWO MINES PRIOR TO THEIR

PLANNED CLOSURE. P&M ALSO OWNS AN APPROXIMATE 30 PERCENT

INTEREST IN INTER-AMERICAN COAL HOLDING N.V., WHICH HAS

INTERESTS IN COAL MINING OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA. SALES OF COAL

FROM P&MS WHOLLY OWNED MINES AND FROM ITS AFFILIATES

WERE 14.9 MILLION TONS, A DECREASE OF 8 PERCENT FROM

2001 PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF REDUCED DEMAND. AT YEAR-END 2002,

P&M CONTROLLED APPROXIMATELY 186 MILLION TONS OF

DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED COAL RESERVES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT

RESERVES OF ENVIRONMENTALLY DESIRABLE LOW-SULFUR FUEL. THE

COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY

13 MILLION TONS OF COAL PER YEAR THROUGH THE END OF 2005.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE CONTRACTS FROM

EXISTING COAL RESERVES.

OTHER ACTIVITIES  SYNTHETIC CRUDE

OIL

IN CANADA, CHEVRONTEXACO HAS A 20 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS PROJECT WHERE BITUMEN

PRODUCTION BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2002. PRODUCTION WAS TEMPORARILY

SUSPENDED IN EARLY 2003 AND IS EXPECTED TO RESUME IN LATE MARCH.

THE BITUMEN WILL BE UPGRADED INTO SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL USING

HYDROPROCESSING TECHNOLOGY AT A SYNTHETIC CRUDE UNIT, EXPECTED

TO BEGIN OPERATIONS IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2003. BITUMEN

PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REACH AN AVERAGE RATE OF 155,000

BARRELS OF PER DAY IN 2005.

POWER AND GASIFICATION

CHEVRONTEXACO PARTICIPATES IN ITS POWER AND

GASIFICATION BUSINESS THROUGH OWNERSHIP, EQUITY INVESTMENTS WITH

OTHERS AND LICENSING OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. THE

COMPANYS ELECTRICAL POWER BUSINESS INCLUDES CONVENTIONAL

POWER GENERATION PROJECTS, AS WELL AS COGENERATION FACILITIES.

COGENERATION PRODUCES THERMAL ENERGY, SUCH AS STEAM, AND

ELECTRIC POWER. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS USED STEAM PRODUCED IN

COGENERATION IN ITS UPSTREAM OPERATIONS ONSHORE CALIFORNIA AND

IN INDONESIA. THE COMPANY USES ITS PROPRIETARY GASIFICATION

TECHNOLOGY TO CONVERT A WIDE VARIETY OF HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS

INTO A CLEAN SYNTHESIS GAS. THE SYNTHETIC GAS CAN BE USED AS A

FEEDSTOCK FOR BASIC CHEMICALS OR TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY IN

LOW-EMISSION POWER PLANTS. CHEVRONTEXACO LICENSES THIS

TECHNOLOGY, OPERATES OWNED GASIFICATION FACILITIES AND INVESTS

IN PROJECTS USING THE TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANY HAS LICENSED ITS

GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY TO MORE THAN 70 PLANTS WORLDWIDE.

RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY

THE COMPANYS CORE HYDROCARBON TECHNOLOGY

EFFORTS SUPPORT THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND POWER AND

GASIFICATION BUSINESSES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE HEAVY OIL

RECOVERY AND UPGRADING, DEEPWATER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION,

SHALLOW WATER PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PROCESSING,

HYDROCARBON GASIFICATION TO POWER, AND NEW AND IMPROVED REFINERY

PROCESSES.

ADDITIONALLY, CHEVRONTEXACOS TECHNOLOGY

VENTURES COMPANY FOCUSES UPON THE IDENTIFICATION, GROWTH, AND

COMMERCIALIZATION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE THE

POTENTIAL TO CHANGE OR TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT ENERGY IS PRODUCED

OR CONSUMED. THE RANGE OF BUSINESS SPANS EARLY-STAGE VENTURE

CAPITAL INVESTING IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOPING JOINT

VENTURE COMPANIES IN NEW ENERGY SYSTEMS SUCH AS ADVANCED

BATTERIES FOR DISTRIBUTED POWER AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND

HYDROGEN FUEL STORAGE.

THE COMPANY HAS LARGELY COMPLETED THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

ENCOMPASSING COMPUTING, DATA MANAGEMENT, SECURITY, AND

CONNECTIVITY OF PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES. THE

ARCHITECTURE, KNOWN AS NET READY, PROVIDES THE

FOUNDATION FOR THE COMPANY TO COST EFFECTIVELY AND RAPIDLY

INTEGRATE ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND NETWORK-BASED TECHNOLOGY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEVRONTEXACOS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES WERE $221 MILLION, $209 MILLION AND

$211 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY.

BECAUSE SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES

IN THE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES

AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, ULTIMATE SUCCESS IS NOT CERTAIN.

ALTHOUGH NOT ALL INITIATIVES MAY PROVE TO BE ECONOMICALLY

VIABLE, THE COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA IS

NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY, AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. CHEVRONTEXACO EXPECTS MORE ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED

REGULATIONS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS OPERATIONS. MOST OF

THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS

PERTAINING TO ITS OPERATIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF

CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS.

IN 2002, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES WERE $271 MILLION, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES.

THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO

RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES, AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

NEW FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE

PETROLEUM SEGMENT AND RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR AND WATER QUALITY

PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS REFINERIES, OIL

AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES AND MARKETING FACILITIES. FOR 2003,

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE $287 MILLION. THE

FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS OF FULFILLING THIS COMMITMENT ARE

UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THEIR NATURE AND SUFFICIENTLY LARGE AMOUNTS, THE SPECIAL ITEMS IN

THE TABLE ABOVE ARE IDENTIFIED SEPARATELY TO HELP EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN NET

INCOME AND SEGMENT INCOME BETWEEN

PERIODS AS WELL AS TO HELP DISTINGUISH THE UNDERLYING TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS

BUSINESSES. THE CATEGORIES MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES AND EXTRAORDINARY LOSS

FROM MERGER-RELATED ASSET SALES ARE AMOUNTS IN 2001 AND 2002 THAT ARE

DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN THE TEXACO MERGER TRANSACTION SECTION ON PAGE FS-3.

OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL FOR EACH MAJOR OPERATING AREA IN

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-4.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

AS SHOWN IN THE SPECIAL ITEMS TABLE, LARGE SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES ADVERSELY

AFFECTED NET INCOME IN 2002 AND 2001. IN 2002, $2.3 BILLION OF THE $3.3 BILLION

OF NET CHARGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT IN ITS DYNEGY INC. AFFILIATE. REFER TO PAGES FS-7 AND FS-8 FOR

DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS. APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF OF THE $3.5 BILLION OF NET

CHARGES IN 2001 RELATED TO ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DOWNWARD

REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES. THESE ITEMS ARE

DISCUSSED IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ANALYSES OF

SEGMENT INCOME BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-4. OTHER MAJOR CHARGES AGAINST EARNINGS IN

2002 AND 2001 RELATED TO THE TEXACO MERGER TRANSACTION, WHICH IS DISCUSSED ON

PAGE FS-3.

APART FROM THE EFFECTS OF SPECIAL ITEMS, CHEVRONTEXACOS EARNINGS DEPEND

LARGELY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM  EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  AND

DOWNSTREAM  REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION  BUSINESSES. OVERALL

EARNINGS TRENDS ARE TYPICALLY LESS AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS

COMMODITY CHEMICALS SECTOR AND INVESTMENTS IN OTHER BUSINESSES. KEY COMPONENTS

OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE

INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS, ARE THE

ABILITY TO INVEST

CAPITAL IN PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RETURNS AND MANAGING

OPERATING EXPENSES SUCCESSFULLY. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES

OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO ITS ASSET BASE

TO HELP SUSTAIN THE COMPANYS GROWTH. DURING 2003, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

EVALUATE AND DETERMINE WHICH ASSETS IN ITS OVERALL POST-MERGER PORTFOLIO

ARE KEY TO PROVIDING LONG-TERM VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN ASSET DISPOSITIONS

MAY RESULT.

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS

ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES IN EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION EARNINGS

ALIGN MOST CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXTERNAL FACTORS, OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL,

INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY

INVENTORY LEVELS, WEATHER-RELATED

DAMAGES AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND THE REGIONAL SUPPLY

INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS OR POLITICAL

UNCERTAINTY. LONGER-TERM TRENDS IN EARNINGS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE ALSO A

FUNCTION OF A RANGE OF FACTORS IN ADDITION TO PRICE TRENDS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE RESERVES AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE THEM.

AVERAGE WORLDWIDE INDUSTRY PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL IN 2002 WERE LITTLE

CHANGED FROM 2001. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION IN

THE UNITED STATES FELL ABOUT ONE THIRD FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AND CONTRIBUTED TO

THE DECLINE IN THE COMPANYS U.S SEGMENT INCOME BETWEEN PERIODS. SEGMENT INCOME

IN 2002 FOR

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REFLECTED RELATIVELY LITTLE CHANGE IN PRICES

FOR BOTH CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS.

DURING 2002, INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL TRENDED UPWARD FROM THE

$20 PER-BARREL LEVEL TO ABOUT $30. IN EARLY MARCH 2003, THE SPOT PRICE FOR WEST

TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI), A BENCHMARK CRUDE OIL WAS QUOTED BETWEEN $35 AND $40

PER BARREL  A 12-YEAR HIGH. BENCHMARK PRICES FOR HENRY HUB U.S. NATURAL GAS

STARTED 2002 IN THE LOW-$2 RANGE PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET AND ALSO TRENDED

UPWARD DURING THE YEAR, TO ABOUT THE $5 LEVEL. THROUGH MID-MARCH 2003, THE

BENCHMARK NATURAL GAS PRICE WAS VOLATILE AND AVERAGED ABOUT $7 PER THOUSAND

CUBIC FEET FOR THAT PERIOD. THE RELATIVELY STRONG PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL IN

EARLY 2003 IN PART REFLECTED THE GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN IRAQ AND

VENEZUELA. THE HIGHER U.S. NATURAL GAS PRICE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

FALLING INVENTORY STORAGE LEVELS REFLECTING WITHDRAWALS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF

A COLD WINTER OVER MUCH OF THE UNITED STATES.

SEGMENT INCOME DURING 2002 WAS ALSO DAMPENED BY LOWER WORLDWIDE

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION  DOWN 3 PERCENT FROM 2001 LEVELS. PART OF THE

PRODUCTION DECLINE WAS THE RESULT OF OPEC QUOTAS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR A

DECREASE IN NIGERIA OF ABOUT 30,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER DAY IN 2002.

STORMS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REDUCED 2002 OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION BY ABOUT

20,000 BARRELS PER DAY. THE IMPACT OF REVISED TERMS ON A PRODUCTION-SHARING

CONTRACT IN INDONESIA LOWERED 2002 NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION BY ABOUT

25,000 BARRELS PER DAY. ABSENT THESE EFFECTS, WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION WAS AT ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL IN BOTH YEARS. THE EXPECTED PRODUCTION

LEVEL IN 2003 AND BEYOND IS UNCERTAIN, IN PART BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

ADDITIONAL QUOTA ADJUSTMENTS BY OPEC AND THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL CIVIL UNREST

AND CHANGING GEOPOLITICS THAT COULD CAUSE PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ARE WEIGHTED HEAVILY TO INTERNATIONAL AREAS DUE TO THE GREATER

NUMBER OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.

DOWNSTREAM

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION EARNINGS ARE CLOSELY

TIED TO REGIONAL DEMAND AND INDUSTRY REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS. OTHER,

COMPANY-SPECIFIC, FACTORS INFLUENCING THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY IN THIS

SEGMENT INCLUDE THE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES OF ITS REFINERY NETWORK, INCLUDING

ANY DOWNTIME DUE TO OPERATING INCIDENTS AND MAINTENANCE.

INDUSTRY MARGINS WORLDWIDE WERE STRONG IN THE EARLY PART OF 2001 BUT

TRENDED DOWNWARD WORLDWIDE DURING THE YEAR, AS WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR REFINED

PRODUCTS WEAKENED. BY EARLY 2002,

CHEVRONTEXACO MARGINS WERE AT THEIR LOWEST LEVELS SINCE THE MID-1990S, AS WEAK

MARKET CONDITIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW FEEDSTOCK COSTS TO BE FULLY RECOVERED FROM

CONSUMERS OF REFINED PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, WORLDWIDE EARNINGS PLUMMETED

BETWEEN 2001 AND 2002 TO BELOW BREAK-EVEN. ADDITIONALLY, THE DECLINE IN

EARNINGS FROM 2001 INCLUDED THE ABSENCE OF ONGOING EARNINGS FROM U.S.

DOWNSTREAM ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD AS A CONDITION OF THE MERGER. INTO EARLY 2003,

U.S. REFINED PRODUCTS MARGINS STRENGTHENED ON THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF THE

GENERAL STRIKE IN VENEZUELA, COLDER-THAN-NORMAL WINTER WEATHER AND LOW

INVENTORY LEVELS. BASED ON CURRENT INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT A REBOUND OF EARNINGS FOR THIS SEGMENT IN 2003 TO

LEVELS SIMILAR TO 2001 AND 2000.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANYS ORONITE SUBSIDIARY IMPROVED IN

2002, AND LOSSES FROM THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL CO. LLC

AFFILIATE WERE LOWER. DEMAND AND MARGINS FOR COMMODITY CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN AT

LOW LEVELS FOR A PROTRACTED PERIOD, AND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IS NOT EXPECTED

IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

TEXACO MERGER TRANSACTION

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

ON OCTOBER 9, 2001, TEXACO INC. (TEXACO) BECAME A

WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON CORPORATION (CHEVRON) PURSUANT TO A MERGER

TRANSACTION, AND CHEVRON CHANGED ITS NAME TO CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION. CERTAIN

OPERATIONS THAT WERE JOINTLY OWNED BY THE COMBINING COMPANIES ARE CONSOLIDATED

IN THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE OPERATIONS ARE PRIMARILY THOSE

OF THE CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES, WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY OWNED 50 PERCENT EACH BY

CHEVRON AND TEXACO. THE COMBINATION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF

INTERESTS,

AND THE ACCOMPANYING AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ALL PERIODS

ARE PRESENTED AS IF CHEVRON AND TEXACO HAD ALWAYS BEEN COMBINED.

MERGER EFFECTS

UNDER MANDATE OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) AS A

CONDITION TO FTC APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS INTERESTS IN

EQUILON AND MOTIVA  JOINT VENTURES

ENGAGED IN U.S. DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES  IN FEBRUARY 2002, RESULTING IN CASH

PROCEEDS OF $2.2 BILLION, INCLUDING DIVIDENDS DUE. INDEMNIFICATION BY

CHEVRONTEXACO AGAINST CERTAIN EQUILON

AND MOTIVA CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF SALE ARE DISCUSSED IN THE

GUARANTEES, OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AND

OTHER CONTINGENCIES SECTION BEGINNING

ON PAGE FS-10. OTHER MANDATED ASSET DISPOSITIONS WERE ALSO COMPLETED DURING

2002. NET INCOME AND CASH PROCEEDS FROM THESE OTHER SALES WERE NOT MATERIAL.

NET INCOME DURING 2001 FOR ALL ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD AS A CONDITION OF THE

MERGER WAS APPROXIMATELY $375 MILLION. THE NET LOSS ON ASSETS SOLD UNDER THE

FTC MANDATE IS PRESENTED IN THE 2001 INCOME STATEMENT AS AN EXTRAORDINARY ITEM.

THE COMPANY INCURRED BEFORE-TAX MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES OF $1.563 BILLION

($1.136 BILLION AFTER TAX) AND $576 MILLION ($386 MILLION AFTER TAX) IN 2001

AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. MAJOR EXPENSES

INCLUDED EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS; INCREMENTAL PENSION AND MEDICAL PLAN

BENEFIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS; LEGAL, ACCOUNTING,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) FILING AND INVESTMENT BANKER FEES;

EMPLOYEE AND OFFICE RELOCATIONS; AND COSTS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF REDUNDANT

FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS. NO SIGNIFICANT MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES ARE

ANTICIPATED FOR 2003.

INCLUDED IN MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES WERE ACCRUALS OF $891 MILLION AND $60

MILLION IN 2001 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, FOR SEVERANCE-RELATED BENEFITS FOR

APPROXIMATELY 4,500 EMPLOYEES AND OTHER MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES THAT WILL NOT

BENEFIT FUTURE OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS AND EVENTS DURING 2002 AND EARLY 2003

INCLUDED.

WORLDWIDE OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRODUCTION

THE COMPANY ADDED

APPROXIMATELY 1.1 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES DURING 2002. THESE

ADDITIONS EQUATED TO 114 PERCENT OF PRODUCTION FOR THE YEAR. INCLUDED WERE

NEARLY 600 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT FROM MAJOR DISCOVERIES AND

EXTENSIONS IN AFRICA, AUSTRALIA, EUROPE AND CHINA. ADDITIONALLY, 500 MILLION

BARRELS WERE ADDED THROUGH IMPROVED RECOVERY AND EXPANSION PROJECTS, PRIMARILY

IN AFRICA, EURASIA AND CALIFORNIA. WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION DECLINED

IN 2002 ABOUT 3 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH 2001 AND ABOUT 4 PERCENT COMPARED WITH

2000. THE DECREASES BETWEEN YEARS REFLECT LOWER U.S. PRODUCTION LEVELS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION.

U.S. GULF OF MEXICO

TWO DEEPWATER DISCOVERIES WERE MADE  TAHITI AND GREAT

WHITE  AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING EVALUATED. CHEVRONTEXACO, WITH A 58

PERCENT INTEREST, OPERATES THE TAHITI

PROSPECT. THE COMPANY HAS A ONE-THIRD NON-OPERATED INTEREST IN GREAT WHITE. IN

DECEMBER, THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE THE

PORT PELICAN LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) RECEIVING AND REGASIFICATION TERMINAL,

LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 50 MILES OFFSHORE IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. PHASE 1 OF THE

PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO PROCESS UP TO 800 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS PER

DAY AND WILL CONNECT TO EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG THE GULF COAST.

CHEVRONTEXACOS INTEREST IS 100 PERCENT. LNG PROJECTS LIKE PORT PELICAN CAN

HELP OFFSET THE EFFECT OF AN EXPECTED

LONG-TERM DECLINE IN THE INDUSTRYS U.S. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION.

ANGOLA

THE EIGHTH AND NINTH DISCOVERIES  GABELA AND NEGAGE  WERE

ANNOUNCED IN CHEVRONTEXACO-OPERATED DEEPWATER BLOCK 14. THESE LATEST

DISCOVERIES WILL BE FOLLOWED BY GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING STUDIES TO ASSESS

THEIR RESERVE POTENTIAL. THE COMPANY, AS OPERATOR, HOLDS A 31 PERCENT INTEREST

IN BLOCK 14.

NIGERIA

A SECOND OIL DISCOVERY  USAN  WAS MADE IN THE NON-OPERATED

DEEPWATER NIGERIA BLOCK OPL 222, WHERE THE COMPANY HOLDS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST.

THE PROSPECT IS APPROXIMATELY 60 MILES OFFSHORE IN A WATER DEPTH GREATER THAN

2,000 FEET. THE COMPANY ALSO CONFIRMED ITS DEEPWATER BLOCK OPL 213 APARO OIL

DISCOVERY (100 PERCENT COMPANY INTEREST) WITH A SUCCESSFUL APPRAISAL WELL. THE

APARO DISCOVERY SHARES A STRUCTURE WITH AN ADJACENT CONCESSION AND WILL LIKELY

BECOME PART OF A JOINT OIL DEVELOPMENT.

U.K. NORTH SEA

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED FIRST OIL FROM ALBA EXTREME SOUTH, THE

LATEST PHASE IN THE FIELDS DEVELOPMENT IN WHICH CHEVRONTEXACO, AS OPERATOR,

HAS A 21 PERCENT INTEREST. THE PHASED DEVELOPMENT EXPANSION IS EXPECTED

NEAR-TERM TO ADD MORE THAN 50,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY TO ALBA PRODUCTION

(100 PERCENT FIELD BASIS), OFFSETTING EXISTING PRODUCTION DECLINES AND

MAINTAINING A PLATEAU RATE OF UP TO 100,000 BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY.

THE CALEDONIA FIELD PRODUCED FIRST OIL IN FEBRUARY 2003 WITH TOTAL PRODUCTION

EXPECTED TO AVERAGE ABOUT 10,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER DAY DURING 2003.

CHEVRONTEXACO IS OPERATOR WITH A 27 PERCENT INTEREST.

TENGIZ

FOLLOWING A DELAY IN LATE 2002, TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO) ANNOUNCED IN

EARLY 2003 THAT ITS PARTNERS HAD APPROVED THE DETAILED ENGINEERING AND

CONSTRUCTION OF THE SECOND GENERATION PROGRAM AND SOUR GAS INJECTION PROJECT.

THESE TWO PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TCOS OIL PRODUCTION CAPACITY FROM

THE CURRENT RATE OF ABOUT 285,000 BARRELS PER DAY TO BETWEEN 430,000 AND

500,000 BARRELS PER DAY. CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PLANS CALL FOR THE TWO PROJECTS TO

BE COMPLETED MID-2006. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS A 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

TCO.

AUSTRALIA

THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA SELECTED THE NORTH

WEST SHELF VENTURE, IN WHICH CHEVRONTEXACO HAS A ONE-SIXTH

INTEREST, AS THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF LNG TO THE PROPOSED GUANGDONG

LNG PROJECT IN SOUTHERN CHINA. A CONDITIONAL 25-YEAR LNG SALE

AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR MORE THAN 3.9 TRILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS (EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 400 MILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY)

WAS SIGNED IN OCTOBER.

CHINA

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A UNITIZATION AGREEMENT WITH CHINA NATIONAL

OFFSHORE OIL CORP (CNOOC) IN OCTOBER TO JOINTLY DEVELOP THE BOZHONG FIELD IN

BOHAI BAY. THIS IS THE FIRST

UNITIZATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN CNOOC AND A FOREIGN PARTNER. CHEVRONTEXACO HOLDS

AN APPROXIMATE 16 PERCENT INTEREST.

U.S. REFINING

AN EXPANSION PROJECT TO PRODUCE LOW SULFUR MOTOR GASOLINE

AND DIESEL AT THE COMPANYS PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI, REFINERY WILL BECOME

OPERATIONAL DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003.

CHEMICALS

IN QATAR, A WORLD-SCALE OLEFINS AND POLYOLEFINS COMPLEX IS

CURRENTLY BEING COMMISSIONED. THE FACILITY IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY QATAR

CHEMICAL COMPANY, A JOINT VENTURE

BETWEEN CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM), THE COMPANYS 50

PERCENT-OWNED PETROCHEMICAL AFFILIATE, AND ITS PARTNER QATAR GENERAL PETROLEUM.

CPCHEM HAS SIGNED AGREEMENTS TO DEVELOP A SECOND PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX IN

QATAR. THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE A WORLD-SCALE OLEFINS FACILITY, ALONG WITH

DERIVATIVES UNITS. FINAL APPROVALS ARE ANTICIPATED IN MID-2004.

U.S. NATURAL GAS MARKETING

THE COMPANYS NATURAL GAS PURCHASE AND SALE

AGREEMENTS WITH ITS 26 PERCENT-OWNED DYNEGY AFFILIATE WERE TERMINATED AT THE

END OF JANUARY 2003. UNDER THE TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS, DYNEGY IS TO ACT IN AN

AGENCY ROLE FOR THE COMPANY UNTIL THE CONTRACTS BECOME MANAGED BY CHEVRONTEXACO

NATURAL GAS  A NEW WHOLESALE NATURAL GAS MARKETING UNIT THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE

FULLY OPERATIONAL IN APRIL 2003. THE CONTRACT TERMINATIONS FOLLOWED DYNEGYS

DECISION TO EXIT THE GAS TRADING AND MARKETING BUSINESS AS PART OF A

COMPANYWIDE RESTRUCTURING PLAN. SEE PAGE FS-8 FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY.

THE FOLLOWING SECTION PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS WELL AS FOR THE DEPARTMENTS AND

COMPANIES MANAGED AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL. TO AID IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF

CHANGES IN SEGMENT INCOME BETWEEN PERIODS, THE DISCUSSION IS IN TWO PARTS -

FIRST, ON UNDERLYING TRENDS AND SECOND, FOR SPECIAL ITEMS THAT TENDED TO

OBSCURE THESE TRENDS.

SEGMENT INCOME IN 2002 REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NATURAL GAS

REALIZATIONS AND AN 11 PERCENT DECREASE IN NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE EARNINGS DECLINE WAS LOWER LIQUIDS PRODUCTION, WHICH

DROPPED 2 PERCENT FROM 2001 LEVELS. LOWER EARNINGS IN 2001 FROM 2000 PARTIALLY

RESULTED FROM SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LIQUIDS REALIZATIONS AND LOWER OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION, OFFSET BY HIGHER NATURAL GAS PRICES.

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS $2.89 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN

2002, COMPARED WITH $4.38 AND $3.87 IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE

COMPANYS AVERAGE 2002 U.S. LIQUIDS REALIZATION WAS $21.34 PER BARREL, COMPARED

WITH $21.33 IN 2001 AND $25.61 IN 2000.

NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AVERAGED 1.002 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2002,

DOWN 6 PERCENT FROM 2001 AND 13 PERCENT FROM 2000. THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT

FOR 2002 AVERAGED 602,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN 2 PERCENT FROM 2001 AND 10

PERCENT FROM 2000. NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 2.4 BILLION CUBIC FEET

PER DAY IN 2002, DOWN 11 PERCENT FROM 2001 AND 17 PERCENT FROM 2000. THE

COMPANYS 2002 PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS WAS CONSTRAINED BY

TROPICAL STORMS THAT OCCURRED IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

THE STORMS REDUCED THE COMPANYS 2002 OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION BY ABOUT 20,000

BARRELS PER DAY, SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS. THE NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS NET INCOME WAS ABOUT $100 MILLION, INCLUDING CASUALTY

LOSSES FOR THE UNINSURED PORTION OF PROPERTY DAMAGES AND ASSOCIATED COSTS. IN

ADDITION TO THE IMPACTS OF THE STORMS ON 2002 PRODUCTION, THE LOWER

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION REFLECTED NORMAL FIELD DECLINES AND THE ABSENCE OF

PRODUCTION FROM ASSETS SOLD IN 2001, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW AND ENHANCED

PRODUCTION IN THE DEEPWATER AND OTHER AREAS OF THE GULF OF

MEXICO. THE REDUCTIONS IN NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION REFLECTED, IN PART, STEEP

DECLINE RATES IN AREAS OF THE GULF OF MEXICO SHELF THAT WERE BROUGHT ONTO

PRODUCTION IN LATE 2000 AND EARLY 2001

TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A PERIOD OF HIGH NATURAL GAS PRICES.

SPECIAL ITEMS DURING THE THREE YEARS INCLUDED ASSET WRITE-OFFS AND REVALUATIONS

RESULTING MAINLY FROM ASSET IMPAIRMENTS CAUSED BY WRITE-DOWNS IN PROVED OIL AND

GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES FOR VARIOUS FIELDS. IN 2001, A $1.0 BILLION IMPAIRMENT

WAS RECORDED FOR THE MIDWAY SUNSET FIELD IN CALIFORNIAS SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY,

UPON DETERMINING LOWER-THAN-PROJECTED OIL RECOVERY FROM THE FIELDS

STEAM-INJECTION PROCESS.

THE EARNINGS IMPROVEMENT IN 2002 VERSUS 2001 WAS MARGINALLY AFFECTED BY A

COMBINATION OF HIGHER LIQUIDS REALIZATIONS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AND LOWER

EXPLORATION AND INCOME TAX

EXPENSE, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER LIQUIDS PRODUCTION AND NATURAL GAS

REALIZATIONS AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. THE EARNINGS DECLINE IN 2001

VERSUS 2000 REFLECTED LOWER AVERAGE LIQUIDS REALIZATIONS, THE EFFECT OF WHICH

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3 PERCENT INCREASE IN OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND

HIGHER NATURAL GAS PRICES.

THE AVERAGE LIQUIDS REALIZATION, INCLUDING EQUITY AFFILIATES, WAS $23.06

PER BARREL IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $22.17 IN 2001 AND $26.04 IN 2000. THE

AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS $2.14 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2002,

COMPARED WITH $2.36 IN 2001 AND $2.09 IN 2000.

DAILY NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 1.295 MILLION BARRELS IN 2002 DECREASED

ABOUT 4 PERCENT FROM 1.345 MILLION BARRELS IN 2001 AND ABOUT 3 PERCENT FROM

1.330 MILLION BARRELS IN 2000. PRODUCTION

DECREASES DURING 2002 IN INDONESIA, PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN CONTRACTUAL

TERMS, AND NIGERIA, PRIMARILY DUE TO OPEC CONSTRAINTS, WERE SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED PRODUCTION IN KAZAKHSTAN. DURING 2001, INCREASES IN KAZAKHSTAN MORE

THAN OFFSET LOWER VOLUMES FROM INDONESIA.

NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 1.971 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY

IN 2002 WAS UP 15 PERCENT FROM 2001 AND MORE THAN 26 PERCENT FROM 2000. A

MAJOR FACTOR IN THE 2002 PRODUCTION INCREASE WAS A FULL YEAR OF NEW PRODUCTION

FROM THE MALAMPAYA FIELD IN THE

PHILIPPINES. OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITH PRODUCTION INCREASES WERE KAZAKHSTAN,

NIGERIA AND AUSTRALIA. THESE INCREASES WERE SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION

FROM MATURE FIELDS IN CANADA.

IN 2001, AREAS WITH PRODUCTION INCREASES WERE KAZAKHSTAN, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO,

SOUTH KOREA AND CANADA.

SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES IN 2002 FOR ASSET WRITE-OFFS AND REVALUATIONS WERE

FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH WRITE-DOWNS IN QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL

AND GAS RESERVES FOR FIELDS IN AFRICA AND CANADA. SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2001

INCLUDED A $247 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF THE LL-652 FIELD IN VENEZUELA, AS

SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED RESERVOIR REPRESSURIZATION RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN THE

PROJECTED VOLUMES OF OIL RECOVERABLE DURING THE COMPANYS REMAINING CONTRACT

THE U.S. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT LOSS IN 2002 WAS

PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REFINED PRODUCT MARGINS. RESULTS

FOR 2001 AND 2000 INCLUDED EARNINGS OF

$375 MILLION AND $215 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS SOLD AS A

CONDITION OF THE MERGER, WHICH INCLUDED THE COMPANYS EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT

VENTURES. IN ADDITION, SALES VOLUMES FOR OPERATIONS THAT WERE RETAINED

FOLLOWING THE MERGER WERE DOWN IN

2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FUEL OIL TRADING ACTIVITY AND JET FUEL SALES

VOLUMES. THE DECLINE IN JET FUEL SALES VOLUMES REFLECTED THE WEAKENED TRAVEL

INDUSTRY. THE EARNINGS INCREASE IN 2001 REFLECTED

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER GASOLINE SALES MARGINS  ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE YEAR -

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY WEAKER DISTILLATE SALES MARGINS AND HIGHER OPERATING

EXPENSES. HIGHER SALES VOLUMES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN 2001.

EXCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF SALES VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS SOLD

AS A CONDITION OF THE MERGER, REFINED PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES OF 1.610 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY IN 2002 DECREASED

ABOUT 4 PERCENT FROM 2001 AND ABOUT 2 PERCENT FROM 2000. THE AVERAGE U.S.

REFINED PRODUCTS SALES REALIZATION OF $34.33 PER BARREL IN 2002 WAS DOWN FROM

THE 2001 AVERAGE OF $36.26 PER BARREL AND DOWN FROM $39.32 PER BARREL IN 2000.

SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2002 INCLUDED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PROVISIONS AND

ASSET WRITE-DOWNS FOR CERTAIN REFINING AND MARKETING ASSETS AND A $57 MILLION

CHARGE CONNECTED WITH A LAWSUIT

RELATED TO GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY MTBE (METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER), AN ADDITIVE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CERTAIN GASOLINE.

THE INTERNATIONAL REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT INCLUDES

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED REFINING AND MARKETING BUSINESSES, INTERNATIONAL

MARINE OPERATIONS, INTERNATIONAL

SUPPLY AND TRADING ACTIVITIES, AND EQUITY EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES, PRIMARILY IN

THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

EARNINGS IN 2002 INCLUDED FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES OF $176 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $23 MILLION AND $107 MILLION IN 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY. CURRENCY LOSSES IN 2002 OCCURRED

MAINLY IN BRAZIL, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, SOUTH KOREA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

INCOME IN MOST OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING AREAS DECLINED IN 2002, WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF LATIN AMERICA, WHERE EARNINGS INCREASED. IN THE AREAS WITH LOWER

EARNINGS, SUPPLY-DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS DID NOT ALLOW THE IMMEDIATE RECOVERY OF

RISING CRUDE OIL COSTS IN THE MARKETPLACE, WITH PRODUCT PRICE CHANGES LAGGING

THOSE FOR FEEDSTOCK COSTS. THIS CONDITION REFLECTED WEAK DEMAND, STIFF

COMPETITION AND, IN SOME AREAS, REGULATED PRICE ENVIRONMENTS. LOWER REFINING

MARGINS IN 2002 REFLECTED CONTINUED EXCESS REFINING CAPACITY IN THESE REGIONS.

THE IMPROVED RESULTS IN LATIN AMERICA FOR 2002 WERE PRIMARILY FROM REDUCED

OPERATING EXPENSES, OFFSET SLIGHTLY

BY LOWER PRODUCT MARGINS AND LOWER VOLUMES. RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS

INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING OPERATIONS ALSO DECLINED IN 2002, COMPARED WITH 2001,

PRIMARILY ON LOWER FREIGHT RATES.

AFTER EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS IN BOTH 2001 AND

2000 FOR THE SEGMENT AS A WHOLE, RESULTS FOR 2001 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED

BECAUSE OF IMPROVED MARKETING MARGINS,

PARTICULARLY EARLY IN THE YEAR. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE MARKETING IMPROVEMENT

WERE HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND SOMEWHAT LOWER REFINING MARGINS.

TOTAL INTERNATIONAL REFINED PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES WERE 2.258 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY IN 2002, DOWN ABOUT 8 PERCENT FROM 2.454 MILLION IN 2001 AND

ABOUT 10 PERCENT FROM 2.521 MILLION IN

2000. WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO DAMPEN DEMAND IN 2002.

THE SPECIAL ITEM AMOUNT IN 2002 WAS FOR A WRITE-DOWN OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT IN ITS PUBLICLY TRADED CALTEX AUSTRALIA AFFILIATE TO ITS FAIR VALUE,

AS A RESULT OF PROTRACTED WEAK BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN THE AUSTRALIAN DOWNSTREAM

MARKETS. THE WRITE-DOWN WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT THAT THE DECLINE IN

THE INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE WAS DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY. SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2001 INCLUDED THE IMPAIRMENT OF REFINERY

ASSETS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE SPECIAL ITEM ASSET WRITE-OFFS AND REVALUATIONS

IN 2000 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENTS OF MARKETING ASSETS IN EASTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL

AMERICA.

ASIDE FROM THE EFFECT OF SPECIAL ITEMS, THE CHANGE BETWEEN 2001 AND 2002

REFLECTED PRIMARILY THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF LOWER CORPORATE CHARGES, INCLUDING

AN INCREASE IN FAVORABLE TAX ADJUSTMENTS OF $245 MILLION AND LOWER NET INTEREST

EXPENSE OF $71 MILLION, OFFSET, IN PART, BY A DECLINE IN THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

DYNEGYS OPERATING RESULTS.

DURING 2002, DYNEGY RESULTS WERE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY A DOWNTURN IN THE

ENERGY MERCHANT SECTOR, WHICH WAS CHARACTERIZED BY LOWER LIQUIDITY LEVELS,

REDUCED POWER PRICES AND CREDIT CONCERNS. SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2002 INCLUDED

$2.306 BILLION RELATED TO DYNEGY, COMPOSED OF $1.626 BILLION FOR THE WRITE-DOWN

OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK TO THEIR

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AND $680 MILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF ITEMS DYNEGY

CLASSIFIED AS SPECIAL FOR ASSET WRITE-DOWNS AND REVALUATIONS AND A LOSS ON AN

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES

WERE $99 BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH

$104 BILLION IN 2001 AND $117 BILLION IN 2000. REVENUES FROM WORLDWIDE

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS DECREASED 27 PERCENT ON LOWER PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES. SALES VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS WERE ALSO DOWN

IN THE UNITED STATES. DOWNSTREAM SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES WERE ABOUT

6 PERCENT HIGHER IN 2002, PRIMARILY ON HIGHER PRICES FOR REFINED PRODUCTS IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. TOTAL SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES IN 2001

DECLINED FROM 2000 ON LOWER

AVERAGE REALIZATIONS FOR CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS.

INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES

DECLINED IN 2002, REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF

EARNINGS FROM ASSETS SOLD AS A CONDITION OF THE MERGER AND LOWER EARNINGS FROM

DYNEGY. EQUITY INCOME INCREASED MARGINALLY IN 2001 ON THE STRENGTH OF IMPROVED

EARNINGS FOR EQUILON, MOTIVA AND DYNEGY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS FOR

TCO AND LG-CALTEX AND BY LARGER LOSSES FROM CPCHEM.

OTHER INCOME

DECREASED IN 2002 AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST INCOME,

CHANGES IN NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND NET GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

ASSET SALES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES

IN 2002 WERE $43 MILLION, COMPARED WITH GAINS OF

$191 MILLION AND $182 MILLION IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2002, NET

GAINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE ARGENTINE PESO, WHICH

BEGAN TO FLOAT AGAINST THE DOLLAR DURING THE YEAR, WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY

LOSSES RELATED TO CURRENCIES OF MOST OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS.

PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS

COSTS OF $57 BILLION IN 2002 WERE 5

PERCENT LOWER THAN 2001  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES AND SALES

VOLUMES  AND ABOUT 18 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2000  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES AND LOWER NATURAL GAS VOLUMES.

EXPLORATION EXPENSES

WERE $0.6 BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $1.0 BILLION

COMPARED WITH 2000, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET DECLINES IN OTHER EXPLORATION

EXPENSES.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE

INCREASED FOR

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2002, BUT THIS EFFECT WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET

BY LOWER EXPENSES IN THE U.S. UPSTREAM SEGMENT. IN 2001, THE ABSENCE OF

CHARGES RELATING TO CHEMICALS ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CPCHEM JOINT VENTURE

THAT WAS FORMED IN MID-2000 WERE ESSENTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN AMOUNTS FOR

OTHER SEGMENTS.

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE

WAS $0.6 BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $0.8

BILLION IN 2001 AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2000. THE DECLINES BETWEEN PERIODS

PRIMARILY REFLECTED LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES

ON DEBT.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

FOR EACH YEAR CORRESPONDED TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 45

PERCENT IN EACH YEAR AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF SPECIAL ITEMS. SEE

ALSO NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY INC.

CHEVRONTEXACO OWNS APPROXIMATELY 26 PERCENT OF THE COMMON STOCK OF ITS DYNEGY

AFFILIATE, AN ENERGY MERCHANT ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS

AND REGULATED ENERGY DELIVERY. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS $1.5 BILLION AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH IS DUE TO BE REDEEMED AT PAR

IN NOVEMBER 2003.

AS A RESULT OF A COLLAPSE OF THE U.S. MERCHANT-ENERGY SECTOR DURING 2002,

DYNEGY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF ITS COMMON STOCK, AS

WELL AS A MARKED REDUCTION IN AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY. THIS RESULTED IN LIMITED

ACCESS BY DYNEGY TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND AN INCREASING USE OF ITS ASSETS AS

COLLATERAL FOR ITS LIABILITIES. DYNEGY IS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF REGULATORY

INVESTIGATIONS AND IS THE DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS SEEKING LARGE

DAMAGE AMOUNTS. DURING 2002, DEBT RATINGS OF DYNEGY SECURITIES WERE DOWNGRADED

BELOW INVESTMENT-GRADE LEVEL. DYNEGYS ABILITY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS IN A

TIMELY FASHION DEPENDS IN PART ON COMPLETION OF ITS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR

RECAPITALIZATION AND RESTRUCTURING OF THE BUSINESS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT DYNEGY WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO REDEEM THE

PREFERRED STOCK WHEN DUE.

CHEVRONTEXACOS NET INCOME FOR 2002 INCLUDED SPECIAL CHARGES OF $2.306

BILLION RELATED TO DYNEGY. THESE CHARGES WERE COMPOSED OF $1.626 BILLION FOR

THE COMPANYS WRITE-DOWN OF THE

COMBINED INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, AND $680 MILLION FOR

THE COMPANYS SHARE OF DYNEGYS OWN SPECIAL ITEMS DURING THE YEAR. THE

WRITE-DOWN OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY DURING 2002 WAS REQUIRED

BECAUSE THE DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK

INVESTMENTS BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY.

ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF THE INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

THE EXTENT THE FAIR VALUES OF THE DYNEGY SECURITIES AT THE END OF ANY

SUBSEQUENT PERIOD WERE BELOW THEIR RESPECTIVE

CARRYING VALUES AT THAT TIME, AND THE DECLINES IN VALUE WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY. IN THE EVENT DYNEGY RECORDS LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS, THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF THOSE LOSSES

WOULD BE RECORDED FIRST AGAINST ANY REMAINING CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMMON

STOCK AND THEN AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE REMAINING BOOK VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

IN DYNEGY WAS $347 MILLION  COMPOSED OF $300 MILLION FOR THE PREFERRED STOCK

AND $47 MILLION FOR THE COMMON STOCK. THE MARKET VALUE OF CHEVRONTEXACOS SHARE

OF DYNEGY COMMON STOCK WAS $114 MILLION, BASED ON EQUIVALENT CLOSING MARKET

PRICES. NO QUOTED MARKET PRICE EXISTS FOR THE PREFERRED

STOCK. REFER TO DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK INVESTMENT ON PAGE FS-12 FOR A

DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 31,

2002.

FOR THE COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, IF FUTURE DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE

ARE DEEMED OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, A CHARGE WOULD BE RECORDED AGAINST INCOME.

HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF A TEMPORARY

DECLINE, OR ANY INCREASE, IN FAIR VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE

RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME AT

THE TIME OF REDEMPTION OR DISPOSITION OF THE SECURITY, OR IN THE EVENT OF A

FURTHER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

DECLINE IN ITS FAIR VALUE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK INVESTMENT

WAS APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION BELOW THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF

DYNEGY NET EQUITY. THIS DIFFERENCE WILL BE ACCRETED TO INCOME OVER THE

ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY

FUTURE IMPAIRMENT OF THE INVESTMENT.

AT THE REQUEST OF DYNEGY, ITS INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT IS CONDUCTING A

RE-AUDIT OF THE

1999-2001 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAS RESULTED THUS FAR IN CERTAIN

RESTATEMENTS OF PRIOR PERIODS. TO DATE, CHEVRONTEXACOS SHARE OF THE KNOWN

RESTATEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN MATERIAL AND, ACCORDINGLY, PRIOR PERIODS IN THE

ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED. UPON

CONCLUSION OF THE AUDIT, THE INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS WILL PERFORM REVIEWS OF

THE 2002 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THESE AUDITS AND

REVIEWS MAY REQUIRE FURTHER RESTATEMENTS BY DYNEGY. CHEVRONTEXACO WILL EVALUATE

THE EFFECTS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THAT TIME.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

WERE $3.8 BILLION AND $3.2

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN 2002 WAS $9.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $11.5 BILLION IN 2001 AND

$13.5 BILLION IN 2000. THE 2002 DECLINE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES MAINLY REFLECTED LOWER EARNINGS IN THE U.S. UPSTREAM AND WORLDWIDE

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES. CASH PROVIDED BY ASSET SALES WAS $2.3 BILLION IN 2002,

$0.3 BILLION IN 2001 AND $1.2 BILLION IN 2000. IN FEBRUARY 2002, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $2.2 BILLION, INCLUDING DIVIDENDS DUE, FROM THE

FTC-MANDATED SALE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN EQUILON AND MOTIVA. IN 2002,

THESE PROCEEDS AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES GENERATED

SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR THE COMPANYS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAM,

THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, AND A REDUCTION IN OVERALL DEBT

LEVELS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DIVIDENDS

CHEVRONTEXACO MADE PAYMENTS OF $2.991 BILLION, $2.858 BILLION

AND $2.789 BILLION FOR DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED

STOCK AND MINORITY INTERESTS IN

2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

DEBT, LEASE AND MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL DEBT AND

CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS WERE $16.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, DOWN FROM

$17.4 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2001. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD MINORITY INTEREST

OBLIGATIONS OF $303 MILLION, UP FROM

$283 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR,

CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT, TOTALED $9.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002, DOWN FROM $11.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2001. OF THESE TOTALS, $4.1 BILLION

AND $3.2 BILLION WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD,

RESPECTIVELY. SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS

NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2003, AS THE COMPANY HAS

THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO

REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE

COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REFINANCE ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER,

MAINTAINING LEVELS IT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE.

AT YEAR-END 2002, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD $4.1 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT

FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR BANKS, WHICH PERMIT THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE

FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND ALSO CAN BE USED FOR GENERAL

CREDIT REQUIREMENTS. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES

DURING THE YEAR OR AT

YEAR-END 2002.

DURING 2002, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE TOTAL VALUE OF SHELF

REGISTRATIONS ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) BY $2.0

BILLION, TO $4.8 BILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD THREE EXISTING

EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATIONS ON FILE WITH THE SEC THAT TOGETHER WOULD PERMIT

ADDITIONAL REGISTERED DEBT OFFERINGS UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $2.8 BILLION OF

SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY ISSUED $2.0 BILLION OF 3.5 PERCENT GUARANTEED NOTES DUE 2007

UNDER A SHELF REGISTRATION IN 2002. THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS ISSUE ARE EXPECTED

TO BE USED TO RETIRE COMMERCIAL

PAPER. REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2002 INCLUDED $250 MILLION OF TEXACO

NORTH SEA U.K. NOTES, $285 MILLION OF TEXACO CAPITAL INC. BONDS, $192 MILLION

OF NEW ZEALAND DEBT, $120 MILLION OF PHILIPPINE DEBT, $114 OF SOUTH AFRICAN DEBT

AND $100 MILLION OF CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION 8.11 PERCENT NOTES. THE CHANGE IN

LONG-TERM DEBT DURING 2002 ALSO INCLUDED A NONCASH REDUCTION OF $100 MILLION IN

THE COMPANY-GUARANTEED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) DEBT.

IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE COMPANY REDEEMED $200 MILLION OF TEXACO CAPITAL INC.

BONDS ORIGINALLY DUE IN 2033. UNDER A SHELF REGISTRATION ALSO IN FEBRUARY, THE

COMPANY ISSUED $750 MILLION OF

3.375 PERCENT BONDS DUE IN FEBRUARY 2008. THE COMPANY PLANS TO USE THE PROCEEDS

FROM THIS ISSUANCE TO PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS.

CHEVRONTEXACOS SENIOR DEBT IS RATED AA BY STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION

AND AA2 BY MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICE. BONDS ISSUED BY TEXACO INC. ARE RATED AA3.

CHEVRONTEXACOS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND

PRIME 1 BY MOODYS, AND THE COMPANYS CANADIAN COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED R-1

(MIDDLE) BY DOMINION BOND RATING SERVICE. ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE

HIGH-QUALITY, INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, THE CAPITAL-SPENDING PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM

ASSET DISPOSITIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS,

AND DURING PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW

MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY CHEMICALS, IT HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO

INCREASE BORROWINGS AND/OR MODIFY CAPITAL-SPENDING PLANS TO CONTINUE PAYING THE

COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE COMPANYS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS

BASED ON THE EXPECTED CHANGES IN PLAN ASSET VALUES AND

PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN 2003, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY SIGNIFICANT

FUNDING OF ITS PENSION PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED DURING THE YEAR. ADDITIONAL

FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS IF INVESTMENT RETURNS

ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN THE PLANS OBLIGATIONS. REFER ALSO TO

THE

DISCUSSION OF PENSION ACCOUNTING IN APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-15.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

FOR 2002 TOTALED $9.3 BILLION,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WERE $12.0 BILLION IN 2001 AND $9.5 BILLION IN 2000.

THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE

CASH OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY, WERE $1.4 BILLION, $1.7 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION

IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. EXPENDITURES OF $6.3 BILLION IN 2002 FOR

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES REPRESENTED 68 PERCENT OF TOTAL OUTLAYS

IN 2002, COMPARED WITH 59 PERCENT IN 2001 AND 66 PERCENT IN 2000.

INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION SPENDING OF $4.4 BILLION WAS 70

PERCENT OF WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION EXPENDITURES IN 2002, COMPARED

WITH 66 PERCENT IN 2001 AND 62 PERCENT IN 2000, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS

CONTINUING FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES.

EXPENDITURES IN 2002 INCLUDED LOWER ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AFFILIATES

THAN IN 2001, REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF THE COMPANYS SHARE OF EXPENDITURES IN

ITS EQUILON AND MOTIVA INVESTMENTS, WHICH WERE SOLD AS A CONDITION OF THE

MERGER. THE 2001 EXPENDITURES INCLUDED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN TCO AND

DYNEGY, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF $1.5 BILLION OF DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES 2003 CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WILL BE

$8.5 BILLION, WHICH IS ABOUT 8 PERCENT LOWER THAN EXPENDITURES IN 2002.

INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT IS ABOUT $1.6 BILLION IN AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES.

ABOUT $6.4 BILLION, OR 75 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, IS BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $4.7 BILLION OF THAT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION EXPENDITURES WILL TARGET THE MOST

PROMISING EXPLORATORY PROSPECTS IN NIGERIA, ANGOLA AND DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO

AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN KAZAKHSTAN,

VENEZUELA AND AFRICA. WORLDWIDE DOWNSTREAM SPENDING IS ESTIMATED TO BE $1.3

BILLION, WITH ABOUT $1.1 BILLION OF THE AMOUNT ON REFINING AND MARKETING AND

$200 MILLION ON TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. INVESTMENTS IN CHEMICALS ARE BUDGETED

AT $300 MILLION. ESTIMATES FOR POWER AND RELATED BUSINESSES ARE $300 MILLION,

DOWN FROM ABOUT $600 MILLION IN 2002. THE REMAINING $200 MILLION IS PRIMARILY

FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

FINANCIAL RATIOS

CURRENT RATIO

 CURRENT ASSETS DIVIDED BY CURRENT LIABILITIES. GENERALLY, TWO

ITEMS ADVERSELY AFFECT CHEVRONTEXACOS CURRENT RATIO, BUT IN THE COMPANYS

OPINION DO NOT AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY. FIRST, CURRENT ASSETS IN ALL YEARS

INCLUDED INVENTORIES VALUED ON A LIFO BASIS, WHICH AT YEAR-END 2002 WERE LOWER

THAN REPLACEMENT COSTS, BASED ON AVERAGE ACQUISITION COSTS DURING THE YEAR, BY

NEARLY $1.6 BILLION. SECOND, THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM LOWER INTEREST RATES

AVAILABLE ON SHORT-TERM DEBT BY CONTINUALLY REFINANCING ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATELY LARGE AMOUNT OF SHORT-TERM DEBT KEEPS

ITS CURRENT RATIO AT RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS.

INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO

 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS INTEREST

AND DEBT EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED INTEREST, DIVIDED BY

BEFORE-TAX INTEREST COSTS. CHEVRONTEXACOS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WAS LOWER IN

2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BEFORE-TAX INCOME PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

INTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES.

DEBT RATIO

 TOTAL DEBT DIVIDED BY TOTAL DEBT PLUS EQUITY. THIS RATIO WAS

34 PERCENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED TO 33.9 PERCENT A YEAR EARLIER.

*THE ABOVE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF CONTINGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALES OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUILON AND MOTIVA.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED

GUARANTEES, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF $1.038 BILLION FOR NOTES AND

OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND $806 MILLION FOR

THIRD PARTIES, AS DISCUSSED BY MAJOR CATEGORY BELOW. THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS BEING

CARRIED AS LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

OF THE GUARANTEES ISSUED IN REGARD TO AFFILIATES OPERATIONS, $775 MILLION

RELATES TO BORROWINGS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THESE

GUARANTEES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE LOWER INTEREST RATES AND GENERALLY COVER

THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF

THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THE 20032006 PERIOD, WITH THE

REMAINING GUARANTEES EXPIRING BY THE END OF 2015. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SHOULD AN AFFILIATE BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. THERE ARE

NO PROVISIONS FOR RECOURSE TO THIRD PARTIES, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS

COLLATERAL FOR THESE GUARANTEES.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES GUARANTEES OF $263 MILLION RELATING TO OBLIGATIONS IN

CONNECTION WITH PRICING OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS

COGENERATION AFFILIATES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY MAY

BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IF THE AFFILIATES DO NOT

PERFORM UNDER THE AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS FOR RECOURSE TO THIRD

PARTIES, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE PRICING GUARANTEES.

GUARANTEES OF $437 MILLION HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN REGARD TO OBLIGATIONS OF

THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO

HOST GOVERNMENTS IN THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. THE

REMAINING GUARANTEES OF $337 MILLION WERE PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY AS CONDITIONS OF

SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY TO THE GUARANTEED PARTIES AND IN CONNECTION WITH COMPANY MARKETING

PROGRAMS. NO AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES ARE

RECORDED AS LIABILITIES. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS GUARANTEED

WILL EXPIRE IN 2003, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPIRING AFTER 2007. THE COMPANY WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN OR CONTRACT TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS

DISCLOSED. APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE RECOURSE

PROVISIONS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO RECOVER ANY PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES FROM SECURITIES HELD OVER THE GUARANTEED PARTIES

ASSETS.

GUARANTEES OF $369 MILLION RELATE TO EQUILON DEBT AND LEASES. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN EQUILON, SHELL

OIL COMPANY AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE COMPANY AGAINST ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF

THESE GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THESE

GUARANTEES. GUARANTEES ON APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE DEBT AND LEASES WILL

EXPIRE WITHIN THE 20032007 PERIOD, WITH THE GUARANTEES OF THE REMAINING

AMOUNTS EXPIRING BY 2024.

INDEMNITIES

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA TO SHELL OIL COM-

FS-10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PANY AND SAUDI REFINING INC.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE

INVESTMENTS. THE INDEMNITIES COVER CONTINGENT GENERAL LIABILITIES, CERTAIN

CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNOCAL

PATENT LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SHOULD THE

CONTINGENT GENERAL LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LIABILITIES WITHIN 18 MONTHS OF

THE SALE AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE MAXIMUM FUTURE PAYMENTS OF $300 MILLION.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED LIABILITIES FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES. THERE ARE NO

RECOURSE PROVISIONS ENABLING RECOVERY OF ANY AMOUNTS FROM THIRD PARTIES NOR ARE

ANY ASSETS HELD AS COLLATERAL. WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE, AT

THE BUYERS OPTION, THE COMPANY ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE CERTAIN ASSETS

FROM SHELL OIL COMPANY FOR THEIR NET BOOK VALUE, AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF

THE COMPANYS PURCHASE.

THE INDEMNITIES PERTAINING TO THE CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATE TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA

JOINT VENTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION

OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PERIODS OF CHEVRONTEXACOS

OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE ENVIRONMENTAL

CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN

PRIOR TO DECEMBER 12, 2001. CLAIMS RELATING TO EQUILON MUST BE ASSERTED NO

LATER THAN FEBRUARY 13, 2009, AND CLAIMS RELATING TO MOTIVA MUST BE ASSERTED NO

LATER THAN FEBRUARY 13, 2012. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO

MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

RECORDED ANY LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. THE

AMOUNTS INDEMNIFIED ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS

AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT. THE COMPANY HOLDS NO ASSETS AS

COLLATERAL. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE ABOVE

INDEMNITIES.

SECURITIZATION

IN OTHER OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY

SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN ITS U.S. DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES). AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, REPRESENTING ABOUT 11 PERCENT OF

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED.

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE

EFFECT OF ACCELERATING CHEVRON-TEXACOS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS.

IN THE EVENT OF THE SPES EXPERIENCING MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF

RECEIVABLES, CHEVRONTEXACO BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO LOSS EXPOSURE

CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT

AGREEMENTS AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS,

THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO

SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THESE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND

SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF ESTIMATED PAYMENTS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED OVER THE LIFE

OF THE AGREEMENTS IS APPROXIMATELY $9 BILLION. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 55,000 BARRELS PER

DAY OF REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY AFFILIATE REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS

PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCING OF A REFINERY OWNED BY

THE AFFILIATE, WHICH IS DUE IN 2009. THE FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS UNDER

THIS CONTRACT ARE: 2003  $800 MILLION; 2004  $800 MILLION; 2005  $900

MILLION; 2006  $900 MILLION; 2007  $900 MILLION; 2008 AND 2009  $1.8

MINORITY INTERESTS

PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED BY SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES TO

THIRD PARTIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS MINORITY INTEREST. MVP PRODUCTION INC., A

SUBSIDIARY, HAS VARIABLE RATE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED SHARES OF $75 MILLION OWNED

BY ONE MINORITY HOLDER. THE SHARES ARE VOTING AND ARE REDEEMABLE IN 2003.

TEXACO CAPITAL LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, HAS ISSUED $65 MILLION

OF DEFERRED PREFERRED SHARES. DIVIDENDS OF $59 MILLION, EQUIVALENT TO AN

INTEREST RATE OF 7.17 PERCENT COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY, WILL BE PAID AT THE

REDEMPTION DATE OF FEBRUARY 28, 2005, UNLESS EARLIER REDEMPTION OCCURS.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRONTEXACO IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS

RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS AND

REFINERY FEEDSTOCK PRICES. THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO

MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE VOLATILITY ON A SMALL PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY,

INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE OR

SALE OF CRUDE OIL, FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR COMPANY REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL AND

REFINED PRODUCTS INVENTORIES, AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS TO SELL NATURAL GAS AND

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

CHEVRONTEXACO ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING

PURPOSES, AND THE RESULTS OF THIS ACTIVITY WERE NOT

FS-11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN 2002.

THE COMPANYS POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN

INTERNAL RISK CONTROL GROUP TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK

MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND

TRADING ACTIVITIES CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK

MERCANTILE EXCHANGE AND THE INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM EXCHANGE, CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS SWAP CONTRACTS, OPTIONS, AND OTHER DERIVATIVE PRODUCTS ENTERED INTO

PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL

SALE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED

PRINCIPALLY FROM MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT ON DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY OF A HYPOTHETICAL 15 PERCENT

CHANGE IN PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS. THE

HYPOTHETICAL LOSS ON THE RELATED COMMODITY CONTRACTS WAS ESTIMATED BY

CALCULATING THE CASH VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

HYPOTHETICAL AND CONTRACT DELIVERY PRICES, MULTIPLIED BY THE CONTRACT AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS,

GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180 DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED PURCHASE

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE

COMMITMENTS FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING

GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT ON FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAPS OF A HYPOTHETICAL ADVERSE

CHANGE OF 10 PERCENT TO YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES (A WEAKENING OF THE U.S.

DOLLAR) WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS

OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS HEDGING A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING

GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. DURING 2002, NO NEW SWAPS WERE INITIATED

IN CONNECTION WITH DEBT ISSUES IN THE YEAR. AT YEAR-END 2002, THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE MATURITY OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS APPROXIMATELY 5.6 YEARS.

A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES UPON THE INTEREST

RATE SWAPS WOULD CAUSE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RECEIVE FIXED SWAPS TO DECLINE.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK INVESTMENT

THE COMPANYS $1.5 BILLION INVESTMENT IN

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF DYNEGY WAS CARRIED AT AN

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $300 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. BECAUSE THE

INVESTMENT IS NOT PUBLICLY TRADED, AN ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR VALUE WAS REQUIRED.

THIS ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON A COMPARISON TO THE PRICING OF MARKETABLE DYNEGY

BONDS AND AN ADDED FACTOR FOR AN ESTIMATED LIQUIDITY DISCOUNT. OTHER

METHODOLOGIES COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A HIGHER OR LOWER FAIR-VALUE ESTIMATION.

SEE ALSO PAGE FS-8 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DYNEGY.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRONTEXACO ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED

PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE

LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, LONG-TERM

AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE WITH DYNEGY FOR THE PURCHASE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED

STATES, EXCLUDING ALASKA, AND THE SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS

FEEDSTOCKS TO THE COMPANYS U.S. REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS PLANTS. IN 2003,

CHEVRONTEXACO AND DYNEGY AGREED TO TERMINATE THE NATURAL GAS SALE AND PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS AT THE END OF JANUARY 2003. INTERNATIONALLY, THERE ARE LONG-TERM

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH THE COMPANYS REFINING AFFILIATE IN THAILAND.

SEE PAGE FS-11 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOREGOING

AGREEMENTS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT

WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

UNOCAL PATENT LITIGATION

CHEVRON, TEXACO AND FOUR OTHER OIL COMPANIES

(REFINERS) FILED SUIT IN 1995 CONTESTING THE VALIDITY OF A PATENT (393

PATENT) GRANTED TO UNOCAL CORPORATION (UNOCAL) FOR CERTAIN REFORMULATED

GASOLINE BLENDS. CHEVRONTEXACO SELLS REFORMULATED GASOLINES IN CALIFORNIA IN

CERTAIN MONTHS OF THE YEAR. IN MARCH 2000, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FEDERAL CIRCUIT UPHELD A SEPTEMBER 1998 DISTRICT COURT DECISION THAT UNOCALS

PATENT WAS VALID AND ENFORCEABLE AND ASSESSED DAMAGES OF 5.75 CENTS PER GALLON

FOR GASOLINE PRODUCED DURING THE SUMMER OF 1996, WHICH INFRINGED ON THE CLAIMS

OF THE PATENT. IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT CONCLUDED IT WOULD NOT

REVIEW THE LOWER COURTS RULING, AND THE CASE WAS SENT BACK TO THE DISTRICT

COURT FOR AN ACCOUNTING OF ALL INFRINGING GASOLINE PRODUCED AFTER AUGUST 1,

1996. THE DISTRICT COURT HAS NOW RULED THAT THE PER-GALLON DAMAGES AWARDED BY

THE JURY ARE LIMITED TO INFRINGEMENT THAT OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA ONLY.

ADDITIONALLY, THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) GRANTED TWO

PETITIONS BY THE REFINERS TO RE-EXAMINE THE VALIDITY OF UNOCALS 393 PATENT

AND HAS NOW TWICE REJECTED ALL OF THE CLAIMS IN THE 393 PATENT. THE DISTRICT

COURT JUDGE REQUESTED FURTHER BRIEFING AND ADVISED THAT SHE WOULD NOT ENTER A

FINAL JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE UNTIL THE USPTO HAD COMPLETED ITS RE-EXAMINATION OF

THE 393 PATENT. DURING 2002, THE USPTO ALSO REJECTED THE VALIDITY OF ANOTHER

UNOCAL PATENT, THE 126 PATENT, WHICH COULD AFFECT A LARGER SHARE OF U.S.

GASOLINE PRODUCTION. SEPARATELY, THE FTC HAS ISSUED AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT

ALLEGING THAT UNOCALS CONDUCT IN THIS MATTER REPRESENTED AN UNFAIR METHOD OF

COMPETITION, WHICH MAY MAKE UNOCALS PATENTS UNENFORCEABLE.

UNOCAL HAS OBTAINED ADDITIONAL PATENTS THAT COULD AFFECT A LARGER SHARE OF

U.S. GASOLINE PRODUCTION. CHEVRONTEXACO BELIEVES THESE ADDITIONAL PATENTS ARE

INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE AND/OR NOT INFRINGED. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL EXPOSURE

IN THE EVENT OF UNFAVORABLE CONCLUSIONS TO THE PATENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

REVIEWS MAY INCLUDE ROYALTIES, PLUS INTEREST, FOR PRODUCTION OF GASOLINE THAT

IS PROVED TO HAVE INFRINGED THE PATENTS. THE COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS

ON THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING OPERATIONS, WHILE PRESENTLY

INDETERMINABLE, COULD BE MATERIAL. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS BEEN ACCRUING IN THE

NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS ANY FUTURE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR POTENTIAL

INFRINGEMENT OF THE 393 PATENT COVERED BY THE 1998 TRIAL COURTS RULING. IN

2000, PRIOR TO THE MERGER, CHEVRON AND TEXACO MADE PAYMENTS TO

FS-12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNOCAL TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION FOR THE ORIGINAL COURT RULING,

INCLUDING INTEREST AND FEES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY

TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR

RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO: SUPERFUND SITES AND REFINERIES, OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS,

TERMINALS, AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR SOLD. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE DISPLAYS THE ANNUAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS BEFORE-TAX

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RESERVES, INCLUDING THOSE FOR SUPERFUND SITES. IN

2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED REMEDIATION

COSTS AT REFINED PRODUCTS MARKETING SITES AND VARIOUS CLOSED OR DIVESTED

FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES.

UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE SUPERFUND LAW, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

(EPA) HAS DESIGNATED CHEVRONTEXACO A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY, OR HAS

OTHERWISE INVOLVED THE COMPANY, IN THE REMEDIATION OF 420 HAZARDOUS WASTE

SITES. THE COMPANY MADE PROVISIONS OR PAYMENTS IN 2002 AND PRIOR YEARS FOR 293

OF THESE SITES. NO SINGLE SITE IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A MATERIAL LIABILITY

FOR THE COMPANY. FOR THE REMAINING SITES, INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT YET AT A STAGE

WHERE THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO QUANTIFY A PROBABLE LIABILITY OR DETERMINE A RANGE

OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE EXPOSURES. THE SUPERFUND LAW PROVIDES FOR JOINT AND

SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA

AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRONTEXACO TO ASSUME OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. REMEDIATION RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2002, 2001 AND 2000 FOR

SUPERFUND SITES WERE $95 MILLION, $62 MILLION AND $73 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ANOTHER ISSUE INVOLVING THE COMPANY IS THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRYS USE OF

METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE AND ITS POTENTIAL

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH SEEPAGE INTO GROUNDWATER. ALONG WITH OTHER OIL

COMPANIES, THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF

THE CHEMICAL MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES. THESE ACTIONS MAY REQUIRE

THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF

PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE

FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME

IN ANY ONE PERIOD. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS WORKED TO REDUCE THE USE OF MTBE IN

GASOLINE IT MANUFACTURES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

DIRECTED THAT MTBE BE PHASED OUT OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS BY THE END OF

2003, AND THE COMPANY INTENDS TO COMPLY WITH THIS MANDATE. BY MAY 2003, THE

COMPANY PLANS TO MARKET BRANDED GASOLINE THAT USES ETHANOL AS AN OXYGENATE

INSTEAD OF MTBE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WILL COMPLETE THE CHANGEOVER IN

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LATER IN THE YEAR.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL

LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO

PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE INDETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS

THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT

OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT

TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE THE AMOUNT OF

FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH

EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER PETROLEUM OR CHEMICALS COMPANIES.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT

AND RESTORATION OF ITS WORLDWIDE OIL AND GAS AND COAL PROPERTIES AT THE END OF

THEIR PRODUCTIVE LIVES. MANY OF THESE COSTS ARE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL

ISSUES. EXPENSE PROVISIONS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION BASIS. THE

RESERVES BALANCE AT YEAR-END 2002 WAS $2.3 BILLION AND IS INCLUDED IN

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION IN THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. PLEASE REFER TO PAGES FS-16 TO FS-17 FOR INFORMATION RELATING

TO THE COMPANYS 2003 IMPLEMENTATION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) STANDARD NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

FOR THE

COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS

FACILITIES, NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE

REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS REACH THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES, UNLESS A

DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS BEEN MADE.

SEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ON PAGE FS-14 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES

ANNUALLY. THESE LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

TAXING AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR

WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED. THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES

HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1996 FOR CHEVRONTEXACO (FORMERLY CHEVRON), THROUGH

1993 FOR CHEVRONTEXACO GLOBAL ENERGY INC. (FORMERLY CALTEX), AND THROUGH 1991

FOR TEXACO. CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1991

FOR CHEVRON AND THROUGH 1987 FOR TEXACO. SETTLEMENT OF OPEN TAX YEARS, AS WELL

AS TAX ISSUES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES, IS

NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION

OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY, AND IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ADEQUATE

PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME AND FRANCHISE TAXES FOR ALL YEARS UNDER

EXAMINATION OR SUBJECT TO FUTURE EXAMINATION.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN

ESTIMATED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY

RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONTEXACOS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM

RESERVE AT ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN

THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE OF

ESTIMATES EXIST FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES.

CHEVRONTEXACO CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY

AT APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. AT THE SAME TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT

THAT COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRONTEXACO IS

FS-13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $50 MILLION. THE

TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES

ARE UNCERTAIN.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE MAJOR

OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED

KINGDOM, NORWAY, DENMARK, FRANCE, PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND

SAUDI ARABIA, REPUBLIC OF CONGO, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, ANGOLA, NIGERIA,

CHAD, EQUATORIAL GUINEA, INDONESIA, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, CHINA, THAILAND,

VENEZUELA, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, SOUTH KOREA, THE

PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, AND SOUTH AFRICA. THE COMPANYS TCO AFFILIATE OPERATES

IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS CPCHEM AFFILIATE MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A WIDE

RANGE OF PETROCHEMICALS AND PLASTICS ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES IN EXISTENCE OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO

RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND BELGIUM.

THE COMPANYS DYNEGY AFFILIATE HAS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE

AFFECTED BY OTHER CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN

THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. FOR

INSTANCE, IN DECEMBER 2002, CALTEX OIL (SA)(PTY) LIMITED (CALTEX OIL (SA))

ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT WITH A SOUTH AFRICAN

CONSORTIUM OF BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PARTNERS. THE AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO

ULTIMATELY PROVIDE THE CONSORTIUM A 25 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN ALL ASPECTS

OF CALTEXS OPERATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA. IT IS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHETHER ANY

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO

INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED

BUSINESSES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS

AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN

THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND

THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY ALSO SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS

PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED OIL

AND GAS FIELDS. THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON

THE RESULTS OF FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITY AND/OR DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. IF THE

COMPANY DECIDES NOT TO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT, THE COSTS OF THESE WELLS ARE

EXPENSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD $450 MILLION OF SUSPENDED

EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, A DECREASE OF

$238 MILLION FROM 2001 AND $332 MILLION FROM 2000.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRONTEXACO RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS

TO CUSTOMERS, TRADING PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY

BODIES, HOST GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS, AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF

THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND MAY

TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR

OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE

ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE

COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER,

MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN

BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF

THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY

OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR

EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY OWNED

FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY.

AN OBLIGATION MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT

NON-CHEVRONTEXACO SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED

OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO FACILITIES

AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE

CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE AND/OR REMEDIAL

WORK TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY

THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRONTEXACO ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE

ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2002 AT $1.324 BILLION FOR ITS CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE $399 MILLION OF ENVIRONMENTAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $925 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTROL AND

ABATEMENT OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM ONGOING OPERATIONS.

FOR 2003, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED

AT $458 MILLION. THESE CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF

COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY

CONTAMINATED SITES.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

IN MAY 2002, THE SEC ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE: DISCLOSURE IN MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

ALTHOUGH THE SEC HAD NOT ISSUED A FINAL RULE BY MID-MARCH 2003, THE FOLLOWING

DISCUSSION HAS BEEN PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF THE GUIDELINES IN THE SEC RULE

PROPOSAL.

IF ADOPTED AS PROPOSED, THE RULE WOULD REQUIRE DISCLOSURES CONNECTED WITH

ESTIMATES A COMPANY MAKES IN APPLYING ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES. HOWEVER, SUCH

DISCUSSION WOULD BE LIMITED TO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, OR THOSE THAT

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES MEET TWO CRITERIA IN THE PROPOSAL: FIRST, THE ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATE MUST REQUIRE A COMPANY TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE IS MADE. SECOND, DIFFERENT

ESTIMATES THAT THE COMPANY REASONABLY COULD HAVE USED FOR THE ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE

REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, MUST HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BESIDE ESTIMATES THAT MEET THE CRITICAL

ESTIMATE CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN

PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALL ESTIMATES,

WHETHER OR NOT DEEMED CRITICAL, AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS

CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES

FS-14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN, INCLUDING FOR ESTIMATES NOT

DEEMED CRITICAL UNDER THE SEC RULE PROPOSAL.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX

BENEFITS BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF OIL

AND GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES THAT REQUIRE ... GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING

DATA (THAT) DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY (RESERVES) TO BE RECOVERABLE

IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING

CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. REFER

TO TABLE V RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION ON PAGES FS-51 AND FS-52 FOR THE

CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND TO

TABLE VII CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH

FLOWS FROM PROVED RESERVES ON PAGE FS-54 FOR ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE

VALUES FOR EACH YEAR-END 20002002, WHICH WERE BASED ON YEAR-END PRICES AT THE

TIME.

NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE

IMPORTANT TO THE TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE UPCOMING DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT

OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES INCLUDES

REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED RESERVE

QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES.

THE COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN

THIS DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RELATED TO ESTIMATES, UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-25. THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION

OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED

DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT WITH THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES MADE BY

THE COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF

PENSION PLAN EXPENSE AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FUNDING THE COMPANYS MAJOR

PENSION PLANS ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE

APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

(OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE FOR

QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN

DETERMINING OPEB EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

AND THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES USED IN THE CALCULATION OF BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS.

NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE FS-39 INCLUDES

INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002, ON THE COMPONENTS OF

PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE AND THE UNDERLYING DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL

AS THE FUNDED STATUS FOR THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS AT THE END OF 2002 AND

2001.

TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS,

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS

RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE, WHICH TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNTED

FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WAS 7.8 PERCENT, AS

COMPARED WITH RATES OF 8.8 PERCENT AND 10.0 PERCENT AT THE END OF 2001 AND

2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF THE U.S. PENSION PLAN

ASSETS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET

VALUES IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE

PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER THE PENSION ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS

THE THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS

FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND YET STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END

OF THE YEAR.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

AND PENSION EXPENSE IS BASED ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT INTEREST

RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY CALCULATED THE U.S. PENSION

OBLIGATIONS USING A 6.8 PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED AT THE

ENDS OF 2001 AND 2000 WERE 7.3 PERCENT AND 7.5 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT

RATE WOULD REDUCE PENSION PLAN EXPENSE AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE

FOR 2002 WAS $457 MILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN

ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS MAIN U.S. PENSION PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR A

SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED

TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2002 BY APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION. A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL

BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION. THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE

OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLDS FINANCIAL MARKETS.

BASED ON THE EXPECTED CHANGES IN PENSION PLAN ASSET VALUES AND PENSION

OBLIGATIONS IN 2003, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING OF

THE PENSION PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED DURING THE YEAR. FOR THE U.S. PLANS, THIS

DETERMINATION WAS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD OF THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA).

PENSION EXPENSE IS INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN

OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND

APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DEPENDING UPON THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE

DIFFERENT PLANS, EITHER A LONG-TERM PREPAID ASSET OR LONG-TERM LIABILITY IS

RECORDED FOR PLANS WITH OVERFUNDING OR UNDERFUNDING, RESPECTIVELY. ANY UNFUNDED

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN EXCESS OF RECORDED LIABILITIES IS RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SEE NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ON PAGE FS-40 FOR THE PENSION-RELATED BALANCE SHEET EFFECTS AT THE

END OF 2002 AND 2001.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2002 WAS $199 MILLION AND WAS

ALSO RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES IN ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

OPEB OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS 6.75 PERCENT  THE SAME DISCOUNT

RATE USED FOR U.S. PENSION OBLIGATIONS. THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND

RATES USED TO CALCULATE OPEB OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, START WITH A 12

PERCENT COST INCREASE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR IN 2002, GRADUALLY DROPPING OVER

FIVE YEARS TO A LONG-TERM ULTIMATE RATE-INCREASE ASSUMPTION OF 4.5 PERCENT FOR

2007 AND THEREAFTER. THE 12 PERCENT RATE ASSUMPTION FOR 2002 WAS PROVIDED BY

EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS. THE 4.5 PERCENT RATE-INCREASE ASSUMPTION AND DURATION TO

REACH THAT RATE IS A COMPANY ESTIMATE.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT-RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB

EXPENSE IN 2002, THE IMPACT OF A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR

THE COMPANYS MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR THE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY

OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB OBLIGATION, WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT. THE

SENSITIVITY OF OPEB EXPENSE TO DISCOUNT RATE CHANGES MAY VARY IN

FS-15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FUTURE

DEPENDING ON THE COMBINATION OF FACTORS THAT ENTER INTO THE DETERMINATION OF

OPEB EXPENSE IN ANY ONE PERIOD.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY ASSESSES ITS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND FOR

OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED PROVED

RESERVE QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY

PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING

EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL MARKET

SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS

AND REFINED PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE

BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND

LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

THE AMOUNT AND INCOME STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION OF MAJOR IMPAIRMENTS OF

PP&E FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002, ARE INCLUDED IN THE

COMMENTARY ON THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THIS DISCUSSION, AS WELL AS IN

NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE FS-28. AN ESTIMATE AS

TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN

USED IN THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT PRACTICABLE,

GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS

INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT

HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS, WHEREAS

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN NUMBER OF OTHER

ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

EQUITY METHOD, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY

INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT

FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE

TIME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE

DECLINE THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND

INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY AND

CALTEX AUSTRALIA. THE IMPAIRMENT OF DYNEGY IS DISCUSSED IN MD&A IN THE

EXPLANATION OF 2002 RESULTS FOR ALL OTHER ON PAGE FS-7, IN INFORMATION

RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY INC. ON PAGE FS-8, AND IN NOTES 4 AND 13 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE IMPAIRMENT OF CALTEX AUSTRALIA IS

DISCUSSED IN THE EXPLANATION OF 2002 RESULTS FOR INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ON

PAGE FS-6 AND IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TAKEN IN 2002 FOR DYNEGY AND CALTEX AUSTRALIA

COMMON STOCK INVESTMENTS WERE BASED ON FAIR VALUES DETERMINED FROM PUBLICLY

QUOTED PRICES. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED FOR THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK WAS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS OWN ESTIMATE OF THE

INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME, SINCE CHEVRONTEXACO WAS THE SOLE PREFERRED

STOCK SHAREHOLDER AND THE INSTRUMENT WAS NOT PUBLICLY TRADED. IN MAKING ITS

ESTIMATE, REFERENCE WAS MADE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PRICING OF MARKETABLE

DYNEGY BONDS AND AN ADDED FACTOR FOR AN ESTIMATED LIQUIDITY DISCOUNT. SEE ALSO

PAGE FS-12 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK.

DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON COMPANY EARNINGS WOULD HAVE RESULTED FROM MAKING

DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO THE INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY AND CALTEX

AUSTRALIA. WHILE THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN MAKING THE ASSESSMENTS

AS TO WHETHER DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE WERE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY WERE NOT

SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE RESULTED IN

NO IMPAIRMENTS BEING RECORDED, A GREATER OR LESSER AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGE,

AND/OR A DIFFERENCE IN THE TIMING OF ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN

RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF

REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION CAN

VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON

CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS,

REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION; THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION; AND IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF

CONTINGENCIES IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND

ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECORDS THESE LOSSES AS OPERATING EXPENSES

OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME. REFER TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION AND IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE FS-28

FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION AND

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER

31, 2002.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICAL

BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT MUST BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, BOTH

IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2001, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143). THIS NEW STANDARD WAS ADOPTED EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2003, AND APPLIES TO LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS. ADOPTION OF FAS 143 PRIMARILY AFFECTS

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ASSETS. FAS 143 DIFFERS IN

SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM CURRENT ACCOUNTING UNDER FAS 19, FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING COMPANIES. ADOPTION OF FAS

143 AFFECTS FUTURE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING OF THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

EXPENSES RELATED TO THESE OBLIGATIONS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2003, THE COMPANY

WILL REPORT AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $200 MILLION TO $250 MILLION FOR THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION BY ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE EFFECT

OF ADOPTION ALSO INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF

$2.6 BILLION AND $2.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT CHANGE, THE EFFECT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING

STANDARD ON 2003 NET INCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

WHAT THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FAS 19 ACCOUNTING. UPON ADOPTION, LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS, IF ANY, TO RETIRE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL,

LONG-LIVED ASSETS GENERALLY WERE NOT RECOGNIZED BECAUSE OF INDETERMINATE

SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENT. THEREFORE, INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION

EXISTS TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DATES AND TO APPLY THE

NET-PRESENT-VALUE TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION.

IN JULY 2002, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 146, ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES (FAS 146). THE STANDARD REQUIRES

COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES WHEN

THEY ARE INCURRED RATHER THAN AT THE DATE OF A COMMITMENT TO AN EXIT OR

DISPOSAL PLAN. EXAMPLES OF COSTS COVERED BY THE STANDARD INCLUDE LEASE

TERMINATION COSTS AND CERTAIN EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

A RESTRUCTURING, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, A PLANT CLOSING, OR OTHER EXIT OR

DISPOSAL ACTIVITY. THE STATEMENT REPLACES EITF (EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE OF

THE FASB) ISSUE NO. 94-3, LIABILITY RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE

TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS TO EXIT AN ACTIVITY (INCLUDING CERTAIN

COSTS INCURRED IN A RESTRUCTURING). FAS 146 IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO

EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 45, GUARANTORS

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT

GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS (FIN 45). THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF

FIN 45 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2002, AND ARE

INCLUDED IN NOTE 21, OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS, WHEREAS THE

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE

BASIS TO GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. AS THESE

REQUIREMENTS RELATE TO FUTURE EVENTS, THE EFFECT CANNOT BE DETERMINED.

IN DECEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 148, ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE (FAS 148), WHICH AMENDS

FASB STATEMENT NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. FAS 148

PERMITS TWO ADDITIONAL TRANSITION METHODS FOR ENTITIES THAT ADOPT THE

FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND

AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN BOTH ANNUAL AND INTERIM FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. CHEVRONTEXACO WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

(APB) OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, AND RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS IN ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS. THE AMENDED DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 148 HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (FIN 46). FIN 46 AMENDED ARB 51, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND ESTABLISHED STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING UNDER WHAT

CIRCUMSTANCES A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ITS

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FIN 46 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT VIES THAT THE

COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE BUT IN WHICH IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT

VARIABLE INTEREST. THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS OF FIN 46 APPLY IMMEDIATELY

TO VIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003. THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO

OLDER ENTITIES IN THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR OR INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE

15, 2003. CERTAIN OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLY IN ALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ISSUED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE VIE WAS

ESTABLISHED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ADOPTION OF FIN 46 WILL HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY.

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION  MERGER OF CHEVRON AND TEXACO

ON OCTOBER 9, 2001, TEXACO

INC. (TEXACO) BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON CORPORATION (CHEVRON)

PURSUANT TO A MERGER TRANSACTION, AND CHEVRON CHANGED ITS NAME TO CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION (CHEVRONTEXACO). THE COMBINATION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF

INTERESTS.

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO THE

MERGER, WITH ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AS IF CHEVRON AND TEXACO HAD ALWAYS BEEN

COMBINED. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM THE SEPARATE

PRESENTATIONS OF CHEVRON AND TEXACO. THE RECLASSIFICATIONS HAD NO IMPACT ON THE

AMOUNT OF NET INCOME OR STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL

MAJORITY-OWNED, CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES AFTER THE ELIMINATION OF SIGNIFICANT

INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATION ARE THE

ACCOUNTS OF THE CALTEX GROUP OF COMPANIES (CALTEX), A JOINT VENTURE OWNED 50

PERCENT EACH BY CHEVRON AND TEXACO PRIOR TO THE MERGER AND ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THE EQUITY METHOD BY BOTH COMPANIES.

GENERAL

CHEVRONTEXACO MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE,

FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS AND COAL MINING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, CHEVRONTEXACO HOLDS

INVESTMENTS IN POWER GENERATION AND GASIFICATION BUSINESSES. COLLECTIVELY,

THESE COMPANIES OPERATE IN APPROXIMATELY 180 COUNTRIES. PETROLEUM OPERATIONS

CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS;

REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINES, MARINE VESSELS,

MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICALS OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND

MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL

AND LUBE OIL ADDITIVES.

IN PREPARING ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY FOLLOWS

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS

REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL

AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND DISCLOSURE

OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. WHILE THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE

CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES SUBJECT IT TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE

IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT

OWNED. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A

SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO 50 PERCENT, OR

FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER

POLICY DECISIONS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT

ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE

ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY CURRENTLY IN

INCOME. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR THESE GAINS AND LOSSES.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN THERE ARE

INDICATIONS THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND THE

AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION

AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH

FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT

FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN

THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMON

STOCK OF EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR

VALUE. SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE

REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FOR OTHER THAN GOODWILL, DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING

EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE AMORTIZED TO INCOME GENERALLY

OVER THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS. DIFFERENCES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO GOODWILL ARE SUBJECT TO ASSESSMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL

TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY, GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE,

DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO APPLY

FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS AND

THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED NOT TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN CURRENT INCOME.

FOR THE COMPANYS TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATING

TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES, GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS  HEDGING A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED RATE DEBT  ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE

FOR SALE AND ARE IN HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS

THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE

BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

ARE BELOW MARKET. MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE

STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR OIL

AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS,

RELATED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED PENDING

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT

ARE ASSIGNED PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE CAPITALIZED FOR

WELLS THAT FIND COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE RESERVES THAT CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, PENDING ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) DECISIONS ON ADDITIONAL MAJOR

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, (2) THE RESULTS OF ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT ARE

UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED, AND (3) SECURING FINAL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR

DEVELOPMENT. OTHERWISE, WELL COSTS ARE EXPENSED IF A DETERMINATION AS TO

WHETHER PROVED RESERVES WERE FOUND CANNOT BE MADE WITHIN ONE YEAR FOLLOWING

COMPLETION OF DRILLING. ALL OTHER EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, ARE ASSESSED

FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THE

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER

ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES

BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN

ASSET, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OR PHYSICAL CHANGE

IN AN ASSET. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE.

IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION (INCLUDING PROVISIONS FOR FUTURE ABANDONMENT

AND RESTORATION COSTS) OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED.

DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE

RECOGNIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE

RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR

IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR COAL ARE DETERMINED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD AS THE PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED

COSTS OF ALL OTHER PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO

DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO

AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION.

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES AND FROM

SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING

OPERATIONS OR TO CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED.

GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND/OR CLEANUPS ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. OTHER THAN FOR ASSESSMENTS, THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF

THESE ACCRUALS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A FORMAL PLAN

OF ACTION, SUCH AS AN APPROVED REMEDIATION PLAN OR THE SALE OR DISPOSAL OF AN

ASSET. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL IS

BASED ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED.

FOR OIL, GAS AND COAL PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A PROVISION IS MADE THROUGH

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR ANTICIPATED ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION COSTS AT THE

END OF A PROPERTYS USEFUL LIFE. SEE ALSO NOTE 18 RELATED TO FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR CHEVRONTEXACO ON JANUARY 1, 2003.

FOR SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY FOR ITS SHARE OF

COSTS WHEN IT HAS BEEN NAMED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY (PRP) AND WHEN

AN ASSESSMENT OR CLEANUP PLAN HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THIS LIABILITY INCLUDES THE

COMPANYS OWN PORTION OF THE COSTS AND ALSO THE COMPANYS PORTION OF AMOUNTS

FOR OTHER PRPS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR

SHARE OF THE CLEANUP OBLIGATION.

THE COMPANY RECORDS THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ITS LIABILITY BASED ON ITS BEST

ESTIMATE OF FUTURE COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING

CURRENT REGULATIONS AS WELL AS THE COMPANYS OWN INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL

POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR REIMBURSEMENTS ARE

RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CURRENCY

TRANSLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION

EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALES OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUILON AND MOTIVA.

AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, EACH SHARE OF TEXACO COMMON STOCK WAS CONVERTED, ON

A TAX-FREE BASIS, INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.77 SHARES OF CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON

STOCK. APPROXIMATELY 425 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED,

REPRESENTING ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK

AFTER THE MERGER.

AS A CONDITION OF APPROVING THE MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

(FTC) REQUIRED THE DIVESTMENT OF CERTAIN TEXACO ASSETS: TEXACOS INVESTMENTS IN

ITS U.S. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION AFFILIATES, EQUILON ENTERPRISES

LLC (EQUILON) AND MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC (MOTIVA), AS WELL AS OTHER INTERESTS

IN

U.S. NATURAL GAS PROCESSING AND TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES AND GENERAL AVIATION

FUEL MARKETING.

AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, TEXACO PLACED ITS INTERESTS IN EQUILON AND

MOTIVA IN TRUST, AS REQUIRED BY THE FTC. BECAUSE THE COMPANY NO LONGER

EXERCISED SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THESE INVESTMENTS, THE ASSOCIATED

ACCOUNTING METHOD WAS CHANGED FROM EQUITY TO COST BASIS.

NET INCOME FOR 2001 INCLUDED A LOSS OF $643, NET OF A TAX BENEFIT OF $144

($0.61 PER COMMON SHARE  DILUTED), RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS THAT

WERE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF THE FTC APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AND OTHER ASSETS

THAT WERE MADE DUPLICATIVE BY THE MERGER. THE AFTER-TAX LOSS ON THESE

DISPOSITIONS WAS REPORTED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY ITEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH

POOLING-OF-INTERESTS ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS.

INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL AFTER-TAX LOSS WAS A LOSS OF $564 CONNECTED WITH THE

SALE OF INTERESTS IN EQUILON AND MOTIVA. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, WHICH CLOSED

IN FEBRUARY 2002, WERE APPROXIMATELY $2,200.

FOR BOTH ASSETS THAT WERE BEING SOLD BY ORDER OF THE FTC AND OTHER ASSETS

THAT WERE BEING DISPOSED OF BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE DUPLICATIVE BY THE MERGER,

THE TOTAL NET BOOK VALUE AT YEAR-END 2001 WAS $2,181. THIS AMOUNT WAS INCLUDED

IN CURRENT ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, AS

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE  MERGER RELATED. NET INCOME FOR 2001 ASSOCIATED WITH

ALL SUCH ASSETS SOLD AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER WAS APPROXIMATELY $375. THE

CORRESPONDING AMOUNT IN 2002 WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

NOTE 3.

EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING COSTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, THE COMPANY INCURRED SIGNIFICANT INCREMENTAL

EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED: EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS; INCREMENTAL PENSION AND

MEDICAL PLAN BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS; LEGAL, ACCOUNTING,

SEC FILING AND INVESTMENT BANKER FEES; EMPLOYEE AND OFFICE RELOCATIONS; AND THE

ELIMINATION OF REDUNDANT FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS. IN 2002, BEFORE-TAX

MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES WERE $576 ($386 AFTER TAX). IN 2001, SUCH EXPENSES WERE

$1,563 ($1,136 AFTER TAX). INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS WERE ACCRUALS OF $891 AND

$60 IN 2001 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, FOR SEVERANCE-RELATED BENEFITS FOR

APPROXIMATELY 4,500 EMPLOYEES AND OTHER MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES THAT WILL NOT

BENEFIT FUTURE OPERATIONS.

ACTIVITY FOR THIS MERGER-RELATED ACCRUAL BALANCE IS SUMMARIZED IN THE

RETAINED EARNINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $1,559

AND $ 2,015, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF

EQUITY AFFILIATES.

UPON THE MERGER OF CHEVRON AND TEXACO, THE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK OF

CHEVRONTEXACO WAS INCREASED FROM 2 BILLION SHARES OF $0.75 PAR VALUE TO 4

BILLION SHARES OF $0.75 PAR VALUE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT,

APPROXIMATELY 425 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED IN

EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF TEXACO COMMON STOCK BASED UPON AN

EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.77 OF A CHEVRONTEXACO SHARE FOR EACH TEXACO SHARE. TEXACOS

COMMON STOCK HELD IN TREASURY WAS CANCELED AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER.

IN 1998, IN CONNECTION WITH THE RENEWAL OF CHEVRONS STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

PLAN, CHEVRON DECLARED A DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION ON EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF ITS

COMMON STOCK OF ONE RIGHT TO PURCHASE PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK. SINCE THIS

DISTRIBUTION IN 1998, ALL NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF THE CORPORATIONS COMMON STOCK

HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHT, INCLUDING THE SHARES

ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER BETWEEN CHEVRON AND TEXACO. FOLLOWING THE

MERGER, THE CHEVRON STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN HAS CONTINUED AS THE STOCKHOLDER

RIGHTS PLAN OF CHEVRONTEXACO. THE RIGHTS ISSUED UNDER THE PLAN BECOME

EXERCISABLE, UNLESS REDEEMED EARLIER BY CHEVRONTEXACO, IF A PERSON OR GROUP

ACQUIRES OR OBTAINS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR COMMENCES A TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFER THAT WOULD

RESULT IN THAT PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRING 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, EITHER EVENT OCCURRING WITHOUT THE PRIOR CONSENT OF

CHEVRONTEXACO. THE CHEVRONTEXACO SERIES A PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK THAT

THE HOLDER OF A RIGHT IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE PURCHASE PRICE PAYABLE

UPON EXERCISE OF THE CHEVRONTEXACO RIGHT ARE BOTH SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT. THE

PERSON OR GROUP WHO ACQUIRED 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK WITHOUT THE PRIOR CONSENT OF CHEVRONTEXACO WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED

TO THIS PURCHASE.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED SO THAT THE

RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE IN NOVEMBER 2003, FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN THE INITIAL

EXPIRATION DATE IN NOVEMBER 2008.

THE RIGHTS MAY BE REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY AT 1 CENT PER RIGHT PRIOR TO THE

EXPIRATION DATE. THE RIGHTS DO NOT HAVE VOTING OR DIVIDEND RIGHTS AND UNTIL

THEY BECOME EXERCISABLE HAVE NO DILUTIVE EFFECT ON THE EARNINGS PER SHARE OF

THE COMPANY. FIVE MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS PREFERRED STOCK WERE

DESIGNATED SERIES A PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK AND RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE

UPON EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS. NO EVENT DURING 2002 MADE THE RIGHTS EXERCISABLE.

UNTIL JUNE 2001, THERE WERE 1,200 SHARES OF TEXACO CUMULATIVE VARIABLE

RATE PREFERRED STOCK, CALLED MARKET AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (MAPS),

OUTSTANDING, WITH AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF $300. THE MAPS WERE REDEEMED IN JUNE

2001, AT A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $250,000 PER SHARE, PLUS PREMIUM AND

ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, 30 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRONTEXACOS AUTHORIZED BUT

UNISSUED COMMON STOCK WERE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE

STOCKHOLDERS IN 1990. TO DATE, ALL OF THE PLANS COMMON STOCK REQUIREMENTS HAVE

BEEN MET FROM THE COMPANYS TREASURY STOCK, AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO ISSUANCES OF

RESERVED SHARES.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRONTEXACO IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS

RELATED TO PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS AND

REFINERY FEEDSTOCK.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THIS EXPOSURE

ON A SMALL PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING: FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF CRUDE OIL; FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR

COMPANY REFINERIES; CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS INVENTORIES; AND FIXED PRICE

CONTRACTS TO SELL NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING

PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A POLICY OF REQUIRING THAT AN INTERNATIONAL SWAPS

AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT GOVERN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED.

WHEN THE COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION

WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT

WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE

NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND A

REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RISK. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO

USE OTHER NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE, LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES  NET, AND DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER

NONCURRENT OBLIGATIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED AS EITHER SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES OR

PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS, WHEREAS TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE

REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED UNDER OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

NOTE 9. FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  CONTINUED

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY

WITH TERMS OF 180 DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED PURCHASE

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE

COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS

AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME. THESE ACTIVITIES

ARE REPORTED UNDER OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH

FLOWS.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS

OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES

REFLECTED IN INCOME.

DURING 2002, NO NEW SWAPS WERE INITIATED. AT YEAR-END 2002, THE INTEREST

RATE SWAPS OUTSTANDING RELATED TO FIXED-RATE DEBT, AND THEIR WEIGHTED AVERAGE

MATURITY WAS APPROXIMATELY 5.6 YEARS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLES OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH

GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED DIRECTLY IN INCOME AS PART OF INTEREST AND DEBT

EXPENSE. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED UNDER OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE

EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH

EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE

RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY

OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT

POLICY LIMITS THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT RISK. SIMILAR STANDARDS OF DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED

TO THE COMPANYS COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED

SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE DISPERSED AMONG THE COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE

WORLDWIDE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE

COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE

FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, LETTERS OF

CREDIT ARE THE PRINCIPAL SECURITY OBTAINED TO SUPPORT LINES OF CREDIT.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED EITHER FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR, IF NOT

AVAILABLE, THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE FAIR VALUES

REFLECT THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE

SETTLED AT YEAR-END.

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $7,296 AND $6,599 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $7,971

AND $7,097 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF $665 AND $930

HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $70 AND $2 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND U.S. DOLLAR MARKETABLE SECURITIES

IN DOMESTIC AND OFFSHORE PORTFOLIOS. EURODOLLAR BONDS, FLOATING-RATE NOTES,

TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS HELD. CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD FAIR VALUES OF $2,506 AND $2,449 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE BALANCES, $1,682 AND $1,446

AT THE RESPECTIVE YEAR-ENDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT HAD

AVERAGE MATURITIES UNDER 90 DAYS. THE REMAINDER, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE

SECURITIES, HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY 3.9 YEARS.

THE COMPANYS $1,500 INVESTMENT IN REDEEMABLE, CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

OF ITS DYNEGY AFFILIATE HAD AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $300 AT DECEMBER 31,

2002.

LITIGATION

UNOCAL

CHEVRON, TEXACO AND FOUR OTHER OIL COMPANIES (REFINERS) FILED SUIT IN

1995 CONTESTING THE VALIDITY OF A PATENT (393 PATENT) GRANTED TO UNOCAL

CORPORATION (UNOCAL) FOR CERTAIN REFORMULATED GASOLINE BLENDS. CHEVRONTEXACO

SELLS REFORMULATED GASOLINES IN CALIFORNIA IN CERTAIN MONTHS OF THE YEAR. IN

MARCH 2000, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT UPHELD A

SEPTEMBER 1998 DISTRICT COURT DECISION THAT UNOCALS PATENT WAS VALID AND

ENFORCEABLE AND ASSESSED DAMAGES OF 5.75 CENTS PER GALLON FOR GASOLINE PRODUCED

DURING THE SUMMER OF 1996, WHICH INFRINGED ON THE CLAIMS OF THE PATENT. IN

FEBRUARY 2001, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT CONCLUDED IT WOULD NOT REVIEW THE LOWER

COURTS RULING, AND THE CASE WAS SENT BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR AN

ACCOUNTING OF ALL INFRINGING GASOLINE PRODUCED AFTER AUGUST 1, 1996. THE

DISTRICT COURT HAS NOW RULED THAT THE PER-GALLON DAMAGES AWARDED BY THE JURY

ARE LIMITED TO INFRINGEMENT THAT OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, THE

U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) GRANTED TWO PETITIONS BY THE REFINERS

TO RE-EXAMINE THE VALIDITY OF UNOCALS 393 PATENT AND HAS TWICE REJECTED ALL

OF THE CLAIMS IN THE 393 PATENT. THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE REQUESTED FURTHER

BRIEFING AND ADVISED THAT SHE WOULD NOT ENTER A FINAL JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE

UNTIL THE USPTO ALSO HAD COMPLETED ITS RE-EXAMINATION OF THE 393 PATENT.

DURING 2002, THE USPTO ALSO REJECTED THE VALIDITY OF ANOTHER UNOCAL PATENT, THE

126 PATENT, WHICH COULD AFFECT A LARGER SHARE OF U.S. GASOLINE PRODUCTION.

SEPARATELY, THE FTC HAS ISSUED AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT

UNOCALS CONDUCT IN THIS MATTER REPRESENTED AN UNFAIR METHOD OF COMPETITION,

WHICH MAY MAKE UNOCALS PATENTS UNENFORCEABLE.

UNOCAL HAS OBTAINED ADDITIONAL PATENTS THAT COULD AFFECT A LARGER SHARE OF

U.S. GASOLINE PRODUCTION. CHEVRONTEXACO BELIEVES THESE ADDITIONAL PATENTS ARE

INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE AND/OR NOT INFRINGED. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL EXPOSURE

IN THE EVENT OF UNFAVORABLE CONCLUSIONS TO THE PATENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

REVIEWS MAY INCLUDE ROYALTIES, PLUS INTEREST, FOR PRODUCTION OF GASOLINE THAT

IS PROVED TO HAVE INFRINGED THE PATENTS. THE COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS

ON THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING OPERATIONS, WHILE PRESENTLY

INDETERMINABLE, COULD BE MATERIAL. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS BEEN ACCRUING IN THE

NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS ANY FUTURE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR POTENTIAL

INFRINGEMENT OF THE 393 PATENT COVERED BY THE 1998 TRIAL COURTS RULING. IN

2000, PRIOR TO THE MERGER, CHEVRON AND TEXACO MADE PAYMENTS TO UNOCAL TOTALING

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION FOR THE ORIGINAL COURT RULING, INCLUDING INTEREST AND

FEES.

MTBE

ANOTHER ISSUE INVOLVING THE COMPANY IS THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRYS USE OF

METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE AND ITS POTENTIAL

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH SEEPAGE INTO GROUNDWATER. ALONG WITH OTHER OIL

COMPANIES, THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF

THE CHEMICAL MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES. THESE ACTIONS MAY REQUIRE

THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF

PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE

FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME

IN ANY ONE PERIOD. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS WORKED TO REDUCE THE USE OF MTBE IN

GASOLINE IT MANUFACTURES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

DIRECTED THAT MTBE BE PHASED OUT OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS BY THE END OF

2003, AND THE COMPANY INTENDS TO COMPLY WITH THIS MANDATE. BY MAY 2003, THE

COMPANY PLANS TO MARKET BRANDED GASOLINE THAT USES ETHANOL AS AN OXYGENATE

INSTEAD OF MTBE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WILL COMPLETE THE CHANGEOVER IN

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LATER IN THE YEAR.

IN 2002, THE BEFORE-TAX LOSS, INCLUDING RELATED CORPORATE AND OTHER

CHARGES, FOR U.S. OPERATIONS WAS $2,140, COMPARED WITH BEFORE-TAX INCOME OF

$1,778 IN 2001 AND $5,823 IN 2000. FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, BEFORE-TAX

INCOME WAS $6,296, $6,513 AND $8,226 IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. U.S.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS REDUCED BY $208, $202 AND $165 IN 2002, 2001 AND

2000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR BUSINESS TAX CREDITS.

THE ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE A CURRENT U.S. TAX BENEFIT OF $2 AND A

U.S. DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF $142 ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY ITEM IN

THE INCREASE IN THE 2002 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS DUE TO A NUMBER OF

FACTORS. THE PRIMARY REASON WAS THAT U.S. BEFORE-TAX INCOME (GENERALLY SUBJECT

TO A LOWER TAX RATE) WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL

BEFORE-TAX INCOME IN 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001. PRIOR-YEAR TAX ADJUSTMENTS AROSE

FROM REVISIONS TO DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND OTHER TAX RELATED

ACCRUALS. THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY AND CALTEX AUSTRALIA WERE

CAPITAL LOSSES FOR WHICH NO OFFSETTING CAPITAL GAINS WERE AVAILABLE.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS DEFERRED TAXES ON A TAX-JURISDICTION BASIS AND

CLASSIFIES THOSE NET AMOUNTS AS CURRENT OR NONCURRENT BASED ON THE BALANCE

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY FOR SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDED IN THE U.S.

CONSOLIDATED TAX RETURN TO RECORD INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS THOUGH THEY FILED

SEPARATELY, WITH THE PARENT RECORDING THE ADJUSTMENT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR

THE EFFECTS OF CONSOLIDATION. INCOME TAXES ARE ACCRUED FOR RETAINED EARNINGS OF

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND CORPORATE JOINT VENTURES INTENDED TO BE

REMITTED. INCOME TAXES ARE NOT ACCRUED FOR UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OR ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES FOR WHICH NO DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR

POSSIBLE FUTURE REMITTANCES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $10,108 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS EARNINGS REINVESTED AS PART OF THE

COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF

TAXES THAT MIGHT BE PAYABLE ON THE EVENTUAL REMITTANCE OF SUCH EARNINGS. ON

REMITTANCE, CERTAIN COUNTRIES IMPOSE WITHHOLDING

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON A PORTION OF

ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTE 9 FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANYS

DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD $4,110 OF COMMITTED CREDIT

FACILITIES WITH BANKS WORLDWIDE, WHICH PERMIT THE COMPANY TO REFINANCE

SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE FACILITIES SUPPORT THE

COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. INTEREST ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERMS

OF SPECIFIC

AGREEMENTS MAY BE BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE, THE RESERVE

ADJUSTED DOMESTIC CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT RATE OR BANK PRIME RATE. NO AMOUNTS

WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE CREDIT AGREEMENTS DURING 2002 OR AT YEAR-END.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED $4,110 AND $3,200,

RESPECTIVELY, OF SHORT-TERM DEBT AS LONG-TERM. SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS

IS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2003, AS THE COMPANY

HAS BOTH THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO REFINANCE THIS DEBT ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2001, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143). THIS NEW STANDARD WAS ADOPTED EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2003, AND APPLIES TO LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS. ADOPTION OF FAS 143 PRIMARILY AFFECTS

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ASSETS. FAS 143 DIFFERS IN

SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM CURRENT ACCOUNTING UNDER FAS 19, FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING COMPANIES. ADOPTION OF FAS

143 AFFECTS FUTURE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING OF THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

EXPENSES RELATED TO THESE OBLIGATIONS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2003, THE COMPANY

WILL REPORT AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $200 TO $250 FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THIS

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE EFFECT OF

ADOPTION BY ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION ALSO INCLUDED AN

INCREASE OF TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF $2.6 BILLION AND $2.8

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT CHANGE, THE EFFECT OF

THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON 2003 NET INCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FAS 19 ACCOUNTING. UPON

ADOPTION, LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, IF ANY, TO RETIRE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS GENERALLY WERE NOT RECOGNIZED BECAUSE OF

INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENT. THEREFORE,

INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION EXISTS TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT DATES AND

TO APPLY THE NET-PRESENT-VALUE TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

IN JULY, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 146, ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES (FAS 146). THE STANDARD REQUIRES

COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES WHEN

THEY ARE INCURRED RATHER THAN AT THE DATE OF A COMMITMENT TO AN EXIT OR

DISPOSAL PLAN. EXAMPLES OF COSTS COVERED BY THE STANDARD INCLUDE LEASE

TERMINATION COSTS AND CERTAIN EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

A RESTRUCTURING, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, A PLANT CLOSING, OR OTHER EXIT OR

DISPOSAL ACTIVITY. THE STATEMENT REPLACES EITF (EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE OF

THE FASB) ISSUE NO. 94-3, LIABILITY RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE

TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS TO EXIT AN ACTIVITY (INCLUDING CERTAIN

COSTS INCURRED IN A RESTRUCTURING). FAS 146 IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO

EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002.

IN NOVEMBER, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 45, GUARANTORS

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT

GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS (FIN 45). THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF

FIN 45 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2002, AND ARE

INCLUDED IN NOTE 21. THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE

APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER

31, 2002. AS THESE REQUIREMENTS RELATE TO FUTURE EVENTS, THE EFFECT CANNOT BE

DETERMINED.

IN DECEMBER, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT NO. 148, ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE (FAS 148), WHICH AMENDS

FASB STATEMENT NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. FAS 148

PERMITS TWO ADDITIONAL TRANSITION METHODS FOR ENTITIES THAT ADOPT THE

FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND

AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN BOTH ANNUAL AND INTERIM FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. CHEVRONTEXACO WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

(APB) OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, AND RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS IN ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS. THE AMENDED DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 148 HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (FIN 46). FIN 46 AMENDED ARB 51, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND ESTABLISHED STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING UNDER WHAT

CIRCUMSTANCES A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ITS

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FIN 46 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT VIES THAT THE

COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE BUT IN WHICH IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT

VARIABLE INTEREST. THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS OF FIN 46 APPLY IMMEDIATELY

TO VIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003. THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO

OLDER ENTITIES IN THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR OR INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE

15, 2003. CERTAIN OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLY IN ALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ISSUED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE VIE WAS

ESTABLISHED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ADOPTION OF FIN 46 WILL HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY.

NOTE 19.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE

INSURANCE PLANS FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY

TYPICALLY FUNDS ONLY THOSE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WHERE LEGAL FUNDING IS

REQUIRED. IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS INCLUDES ALL QUALIFIED PLANS SUBJECT TO

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT FUND DOMESTIC NONQUALIFIED PLANS OR INTERNATIONAL PLANS

THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY LEGAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THE AGGREGATED FUNDED

STATUS FOR THE FUNDED AND UNFUNDED PENSION PLANS IS DEPICTED IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE.

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION FOR MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS ARE

LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF ACTUAL MEDICAL AND DENTAL CLAIMS OR A DEFINED FIXED

PER-CAPITA AMOUNT. LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY, AND ANNUAL

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE BASED ON ACTUAL PLAN EXPERIENCE. NONFUNDED PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE PAID DIRECTLY WHEN INCURRED; ACCORDINGLY, THESE

PAYMENTS ARE NOT REFLECTED AS CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

COMPONENT OF THE EMPLOYEES THRIFT PLAN OF TEXACO INC. THE THRIFT PLAN LESOP

PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL

LESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE COMPUTATIONS.

EXPENSE RECORDED FOR THE LESOPS WAS $98, $75 AND $26 IN 2002, 2001 AND

2000, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $32, $43 AND $48 OF INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO

RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY MADE LESOP CONTRIBUTIONS OF $102, $75 AND $1 IN 2002, 2001 AND

2000, RESPECTIVELY, TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE IN EXCESS OF DIVIDENDS

RECEIVED BY THE LESOP. THE LESOP SHARES WERE PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE

PLANS. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE SHARES, OR USE THE DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES, TO

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLANS

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS TWO INCENTIVE PLANS, THE

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN (MIP) AND THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) FOR

OFFICERS AND OTHER REGULAR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. THE PLANS WERE

EXPANDED IN 2002 TO INCLUDE FORMER EMPLOYEES OF TEXACO AND CALTEX. THE MIP IS

AN ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PLAN THAT LINKS AWARDS TO PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE CASH AWARDS MAY BE DEFERRED BY CONVERSION TO STOCK UNITS OR

OTHER INVESTMENT FUND ALTERNATIVES. AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF,

BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, STOCK UNITS AND

NONSTOCK GRANTS. TEXACO ALSO HAD A CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND A STOCK INCENTIVE

PLAN (SIP) THAT INCLUDED STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER INCENTIVE

AWARDS FOR EXECUTIVES, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES. AWARDS UNDER THE CALTEX

LTIP WERE IN THE FORM OF PERFORMANCE UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLANS, EXCLUDING

EXPENSE RELATED TO LTIP AND SIP STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS, THAT

ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 20, WERE $48, $101 AND $83 IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER INCENTIVE PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES WITH AN ANNUAL CASH BONUS IF THE COMPANY ACHIEVES CERTAIN FINANCIAL

AND SAFETY GOALS. CHARGES FOR THE PROGRAM WERE $158, $154 AND $230 IN 2002,

2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 20.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANY APPLIES APB OPINION NO. 25 AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN

ACCOUNTING FOR ITS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED

BELOW. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (CREDIT) EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH

THESE PROGRAMS WAS $(2), $111 AND $23 IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRO FORMA EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, HAD THE COMPANY

APPLIED THE FAIR-VALUE-RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF FAS NO. 123, ARE SHOWN IN NOTE

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN 1998, CHEVRON GRANTED TO ALL ITS ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES AN OPTION THAT VARIED FROM 100 TO 300 SHARES OF STOCK OR EQUIVALENTS,

DEPENDENT ON THE EMPLOYEES SALARY OR JOB GRADE. THESE OPTIONS VESTED AFTER TWO

YEARS IN FEBRUARY 2000. OPTIONS FOR 4,820,800 SHARES WERE AWARDED AT AN

EXERCISE PRICE OF $76.3125 PER SHARE. OUTSTANDING OPTION SHARES WERE 3,064,367

AT YEAR-END 2000. EXERCISES OF 653,096 AND FORFEITURES OF 44,960 REDUCED THE

OUTSTANDING OPTION SHARES TO 2,366,311 AT THE END OF 2001. IN 2002, EXERCISES

OF 295,985 AND FORFEITURES OF 61,151 REDUCED THE OUTSTANDING OPTION SHARES TO

2,009,175 AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE OPTIONS EXPIRE FEBRUARY 11, 2008. THE

COMPANY RECORDED (CREDIT) EXPENSE OF $(2), $1 AND $(2) FOR THESE OPTIONS IN

2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION SHARE ON THE DATE OF GRANT UNDER FAS NO. 123

WAS ESTIMATED AT $19.08 USING THE AVERAGE RESULTS OF BLACK-SCHOLES MODELS FOR

THE PRECEDING 10 YEARS. THE 10-YEAR AVERAGES OF EACH ASSUMPTION USED BY THE

BLACK-SCHOLES MODELS WERE: A RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 7.0 PERCENT, A DIVIDEND

YIELD OF 4.2 PERCENT, AN EXPECTED LIFE OF SEVEN YEARS AND A VOLATILITY OF 24.7

PERCENT.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP EXTEND FOR 10

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE WITH OPTIONS GRANTED IN JUNE 2002, ONE

THIRD OF THE OPTIONS VEST ON EACH OF THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES

OF THE DATE OF GRANT. PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE, OPTIONS GRANTED BY CHEVRON VESTED

ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED BY TEXACO UNDER ITS SIP

VESTED OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD AT A RATE OF 50 PERCENT EACH YEAR. THE MAXIMUM

NUMBER OF SHARES THAT MAY BE GRANTED EACH YEAR IS 1 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL

OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS OF JANUARY 1 OF SUCH YEAR.

ON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER ON OCTOBER 9, 2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS

GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRONTEXACO OPTIONS AT THE

MERGER EXCHANGE RATE OF 0.77. THESE OPTIONS RETAINED A PROVISION FOR RESTORED

OPTIONS. THIS FEATURE ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISES A STOCK OPTION BY

EXCHANGING PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED COMMON STOCK OR WHO HAS SHARES WITHHELD TO

SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER

OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE RESTORED OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX

MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE IS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE

OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED OPTION IS GRANTED. RESTRICTED

SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE FORMER TEXACO PLAN CONTAINED A PERFORMANCE ELEMENT

THAT HAD TO BE SATISFIED IN ORDER FOR ALL OR A SPECIFIED PORTION OF THE SHARES

TO VEST. UPON THE MERGER, ALL RESTRICTED SHARES BECAME VESTED AND CONVERTED TO

CHEVRONTEXACO SHARES AT THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.77. APART FROM THE

RESTORED OPTIONS, NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE FORMER TEXACO

PLANS. AMOUNTS CHARGED TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

INCLUDING THE FORMER TEXACO PLANS, WERE $0, $110 AND $25, RESPECTIVELY.

SECURITIZATION

IN OTHER OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY

SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN ITS DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES). AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, APPROXIMATELY $1,000, REPRESENTING ABOUT 11 PERCENT OF

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED.

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS APPROXIMATELY $75. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT OF

ACCELERATING CHEVRONTEXACOS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE

EVENT OF THE SPES EXPERIENCING MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES,

CHEVRONTEXACO WOULD HAVE NO LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT

AGREEMENTS AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE

AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE

CAPACITY, UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS

UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE 2003  $1,320; 2004  $1,257; 2005 

$1,274; 2006

 $1,109; 2007  $1,096; 2008 AND AFTER  $2,798. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE

AGREEMENTS WERE $1,188 IN 2002, $1,509 IN 2001 AND $1,506 IN 2000. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE

APPROXIMATELY 55,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY

AFFILIATE REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH

THE FINANCING OF A REFINERY OWNED BY THE AFFILIATE AND EXPIRES IN 2009. THE

FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT ARE: 2003  $800; 2004  $800;

2005  $900; 2006  $900; 2007  $900; 2008 AND 2009  $1,800.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PREFERRED SHARES

OF SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS MINORITY INTEREST. MVP

PRODUCTION INC., A SUBSIDIARY, HAS VARIABLE RATE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED SHARES OF

$75 OWNED BY ONE MINORITY HOLDER. THE SHARES ARE VOTING AND ARE REDEEMABLE IN

2003. TEXACO CAPITAL

LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, HAS ISSUED $65 OF DEFERRED PREFERRED

SHARES, SERIES C. DIVIDENDS AMOUNTING TO $59 ON SERIES C, AT A RATE OF 7.17

PERCENT COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY, WILL BE PAID AT THE REDEMPTION DATE OF FEBRUARY

28, 2005, UNLESS EARLIER REDEMPTION OCCURS. EARLY REDEMPTION MAY RESULT UPON

THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIC EVENTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY

TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR

RELEASE OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING BUT

NOT LIMITED TO: SUPERFUND SITES AND REFINERIES, OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS,

TERMINALS, AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR SOLD. THE

AMOUNT OF SUCH FUTURE COST IS INDETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN

MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS

LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH

SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED

FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE,

THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE

COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH

EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICALS CONCERNS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS NO MATERIAL MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO ITS

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF ITS COMMODITIES AND

OTHER DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND INTEREST

RATE SWAPS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF

CERTAIN EQUITY AFFILIATES MAY BE AFFECTED BY THEIR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

INVOLVING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE

SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA,

THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY, DENMARK, FRANCE, PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN

NOTE 21. OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  CONTINUED

INDONESIA, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, THE PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, CHINA, THAILAND, VENEZUELA,

ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO AND SOUTH KOREA. THE COMPANYS

TENGIZCHEVROIL AFFILIATE OPERATES IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS CHEVRON PHILLIPS

CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC AFFILIATE MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF

PETROCHEMICALS AND PLASTICS ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

IN EXISTENCE OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO,

SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND BELGIUM. THE

COMPANYS DYNEGY AFFILIATE HAS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE

AFFECTED BY OTHER CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN

THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. FOR

INSTANCE, IN DECEMBER 2002, CALTEX OIL (SA) (PTY) LIMITED (CALTEX OIL (SA))

ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT WITH A SOUTH AFRICAN

CONSORTIUM OF BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PARTNERS. THE AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO

ULTIMATELY PROVIDE THE CONSORTIUM A 25 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN ALL ASPECTS

OF CALTEXS OPERATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA. IT IS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHETHER ANY

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO

INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY- OR WHOLLY-OWNED

BUSINESSES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS

AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN

THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND

THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS, AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN

ESTIMATED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY

RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONTEXACOS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM

RESERVE AT ELK HILLS IN CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS

IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE

REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES. CHEVRONTEXACO

CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT LESS THAN

$200. AT THE SAME TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO

CHEVRONTEXACO IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN $50. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND

THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRONTEXACO RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS

TO CUSTOMERS, TRADING PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY

BODIES, HOST GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS, AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF

THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE

LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR

OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE

ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE

COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER,

MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED UNDERGROUND OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND CHANGES

THERETO FOR THE YEARS 2002, 2001 AND 2000 ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH

SCIENTISTS AND RESERVOIR ENGINEERS. THESE PROVED RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE REVIEWED

ANNUALLY BY THE COMPANYS RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT RIGOROUS

PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND THE RESERVES DEFINITIONS PRESCRIBED BY THE U.S.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE

COMPANY.

PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING

DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS

FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS. DUE TO

THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES

OF UNDERGROUND RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES THAT MAY RESULT FROM

EXTENSIONS OF CURRENTLY PROVED AREAS OR FROM APPLYING SECONDARY OR TERTIARY

RECOVERY PROCESSES NOT YET TESTED AND DETERMINED TO BE ECONOMIC.

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THE QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED

THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS.

NET RESERVES EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE

ESTIMATE.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES,

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA

ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATHABASCA PROJECT. FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES,

CHEVRONTEXACO VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF

TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

REGULATIONS DEFINE THESE RESERVES AS MINING-RELATED AND NOT A PART OF

CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES. NET PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES WERE 183

MILLION BARRELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. PRODUCTION BEGAN IN LATE 2002.

THE OIL SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF

DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES, WHICH

IS FOUND ON PAGE FS-53.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES  CONTINUED

UNAUDITED

TABLE VI  STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE

PRECEDING PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF FAS NO. 69. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCTION ARE

COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF

ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE LIMITED TO THOSE

PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING

YEAR. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED FUTURE

EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED

RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF YEAR-END

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING

APPROPRIATE YEAR-END STATUTORY TAX RATES. THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE

DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PRETAX NET CASH

FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF RELATED ASSETS.

DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE CALCULATED USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD

DISCOUNT FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN FUTURE

EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE

COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

ESTIMATES OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS

NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES,

WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE

ARBITRARY VALUATION PRESCRIBED UNDER FAS NO. 69 REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS

ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN

INDICATION OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL AND GAS

RESERVES.
