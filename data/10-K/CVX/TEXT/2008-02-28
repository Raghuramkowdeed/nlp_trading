of chevron corporation contains forward-looking statements
relating to chevrons operations that are based on
managements current expectations, estimates and
projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
energy-related industries. words such as
anticipates, expects,
intends, plans, targets,
projects, believes, seeks,
schedules, estimates,
budgets and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. these statements are
not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
our control and are difficult to predict. therefore, actual
outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. the
reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
unless legally required, chevron undertakes no obligation to
update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.
among the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
are crude oil and natural gas prices; refining margins and
marketing margins; chemicals margins; actions of competitors;
timing of exploration expenses; the competitiveness of alternate
energy sources or product substitutes; technological
developments; the results of operations and financial condition
of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the
companys joint-venture partners to fund their share of
operations and development activities; the potential failure to
achieve expected net production from existing and future crude
oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in
the development, construction or
start-up of
planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of
the companys net production or manufacturing facilities or

political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude-oil
production quotas that might be imposed by opec (organization of
petroleum exporting countries); the potential liability for
remedial actions under existing or future environmental
regulations and litigation; significant investment or product
changes under existing or future environmental statutes,
regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting
from pending or future litigation; the companys
acquisition or disposition of assets; gains and losses from
asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales,
divestitures, recapitalizations, changes in fiscal terms or
restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency
movements compared with the u.s.dollar; the effects of
changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting
principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors
set forth under the heading risk factors on pages 32
and 33 in this report. in addition, such statements could be
affected by general domestic and international economic and
political conditions. unpredictable or unknown factors not
discussed in this report could also have material adverse
effects on forward-looking statements.

summary
description of chevron
chevron
corporation,1
a delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
management and technology support to u.s.and international
subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
generation and energy services. exploration and production
(upstream) operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural
gas. refining, marketing and transportation (downstream)
operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail
car. chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing
of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and
fuel and lubricant oil additives.
on august10, 2005, the company acquired unocal corporation
(unocal), an independent oil and gas exploration and production
company. discussion of the unocal acquisition is in note2
on
pagefs-34.
a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pages e-4
and e-5. as
of december31, 2007, chevron had approximately
65,000employees (including about 6,000 service station
employees). approximately 31,000, or 48percent, of the
companys employees were employed in u.s.operations.
overview
of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
control over some of them. governmental policies, particularly
in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
their operations and formulate their products and, in some
cases, limiting their profits directly. prices for crude oil and
natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
determined by supply and demand for these commodities. however,
some governments impose price controls on refined products such
as gasoline or diesel fuel. the members of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec) are typically the
worlds swing producers of crude oil, and their production
levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
other energy sources also play a significant part. seasonality
is not a primary driver to changes in the companys
quarterly earnings during the year.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron
competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies,
as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the
acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other
properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop
and operate those properties. in its downstream business,
chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum
companies and other independent refining, marketing and
transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various
goods or services in many national and international markets.
1incorporated
in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the
company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and
chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. in 2005, chevrontexaco
corporation changed its name to chevron corporation. as used in
this report, the term chevron and such terms as
the company, the corporation,
our, we and us may refer to
chevron corporation, one or more of its consolidated
subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
otherwise, it does not include affiliates of
chevron i.e., those companies accounted for by the
equity method (generally owned 50percent or less) or
investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms
are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.

with operations in north america, south america, europe, africa,
the middle east, asia and australasia. tabulations of segment
sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes

capital
and exploratory expenditures
total reported expenditures for 2007 were $20billion,
including $2.3billion for chevrons share of
expenditures by affiliated companies, which did not require cash
outlays by the company. in 2006 and 2005, expenditures were
$16.6billion and $11.1billion, respectively,
including the companys share of affiliates
expenditures of $1.9billion and $1.7billion in the
corresponding periods. the 2005 amount excludes
$17.3billion for the acquisition of unocal.
of the $20billion in expenditures for 2007,
78percent, or $15.5billion, related to upstream
activities. approximately the same percentage was also expended
for upstream operations in 2006 and 2005. international upstream
accounted for about 70percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in each of the three years, reflecting the
companys continuing focus on opportunities that are
available outside the united states.
in 2008, the company estimates capital and exploratory
expenditures will be 15percent higher at
$22.9billion, including $2.6billion of spending by
affiliates. about three-fourths of the total, or
$17.5billion, is budgeted for exploration and production
activities, with $12.7billion of that amount outside the
united states.

exploratory expenditures on

through september 2006, ll-652 was
reported as part of venezuela consolidated operations. as of
october 2006, ll-652 is reported under equity affiliates. see
footnote 3 below.
equity affiliates represent
chevrons share of production by affiliates, including
tengizchevroil (tco) in kazakhstan and hamaca in venezuela.
effective october 2006, the company converted its interests in
boscan and ll-652 operating service agreements in venezuela to
empresas mixtas (i.e., joint stock contractual structures), and
these interests are accounted for as equity affiliates.
ll-652 was
previously reported as part of venezuela consolidated
operations, and boscan was included in other produced
volumes. see footnote 5 below.
includes natural gas consumed in
operations of 498million and 475million cubic feet

table of contents
as shown in the table on page5, worldwide oil-equivalent
production of 2.59million barrels per day in 2007 was up
34,000barrels per day from the prior year. worldwide
oil-equivalent production including other produced
volumes (refer to footnote 5 to the table on
page5)was 2.62million barrels per day, down
about 2percent from 2006. the decline was mostly
attributable to the change in the boscan operating service
agreement in venezuela to a joint-stock company in october 2006.
refer to the results of operations section beginning
on
pagefs-6
for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
20052007 changes in production for crude oil and natural
gas liquids and natural gas.
the company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent
production in 2008 will be approximately 2.65million
barrels per day. this estimate is subject to many uncertainties,
including quotas that may be imposed by opec, the price effect
on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in
fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
delays in project
start-ups,
and production that may have to be shut in due to weather
conditions, civil unrest, changing geopolitics or other
disruptions to operations. future production levels also are
affected by the size and number of economic investment
opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag
between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production
activities in key areas, beginning on page9, for a
discussion of the companys major oil and gas development
projects.

provides a tabulation of the companys proved net oil and
gas reserves, by geographic area, as of each year-end 2004
through 2007, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to
proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period.
during 2007, the company provided oil and gas reserves estimates
table of contents
for 2006 to the department of energy, energy information
administration (eia), that agree with the 2006 reserve volumes
in table v. this reporting fulfilled the requirement that such
estimates are to be consistent with, and do not differ more than
5percent from, the information furnished to the securities
and exchange commission in the companys 2006 annual report
on
form10-k.
during 2008, the company will file estimates of oil and gas
reserves with the department of energy, eia, consistent with the
2007 reserve data reported in table v.

table of contents
contract
obligations
the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
operations under a variety of contractual obligations. most
contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
quantities.
in the united states, the company is contractually committed to
deliver to third parties and affiliates approximately
456billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2010. the
company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities
available from production of the companys proved developed
u.s.reserves. these contracts include variable-pricing
terms.
outside the united states, the company is contractually
committed to deliver to third parties a total of approximately
631billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2008 through
2010 from argentina, australia, canada, colombia, denmark and
the philippines. the sales contracts contain variable pricing
formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market
price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at
the time of delivery and in some cases consider inflation or
other factors. the company believes it can satisfy these
contracts from quantities available from production of the
companys proved developed reserves in argentina,
australia, colombia, denmark and the philippines. the company
plans to meet its canadian contractual delivery commitments of
30billion cubic feet through third-party purchases.
development
activities
details of the companys development expenditures and costs
of proved property acquisitions for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are

pagefs-61.
the table below summarizes the companys net interest in
productive and dry development wells completed in each of the
past three years and the status of the companys
development wells drilling at december31, 2007. a
development well is a well drilled within the proved
area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a
stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.

indicates the fractional number of
wells completed during the year, regardless of when drilling was
initiated. completion refers to the installation of permanent
equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas or, in
the case of a dry well, the reporting of abandonment to the
appropriate agency. some exploratory wells are not drilled with
the intention of producing from the well bore. in such cases,
completion refers to the completion of drilling.
further categorization of productive or dry is based on the
determination as to whether hydrocarbons in a sufficient
quantity were found to justify completion as a producing well,
whether or not the well is actually going to be completed as a
producer.

the discussion that follows references the status of proved
reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
yet on production and for projects recently placed on
production. reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries
that have yet to advance to a project stage or for mature areas
of production that do not have individual projects requiring
significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. amounts
indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not
the companys share of costs for projects that are less
than wholly owned. in addition to the activities discussed,
chevron was active in other geographic areas, but those
activities are considered less significant.

in
the sanjoaquin valley. in 2007, average net
oil-equivalent
production was 221,000barrels per day, composed of
200,000barrels of crude oil, 97million cubic feet of
natural gas and 5,000barrels of natural gas liquids.
approximately 80percent of the
crude-oil
production is considered heavy oil (typically with api gravity
lower than 22degrees).
table of contents
gulf of mexico:average net oil-equivalent production during 2007 for the companys combined interests in the gulf of mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 214,000barrels per day. the daily oil-equivalent production comprised 105,000barrels of crude oil, 576million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000barrels of natural gas
liquids.during 2007, chevron was engaged in various development and exploration activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico. development work continued at the 58percent-owned and operated tahiti field, where production start-up is expected in the third quarter 2009. construction of
the spar hull and topsides was completed in 2007; however,
installation of the spar hull was delayed for about one year
when testing revealed a metallurgical problem with the mooring
shackles. six development wells were drilled in 2007, and
flow-back tests for five of the six were completed during the
year. initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in
2003, and the transfer of these reserves into the proved
developed category is anticipated near the time of production
start-up.
with an estimated production life of 30years, tahiti is
designed to have a maximum total daily production of
125,000barrels of crude oil and 70million cubic feet
of natural gas. the total cost for this project is estimated at
$4.7billion and includes a planned second phase of field
development after
start-up
that involves additional wells and facility upgrades.
also under development is the 75percent-owned and operated
blind faith discovery, in which the company increased its
ownership from 63percent in july 2007. three development
wells were drilled, and construction of the topsides and hull
was completed in 2007. the project includes a subsea development
plan, with tieback to a semisubmersible floating production
facility that had an original daily-production design capacity
of 45,000barrels of crude oil and 45million cubic
feet of natural gas based on the initial three-well development
program. a fourth development well and associated facility
upgrades are planned to commence in the first half of 2008. the
facility upgrades are planned to increase the daily capacity to
60,000barrels of crude oil and 60million cubic feet
of natural gas. initial daily total production, including the
fourth well, is estimated at 45,000 to 60,000barrels of
crude oil and 45million to 60million cubic feet of
natural gas. proved undeveloped reserves for the project were
recognized in 2005. reclassification of the reserves to the
proved developed category is anticipated near the time of
production
start-up in
the second quarter 2008. the estimated production life of the
field is approximately 20years.
the company is also participating in the ultra-deep perdido
regional development. the project encompasses the installation
of a producing host facility to service multiple fields,
including chevrons 33percent-owned great white,
60percent-owned silvertip and 58percent-owned
tobago. chevron has a 38percent interest in the perdido
regional host. all of these fields and the production facility
are partner-operated. activities during 2007 included facility
construction and development drilling. first oil is expected in
2010, with the facility capable of handling 130,000barrels
of oil-equivalent per day. proved undeveloped reserves related
to the project were first recorded in 2006, and the phased
reclassification of these reserves to the proved developed
category is anticipated near the time of production
start-up.
the project has an expected life of approximately 25years.
deepwater exploration activities in 2007 included participation
in 12 exploratory wells six wildcat and six
appraisal. exploratory work included the following:
big foot 60percent-owned and operated.a
successful appraisal well was completed in january 2008.
jack 50percent-owned and operated.a
second appraisal well is scheduled for completion in the second

at the end of 2007, the company had not yet recognized proved
reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above.
besides the activities connected with the development and
exploration projects in the gulf of mexico area, chevron also
continued the federal, state and local permitting process during
2007 and early 2008 for a proposed natural gas import terminal
at casotte landing in jackson county, mississippi. in february
2007, the company received approval from the federal energy
regulatory commission for the proposed terminal. the terminal
would be located adjacent to the companys pascagoula
refinery and designed to process imported liquefied natural gas
(lng) for distribution to industrial, commercial and residential
customers in mississippi, florida and the northeast. the
terminal would have an initial natural gas processing capacity
of 1.3billion cubic feet per day. the decision to
construct a facility will be timed to align with the
companys lng supply projects.
the company also has contractual rights to 1billion cubic
feet per day of regasification capacity beginning in 2009 at the
third party-owned sabine pass lng terminal that is expected to
be commissioned in the second quarter 2008. also in the sabine
pass area in louisiana, the company has a binding agreement to
be one of the anchor shippers in a
3.2billion-cubic-foot-per-day third party-owned natural
gas pipeline. chevron will have 1.6billion cubic feet per
day of capacity in the pipeline, of which 1billion cubic
feet per day is in a new pipeline and 600million cubic
feet per day is interconnecting capacity to an existing
pipeline. the new pipeline system will provide access to
chevrons sabine and bridgeline pipelines, which connect to
the henry hub. the henry hub is the pricing point for natural
gas futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange
(nymex) and is located on the natural gas pipeline system in
louisiana. henry hub interconnects to nine interstate and four
intrastate pipelines.
other u.s.areas:outside california and the
gulf of mexico, the company manages operations across the
mid-continental united states and alaska. during 2007 in the
piceance basin of northwestern colorado, the company commenced
development drilling in the basins tight-gas formation.
facilities to produce 50million cubic feet of natural gas
per day are expected to start up in 2009. the piceance project,
in which the company holds a 100percent operated working
interest, is scalable, and the work is planned to be completed
in multiple phases over the 15- to
20-year
project life. the plans include expanding facilities to a
production capacity of 450million cubic feet per day. the
total cost for this project is estimated at $7.3billion.
also during 2007, chevron initiated redevelopment programs in
three offshore fields in alaskas cook inlet, where the
company operates 10 offshore platforms and five producing
natural gas fields. the company also owns nonoperated working
interest production and exploratory acreage at the white hills
prospect on the north slope of alaska. during 2007, the
companys production outside california and the gulf of
mexico averaged 308,000net oil-equivalent barrels per day,
composed of 104,000barrels of crude oil, 1billion
cubic feet of natural gas and 33,000 barrels of natural gas
liquids.

angola:chevron holds company-operated working interests in blocks0 and 14 and nonoperated working interests in block2 and the fina sonangol texaco (fst) area. in 2007, daily net production was 179,000barrels of oil-equivalent.the 39percent-owned block0 and 31percent-owned block14 are off the west coast, north of the congo river. in
block0, the company operates in two areas a and b composed of 21 fields that produced 120,000barrels per day of net liquids in 2007. the block0 concession extends through 2030.area a of block0 comprises 15 producing fields and averaged daily net production of approximately 65,000barrels of crude oil and 1,000barrels of liquefied petroleum
gas (lpg) in 2007. this production includes volumes from the banzala field that produced first oil in june 2007. the development of the mafumeira field in area a continued in 2007 and will target the northern portion of the field. initial booking of proved
undeveloped reserves for this development occurred in 2003, and
reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves into the proved
developed category is anticipated near the time of first
production expected in 2009. maximum total daily production is
expected to be approximately 30,000barrels of crude oil in
2011.
also in area a, construction continued during 2007 on the takula
gas processing platform and on projects for the cabinda gas
plant and the flare and relief modification. these three
projects, called the area a gas management projects, are
scheduled to start up in 2009 and are expected to eliminate the
routine flaring of natural gas by reinjecting excess natural gas
into various reservoirs.
in area b of block0, average daily net production in 2007
from six producing fields was 47,000barrels of crude oil
and condensate and 7,000barrels of lpg. included in this
production were volumes from the sanha condensate natural gas
utilization and bomboco crude oil project that was completed in
mid-2007. during 2007, a portion of the proved undeveloped
reserves for this project was reclassified to the proved
developed category.
in block14, net production in 2007 from the benguela,
belize, lobito, tomboco, kuito and landana fields averaged
48,000barrels of liquids per day. during 2007, development
of the benguela belize-lobito tomboco (bblt) project continued,
with production of first oil at the benguela and tomboco fields.
further development drilling is expected to continue at all bblt
fields. maximum total production for bblt is estimated at
200,000barrels of crude oil per day and is scheduled to
occur in late 2008 or early 2009. proved undeveloped reserves
for benguela and belize were initially recognized in 1998 and
for lobito and tomboco in 2000. proved developed reserves for
belize and lobito were recognized in 2006 and for benguela and
tomboco in 2007. additional bblt reserves are expected to be
reclassified to proved developed as project milestones are met.
development and production rights for these fields expire in
2027.
another major project in block14 is the development of the
tombua and landana fields. construction of facilities continued
in 2007. production from the landana north reservoir is
utilizing the bblt infrastructure. the maximum total daily
production from tombua and landana of 100,000barrels of
crude oil is expected to occur in 2011. proved undeveloped
reserves were recognized for tombua and landana in 2001 and
2002, respectively. initial reclassification from proved
undeveloped to proved developed for landana occurred in 2006 and
continued in 2007. further reclassification is expected between
2009 when the
tombua-landana
facilities are completed and 2012 when the drilling program is
scheduled for completion. development and production rights for
these fields expire in 2028.
as of early 2008, the negage project in block14 was under
evaluation. front-end engineering and design (feed) for this
project was expected to begin in late 2008, with the date of
production
start-up yet
to be determined.

nigeria:chevron holds a 40percent interest in 13 concessions predominantly in the onshore and near-offshore regions of the niger delta and varying interests in deepwater offshore blocks. in the niger delta, the company operates under a joint-venture arrangement with the nigerian national petroleum corporation (nnpc), which owns a 60percent interest. in 2007, net oil- equivalent
production from 32fields averaged 129,000barrels per day. the daily oil-equivalent rate comprised 126,000barrels of liquids and 15million cubic feet of natural gas.in the niger delta, chevron has a 40percent operated interest in the south offshore water injection project (sowip), an enhanced crude-oil recovery
project in oil mining license (oml) 90 aimed at increasing production through water injection, natural-gas lift and production debottlenecking in the okan and delta fields. the upgraded delta south water injection platform (dswip), which is part of sowip, began water injection in march 2007 at a total daily rate of 100,000barrels. the total maximum daily water injection rate
is expected to increase to 240,000barrels in 2009 upon the
laying of water injection pipelines. crude-oil production at
year-end 2007 was approximately 5,000barrels per day, and
maximum total production is expected to be 35,000barrels
per day in 2010. initial recognition of proved reserves was made
in 2005. reclassification of additional proved undeveloped
reserves to the developed category is expected to occur  after
the evaluation of the water injection performance. the estimated
life of the project is 25years.
during 2007, the company continued development activities of
deepwater offshore projects. the 68percent-owned and
operated deepwater agbami project in oml 127 and oml 128 is a
subsea development with wells tied back to a floating
production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel, which was
delivered from south korea in december 2007. development
drilling and completion operations started in 2006, and subsea
installation of production equipment began in 2007. maximum
total daily production of 250,000barrels of crude oil and
natural gas liquids is anticipated within one year after
start-up,
which is expected by the third quarter 2008. the company
initially recognized proved undeveloped reserves for agbami in
2002. a portion of the proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled
to be reclassified to proved developed in 2008 near production
start-up.
the expected field life is approximately 20years. the
total cost for this project is estimated at $5.4billion.
the aparo field in oml 132 and oml 140 and the bonga sw field in
oml 118share a common geologic structure and are planned
to be jointly developed. the geologic structure lies
70miles offshore in 4,300feet of water. a
pre-unit
agreement was executed between chevron and the oml 118 partner
group in 2006. final terms for a unitization agreement are
expected to be completed in mid-2008. in 2007, feed and
tendering of major contracts continued. development will likely
involve an fpso vessel and subsea wells. partners are expected
to make the final investment decision in the second half 2008,
with production
start-up
projected for 2012. maximum total production of
150,000barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
reached within one year of production
start-up.
the company recognized initial proved undeveloped reserves in
2006 for its approximate 20percent nonoperated working
interest in the unitized area. the expected production life of
this project is 20years.
the company holds a 30percent nonoperated working interest
in the usan project, located offshore in oml 138 and designed to
utilize an fpso vessel. the company recognized proved
undeveloped reserves in 2004. production
start-up is
estimated for late 2011, before which time a portion of proved
undeveloped reserves is expected to be reclassified to the
proved developed category. maximum total production of
180,000barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
achieved within one year of
start-up.
the end date of the concession period will be determined after
final regulatory approvals are obtained.
chevron operates and holds a 95percent interest in the
nsiko discovery on oml 140. as of early 2008, subsurface
evaluations and field development planning were ongoing. an
investment decision is contingent on negotiations concerning the
level of nigerian content in the projects contracts.
the company has a 46percent nonoperated interest in the
nnwa field in oml 129, which contains a discovery that extends
into two adjacent blocks not owned by chevron. commerciality is
dependent upon resolution of the nigerian deepwater gas fiscal
regime and collaboration agreements with the adjacent blocks. a
joint study was initiated in 2007 with owners in adjoining block
oml 135 to progress technical and commercial evaluations.
table of contents
chevron participated in two deepwater exploration wells during
2007. the uge 2well, drilled as an appraisal well to the
uge 1 discovery in oil prospecting license (opl) 214, confirmed
hydrocarbons. the company has a 20percent nonoperated
working interest in opl 214. the second well was deemed
noncommercial. two additional deepwater exploration wells are
planned in 2008.
chevron also is involved in projects in the niger delta region
that support the companys strategic initiative to
commercialize its significant natural gas resource base outside
the united states. construction is under way on the
phase3a expansion of the escravos gas plant (egp), which
is expected to start up in 2009. phase 3a scope includes
offshore natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure
and a second gas processing facility, which potentially would
increase processing capacity from 285million to
680million cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase
lpg and condensate export capacity from 12,000 to
47,000barrels per day. egp phase 3a is designed to process
natural gas from the meji, delta south, okan and mefa producing
fields. proved undeveloped reserves associated with egp
phase3a were recognized in 2002. these reserves are
expected to be reclassified to proved developed as various
project milestones are reached and related projects are
completed. the anticipated life of the project is 25years.
chevron holds a 40percent operated interest in this
project.
refer also to page26 for a discussion of the planned
gas-to-liquids facility at escravos.
chevron holds a 37percent interest in the west african gas
pipeline, which is designed to supply nigerian natural gas to
customers in ghana, benin and togo for industrial applications
and power generation. first gas is anticipated to be shipped by
mid-2008, and facility completion, with a capacity of
170million cubic feet of natural gas per day, is expected
in the second-half 2008. chevron is the managing sponsor in the
west african pipeline company limited affiliate, which
constructed, owns and operates the
412-mile
pipeline.
in march 2007, chevron signed a shareholders agreement for
a 19percent interest in the oklng free zone enterprise
(oklng) affiliate, which will operate the olokola lng project.
oklng plans to build a multitrain,
22million-metric-ton-per-year natural gas liquefaction
facility and marine terminal located in a free trade zone. the
project entered feed in 2006 and is expected to be implemented
in phases, commencing with two trains having at least
11million-metric-ton-per-year total capacity.
approximately 50percent of the gas supplied to the plant
is expected to be provided from the producing areas associated
with chevrons joint-venture arrangement with nnpc
(discussed earlier in this section).
nigeria-so tom e prncipe joint
development zone (jdz):chevron holds a 46percent
operated interest in jdz block1. in 2006, the first

australia:during 2007, the average net oil-equivalent production from chevrons interests in australia was 100,000barrels per day, composed of 39,000barrels of liquids and 372million cubic feet of natural gas.chevron has a 17percent nonoperated working interest in the north west shelf (nws) venture offshore western australia. daily net production from
the project during 2007 averaged 29,000barrels of crude oil and condensate, 369million cubic feet of natural gas, and 5,000barrels of lpg. approximately 75percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of lng to major utilities in japan, south korea and china, primarily under long-term contracts. the remaining natural gas was sold to the western australia domestic
market. a fifth lng train, which is intended to increase export
capacity by more than 4million metric tons per year, to
more than 16million, is expected to be commissioned in
late 2008. the angel natural gas field, where development is
under way, and the north rankin redevelopment project will
supply the fifth lng train.
start-up of
the fifth train is projected to accelerate production from the
nws fields. an investment decision by the company and its
partners on the north rankin redevelopment project is expected
in late 2008. the end of the nws venture concession period is
2034.
on barrow and thevenard islands off the northwest coast of

ownership interest across most of the greater gorgon area.
chevron and its two joint-venture participants signed a
framework agreement in 2005 that will enable the combined
development of gorgon and the nearby natural gas fields as one
world-scale project. in 2007, the company received environmental
regulatory approvals necessary for the development of the
greater gorgon lng project on barrow island using a two-train,
10million-metric-ton-per-year lng development plan. as of
early 2008, the detailed environmental conditions were
incorporated into the projects updated optimization and
engineering efforts for a three-train,
15million-metric-ton-per-year lng configuration, and
activities to secure the necessary government approvals were
under way. natural gas for the project will be supplied from the
gorgon and jansz fields. the gorgon project has an expected
economic life of at least 40years.
elsewhere in the greater gorgon area during 2007, chevron
participated in four successful appraisal wells two
in the browse basin and two in the carnarvon basin. chevron also
participated in two exploration wells in the carnarvon basin,
with lady nora resulting in a natural gas discovery and snarf-1
expecting to be completed in 2008. as of early 2008, plans were
also being developed to appraise the 67percent-owned clio
and the 50percent-owned chandon natural gas discoveries.
concept studies continued in 2007 on the wheatstone natural gas
discovery, and a successful appraisal well was drilled late in
the year. further appraisal wells are planned to be drilled in
the area in 2008.
at the end of 2007, the company had not recognized proved
reserves for any of the greater gorgon area fields. recognition
is contingent on securing sufficient lng sales agreements and
achieving other key project milestones. in 2007, the company
signed a nonbinding heads of agreement (hoa) with gs caltex, a
chevron affiliated company, to supply 250,000 metric tons of lng
annually from the gorgon project. combined with the nonbinding
hoas signed previously with three utility customers in japan,
volumes under the four hoas totaled 4.5million metric tons
per year. as of early 2008, negotiations were continuing to
finalize binding sales agreements on these hoas. purchases by
each of these customers are expected to range from 300,000
metric tons per year to 1.5million metric tons per year
over 25 years.
azerbaijan:chevron holds a 10percent nonoperated working interest in the azerbaijan international operating company (aioc), which produces crude oil in the caspian sea from the azeri-chirag-gunashli (acg) project. chevron also has a 9percent interest in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc) affiliate, which transports aioc production by pipeline from baku, azerbaijan, through georgia
to mediterranean deepwater port facilities in ceyhan, turkey. (refer to pipelines under transportation operations on page28 for a discussion of the btc operations.)in 2007, the companys daily net production from aioc averaged 61,000barrels of oil-equivalent. first production from phaseiii of acg development is targeted for the second quarter 2008.
total crude-oil production from the acg project is expected to increase to about 940,000barrels per day by the end of 2008 and to more than 1million barrels per day in 2009. proved undeveloped reserves for acg are expected to be reclassified to proved developed reserves as wells are drilled and completed. the aioc operations are conducted under a 30-year
psc that expires in 2024.
kazakhstan:chevron holds a 20percent
nonoperated working interest in the karachaganak project that is
being developed in phases. during 2007, karachaganak net
oil-equivalent production averaged 66,000barrels per day,
composed of 41,000barrels of liquids and 149million
cubic feet of natural gas. in 2007, access to the caspian
pipeline consortium (cpc) and atyrau-samara (russia) pipelines
allowed karachaganak sales of approximately 166,000barrels
per day (31,000net barrels) of processed liquids at prices
available in world markets. the remaining liquids were sold into
russian markets. during 2007, work continued on a fourth train
that is designed to increase this export of processed liquids by
56,000barrels per day (11,000net barrels). the
fourth train is expected to start up in 2009.
in 2007, the karachaganak operator signed a
15-year
natural gas sales agreement to deliver up to 1.6billion
cubic feet per day of sour gas to a russian-kazakh joint
venture. deliveries under the agreement commenced in september
2007. as of early 2008, phaseiii development of
karachaganak continued under evaluation. the project could
increase maximum total production to 335,000barrels of
liquids per day and 1.7billion cubic feet of natural gas
per day. timing for the recognition of phaseiii proved
reserves is uncertain and depends on finalizing a viable
phaseiii project design.

ownership interests ranging from 35percent to
80percent in blocks10 through 13, b12/27, b8/32, 9a,
g4/43 and g4/48. blocks b8/32 and 9a produce crude oil and
natural gas from six operating areas, and blocks10 through
13 and b12/27 produce crude oil, condensate and natural gas from
16 operating areas.
the companys production of natural gas increased beginning
in march 2007 with ptts commissioning of a third natural
gas pipeline. in october 2007, the leases for blocks10
through 13 were extended from 2012 to 2022. in december 2007,
the company signed a natural gas sales agreement that will
increase daily contract quantity of natural gas from these
blocks by 500million cubic feet, to 1.2billion, by
2012. in addition, this agreement is expected to enable the
construction of a second central natural gas processing facility
in the platong area. the 70percent-owned platong
gasii project is designed to add 420million cubic
feet per day of processing capacity in the first quarter 2011.
the company expects to recognize proved reserves throughout the
projects
12-year life
as the wellhead platforms are installed.
chevron has a 16percent nonoperated working interest in
blocks14a, 15a, 16a, g9/48 and g8/50, known collectively
as the arthit field. first production from arthit is planned for
the second quarter 2008 and is expected to reach an estimated
maximum total production of 330million cubic feet of
natural gas per day by the end of 2008. proved undeveloped
reserves were recorded for the first time in 2006.
reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to the proved
developed category is anticipated in 2008, near production
start-up.
the concessions that cover arthit operations expire in 2040.
table of contents
in g9/48, one exploration well is required to be drilled by the
first quarter 2009. chevron also holds exploration interests in
a number of blocks that are currently inactive, pending
resolution of border issues between thailand and cambodia.
in late 2007, the company was granted the concession rights to
four prospective offshore petroleum blocks in thailand, which
includes block g8/50 (discussed earlier in this section).
chevrons interest in the other three operated blocks,
g4/50, g6/50 and g7/50, ranges from 35percent to
75percent.
vietnam:the company is operator in two pscs
offshore southwest vietnam in the northern part of the malay
basin. chevron has a 42percent interest in one psc that
includes blocks b and 48/95 and a 43percent interest in
the other psc that has block52/97. chevron also has a
50percent operated interest in block b122 offshore eastern
vietnam. no production occurred in these pscs during 2007.
the vietnam gas project is aimed at developing an area in the
two malay basin pscs to supply natural gas to state-owned
petrovietnam. in the third quarter 2007, petrovietnam approved
the revised development plan, joint development area and
unitization agreement for the project. the project includes
installation of wellhead and hub platforms, an fpso vessel,
infield pipelines and a central processing platform. the timing
of first natural gas production is dependent upon the outcome of
commercial negotiations. maximum total production of
approximately 500million cubic feet of natural gas per day
is projected within five years of
start-up.
recognition of initial proved undeveloped reserves would follow
execution of the gas sales agreements and project approval. the
psc for blocks b and 48/95 and the psc for block 52/97 will
expire in 2022 and 2029, respectively.
in block122, a planned seismic program was postponed in
2007 due to issues of territorial claim between vietnam and
china.
china:chevron has nonoperated working interests of
33percent in blocks 16/08 and 16/19 located in the pearl

oil late in the year. chevron also has interests ranging from
36percent to 50percent in four prospective onshore
natural gas blocks in the ordos basin totaling about
1.5million acres. in december 2007, the company signed a
30-year psc
that became effective in february 2008 for the development of
the chuandongbei natural gas area in the onshore sichuan basin.
the aggregate design input capacity of the proposed gas plants
is expected to be 740million cubic feet of natural gas per
day. the company holds a 49percent interest in the area.
partitioned neutral zone (pnz):chevron holds a
60-year
concession that expires in 2009 to produce crude oil from
onshore properties in pnz, which is located between saudi arabia
and kuwait. negotiations to extend the concession period were
ongoing in early 2008. net production in pnz for 2007
represented 4percent of chevrons net barrels of
oil-equivalent total.
under the current concession, chevron has the right to saudi
arabias 50percent interest in the hydrocarbon
resource and pays a royalty and other taxes on volumes produced.
during 2007, average net oil-equivalent production was
112,000barrels per day, composed of 109,000barrels
of crude oil and 17million cubic feet of natural gas. the
second phase of a steamflood pilot project is expected to be
completed in early 2009. this pilot is a unique application of
steam injection into a carbonate reservoir and, if successful,
could significantly increase recoverability of the heavy oil in
place.
philippines:the company holds a 45percent
nonoperated working interest in the malampaya natural gas field
located 50miles offshore palawan island. net

80percent to 100percent. chevron also has
nonoperated working interests in a joint venture in south natuna
sea block b and in the ne maduraiii block in the east java
sea basin. chevrons interests in these pscs range from
25percent to 40percent. in january 2008, chevron
relinquished its 35percent nonoperated working interest
in the donggala psc in the kutei basin. in west java, chevron
wholly owns a power generation company that operates the darajat
geothermal contract area in garut, west java, with a total
capacity of 259 megawatts. this includes the darajatiii
110-megawatt unit that was placed online in july 2007. chevron
also operates a 95percent-owned
300-megawatt
cogeneration facility in support of cpis operation in
north duri and the wholly owned salak geothermal field, located
in west java, with a total capacity of 377 megawatts.
the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2007 from
all of its interests in indonesia averaged 241,000barrels
per day. the daily oil-equivalent rate comprised
195,000barrels of crude oil and 277million cubic
feet of natural gas. the largest producing field is duri,
located in the rokan psc. duri has been under steamflood
operation since 1985 and is one of the worlds largest
steamflood developments. an expansion area, area 12, is targeted
for start-up
in late 2008. maximum total daily production is estimated at
34,000barrels of crude oil in 2012. two other areas have
been identified for possible sequential expansions. proved
undeveloped reserves for north duri were recognized in previous
years, and reclassification from proved undeveloped to proved
developed is scheduled to occur during various stages of
sequential completion. the rokan psc expires in 2021.
a drilling campaign continued through 2007 in south natuna sea
block b, with first oil produced from the kerisi field in
december 2007. first production of lpg from the belanak field
was achieved in april 2007. additional development drilling in
the north belut field is scheduled to begin in mid-2008, with
first production expected in 2009.
in january 2007, chevron combined the development of the gendalo
and gehem deepwater natural gas fields located in the kutei
basin into a single project with one development concept. in
august 2007, the company submitted final development plans to
the government of indonesia. approvals are expected during the
first-half 2008. the bangka natural gas project was under
evaluation in 2007 and will likely be developed in parallel with
gendalo and gehem. the development timing is partially dependent
on government approvals, market conditions and the achievement
of key project milestones. the company holds an 80percent
operated interest in these projects.
as of early 2008, the development concept for the
50percent-owned and operated sadewa project in the kutei

of the guajira association contract. in exchange, chevron
receives 43percent of the production for the remaining
life of each field and a variable production volume from a
fixed-fee build-operate-maintain-transfer agreement based on
prior chuchupa capital contributions. daily net production
averaged 178million cubic feet of natural gas, or
30,000barrels of oil-equivalent, in 2007. during the year,
new dehydration facilities were constructed that enabled natural
gas exports to venezuela beginning in january 2008.
trinidad and tobago:the company has a
50percent nonoperated working interest in four blocks in
the east coast marine area offshore trinidad, which include the
dolphin and dolphin deep producing natural gas fields and the
starfish discovery. net production from dolphin and dolphin deep
in 2007 averaged 174million cubic feet of natural gas per
day, or 29,000barrels of oil-equivalent.
in may 2007, a domestic natural gas sales agreement was signed
for the trinidad incremental gas project. the agreement includes
the delivery of 220million cubic feet per day for
11years with an option for a four-year extension. drilling
operations started in late 2007 at the dolphin platform. first
gas for the project is expected in 2009, ramping up to maximum
total production of 220million cubic feet of natural gas
per day in early 2010. reserves were initially booked in 2006.
in 2007, additional proved reserves were recorded, and some
proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified to the proved
developed category. further reclassifications are expected in
2008, following the drilling of additional development wells.
chevron also holds a 50percent operated interest in the
manatee area of block6d. in early 2007, an agreement was
signed by the governments of venezuela and trinidad and tobago
to unitize the loran field in venezuela and the manatee area.
negotiations are expected to continue in 2008 to achieve a
field-specific unitization treaty.
venezuela:chevron holds interest in two affiliates
located in western venezuela and one affiliate in the orinoco
belt. the company also operates in two exploratory blocks
offshore plataforma deltana, with working interests of
60percent in block2 and 100percent in
block3. in block2, which includes the loran natural
gas field, a conceptual offshore development plan was completed
in 2007. in block3, chevron discovered natural gas in 2005
that is in close proximity to loran. both block3 and loran
will provide a possible supply source for venezuelas first
lng train. seismic work elsewhere in block3 was completed
in 2007. chevron also has a 100percent interest in the

canada:the company has nonoperated working
interests of 27percent in the hibernia field offshore
eastern canada and 20percent in the athabasca oil sands
project (aosp), a 60percent operated interest in the ells
river in situ oil sands project, a 28percent
operated interest in the hebron project and exploration acreage
in the mackenzie delta, beaufort sea and the orphan basin.
excluding volumes mined at the aosp, average net oil-equivalent
production during 2007 was 36,000barrels per day, composed
of 35,000barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
5million cubic feet of natural gas. substantially all of
the production was from the hibernia field. at aosp, bitumen
mined and upgraded to synthetic crude oil averaged
27,000net barrels per day.
at aosp, the first phase of an expansion project, with an
estimated total project cost of $10.2billion, is being
designed to upgrade an additional 100,000barrels of
bitumen into synthetic crude oil per day. the expansion would
increase total aosp design capacity to more than
255,000barrels of bitumen per day in 2010. preliminary
work is under way to determine the feasibility of additional
expansion projects.
the ells river project consists of heavy oil leases of more than
85,000acres. the area contains significant volumes with
the potential for recovery using steam assisted gravity
drainage, a proven technology that employs steam and horizontal
drilling to extract the bitumen through wells rather than
through mining operations. during 2007, a successful appraisal
drilling program involving 66wells was completed.
follow-up
appraisal activities are planned in 2008, with a similar number
of wells and a small
2-d and
3-d seismic
program.
the potential development at hebron stalled in 2006 after
unsuccessful negotiations with the provincial government of
newfoundland and labrador. in mid-2007, the hebron partners
executed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with the
government that outlined fiscal, equity and local-benefit terms
associated with the hebron project. execution of formal
agreements is expected during 2008.
exploratory activities are expected to continue during 2008 in
the mackenzie delta and the orphan basin.

britannia field.
as of early 2008, development activities were continuing at the
britannia satellite fields callanish and brodgar, in which
chevron holds 17percent and 25percent nonoperated
working interests, respectively. production
start-up
from these two fields is expected to occur in late 2008.
together, these fields are expected to achieve maximum total
daily production of 25,000barrels of crude oil and
133million cubic feet of natural gas several months after
both fields start up. proved undeveloped reserves were initially
recognized in 2000. in 2006, proved undeveloped reserves
were reclassified to the proved developed category. this project
has an expected production life of approximately 15years.
in exploration activities, the alder discovery west of the
britannia field was being evaluated in early 2008 and is likely
to be developed as a tieback to existing infrastructure. the
company has a 70percent operated interest in the project,
which is expected to start up and reach maximum total daily
production rates of 9,000barrels of crude oil and
80million cubic feet of natural gas in 2012. the timing of
the initial proved-reserves recognition was also under
evaluation in early 2008. this project has an expected
production life of approximately nine years.
at the rosebank/lochnagar discovery west of the shetland
islands, an appraisal program consisting of three wells and a
sidetrack was completed in 2007. all four wellbores encountered
hydrocarbons, and an evaluation for commerciality was under way
in early 2008. evaluation continued of a successful natural gas
production test at the tormore well that is also in the west of
shetlands gas trend. during 2007, another successful appraisal
well was drilled in the clair phase 2 area.
equity
affiliate operations
angola:in addition to the exploration and producing
activities in angola, chevron participates in the angola lng
project, for which the company and partners made a final
investment decision at the end of 2007. the lng plant will be
designed with a capacity to process 1billion cubic feet of
natural gas per day and will provide a commercial option for
angolas natural gas resources. chevron has a
36percent interest in the angola lng affiliate.
construction began in early 2008 on the
5.2million-metric-ton-per-year onshore lng plant that is
located in the northern part of the country. plant
start-up is
expected in 2012. at the end of 2007, the company made an
initial booking of proved natural gas reserves for the producing
operations associated with this lng project. the life of the lng
plant is estimated to be in excess of 20years.
kazakhstan:the company holds a 50percent
interest in tengizchevroil (tco), which is developing the tengiz
and korolev crude-oil fields located in western kazakhstan under
a 40-year
concession that expires in 2033. chevrons net
oil-equivalent production in 2007 from these fields averaged
176,000barrels per day, composed of 144,000barrels
of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 193million cubic
feet of natural gas.
tco is undergoing a significant expansion composed of two
integrated projects referred to as the second generation plant
(sgp) and sour gas injection (sgi). at a total combined cost of
approximately $7.2billion, these projects are designed to
increase tcos crude-oil production capacity to
540,000barrels per day during the second half of 2008.
sgp involves the construction of a large processing train for
treating crude oil and the associated sour gas (i.e., high in
sulfur content). the sgp design is based on the same
conventional technology employed in the existing processing
trains. proved undeveloped reserves associated with sgp were
recognized in 2001. wells were drilled, deepened
and/or
completed since 2002 in the tengiz and korolev reservoirs to
produce volumes required for the new sgp train. reserves
associated with the project were reclassified to the proved
developed category. over the next decade, ongoing field
development is expected to result in the reclassification of
additional proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed.
sgi involves taking a portion of the sour gas separated from the
crude-oil production at the sgp processing train and reinjecting
it into the tengiz reservoir. chevron expects that sgi will have
two key effects. first, sgi will reduce the sour gas processing
capacity required at sgp, thereby increasing liquid production
capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that
would otherwise be generated. second, sgi is expected over time
to increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes as the
injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure and displaces
oil toward producing wells. the company anticipates recognizing
additional proved reserves associated with the sgi expansion in
late 2008. the primary sgi risks include uncertainties about
compressor performance associated with injecting high-pressure
sour gas and subsurface responses to injection.
table of contents
initial production from the first phase of the sgi/sgp expansion
projects occurred in late 2007. this first phase increased
production capacity by 90,000barrels per day, to
approximately 400,000, in january 2008.
as of early 2008, essentially all of tcos production was
being exported through the caspian pipeline consortium (cpc)
pipeline that runs from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker loading
facilities at novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black
sea. also in early 2008, cpc was seeking stockholder approval
for an expansion to accommodate increased tco volumes beginning
in 2009. expanded rail-car loading and rail-export facilities,
designed to transport most of the incremental sgi/sgp production
prior to the cpc expansion, started operation during 2007. as of
early 2008, other alternatives were also being explored to
increase export capacity.
venezuela:chevron has a 30percent interest in
the hamaca heavy oil production and upgrading project located in
venezuelas orinoco belt, a 39percent interest in the
petroboscan affiliate that operates the boscan field, and a
25percent interest in the petroindependiente affiliate
that operates the ll-652 field. the companys average net
oil-equivalent production during 2007 from these affiliates was
72,000barrels per day, composed of 68,000barrels of
crude oil and 27million cubic feet of natural gas.
the hamaca project has a total design capacity for processing
and upgrading 190,000barrels per day of heavy crude oil
(8.5 degrees api gravity) into 180,000barrels of lighter,
higher-value crude oil (26 degrees api gravity). in february
2007, the president of venezuela issued a decree announcing the
governments intention for pdvsa to increase its ownership
in all orinoco heavy oil associations effective may1,
2007, including chevrons 30percent-owned hamaca
project, to a minimum of 60 percent. in december 2007, chevron
executed a conversion agreement and signed a charter and by-laws
with a pdvsa subsidiary that provided for chevron to retain its
30percent interest in the hamaca project. the new entity,
petropiar, commenced activities in january 2008.
the boscan field is located onshore western venezuela. a 3-d
seismic program was acquired in 2007 that is expected to guide
future development activities in south boscan. the
water-injection pressure-maintenance project was expanded to
include four wells converted to injectors in 2007, and four new
injectors are planned to be drilled in 2008 and 2009. the ll-652
field is located in lake maracaibo.
russia:as of early 2008, chevron and jsc gazprom
neft continued to negotiate the final agreements for exploration
and development activities in two licensed areas in the
yamal-nenets region of western siberia. once the agreement is
finalized, chevron is expected to hold a 49percent
interest in the northern taiga neftegaz llc affiliate, which
will operate in the licensed areas. exploration and delineation
activities are planned for 2008 on both licenses.
sales of
natural gas and natural gas liquids

asphalt plants in perth amboy, new
jersey, and portland, oregon. the portland plant was sold in
february 2005.
chevron holds 100percent of
the common stock issued by chevron south africa (pty) limited,
which owns the cape town refinery. a consortium of south african
partners owns preferred shares ultimately convertible to a
25percent equity interest in chevron south africa (pty)
limited. none of the preferred shares had been converted as of
february 2008.
chevron sold its 31percent
interest in the nerefco refinery in the netherlands in march
2007. this decreased the companys share of operable
capacity by about 124,000barrels per day.
in the first quarter 2008, the company sold its 4percent
ownership interest in an affiliate that owned a refinery in
abidjan, cte divoire, decreasing the companys
share of operable capacity by about 2,000barrels per day.
average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2007
was 86percent, compared with 90percent in 2006. this
decrease generally resulted from unplanned downtime to repair
damage resulting from fires in the crude units at the richmond
and pascagoula refineries during 2007. this impact was partially
offset by an improvement in capacity utilization at the
pembroke, u.k., refinery, which had unplanned downtime in 2006.
the crude unit at the pascagoula refinery was back in service in
february 2008. despite the outage at pascagoula, the company was
able to maintain uninterrupted product supplies to customers
through the use of other feedstocks in its gasoline-producing
facilities at the refinery. at the u.s.fuel refineries,
crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged
85percent in 2007, compared with 99percent in 2006,
and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged
78percent and 86percent in 2007 and 2006,
respectively. cracking and coking units, including fluid
catalytic cracking units, are the primary facilities used in
fuel refineries to convert heavier products into gasoline and
other light products.
the companys fuel refineries in the united states, europe,
canada, south africa and australia produce low-sulfur fuels. in
2007, singapore refining company, the companys
50percent-owned affiliate, began an upgrade project at its
290,000-barrel-per-day refinery in singapore to produce diesel
fuels that meet euroiv specifications.
in 2007, the company completed modifications at its refineries
in el segundo, california, to enable the processing of heavier
crude oils into gasoline, diesel and other light products, and
in the united kingdom to increase the capability to process
caspian-blend crude oils. in october 2007, the company approved
plans to construct a $500million continuous catalyst
regeneration unit at the pascagoula, mississippi, refinery,
which is expected to increase gasoline production by
10percent, or 600,000 gallons per day, by mid-2010. design

flexibility to process lower api-gravity crude oils at the
companys richmond, california, refinery continued in 2007.
other upgrade projects at the el segundo refinery were being
evaluated in early 2008.
in late 2007, gs caltex, the companys
50percent-owned affiliate, completed commissioning of new
facilities associated with a $1.5billion upgrade project
at the 680,000-barrel-per-day yeosu refining complex in south
korea. this project is expected to increase the yield of
high-value refined products by 33,000barrels per day, add
15,000barrels of new lubricant base oil production and
reduce feedstock costs through an increase in the
refinerys ability to process heavy oil.
chevron owns a 5percent interest in reliance petroleum
limited, a company formed by reliance industries limited to own
and operate a new export refinery being constructed in jamnagar,
india. the refinery is expected to begin operation by year-end
2008, with a crude-oil capacity of 580,000barrels per day.
chevron has future rights to increase its equity ownership to
29percent.
chevron processes imported and domestic crude oil in its
u.s.refining operations. imported crude oil accounted for
about 87percent of chevrons u.s.refinery
inputs in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
gas-to-liquids
through the sasol chevron global
50-50 joint
venture, the company is pursuing gas-to-liquids (gtl)
opportunities in several countries.
in nigeria, chevron and the nigerian national petroleum
corporation are developing a 34,000-barrel-per-day gtl facility
at escravos designed to process natural gas supplied from the
phase 3a expansion of the escravos gas plant (egp). as of early
2008, approximately 90percent of engineering and

federal law requires that cargo transported between
u.s.ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
united states, owned and operated by u.s.entities, and
manned by u.s.crews. in 2007, the companys
u.s.flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting
refined products between the gulf coast and the east coast and
from california refineries to terminals on the west coast and in
alaska and hawaii. three
u.s.-flagged
product tankers, each capable of carrying 300,000barrels
of cargo, are scheduled for delivery from 2008 through 2010.
the foreign-flagged vessels were engaged primarily in
transporting crude oil from the middle east, asia, the black
sea, mexico and west africa to ports in the united states,
europe, australia and asia. refined products were also
transported by tanker worldwide. during 2007, the company took
delivery of one new double-hulled tanker, with a total capacity
of 500,000barrels, and one
u.s.-flagged
product tanker capable of carrying 300,000barrels of
cargo. the company also returned a
1million-barrel-capacity
crude tanker at the end of its lease.
in addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural gas (lng)
tankers transporting cargoes for the north west shelf (nws)
venture in australia. the nws project also has two lng tankers
under long-term time charter. in 2005, chevron placed orders for
two company-owned lng tankers.
the federal oil pollution act of 1990 requires the phase-out by
year-end 2010 of all single-hull tankers trading to
u.s.ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
u.s.exclusive economic zone. this has raised the demand
for double-hull tankers. at the end of 2007, 100percent of
the companys owned and bareboat-chartered fleet was
double-hulled.
the company is a member of many oil-spill-response cooperatives
in areas in which it operates around the world.
chemicals
chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) is equally owned
with conocophillips corporation. at the end of 2007, cpchem
owned or had joint venture interests in 30 manufacturing
facilities and six research and technical centers in belgium,
china, puerto rico, qatar, saudi arabia, singapore, south korea
and the united states.
in 2007, cpchem completed construction on the integrated,
world-scale styrene facility in al jubail, saudi arabia. jointly
owned with the saudi industrial investment group (siig),
commercial production is expected to commence in mid-2008. the
styrene facility is located adjacent to cpchem and siigs
existing aromatics complex in al jubail. also during 2007,
cpchem secured final approval for a third petrochemical project
in al jubail. construction began in early 2008, with expected

mining
chevrons
u.s.-based
mining company produces and markets coal, molybdenum, rare earth
minerals and calcined petroleum coke. sales occur in both
u.s.and international markets.
in 2007, the companys coal mining and marketing
subsidiary, the pittsburg& midway coal mining co.
(p&m), changed its name to chevron mining inc.
(cmi)and merged with molycorp inc., another chevron mining
subsidiary, to form a single chevron mining entity. the company
owns and operates two surface coal mines, mckinley, in new
mexico, and kemmerer, in wyoming, and one underground coal mine,
north river, in alabama. sales of coal from cmis wholly
owned mines were 12million tons, down about 1million
tons from 2006.
at year-end 2007, cmi controlled approximately 214million
tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the united states,
including reserves of environmentally desirable low-sulfur coal.
the company is contractually committed to deliver between
11million and 12million tons of coal per year
through the end of 2009 and believes it will satisfy these
contracts from existing coal reserves.
in addition to the coal operations, chevron owns and operates
the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico and the mountain pass
rare earth mine in california. at year-end 2007, cmi controlled
approximately 57million pounds of proven molybdenum
reserves at questa and 241million pounds of proven and
probable rare earth reserves at mountain pass.
chevron also owns a 33percent interest in sumikin
molycorp, a manufacturer of neodymium compounds, located in
japan, and a 50percent interest in youngs creek mining
company llc, a joint venture to develop a coal mine in northern
wyoming. the company also owns the chicago carbon company, a

projects completed by ces in 2007 include energy efficiency
installations for the state of colorado government facilities
and a 1.1 megawatt solar system at californias fresno
state university.
research
and technology
the companys energy technology company (etc) supports
chevrons upstream and downstream businesses. etc provides
technology and competency support in earth sciences; reservoir
and production engineering; drilling and completions; facilities
engineering; health, environment and safety; refining; technical
computing; strategic planning; and organizational capability.
technology ventures company manages investments and projects in
emerging energy technologies and their integration into
chevrons core businesses. its activities are managed
through four business units: venture capital, biofuels, hydrogen
and emerging energy.
information technology company integrates computing,
telecommunications, data management, security and network
technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure for
chevrons global operations.
during 2007, the company entered into research alliances with
texas a&m university, with focus on the production and
conversion of crops for biofuels from cellulose, and the
colorado center for biorefining and biofuel, with focus on
conversion technologies. the company also has research alliances
with the university of california, davis and the georgia
institute of technology that are focused on converting
cellulosic biomass into transportation fuels.
chevrons research and development expenses were
$562million, $468million and $316million for
the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, and ultimate successes are not certain. although not
all initiatives may prove to be economically viable, the
companys overall investment in this area is not
significant to the companys consolidated financial
position.
environmental
protection
virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are
subject to various u.s.federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
similar laws and regulations in other countries. these
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. chevron expects more environment-related regulations in
the countries where it has operations. most of the costs of
complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its
operations are embedded in the normal costs of conducting
business.
in 2007, the companys u.s.capitalized environmental
expenditures were approximately $350million, representing
approximately 5percent of the companys total
consolidated u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures.
these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with
new facilities. the expenditures are predominantly in the
upstream and downstream segments and relate mostly to air- and
water-quality projects and activities at the companys
refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
facilities. for 2008, the company estimates u.s.capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
approximately $580million. the future annual capital costs
of fulfilling this commitment are uncertain and will be governed
by several factors, including future changes to regulatory
requirements.

item1a.risk
factors
chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a
diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a
history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. nevertheless,
some inherent risks could materially impact the companys
financial results of operations or financial condition.
chevron
is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
prices.
chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the
companys results of operations is crude-oil prices. except
in the ordinary course of running an integrated petroleum
business, chevron does not seek to hedge its exposure to price
changes. a significant, persistent decline in crude-oil prices
may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
and its capital and exploratory expenditure plans.
the
scope of chevrons business will decline if the company
does not successfully develop resources.
the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron
is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
produces with good prospects for future production, the
companys business will decline. creating and maintaining
an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including
obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce
hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time,
capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and schedule;
and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.
the
companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human
factors.
chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
inhospitable regions. the companys operations and
facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes, including hurricanes, floods and other
forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political
events, fires, earthquakes, and explosions, any of which could
result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the
natural environment.
chevrons
business subjects the company to liability risks.
the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
companys business. chevron operations also produce
byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. any of these
activities could result in liability, either as a result of an
accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
on the effects of the companys operations on human health
or the environment.
political
instability could harm chevrons business.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
governments to increase public ownership of the companys
partially or wholly owned businesses
and/or to
impose additional taxes or royalties.
in certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal
unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
government and the company or other governments may affect the
companys operations. those developments have, at times,
significantly affected the companys related operations and
results and are carefully considered by management when
evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries. at december31, 2007, 26percent of the
companys proved reserves were located in kazakhstan. the
company also has significant interests in organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec) member
countries including angola, indonesia, nigeria and venezuela.
twenty-eight percent of the companys net proved reserves,
including affiliates, were located in opec countries at
december31, 2007.

regulation
of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons
operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons
products.
management believes it is reasonably likely that the scientific
and political attention to issues concerning the existence and
extent of climate change, and the role of human activity in it,
will continue, with the potential for further regulation that
affects the companys operations. although uncertain, these
developments could increase costs or reduce the demand for the
products the company sells. the companys production and
processing operations (e.g., the production of crude oil at
offshore platforms and the processing of natural gas at
liquefied natural gas facilities) typically result in emissions
of greenhouse gases. likewise, emissions arise from midstream
and downstream operations, including crude oil transportation
and refining. finally, although beyond the control of the
company, the use of passenger vehicle fuels and related products
by consumers also results in greenhouse gas emissions that may
be regulated.
international agreements, domestic legislation and regulatory
measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in
various phases of discussion or implementation. these include
the kyoto protocol, proposed federal legislation and current
state-level actions. some of the countries in which chevron
operates have ratified the kyoto protocol, and the company is
currently complying with greenhouse gas emissions limits within
the european union. although resolutions supporting cap
and trade systems have been introduced in the
u.s.congress, no bill restricting greenhouse gas emissions
has been passed to date.
in california, the global warming solutions act became effective
on january1, 2007. this law caps californias
greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020; directs the air
resources board, the responsible state agency, to determine
certain greenhouse gas emissions in and outside california to
adopt mandatory reporting rules for significant sources of
greenhouse gases; delegates to the agency the authority to adopt
compliance mechanisms (including market-based approaches); and
permits a one-year extension of the targets under extraordinary
circumstances. related regulatory activity is under way within
the california public utilities commission. the air resources
board and the california energy commission are also in the
process of developing a low carbon fuel standard for
transportation fuels used in california, as directed by governor
arnold schwarzenegger. the company extracts crude oil and
natural gas, operates refineries, and markets and sells
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in california. the extent to which
the state and local agencies regulations will affect the
companys california operations was not known as of early
2008.

business environment and outlook
chevron is a global energy company with significant business activities in the following
countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad,
china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, france, india, indonesia, kazakhstan,
myanmar, the netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned neutral zone between saudi arabia and
kuwait, the philippines, qatar, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea,
thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela and vietnam.
current and future earnings of the company depend largely on the profitability of its upstream
(exploration and production) and downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) business
segments. the single biggest factor that affects the results of operations for both segments is
movement in the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost
component of refined products.
the overall trend in earnings is typically less affected by results from the companys chemicals
business and other activities and investments. earnings for the company in any period may also be
influenced by events or transactions that are infrequent and/or unusual in nature.
chevron and the oil and gas industry at large continue to experience an increase in certain
costs that exceeds the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. this increase in
costs is affecting the companys operating expenses and capital expenditures, particularly for the
upstream business. the companys operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing
economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates,
including the united states. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
government and the company or other governments may impact the companys operations or investments.
those developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and
are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in
such countries.
to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must
develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer adequate financial returns for the
investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to
explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many
technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in
this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. in the current
environment of higher commodity prices, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or
impose additional costs on the company. other governments may attempt to do so in the future. the
company will continue to monitor these developments, take them into account in evaluating future
investment opportunities, and otherwise seek to mitigate any risks to the companys current
operations or future prospects.
the company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value, or to acquire assets or operations complementary to
its asset base to help augment the companys growth. asset sales during 2007 included the companys
31percent ownership interest in a refinery and related assets in the netherlands; fuels marketing
businesses in belgium, luxembourg, the netherlands and uruguay; and the investment in common stock
of dynegy inc. other asset dispositions and restructurings may occur in future periods and could
result in significant gains or losses.
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:
fs-2
table of contents
upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over
which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic
conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum
exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and
regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that
may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. moreover, any of these
factors could also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region. the company
monitors developments closely in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and
attempts to manage risks in operating its facilities and business.
price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the
efficient production of crude oil and natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond
the companys control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation but also
prices charged by the industrys material- and service-providers, which can be affected by the
volatility of the industrys own supply and demand conditions for such materials and services. the
oil and gas industry worldwide has experienced significant price increases for these items since
2005, and future price increases may continue to exceed the general level of inflation. capital and
exploratory expenditures and operating expenses also can be affected by damages to production
facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.
industry price levels for crude oil increased during 2007. the spot price for west texas
intermediate (wti)crude oil, a benchmark crude oil, averaged $72 per barrel in 2007, up
approximately $6 per barrel from the 2006 average price. the rise in crude oil prices was
attributed primarily to increasing demand in growing economies, the heightened level of
geopolitical uncertainty in some areas of the world and supply concerns in other key producing
regions. as of mid-february2008, the wti price was about $93 per barrel.
as in 2006, a wide differential in prices existed in 2007 between high-quality (i.e.,
high-gravity, low sulfur) crude oils
and those of lower quality (i.e., low-gravity, heavier types of crude). the price for the heavier
crudes has been dampened because of ample supply and lower relative demand due to the limited
number of refineries that are able to process this lower-quality feedstock into light products
(i.e., motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the price for
higher-quality crude oil has remained high, as the demand for light products, which can be
more easily manufactured by refineries from high-quality crude oil, has been strong worldwide.
chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad,
indonesia, the partitioned neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and certain
fields in angola, china and the united kingdom north sea. (refer to
page fs-l0 for the
companys average u.s. and international crude oil prices.)
in contrast to price movements in
the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are
more closely aligned with supply and demand conditions in those markets. in the united states
during 2007, benchmark prices at henry hub averaged about $7 per thousand cubic feet (mcf),
compared with about $6.50 in 2006. as of mid-february2008, the henry hub price was about $8
per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated
with the volumes produced in north america and the inventory in underground storage relative
to customer demand. u.s. natural gas prices are also typically higher during the winter period
when demand for heating is greatest.
certain other regions of the world in which the company operates have different supply, demand
and regulatory circumstances, typically resulting in significantly lower average sales prices for
the companys production of natural gas. (refer to page fs-l0 for the companys average natural gas
prices for the u.s. and international regions.) additionally, excess-supply conditions that exist
in certain parts of the world cannot easily serve to mitigate the relatively high-
fs-3
table of contents
managements
discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
price conditions in the united states and other markets because of the lack of infrastructure to
transport and receive liquefied natural gas.
to help address this regional imbalance between supply and demand for natural gas, chevron is
planning increased investments in long-term projects in areas of excess supply to install
infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker, along with investments
and commitments to regasify the product in markets where demand is strong and supplies are not as
plentiful. due to the significance of the overall investment in these long-term projects, the
natural gas sales prices in the areas of excess supply (before the natural gas is transferred to a
company-owned or third-party processing facility) are expected to remain well below sales prices
for natural gas that is produced much nearer to areas of high demand and can be transported in
existing natural gas pipeline networks (as in the united states).
besides the impact of the fluctuation in price for crude oil and natural gas, the longer-term
trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the
companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in
fiscal terms of contracts, changes in tax rates on income, and the cost of goods and services.
chevrons worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2007, including volumes produced from oil
sands, averaged 2.62million barrels per day, a decline of about 48,000 barrels per day from 2006,
due mainly to the effect of a conversion of operating service agreements in venezuela to
joint-stock companies. (refer to the table selected operating
data on page fs-l0 for a listing of
production volumes for each of the three years ending december31, 2007.) the company estimates
that oil-equivalent production in 2008 will average approximately 2.65million barrels per day.
this estimate is subject to many uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec, the
price effect on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions
of certain contracts, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
delays in project start-ups, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing
geopolitics or other disruptions to operations. future production levels also are affected by the
size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time
lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. most of chevrons upstream
investment is currently being made outside the united states. investments in upstream projects
generally are made well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas
production.
approximately 28percent of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2007 occurred in
the opec-member countries of angola, indonesia, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned
neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. opec quotas did not significantly affect chevrons production level in 2007.
the impact of opec quotas on the companys production in 2008 is
uncertain.
in october2006, chevrons boscan and ll-652 operating service agreements in venezuela were
converted to empresas mixtas (i.e., joint-stock companies), with petrleos de venezuela, s.a.
(pdvsa)as majority shareholder. from that time, chevron reported its equity share of the boscan
and ll-652 production, which was approximately 85,000 barrels per day less than what the company
previously reported under the operating service agreements. the change to the empresa mixta
structure did not have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
in february2007, the president of venezuela issued a decree announcing the governments
intention for pdvsa to take over operational control of all orinoco heavy oil associations
effective may1, 2007, and to increase its ownership in all such associations to a minimum of 60
percent. the decree included chevrons 30percent-owned hamaca project. in april2007, chevron
signed a memorandum of understanding (mou)with pdvsa that summarized the ongoing discussions to
transfer control of hamaca operations in accordance with the february decree. as provided in the
mou, a pdvsa-controlled transitory operational committee, on which chevron had representation,
assumed responsibility for daily operations on may1, 2007. the mou stipulated that terms of
existing contracts were to remain in place during the transition period. in december2007, chevron
executed a conversion agreement and signed a charter and by-laws with a pdvsa subsidiary that
provided for chevron to retain its 30percent interest in the hamaca project. the new entity,
petropiar, commenced activities in january2008. the conversion agreement did not have a material
effect on chevrons results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
refer to pages fs-6 through fs-7 for additional discussion of the companys upstream
operations.
downstreamearnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining and
marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil and feedstocks
for chemical manufacturing. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the
global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and by changes in the price of
crude oil used for refinery feedstock. industry margins can also be influenced by refined-product
inventory levels, geopolitical events, refinery maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries
resulting from unplanned outages that may be due to severe weather, fires or other operational
events.
other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the companys refining and marketing network, the effectiveness of the crude-oil and
fs-4
table of contents
product-supply functions and the economic returns on invested capital.
profitability can also be affected by the volatility of tanker charter rates for the companys
shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product
tankers. other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and
energy costs to operate the companys refinery and distribution network.
the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the
u.s. gulf coast, latin america, asia, sub-saharan africa and the united kingdom. chevron
operates or has ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas except latin america. for
the industry, refined-product margins were generally higher in 2007 than in 2006. for the company,
u.s. refined-product margins during 2007 were negatively affected by planned and unplanned downtime
at its three largest u.s. refineries.
industry margins in the future may be volatile and are influenced by changes in the price of
crude oil used for refinery feedstock and by changes in the supply and demand for crude oil and
refined products. the industry supply and demand balance can be affected by disruptions at
refineries resulting from maintenance programs and unplanned outages, including weather-related
disruptions; refined-product inventory levels; and geopolitical events.
refer to page fs-7 through fs-8 for additional discussion of the companys downstream
operations.
chemicalsearnings in the petrochemicals business are closely tied to global chemical demand,
industry inventory levels and plant capacity utilization. feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to
follow crude oil and natural gas price movements, also influence earnings in this segment.

total production is expected to increase to a maximum of 500million cubic feet per day by 2010.
chinasigned a 30-year production-sharing contract with china national petroleum corporation
to assume operatorship and hold a 49percent interest in the development of the chuandongbei
natural gas area in central china. design input capacity of the proposed gas plants is expected to
be 740million cubic feet of natural gas per day.
indonesiabegan commercial operation of the 1l0-megawatt darajat iii geothermal power plant in
garut, west java. the plant increased darajats total capacity to 259 megawatts.
kazakhstaninitiated production from the first phase of the sour gas injection and second
generation plant expansion projects at the 50percent-owned tengiz field. this phase increased
production capacity by 90,000 barrels of crude oil per day to approximately 400,000. full facility
expansion is expected to occur during the second-half 2008, increasing production capacity to
540,000 barrels per day.
republic of the congoconfirmed two crude oil discoveries in the offshore moho-bilondo permit.
evaluation and development studies were undertaken to appraise the discoveries, in which chevron
holds a 32percent nonoperated working interest.
thailandsigned an agreement to increase sales of natural gas from company-operated blocks 10,
11, 12 and 13 in the gulf of thailand to ptt public company limited. chevron has ownership
interests ranging from 60percent to 80percent in the blocks, which received 10-year
production-period extensions to 2022. the company was also granted the concession rights for a
six-year period to four prospective offshore petroleum blocks, three of which it will operate.
trinidad and tobagosigned an agreement to sell natural gas to the national gas company of
trinidad and tobago for 11 years with an option for a four-year extension. the gas is expected to
be sourced from chevrons 50percent-owned east coast marine area.
united statesannounced that first production from the tahiti project in the deepwater gulf of
mexico is expected by the third quarter 2009. the start-up is approximately one year later than
originally planned due to metallurgical problems with the mooring shackles for the floating
production facility.

u.s.
upstream income of $4.5billion in 2007 increased approximately $260million from
2006. results in 2007 benefited approximately $700million from higher prices for crude oil and
natural gas liquids. this benefit to income was partially offset by the
effects of a decline in
oil-equivalent production and an increase in depreciation, operating and exploration expenses.
income of $4.3billion in 2006 increased approximately $100million from 2005. earnings in
2006 benefited about $850million from higher average prices on oil-equivalent production and the
effect of seven additional months of production from the unocal properties that were acquired in
august2005. substantially offsetting these benefits were increases in operating, exploration and
depreciation expenses. included in the operating expense increases were costs associated with the
carryover effects of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in 2005.
the companys average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2007 was $63.16 per
barrel, compared with $56.66 in 2006 and $46.97 in 2005. the average natural gas realization was
$6.12 per thousand cubic feet in 2007, compared with $6.29 and $7.43 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
net oil-equivalent production in 2007 averaged 743,000 barrels per day, down 2.6percent from
2006 and up 2percent from 2005, which included only five months of production from the unocal
properties acquired in august of that year. the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production
for 2007 averaged 460,000 barrels a day, which was essentially flat compared with 2006, and an
increase of 1percent from 2005. net natural gas production averaged 1.7billion cubic feet per day
in 2007, down 6percent from 2006 and up 4percent from 2005.

international upstream income of $10.3billion in 2007 increased $1.4billion from 2006.
earnings in 2007 benefited approximately $1.6billion from higher prices, primarily for crude oil,
and $300million from increased liftings. non-recurring income tax items also benefited earnings
between periods. these benefits to income were partially offset by the impact of higher operating
and depreciation expenses.
income in 2006 of approximately $8.9billion increased $1.3billion from 2005. earnings in
2006 benefited approximately $3billion from higher prices for crude oil and natural gas and an
additional seven months of production from the former unocal properties. about 70percent of this
benefit was associated with the impact of higher prices. substantially offsetting these benefits
were increases in depreciation expense, operating expense and exploration expense. also adversely
affecting 2006 income were higher taxes related to an increase in tax rates in the u.k. and
venezuela and settlement of tax claims and other tax items in venezuela, angola and chad. foreign
currency effects reduced earnings by $371million in 2006, but increased income $14million in
2005.
the companys average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2007 was $65.01 per
barrel, compared with $57.65 in 2006 and $47.59 in 2005. the average natural gas realization was
$3.90 per thousand cubic feet in 2007, compared with $3.73 and $3.19 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
net oil-equivalent production of 1.88million barrels per day in 2007 declined about 2percent
from 2006 and increased 5percent from 2005. the volumes for each year included production from oil
sands in canada and an operating service agreement in venezuela until its conversion to a
joint-stock company in october2006. the decline between 2006 and 2007 was associated with the
impact of this contract conversion in venezuela and the price effects on production volumes
calculated under production-sharing agreements. partially offsetting the decline was increased
production in bangladesh, angola and azerbaijan. the increase from 2005 was due to that year having
included only five months of production from the former unocal properties.
the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production was 1.3million barrels per day in
2007, a decrease of approximately 4percent from 2006 and 3percent from 2005. net natural gas
production of 3.3billion cubic feet per day in 2007 was up 5.5percent and 28percent from 2006

$
u.s. downstream earnings of $966million in 2007 declined nearly $1billion from 2006 and
were essentially the same as 2005. the decline in 2007 from 2006 was associated mainly with weaker
refined-product margins due to the effects of higher crude oil prices and the negative impacts of
higher planned and unplanned downtime on refinery production volumes at the companys three major
refineries. operating expenses were also higher in 2007. the improvement in 2006 earnings from 2005
was primarily associated with higher average refined-product margins in 2006 and the adverse effect
of downtime in 2005 at refining, marketing and pipeline operations that was caused by hurricanes in
the gulf of mexico.
sales volumes of refined products were 1.46million barrels per day in 2007, a decrease of 3
percent and 1percent from 2006 and 2005, respectively. the reported sales volume for 2007 was on a
different basis than 2006 and 2005 due to a change in accounting rules that became effective april
1, 2006, for certain purchase and sale (buy/sell) contracts with the same counterparty. excluding
the impact of this accounting standard, refined-product sales in 2007 decreased 1percent from 2006
and increased about 5percent from 2005. branded gasoline sales volumes of 629,000 barrels per day
in 2007 increased about 2percent from 2006 and 6percent from 2005, largely due to growth of the
texaco brand.

sale of assets, including an interest in a refinery and marketing
assets in the benelux region of
europe. margins on the sale of refined products in 2007 were up slightly from the prior year.
operating expenses were higher, and earnings from the companys shipping operations were lower. the
increase in earnings in 2006 compared with 2005 was associated mainly with the benefit of higher
refined-product sales margins in the asia-pacific area and canada and improved results from
crude-oil and refined-product trading activities.
refined-product sales volumes were 2.03million barrels per day in 2007, about 5percent and

for the cost of employee payroll and contract labor. total expenses increased in 2006 from 2005 due
mainly to the inclusion of former-unocal expenses for the full year 2006. besides this effect,
expenses were higher in 2006 for labor, transportation, and uninsured costs associated with the
hurricanes in 2005.

taxes other than on income increased in 2007 from a year earlier due to higher duties in
the companys u.k. downstream operations. taxes other than on income were essentially unchanged in
2006 from 2005, with the effect of higher u.s. refined product sales being offset by lower sales
volumes subject to duties in the companys european downstream operations.

interest and debt expense in 2007 decreased from 2006 primarily due to lower average debt
balances and higher amounts of interest capitalized. the decrease in 2006 vs. 2005 was mainly due
to lower average debt balances and an increase in the amount of interest capitalized, partially
offset by higher average interest rates on commercial paper and other variable-rate debt.

effective income tax rates were 42percent in 2007, 46percent in 2006 and 44percent in
2005. rates were lower in 2007 compared with the prior year due mainly to the impact of
nonrecurring items, including asset sales in 2007 and the absence of 2006 charges related to a
tax-law change that increased tax rates on upstream operations in the u.k. north sea and the
settlement of a tax claim in venezuela. the higher tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 also
reflected these nonrecurring charges in 2006. refer also to the discussion of income taxes in note

cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiestotal balances were $8.1billion
and $11.4billion at december31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. cash provided by operating
activities in 2007 was $25.0billion, compared with $24.3billion in 2006 and $20.1billion in
2005.
cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
$300million, $400million and $1.0billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. cash provided by
investing activities included proceeds from asset sales of $3.3billion in 2007, $1.0billion in
2006 and $2.7billion in 2005.
cash provided by operating activities and asset sales during 2007 was sufficient to fund the
companys $17.7billion capital and exploratory program, pay $4.8billion of dividends to
stockholders and repay approximately $3.7billion of debt.
restricted cash of $799million associated with capital-investment projects at the companys
pascagoula, mississippi, refinery and angola liquefied natural gas project was invested in
short-term marketable securities and reclassified from cash equivalents to a long-term asset on the
consolidated balance sheet.
dividendsthe company paid dividends of approximately $4.8billion in 2007, $4.4
billion in 2006 and $3.8billion in 2005. in april2007, the company increased its quarterly common
stock dividend by 11.5percent to 58 cents per share.
debt,
capital lease and minority interest obligationstotal debt and capital lease
balances were $7.2billion at december31, 2007, down from $9.8billion at year-end 2006. the
company also had minority interest obligations of $204million, down from $209million at december
31, 2006.
the $2.6billion reduction in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2007 included
the early redemption and maturity of individual debt issues. in february, $144million of texaco
capital inc. bonds matured. in the second and fourth quarters, the company redeemed approximately
$809million and $65million, respectively of texaco capital inc.
debt and recognized an after-tax
loss of approximately $175million. in august, $2billion of chevron canada funding company bonds
matured. in december, the company issued a $650million tax exempt mississippi gulf opportunity
zone bond to fund an upgrade project at the companys refinery in pascagoula, mississippi.
commercial paper balances at the end of 2007 declined approximately
$450million from $3.5billion
at year-end 2006. in february2008, $750million of chevron canada funding company bonds matured.
the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of
commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $5.5billion at december31,
2007, down from $6.6billion at year-end 2006. of these amounts, $4.4billion and $4.5billion were
reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. at year-end 2007, settlement of
these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the
company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance
them on a long-term basis.
at year-end 2007, the company had $5billion in committed credit facilities with various major
banks, which permit the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these
facilities support commercial paper borrowing and also can be used for general corporate purposes.
the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on
substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings
under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on london interbank
offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms
reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these
facilities at december31, 2007.
in march2007, the company filed with the securities and exchange commission (sec)an
automatic registration statement that expires in march2010. this registration statement is for an
unspecified amount of non-convertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. at the
same time, the company withdrew three shelf registration statements on file with the sec that
permitted the issuance of up to $3.8billion of debt securities.
at december31, 2007, the company had outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation
profit sharing/savings plan trust fund, chevron canada funding company (formerly chevrontexaco
capital company), texaco capital inc. and union oil company of california. all of these securities
are guaranteed by chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poors corporation and aal
by moodys investors service. the rating by moodys reflects an upgrade in december from aa2. the
companys u.s. commercial paper is rated a-l+ by standard and poors and p-1 by moodys. all of
these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. the company
believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash

requirements and that during periods of low prices for crude oil and
natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, it has the flexibility
to increase borrowings and/or modify capital-spending plans to continue paying the common stock
dividend and maintain the companys high-quality debt ratings.
common stock repurchase program a $5billion stock repurchase program initiated in
december2006 was completed in september2007. during 2007, about 61.5million common shares were
acquired under this program at a total cost of $4.9billion. upon completion of this program, the
company authorized the acquisition of up to $15billion of additional common shares from time to
time at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject
to market conditions and other factors. the program is for a period of up to three years and may be
discontinued at any time. as of december31, 2007, 23.5million shares had been acquired under the new
program for $2.1billion. purchases through mid-february2008 increased the total shares acquired
to 34.2million at a cost of approximately $3.0billion.
capital and exploratory expenditures total reported expenditures for 2007 were $20billion,
including $2.3billion for the companys share of affiliates expenditures, which did not require
cash outlays by the company. in 2006 and 2005, expenditures were $16.6billion and $11.1billion,
respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $1.9billion and $1.7
billion in the corresponding periods. the 2005 amount excludes $17.3billion for the acquisition of
unocal corporation.
of the $20billion in expenditures for 2007, about three-fourths, or $15.5billion, related to
upstream activities. approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream operations in
2006 and 2005. international upstream accounted for about 70percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in each of the three years, reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities
that are available outside the united states.
in 2008, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 15percent higher
at $22.9billion, including $2.6billion of spending by affiliates. about three-fourths of the
total, or $17.5billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $12.7billion
of this amount outside the united states. spending in 2008 is primarily targeted for exploratory
prospects in the deepwater gulf of mexico and western africa and major development projects in
angola, australia, brazil, indonesia, kazakhstan, nigeria, thailand, the deepwater gulf of mexico,
the piceance basin in colorado and an oil sands project in canada.
worldwide downstream spending in 2008 is estimated at $4.1billion, with about $2.3billion
for projects in the united states. capital projects include upgrades to refineries in the united
states and south korea and construction of gas-to-liquids facilities in support of associated
upstream projects.
investments in chemicals, technology and other corporate businesses in 2008 are budgeted at
$1.3billion. technology investments include projects related to unconventional hydrocarbons
technologies, oil and gas reservoir management and gas-fired and renewable power generation.

pension obligations in 2007, the companys pension plan contributions were $317million
(approximately $78million to the u.s. plans). the company estimates contributions in 2008
will be approximately $500million. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment
results, changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors.

costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $7billion.
interest coverage ratio  income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and
amortization of capitalized interest, divided by before-tax interest costs. the companys
interest coverage ratio was higher between 2007 and 2006 and between 2006 and 2005, primarily
due to higher before-tax income and lower average debt balances in each of the subsequent years.
debt ratio  total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity. the progressive decrease

the companys guarantee of approximately $600million is associated with certain payments
under a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. the terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will reduce over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron carries no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.
indemnificationsthe company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon
and motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300million. through the end of 2007, the company had paid $48million
under these indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification
payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims must be asserted no later than february2009 for equilon indemnities and no
later than february2012 for motiva indemnities. under the terms of these indemnities, there is no
maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. the company has not recorded any
liabilities for possible claims under these indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral
and has made no payments under the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts recovered
from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or motiva prior to
september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. under the indemnification

securitizationduring 2007, the company completed the sale of its u.s. proprietary consumer
credit card business and related receivables. this transaction included terminating the qualifying
special purpose entity (spe)that was used to securitize associated retail accounts receivable.
through the use of another qualifying spe, the company had $675million of securitized trade
accounts receivable related to its downstream business as of
december31, 2007. this arrangement has
the effect of accelerating chevrons collection of the securitized amounts. chevrons total
estimated financial exposure under this securitization at
december31, 2007, was $65million. in the
event that the spe experiences major defaults in the collection of receivables, chevron believes
that it would have no additional loss exposure connected with third-party investments in this
securitization.
minority intereststhe company has commitments of $204million related to minority interests
in subsidiary companies.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreementsthe company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements
typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs,
utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys
business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments
are: 2008  $4.7billion; 2009  $3.3billion; 2010  $3.3billion; 2011  $1.9billion; 2012
$1.3billion; 2013 and after  $4.9billion. a portion of these commitments may ultimately be
shared with project partners. total payments under the agreements were approximately $3.7billion

financial and derivative instruments
no material change in market risk occurred between 2006 and 2007 for the financial and
derivative instruments discussed below. the hypothetical variances used in this section were
selected for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the companys estimation of market
changes. the actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors
discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading risk factors in
part1, item1a, of the companys 2007 annual report
on form 10-k.
commodity derivative instrumentschevron is exposed to market risks related to the price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company
refineries. the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.
the results of this activity were not material to the companys financial position, net income or
cash flows in 2007.
fs-14
table of contents
the companys market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal risk control group to ensure compliance with the companys risk management policies that
have been approved by the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
the derivative instruments used in the companys risk management and trading activities
consist mainly of futures, options, and swap contracts traded on the nymex (new york mercantile
exchange) and on electronic platforms of ice (inter-continental exchange) and globex (chicago
mercantile exchange). in addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap contracts and
option contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and
gas companies in the over-the-counter markets.
virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other
independent third-party quotes.
effective with 2007year-end reporting, the company changed the model used to quantify
information about market risk for its commodity derivatives from a sensitivity analysis approach
to value-at-risk (var). the major reason for the change is that var allows estimation of a
portfolios aggregate market risk exposure and takes into account correlations between trading
assets. therefore, it reflects risk reduction due to diversification or hedging activities. most of
the companys market positions are time and commodity spreads, and the company believes that var is
a more accurate tool to measure this type of exposure than the sensitivity analysis model. the
company fully developed and tested its var model during 2007.
var is the maximum loss not to be exceeded within a given probability or confidence level over
a given period of time. the companys var model uses the monte carlo simulation method that
involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified probability distribution and
constructing a full distribution of a potential portfolios values.
the var model utilizes an exponentially-weighted moving average for computing historical
volatilities and correlations, a 95percent confidence level, and one-day holding period. that is,
the companys 95percent, one-day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that
would not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were held
constant for one day.
the one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be
liquidated or hedged within one day. for hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options, as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most
of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. the table below presents 95
percent/one-day var for each of the companys primary risk exposures in the area of commodity
derivative instruments at december31, 2007:

sensitivity analysis for the companys open commodity derivative instruments at december
31, 2007, and december31, 2006, based on a hypothetical 10percent increase in commodity prices, is
provided in the following table:

the same hypothetical decrease in prices of these commodities would result in
approximately the same opposite effects on the fair values of the contracts. the hypothetical
effect on these contracts was estimated by calculating the fair value of the contracts as the
difference between the hypothetical and current market prices multiplied by the contract amounts.
the change in the amounts between years in the table above for crude oil and refined products
is associated with an increase in commodity prices, volumes hedged and the use of longer-term
contracts.
foreign currencythe company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of
180days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue
and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical 10percent increase in the value of the u.s. dollar at
year-end 2007 would be a reduction in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts of
approximately $75million. the effect would be the opposite for a hypothetical 10percent decrease
in the value of the u.s. dollar at year-end 2007.
interest ratesthe company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges. interest rate swaps related to
floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. at year-end 2007, the company had no interest-rate swaps on floating-rate
debt. at year-end 2007, the weighted average maturity of receive fixed interest rate swaps was
less than one year. a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 basis points in fixed interest rates
would have a de minimis impact on the fair value of the receive fixed swaps.

litigation and other contingencies
mtbechevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary
butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. the company is a party to 88 lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of
mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepages of mtbe into groundwater. chevron has
agreed in principle to a tentative settlement of 60 pending lawsuits and claims. the terms of this
agreement, which must be approved by a number of parties, including the court, are confidential and
not material to the companys results of operations, liquidity or financial position.
resolution of remaining lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or
ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other
parties. additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury
claims, may be filed in the future. the tentative settlement of the referenced 60 lawsuits did not
set any precedents related to standards of liability to be used to judge the merits of the claims,
corrective measures required or monetary damages to be assessed for the remaining lawsuits and
claims or future lawsuits and claims. as a result, the companys ultimate exposure related to
pending lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but could be material to net income in
any one period. the company no longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states.
rfg patentfourteen purported class actions were brought by consumers of reformulated gasoline
(rfg)alleging that unocal misled the california air resources board into adopting standards for
composition of rfg that overlapped with unocals undisclosed and pending patents. eleven lawsuits
were consolidated in u.s. district court for the central district of california, where a class
action has been certified, and three were consolidated in a state court action. unocal is alleged
to have monopolized, conspired and engaged in unfair methods of competition, resulting in injury to
consumers of rfg. plaintiffs in both consolidated actions seek unspecified actual and punitive
damages, attorneys fees, and interest on behalf of an alleged class of consumers who
purchased
summertime rfg in california from january1995 through august2005. the parties have reached a
tentative agreement to resolve all of the above matters in an amount that is not material to the
companys results of operations, liquidity or financial position. the terms of this agreement are
confidential, and subject to further negotiation and approval, including by the courts.
environmentalthe company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe,
by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields,
service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may
be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized.
the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

included in the $1,539million year-end 2007 reserve balance were remediation activities
of 240 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or
otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)or other
regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws. the
companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2007 was $123million. the federal
superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible
parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume
other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected
to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or liquidity.
of
the remaining year-end 2007 environmental reserves balance of $1,416million, $864million
related to approximately 2,000 sites for the companys u.s. downstream operations, including
refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and
pipelines. the remaining $552million was associated with various sites in international
downstream ($146million), upstream ($267million), chemicals ($105million) and other ($34
million). liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2007 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
the company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with financial accounting
standards board statement (fasb)no.143, accounting for asset retirement obligations (fas 143).
under fas 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when
there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability
can be reasonably estimated. the liability balance of approximately $8.3billion for asset
retirement obligations at year-end 2007 related primarily to upstream and mining properties.
for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities,
no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the
end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been
made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

interpretation of fasb statement no.143
(fin 47), and the discussion of environmental matters on page fs-18.
income taxesthe company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. refer to note 15 beginning on page fs-43 for a discussion of the periods for which tax
returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax
jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the company does not
expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
suspended wellsthe company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude oil and natural gas fields. the
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity or
development decisions or both. at december31, 2007, the company had approximately $1.7billion of
suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $421
million from 2006 and an increase of $551million from 2005.
the future trend of the companys exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. the effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $1.7billion of suspended wells at year-end 2007 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.
refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-47, for additional discussion of suspended wells.

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
equity redeterminationfor oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may
provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas
reserves. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be
material to earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve at
elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the
u.s. department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for
the four zones. for this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax
liability at approximately $200million, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to
chevron is estimated at about $150million. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount
within this range of estimates are uncertain.
other contingencieschevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading
partners; u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors;
insurers; and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be
significant and take lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. an obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2007 at approximately $2.7billion for its
consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were approximately $900million of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.8billion of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or
divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sites.
for 2008, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.9billion.
these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental
regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by
prior releases of hazardous materials. although these costs may be significant to the results of
operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the
companys liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted
accounting principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over
different reporting periods. all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates or assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity
and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such
matters to change; and
2.
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or
operating performance is material.
fs-18
table of contents
besides those meeting these critical criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. although
not associated with highly uncertain matters, these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be more likely than not. another
example is the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves under sec rules that require ...
geological and engineering data (that)demonstrate with reasonable certainty (reserves)to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions,
i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. refer to table v, reserve quantity
information, beginning on page fs-66, for the changes in these estimates for the three years
ending december31, 2007, and to table vii, changes in the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows from proved reserves on page fs-74 for estimates of proved-reserve values
for each of the three years ending december31, 2007, which were based on year-end prices at the
time. note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-32, includes a
description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities. the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the
timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical accounting policy for impairment of properties, plant and
equipment and investments in affiliates, beginning on page fs-20, includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and
gas properties. this commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. significant accounting policies are
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-32. the
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the audit committee of the board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plansthe determination of pension plan obligations
and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. for other postretirement benefit (opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care
and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining opeb obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed
health care cost-trend rates.
note 20, beginning on page fs-48, includes information on the funded status of the companys
pension and opeb
plans at the end of 2007 and 2006, the components of pension and opeb expense for
the three years ending december31, 2007, and the underlying assumptions for those periods.
pension and opeb expense is recorded on the consolidated statement of income in operating
expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses and applies to all business segments.
the year-end 2007 and 2006 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and
obligations, of each of the companys pension and opeb plans is recognized on the consolidated
balance sheet. the funded status of overfunded pension plans is recorded as a long-term asset in
deferred charges and other assets. the funded status of underfunded or unfunded pension and opeb
plans is recorded in accrued liabilities or reserves for employee benefit plans. amounts yet to
be recognized as components of pension or opeb expense are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income.
to estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses
a process that incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected
future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors.
asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the
determination of the companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these
studies. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 67
percent of the companys pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8percent since 2002. for the 10
years ending december31, 2007, actual asset returns averaged 8.7percent for this plan.
the year-end market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market
value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2007, the company selected a 6.3
percent discount rate for the major u.s. pension and postretirement plans. this rate was selected
based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to the citigroup
pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2007. the discount rates at the end of 2006 and 2005
were 5.8percent and 5.5percent, respectively.
an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2007 was $620million. as an
indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1
percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the companys primary u.s. pension
plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2007 by approximately $70
fs-19
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
million. a 1percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for
about 60percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan
expense for 2007 by approximately $155million.
an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the
funded status of a plan recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. the total pension liability on
the consolidated balance sheet at december31, 2007, for underfunded plans was approximately $1.7
billion. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary u.s.
pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $250million, which would have
increased the plans over-funded status from approximately $160million to $410million. other
plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. the actual rates of return on plan
assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in
the worlds financial markets.
in 2007, the companys pension plan contributions were $317million (including $78million to
the u.s. plans). in 2008, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $500million.
actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2007 was $233million and the total liability, which
reflected the underfunded status of the plans at the end of 2007, was $2.9billion.
as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2007, a
1percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary u.s. opeb plan, which accounted
for about 75percent of the companywide opeb expense, would have decreased opeb expense by
approximately $20million. a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 87percent of the companywide opeb liabilities, would have decreased total opeb
liabilities at the end of 2007 by approximately $60million.
for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4percent per year. the cap becomes effective in the year of retirement for
pre-medicare-eligible employees retiring on or after january1, 2005. the cap was effective as
of january1, 2005, for pre-medicare-eligible employees retiring before that date and all
medicare-eligible retirees. for active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims experiences
are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 8percent in
2008 and gradually drop to 5percent for 2014 and beyond. as an indication of the health care
cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of
opeb expense in 2007, a 1percent increase in
the rates for the main u.s. opeb plan, which accounted for about 87percent of the companywide opeb
liabilities, would have increased opeb expense $8million.
differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of
each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference
occurs. instead, the differences are included in actuarial gain/loss and unamortized amounts have
been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. refer
to note 20, beginning on page fs-48, for information on the $3.3billion of before-tax actuarial
losses recorded by the company as of december31, 2007; a description of the method used to amortize
those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2008.
impairment
of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliatesthe company
assesses its properties, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
such indicators include changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated
proved-reserve quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash
flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of
the asset over its estimated fair value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply and demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions.
no
major individual impairments of pp&e were recorded for the three years ending december31,
2007. an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of
the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. that is, favorable
changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to
become impaired.
investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as
well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when
the
fs-20
table of contents
fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value. when such a decline is
deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the
difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time. in
making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers
such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and
the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. differing assumptions could
affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment and are not
subject to sensitivity analysis.
from time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines that no write-down
in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when significant
downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or
concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. that is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified
as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets associated carrying values.
business
combinations  purchase-price allocation accounting for business combinations
requires the allocation of the companys purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of
the acquired business at their respective fair values. the company uses all available information
to make these fair value determinations, and for major acquisitions, may hire an independent
appraisal firm to assist in making fair value estimates. in some instances, assumptions with
respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset might
have to be used in determining its fair value. actual timing and amount of net cash flows from
revenues and expenses related to that asset over time may differ materially from those initial
estimates, and if the timing is delayed significantly or if the net cash flows decline
significantly, the asset could become impaired.
goodwillgoodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as
required by fasb statement no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets, the company tests such
goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if
an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount.
contingent lossesmanagement also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. for example, the costs
from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation,
the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and
improvements in technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies
if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally records
these losses as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of income. an exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than
not (i.e. likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. for
additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to note 15
beginning on page fs-43. refer
also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation, and environmental remediation and tax matters for the
three years ended december31, 2007.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.
new accounting standards

measurements. fas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but applies to assets and

february2007, the fasb issued fas 159, which became effective for the company on january1, 2008.
this standard permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses in earnings. such accounting is optional
and is generally to be applied instrument by instrument. the implementation of fas 159 did not have
a material effect on the companys results of operations or consolidated financial position.
fasb statement no.141 (revised 2007), business combinations (fas 141-r)in december
2007, the fasb issued fas 141-r, which will become effective for business combination transactions
having an acquisition date on or after january1, 2009. this standard requires the acquiring entity
in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date to be measured at their respective
fair values. the statement requires acquisition-related costs, as well as restructuring costs the
acquirer expects to incur for
which it is not obligated at acquisition date, to be recorded against
income rather than included in purchase-price determination. it also requires recognition of
contingent arrangements at their acquisition-date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair
value generally reflected in income.
fasb statement no.160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, an
amendment of arb no.51 (fas 160)the fasb issued fas 160 in december2007, which will
become effective for the company january 1, 2009, with retroactive adoption of the statements
presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. this standard will
require ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be presented
within the equity section of the consolidated statement of financial position but separate from the
parents equity. it will also require the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the
consolidated income statement. certain changes in a parents ownership interest are to be accounted
for as equity transactions and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any noncontrolling equity
investment in the former subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value. the company does not
anticipate the implementation of fas 160 will significantly change the presentation of its
consolidated income statement or consolidated balance sheet.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevron corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of chevron corporation and its subsidiaries at
december31, 2007, and december31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended december31, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. also, in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2007, based on
criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule; for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal controls
over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements,
on the financial statement schedule, and on the companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatements and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed risk. our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
thecircumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
as discussed
in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting
for buy/sell contracts on april1, 2006.
as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its
method of accounting for uncertain income tax positions on january1, 2007.
as discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its
method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on december31,
2006.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

summary of significant accounting policies
general exploration and production (upstream)operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas and marketing natural gas. refining, marketing and
transportation (downstream)operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude
oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car.
chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.
the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.
the nature of the companys operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. the company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent-owned and variable-interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to
50percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity
currently in income.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the
investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be other
than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the
amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investees financial
performance, and the companys ability and intention to
retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
the investments market value. the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not
changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. subsequent recoveries in the carrying value of
other investments are reported in other comprehensive income.
differences between the companys
carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys
analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. the companys share of the
affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly when appropriate to reflect the difference
between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values.
derivatives the majority of the companys activity in commodity derivative instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. for the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from the derivative
instruments are reported in current income. for derivative instruments relating to foreign currency
exposures, gains and losses are reported in current income. interest rate swaps  hedging a
portion of the companys fixed-rate debt  are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas
interest rate swaps relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair
value on the consolidated balance sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. where
chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts
recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are offset on the balance
sheet.
short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents.
the balance of the short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and are
marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income.
inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost, using a
last-in, first-out (lifo)method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials,
supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost.

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  continued
properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. costs are also capitalized for exploratory wells that have
found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when
the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. all other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-47, for additional
discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are
assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the united states, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. in the refining, marketing, transportation and
chemical areas, impairment reviews are generally done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a
marketing area or marketing assets by country. impairment amounts are recorded as incremental
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the
carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value.
as required under financial accounting standards board (fasb)statement no.143, accounting for
asset retirement obligations (fas 143), the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an
asset and a liability when there is a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of a
long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. refer
also to note 23, beginning on page fs-57,
relating to aros.
depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and
natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the
unit-of-production method by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced.
depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the
unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic
valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are
expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses for mining assets are determined using the unit-of-production
method as the proven reserves are produced. the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment
are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the declining-balance
method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the straight-line method
generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized
leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as other
income.
expenditures for maintenance (including
those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in
operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. major replacements and renewals are
capitalized.
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as required
by fasb statement no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets, the company tests such goodwill at
the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit below its carrying amount.
environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and
canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future
remediation commitment will be required. for crude oil, natural gas and mineral producing properties,

a liability for an asset retirement obligation is made, following fas
143. refer to note 23, beginning on page fs-57, for a discussion of fas 143.
for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability
for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other
potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties
are not able to pay their respective shares.
the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of future
costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the companys own
internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or reimbursements
are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all
gains and losses from currency translations are currently included in income. the cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in the currency translation adjustment in
stockholders equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on the
basis of the companys net working interest (entitlement method). excise, value-added and similar
taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and
a customer are presented on a gross basis. the associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the
consolidated statement of income on page fs-27. refer to note 13, on page fs-42, for a discussion
of the accounting for buy/sell arrangements.
stock options and other share-based compensation effective july1, 2005, the company adopted the
provisions of fasb statement no.123r, share-based payment (fas 123r), for its share-based
compensation plans. the company previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and
measurement principles of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.25, accounting for stock
issued to employees (apb 25), and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established
by fasb statement no.123, accounting for stock-based compensation (fas 123).
refer to note 21, beginning on page fs-53, for a description of the companys share-based
compensation plans, information related to awards granted under those plans and additional
information on the companys adoption of fas 123r.

activities. refer to note 23, starting on page fs-57, for a discussion of revisions to the
companys asset retirement obligations that did not involve cash receipts or payments in 2007.
in accordance with the cash-flow classification requirements of fas 123r, share-based payment, the
net decrease (increase)in operating working capital includes reductions of $96 and $94 for
excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2007 and 2006,
respectively. these amounts are offset by net purchases of treasury shares.
the 2007 net
purchases of other short-term investments consist of $799 in restricted cash associated with
capital-investment projects at the companys pascagoula, mississippi refinery and angola liquefied
natural gas project that was invested in short-term marketable securities and reclassified from
cash equivalents to a long-term deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet. in december2007,
the company issued a $650 tax exempt mississippi gulf opportunity zone bond as a source of funds
for the pascagoula refinery project.
the net purchases of treasury shares represents the cost of
common shares acquired in the open market less the cost of shares issued for share-based
compensation plans. open-market purchases totaled $7,036, $5,033 and $3,029 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,

financial and derivative instruments
for the financial and derivative instruments discussed below, no material change in market risk
occurred relative to the information presented in 2006.
commodity derivative instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to price volatility of
crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery
feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its
activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and feedstock for company
refineries. the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.
the company uses international swaps and derivatives association agreements to govern derivative
contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. depending on the nature of the
derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. when the company
is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and also
has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net marked-to-market
exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and
is a reasonable measure of the companys credit risk exposure. the company also uses other netting
agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate
credit risk.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, long-term receivables  net and deferred
credits and other noncurrent obligations. gains and losses on the companys risk management
activities are reported as either sales and other operating revenues or purchased crude oil and
products, whereas trading gains and losses are reported as other income.
foreign currency the company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180
days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
fs-36
table of contents
note 7 financial and derivative instruments  continued
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable or accounts payable, with gains and losses reported as other
income.
interest rates the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges.
fair values of the interest rate swaps are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts
and notes receivable or accounts payable.
fair value fair values are derived from quoted market prices, other independent third-party quotes
or, if not available, the present value of the expected cash flows. the fair values reflect the
cash that would have been received or paid if the instruments were settled at year-end.
long-term debt of $2,132 and $5,131 had estimated fair values of $2,325 and $5,621 at december31,
2007 and 2006, respectively.
the company holds cash equivalents and marketable securities in u.s. and non-u.s. portfolios.
eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes, time deposits and commercial paper are the primary
instruments held. cash equivalents and marketable securities had carrying/fair values of $5,427 and
$9,200 at december31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. of
these balances, $4,695 and $8,247 at the respective year-ends were classified as cash equivalents
that had average maturities under 90days. the remainder, classified as marketable securities, had
average maturities of approximately one year. at december31, 2007, restricted cash with a
carrying/fair value of $799 that is related to capital-investment projects at the companys
pascagoula, mississippi refinery and angola liquefied natural gas project was reclassified from
cash equivalents to a long-term deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet. this restricted
cash was invested in short-term marketable securities.
fair values of other financial and derivative instruments at the end of 2007 and 2006 were not
material.
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the companys short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. this diversified
investment policy limits the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit
risk. similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the companys
counterparties in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the
companys broad customer base worldwide. as a consequence, the company believes
concentrations of credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers. when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring
letters of credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.

operating segments and geographic data
although each subsidiary of chevron is responsible for its own affairs, chevron corporation manages
its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. for this purpose, the investments are
grouped as follows: upstream  exploration and production; downstream  refining, marketing and
transportation; chemicals; and all other. the first three of these groupings represent the
companys reportable segments and operating segments as defined in financial accounting
standards board (fasb)statement no.131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related
information (fas 131).
the segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
segment managers who report to the companys chief operating decision maker (codm) (terms as
defined in fas 131). the codm is the companys executive committee, a committee of senior officers
that includes the chief executive officer and that, in turn, reports to the board of directors of
chevron corporation.
the operating segments represent components of the company as described in fas 131 terms that
engage in activities (a)from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b)whose
operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm, which makes decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segments and to assess their performance; and (c)for which discrete financial
information is available.
segment managers for the reportable segments are accountable directly to and maintain regular
contact with the companys codm to discuss the segments operating activities and financial
performance. the codm approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and exploratory budgets. however, business-unit managers within the
operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and
all other matters connected with daily operations. company officers who are members of the
executive committee also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other
committees for purposes other than acting as the codm.
all other activities include the companys interest in dynegy (through may2007, when chevron
sold its interest), mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and
debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate
activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies.

the companys primary country of operation is the united states of america, its country of
domicile. other components of the companys operations are reported as international (outside the
united states).
segment earnings the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest

accounting for buy/sell contracts
the company adopted the accounting prescribed by emerging issues task force (eitf)issue no.04-13,
accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty (issue 04-13) on a
prospective basis from april1, 2006. issue 04-13 requires that two or more legally separate
exchange transactions with the same counterparty, including buy/sell transactions, be combined and
considered as a single arrangement for purposes of applying the provisions of accounting principles
board opinion no.29, accounting for nonmonetary transactions, when the transactions are entered
into in contemplation of one another. in prior
periods, the company accounted for buy/sell
transactions in the consolidated statement of income as a monetary transaction  purchases were
reported as purchased crude oil and products; sales were reported as sales and other operating
revenues.
with the companys adoption of issue 04-13, buy/sell transactions beginning in the
second quarter 2006 are netted against each other on the consolidated statement of income, with no
effect on net income. amounts associated with buy/sell transactions in periods prior to the second

litigation
mtbe chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. the company is a party to 88 lawsuits and claims, the majority
of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of mtbe in
certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepages of mtbe into groundwater. chevron has agreed
in principle to a tentative settlement of 60 pending lawsuits and claims. the terms of this
agreement, which must be approved by a number of parties, including the court, are confidential and
not material to the companys results of operations, liquidity or financial position.
resolution of
remaining lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the
alleged effects on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties.
additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be
filed in the future. the tentative settlement of the referenced 60 lawsuits did not set any
precedents related to standards of liability to be used to judge the merits of the claims,
corrective measures required or monetary damages to be assessed for the remaining lawsuits and
claims or future lawsuits and claims. as a result, the companys ultimate exposure related to
pending lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but could be material to net income in
any one period. the company no longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united
states.
rfg patent fourteen purported class actions were brought by consumers of reformulated gasoline
(rfg)alleging that unocal misled the california air resources board into adopting standards for
composition of rfg that overlapped with unocals undisclosed and pending patents. eleven lawsuits
were consolidated in u.s. district court for the central district of california, where a class
action has been certified, and three were consolidated in a state court action. unocal is alleged
to have monopolized, conspired and engaged in unfair methods of competition, resulting in injury to
consumers of rfg. plaintiffs in both consolidated actions seek unspecified actual and punitive
damages, attorneys fees, and interest on behalf of an alleged class of consumers who purchased
summertime rfg in california from january1995 through august2005. the parties have reached a
tentative agreement to resolve all of the above matters in an amount that is not material to the
companys results of operations, liquidity or
financial position. the terms of this agreement are
confidential, and subject to further negotiation and approval, including by the courts.

in 2007, before-tax income for u.s. operations, including related corporate and other charges, was
$7,794, compared with before-tax income of $9,131 and $6,733 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. for
international operations, before-tax income was $24,373, $22,845 and $18,464 in 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. u.s. federal income tax expense was reduced by $132, $116 and $289 in 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively, for business tax credits.

in 2007, deferred tax liabilities increased by approximately $1,000 from the amount reported in
2006. the increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for properties, plant
and equipment.
deferred tax assets increased by approximately $1,900 in 2007. the increase related primarily to
additional foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions.
this increase was substantially offset by valuation allowances.
the overall valuation allowance relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards
and temporary differences for which no benefit is expected to be realized. tax loss carryforwards
exist in many international jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have
an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2008 through 2029. foreign tax credit
carryforwards of $3,138 will expire between 2008 and 2017.

income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. undistributed earnings of international consolidated
subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible
future remittances totaled $20,557 at december31, 2007. this amount represents earnings reinvested
as part of the companys ongoing international business. it is not practicable to estimate the
amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of earnings that are intended to
be reinvested indefinitely. at the end of 2007, deferred income taxes were recorded for the
undistributed earnings of certain international operations for which the company no longer intends
to indefinitely reinvest the earnings. the company does not anticipate incurring significant
additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.
uncertain income tax positions effective january1, 2007, the company implemented financial
accounting standards board (fasb)interpretation no.48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
an interpretation of fasb statement no.109
(fin 48), which clarifies the accounting for income tax benefits that are uncertain in nature. this
interpretation was intended by the standard-setters to address the diversity in practice that
existed in this area of accounting for income taxes.
under fin 48, a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a
likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the
technical merits of the position. the term tax position in fin 48 refers to a position in a
previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is
reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual
periods. the accounting interpretation also provides guidance on measurement methodology,
derecognition thresholds, financial statement classification and disclosures, recognition of
interest and penalties, and accounting for the cumulative-effect adjustment at the date of
adoption. upon adoption of fin 48 on january1, 2007, the company recorded a cumulative-effect
adjustment that reduced retained earnings by $35.

the following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the year
ended december31, 2007. the term unrecognized tax benefits in fin 48 refers to the differences
between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and
recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the guidelines of fin 48. interest and
penalties are not included.

the only individually significant change for 2007 was a reduction in an unrecognized tax benefit
for a position previously expected to be taken but subsequently not taken on a 2006 tax return.
although unrecognized tax benefits for individual tax positions may increase or decrease during
2008, the company believes that no change will be individually significant during 2008.
approximately 80percent of the $2,199 of unrecognized tax benefits at december31, 2007, would
have an impact on the overall tax rate if subsequently recognized.
tax positions for chevron and
its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions
throughout the world. for the companys major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for
certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december31, 2007. in this regard, the company
received a final u.s. federal income tax audit report for years 2002 and 2003 in march2007. in
early 2008, the companys 2004 and 2005 tax returns were under examination by the internal revenue
service. for other major tax jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had
been finalized were as follows: nigeria  1994, angola  2001 and saudi arabia  2003.
on the consolidated statement of income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities
for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. as of december31, 2007, accruals of $198 for
anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance sheet. for
the year 2007, income tax expense associated with interest and penalties was not material.

new accounting standards
fasb statement no.157, fair value measurements (fas 157) in september2006, the fasb issued fas
157, which became effective for the company on january1, 2008. this standard defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. fas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but applies to assets and
liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value under other accounting standards. the
implementation of fas 157 did not have a material effect on the companys results of operations or
consolidated financial position.
fasb staff position fas no.157-1, application of fasb statement no.157 to fasb statement no.13
and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions (fsp
157-1) in february2008, the fasb issued fsp 157-1, which became effective for the company on
january1, 2008. this fsp excludes fasb statement no.13, accounting for leases, and its related
interpretive accounting pronouncements from the provisions of fas 157.
implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on the companys results of
operations or consolidated financial position.
fasb staff position fas no.157-2, effective date of fasb statement no.157 (fsp 157-2) in february
2008, the fasb issued fsp 157-2, which delays the companys january1, 2008 effective date of fas
157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until january
1, 2009. implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on the companys results of
operations or consolidated financial position.
fasb statement no.159, the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities -
including an amendment of fasb statement no.115 (fas 159) in february2007, the fasb issued fas
159, which became effective for the company on january1, 2008. this standard permits companies to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report
unrealized gains and losses in earnings. such accounting is optional and is generally to be applied
instrument by instrument. the implementation of fas 159 did not have a material effect on the
companys results of operations or consolidated financial position.
fasb statement no.141 (revised 2007), business combinations (fas 141-r) in december2007, the fasb
issued fas 141-r, which will become effective for business combination transactions having an
acquisition date on or after january1, 2009. this standard requires the acquiring entity in a
business combination to
fs-46
table of contents
note 18 new accounting standards  continued
recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date to be measured at their respective fair values.
the statement requires acquisition-related costs, as well as restructuring costs the acquirer
expects to incur for which it is not obligated at acquisition date, to be recorded against income
rather than included in purchase-price determination. it also requires recognition of contingent
arrangements at their acquisition-date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair value generally
reflected in income.
fasb statement no.160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, an amendment
of arb no.51 (fas 160) the fasb issued fas 160 in december2007, which will become effective for
the company january1, 2009, with retroactive adoption of the statements presentation and
disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. this standard will require ownership
interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be presented within the equity
section of the consolidated statement of financial position but separate from the parents equity.
it will also require the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the
noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
income statement. certain changes in a parents ownership interest are to be accounted for as
equity transactions and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any noncontrolling equity investment
in the former subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value. the company does not anticipate
the implementation of fas 160 will significantly change the presentation of its consolidated income
statement or consolidated balance sheet.

accounting for suspended exploratory wells
the company accounts for the cost of exploratory wells in accordance with fasb statement no.19,
financial and reporting by oil and gas producing companies (fas 19), as amended by fasb staff
position (fsp)fas 19-1, accounting for suspended well costs, which provides that exploratory well
costs continue to be capitalized after the completion of drilling when (a)the well has found a
sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (b)the enterprise is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project. if either condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains information that raises
substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well
would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to
expense. fas 19 provides a number of indicators that can assist an entity to demonstrate sufficient
progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys suspended exploratory well costs for the
three years ended december31, 2007. no capitalized exploratory well costs were charged to expense
upon the 2005 adoption of fsp fas 19-1.

employee benefit plans
the company has defined-benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically prefunds
defined-benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding
provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified plans are subject to the employee
retirement income security act minimum funding standard. the company does not typically fund u.s.
nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations
because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be
less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives.
the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa)became effective for the company in
2008. these provisions change, among other things, the methodology for determining the interest
rate to be used in calculating lump-sum benefits. this change in methodology increased the lump-sum
interest rate and lowered the companys pension benefit obligations by about $300 at december31,
2007. the effect of the interest rate change on pension plan contributions during 2008 is expected
to be de minimis, as the companys funded pension plans are considered well-funded under ppa
provisions.
the company also sponsors other postretirement plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as
well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans are unfunded,
and the company and retirees share the costs. medical coverage for medicare-eligible retirees in
the companys main u.s. medical plan is secondary to medicare (including partd) and the increase
to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4percent per
year. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
effective december31, 2006, the company implemented the recognition and measurement provisions of
financial accounting standards board statement no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106 and
132(r)(fas158), which requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of each of
its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability, with
the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss.

net actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31, 2007, for
the companys u.s. pension, international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 13 and 10years, respectively. these
amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to
receive benefits under the plans. these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10percent
of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. the
amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. during 2008, the company
estimates actuarial losses of $59, $80 and $39 will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international pension and other postretirement benefit plans,
respectively. in addition, the company
estimates an additional $78 will be recognized from
accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2008 related to lump-sum settlement costs from u.s.
pension plans.
the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs
(credits)recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31, 2007, was
approximately nine and 11years for u.s. and international pension plans, respectively, and six
years for other postretirement benefit plans. during 2008, the company estimates prior service
(credits)costs of $(7), $25 and $(81) will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
loss for u.s. pension, international pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively.

the 2005 discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase reflect the remeasurement of the
acquired unocal benefit plans at july31, 2005.
the 2006 u.s. discount rate reflects remeasurement on july1, 2006, due to plan combinations and changes, primarily several
unocal plans into related chevron plans.
expected return on plan assets the companys estimated long-term rate of return on pension assets
is driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future
performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class
risk factors. asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability
studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.
there have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002 for
u.s. plans, which account for 67percent of the companys pension plan assets. at december31,
2007, the estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.8percent.
the market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of pension
expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date,
as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from
day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans,
market value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.
discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2007, the company selected a 6.3
percent discount rate for the major u.s. pension and postretirement plans. this rate was based on a
cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to the citigroup pension discount
yield curve as of year-end 2007. the discount rates at the end of 2006 and 2005 were 5.8percent
and 5.5percent, respectively.
other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
december31, 2007, for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care
cost-trend rates start with 8percent in 2008 and gradually decline to 5percent for 2014 and
beyond. for this measurement at december31, 2006, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started
with 9percent in 2007 and gradually declined to 5percent for 2011 and beyond. in both
measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4percent.
assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. the impact is mitigated by the 4percent cap on the companys medical
contributions for the primary u.s. plan. a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

the plans investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy
benchmarks have been established.
for the primary u.s. pension plan, the chevron board of directors
has approved the following percentage asset-allocation ranges: equities 4070, fixed income/cash
2060, real estate 015 and other 05. the significant international pension plans also have
established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by each plan. actual asset
allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions
and consideration of specific asset category risk.
equities include investments in the companys common stock in the amount of $36 and $17 at december
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. the other asset category includes minimal investments in
private-equity limited partnerships.
cash contributions and benefit payments in 2007, the company contributed $78 and $239 to its u.s.
and international pension plans, respectively. in 2008, the company expects contributions to be
approximately $300 and $200 to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $207 in 2008, as
compared with $150 paid in 2007.

employee savings investment plan eligible employees of chevron and certain of its subsidiaries
participate in the chevron employee savings investment plan (esip).
charges to expense for the esip represent the companys contributions to the plan, which are funded
either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the release of
common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan
(lesop), which follows.
total company matching contributions to employee accounts within the esip were $206, $169 and $145
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. this cost was reduced by the value of shares released from
the lesop totaling
$33,$6and $4 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. the remaining amounts,
totaling $173, $163 and $141 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, represent open market purchases.
employee stock ownership plan within the chevron esip is an employee stock ownership plan (esop).
in 1989, chevron established a lesop as a constituent part of the esop. the lesop provides partial
prefunding of the companys future commitments to the esip.
as permitted by american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa)statement of position
93-6, employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans, the company has elected to continue
its practices, which are based on aicpa statement of position 76-3, accounting practices for
certain employee stock ownership plans, and subsequent consensus of the eitf of the fasb. the debt
of the lesop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred
compensation and benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated
statement of stockholders equity.
the company reports compensation expense equal to lesop debt principal repayments less dividends
received and used by the lesop for debt service. interest accrued on lesop debt is recorded as
interest expense. dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
all lesop shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.
total (credits)expenses recorded for the lesop were $(1), $(1) and $94 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, including $16, $17 and $18 of interest expense related to lesop debt and a (credit)
charge to compensation expense of $(17), $(18) and $76.
of the dividends paid on the lesop shares, $8, $59 and $55 were used in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, to service lesop debt. the amount in 2006 included $28 of lesop debt service that was
scheduled for payment on the first business day of january2007 and was paid in late december2006.
in addition, the company made contributions in 2005 of $98 to satisfy lesop debt service in excess
of dividends received by the lesop. no contributions were required in 2007 or 2006 as dividends
received by the lesop were sufficient to satisfy lesop debt service.
shares held in the lesop are
released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants based on debt service deemed to be paid
in the year in proportion to the total of current year and remaining debt service. lesop shares as of

benefit plan trusts texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of
its benefit plans. at year-end 2007, the trust contained 14.2million shares of chevron treasury
stock. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the trust
will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that
the company does not pay such benefits. the trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as
instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust are not considered
outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of
benefit obligations.
unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans,
including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. at december 31, 2007 and
2006, trust assets of $69 and $98, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning
accounts.
employee incentive plans chevron has two incentive plans, the management incentive plan (mip)and
the long-term incentive plan (ltip), for officers and other regular salaried employees of the
company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. mip is an annual
cash incentive plan that links awards to performance results of the prior year. the cash awards may
be deferred by the recipients by conversion to stock units or other investment fund alternatives.
aggregate charges to expense for mip were $184, $180 and $155 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
awards under ltip consist of stock options and other share-based
compensation that are described in note
21 below.
through 2007 the company had a program that provided eligible employees, other than those covered
by mip and ltip, with an annual cash bonus if the company achieves certain financial and safety
goals. charges for the program were $431, $329 and $324 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
effective in 2008, this program was modified to mirror the design of mip and both were combined
into a single plan named the chevron incentive plan (cip).
note 21
stock options and other share-based compensation
effective july1, 2005, the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board
statement no.123r, share-based payment (fas 123r), for its share-based compensation plans. the
company previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of
accounting principles board opinion no.25, accounting for stock issued to employees, and related
interpretations and disclosure requirements established by fasb statement no.123,
accounting for stock-based compensation.
the company adopted fas 123r using the modified prospective method and, accordingly, results for
prior periods were
not restated. refer to note 1, beginning on page fs-32, for the pro forma effect
on net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair-value recognition
provisions of fas 123r for the full year 2005.
for 2007, 2006 and 2005, compensation expense for stock options was $146 ($95 after tax), $125 ($81
after tax) and $65 ($42 after tax), respectively. in addition, compensation expense for stock
appreciation rights, performance units and restricted stock units was $205 ($133 after tax), $113
($73 after tax) and $59 ($39 after tax) for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. there were no
significant stock-based compensation costs that were capitalized at december31, 2007 and 2006.
cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $445, $444 and $297, respectively. actual tax benefits realized for the tax
deductions from option exercises were $94, $91 and $71 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $88, $68 and $110 for 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. cash paid in 2005 included $73 for unocal awards paid under
change-in-control plan provisions.
the company presents the tax benefits of deductions from the exercise of stock options as financing
cash inflows in the consolidated statement of cash flows. in 2006, the company implemented the
transition method of fasb staff position fas 123r-3, transition election related to accounting for
the tax effects of share-based payment awards, for calculating the beginning balance of the pool of
excess tax benefits related to employee compensation and determining the subsequent impact on the
pool of employee awards that were fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of fas 123r. the
companys reported tax expense for the period subsequent to the implementation of fas 123r was not
affected by this election. refer to note 3, on page fs-35, for information on excess tax
benefits reported on the companys statement of cash flows.
chevron long-term incentive plan (ltip) awards under the ltip may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. from april2004 through january2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the ltip, and no more than 64million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient.
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the ltip extend for 10years from grant
date. effective with options granted in june2002, one-third of each award vests on the first,
second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. prior to this change, options vested one year
after the date of grant.

performance units granted under the ltip settle in cash at the end of a

relative to major competitors over the period, and payments are indexed to the companys stock
price.
texaco stock incentive plan (texaco sip) on the closing of the acquisition of texaco in october
2001, outstanding options granted under the texaco sip were converted to chevron options. these
options, which have 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. this provision enables a participant who exercises a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. the
restored options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price
is the market value of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. beginning in
2007, restored options were granted under the ltip. no further awards may be granted under the
former texaco plans.
unocal share-based plans (unocal plans) when chevron acquired unocal in august2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various unocal plans were exchanged for
fully vested chevron options and appreciation rights. these awards retained the same provisions as
the original unocal plans. awards issued prior to 2004 generally may be exercised for up to three
years after termination of employment (depending upon the terms of the individual award agreements)
or the original expiration date, whichever is earlier. awards issued since 2004 generally remained
exercisable until the end of the normal option term if termination of employment occurred prior to
august10, 2007. other awards issued under the unocal plans, including restricted stock, stock
units, restricted stock units and performance shares, became vested at the acquisition date, and
shares or cash were issued to recipients in accordance with change-in-control provisions of the
plans.

distributed to recipients and 32,017 units were forfeited. at december31, 2007, units outstanding
were 2,225,015, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $205. in
addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various
ltip and former texaco and unocal programs totaled approximately 1million equivalent shares as of
december31, 2007. a liability of $38 was recorded for these awards.
broad-based employee stock options in addition to the plans described above, chevron granted all
eligible employees stock options or equivalents in 1998. the options vested in february 2000 and
expired in february2008. a total of 9,641,600 options were awarded with an exercise price of
$38.16 per share.
the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated at $9.54 using
the black-scholes model for the preceding 10years. the assumptions used in the model, based on a
10-year average, were: a risk-free interest rate of 7percent, a dividend yield of 4.2percent, an
expected life of seven years and a volatility of 24.7percent.
at january1, 2007, the number of broad-based employee stock options outstanding was 1,306,059.
during 2007, exercises of 637,044 shares and forfeitures of 16,300 shares reduced outstanding
options to 652,715. as of december31, 2007, these instruments had an aggregate intrinsic value of
$36 and the remaining contractual term of these options was 0.1year. the total intrinsic value of
these options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $30, $10 and $9, respectively.

settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
guarantees the companys guarantee of approximately $600 is associated with certain payments under
a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. the terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will reduce over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron carries no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and
motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300. through the end of 2007, the company paid $48 under these
indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification payments in the
future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities related
to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims must be asserted no later than february2009 for equilon indemnities and no
later than february2012 for motiva indemnities. under the terms of these indemnities, there is no
maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. the company has not recorded any
liabilities for possible claims under these indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral
and has made no payments under the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described
above are to be net of amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities
recorded by equilon or motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. under the indemnification
agreement, the companys liability is unlimited until april2022, when the indemnification expires.

securitization during 2007, the company completed the sale of its u.s. proprietary consumer credit
card business and related receivables. this transaction included terminating the qualifying special
purpose entity (spe)that was used to securitize associated retail accounts receivable.
through the use of another qualifying spe, the company had $675 of securitized trade accounts
receivable related to its downstream business as of december31, 2007. this arrangement has the
effect of accelerating chevrons collection of the securitized amounts. chevrons total estimated
financial exposure under this securitization at december31, 2007, was $65. in the event that the
spe experiences major defaults in the collection of receivables, chevron believes that it would
have no additional loss exposure connected with third-party investments in this securitization.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. the
aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2008
$4,700; 2009  $3,300; 2010  $3,300; 2011  $1,900; 2012  $1,300; 2013 and after  $4,900. a
portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under
the agreements were approximately $3,700 in 2007, $3,000 in 2006 and $2,100 in 2005.
minority interests the company has commitments of $204 related to minority interests in subsidiary
companies.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe,
by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the
company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any
significant impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international
petroleum or chemical companies.
chevrons environmental reserve as of december31, 2007, was $1,539. included in this balance were
remediation activities of 240 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially
responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection
agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or
analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2007 was $123.
the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron
to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2007 environmental reserves balance of $1,416,
$864 related to approximately 2,000 sites for the companys u.s. downstream operations, including
refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and
pipelines. the remaining $552 was associated with various sites in the international downstream
($146), upstream ($267), chemicals ($105) and other ($34). liabilities at all sites, whether
operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the companys plans and activities to
remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities include one or more
of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite
containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil;
groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the
contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which
in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or local
regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2007 had a recorded liability that was material
to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded,
for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude

equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. these
activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve at elk hills,
california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the u.s.
department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
for this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to chevron is estimated
at about $150. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this range of estimates are
uncertain.
other contingencies chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners;
u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers.
the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy
periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close,
abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits
and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together, may
result in gains or losses in future periods.
note 23
asset retirement obligations
the company accounts for asset retirement obligations (aro)in accordance with financial accounting
standards board statement (fasb)no.143, accounting for asset retirement obligations (fas 143).
this accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an aro that is recorded when
there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. obligations associated with the retirement of these assets
require recognition in certain circumstances: (1)the present value of a liability and offsetting
asset for an aro, (2)the subsequent accretion of that liability
and depreciation of the asset, and
(3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates. in 2005, the fasb issued
fasb interpretation no.47, accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an
interpretation of fasb statement no.143 (fin 47), which was effective for the company on december
31, 2005. fin 47 clarifies that the phrase conditional asset retirement obligation, as used in
fas 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activity for which the timing
and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the
control of the company. the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional
even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. uncertainty about the
timing and/or method of settlement of a conditional aro should be factored into the measurement of
the liability when
sufficient information exists. fas 143 acknowledges that in some cases, sufficient information may
not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an aro. fin 47 also clarifies when an
entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an aro. in
adopting fin 47, the company did not recognize any additional liabilities for conditional aros due
to an inability to reasonably estimate the fair value of those obligations because of their
indeterminate settlement dates.
fas 143 and fin 47 primarily affect the companys accounting for crude oil and natural gas
producing assets. no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire refining,
marketing and transportation (downstream)and chemical long-lived assets have been recognized, as
indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of
the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream and chemical long-lived
assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement
obligation.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2007, 2006 and 2005:

directly to the companys retained earnings instead of net income. diluted eps includes the effects
of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the
companys stock option programs (refer to note 21, stock options and other share-based

reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource
classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum
engineers, the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists. the
system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting  three deemed commercial and three noncommercial. within the commercial classification
are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. the noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all sec and company standards.
proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geologic and engineering data demonstrate
with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions. net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by
others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the
estimate.
proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. proved developed reserves
are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of
reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and
engineers. as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company
maintains a reserves advisory committee (rac)that is chaired by the corporate reserves manager,
who is a member of a corporate department that reports directly to the executive vice president
responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and production activities. all of the rac
members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification. the rac coordinates
its activities through two operating company-level reserves managers. these two reserves managers
are not members of the rac so as to preserve the corporate-level independence.
the rac has the following primary responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the
business units recommended reserve changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in
accordance with sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and
appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon
reserves.

continued
during the year, the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream
business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. major
changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee and the executive
committee, whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. the
companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors. if major changes to
reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the
board.
rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have the
largest proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve
records and documentation of their alignment with the corporate reserves manual.
reserve quantities at december31, 2007, oil-equivalent reserves for the companys
consolidated operations were 7.9billion barrels. (refer to the
term reserves on page e-24 for
the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) approximately 28percent of the total reserves were in
the united states. for the companys interests in equity affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves were
2.9billion barrels, 84percent of which were associated with the companys 50percent ownership in
tco.
aside from the tco operations, no single property accounted for more than 5percent of the
companys total oil-equivalent proved reserves. fewer than 20 other individual properties in the
companys portfolio of assets each contained between 1percent and 5percent of the companys
oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for about 37percent of the
companys proved reserves total. these properties were geographically dispersed, located in the
united states, south america, west africa and the asia-pacific region.
in the united states, total oil-equivalent reserves at year-end 2007 were 2.2billion barrels.
of this amount, 41percent, 21percent and 38percent were located in california, the gulf of
mexico and other u.s. areas, respectively.
in california, liquids reserves represented 94percent of the total, with most classified as
heavy oil. because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods,
the producing operations are capital intensive in nature. most of the companys heavy-oil fields in
california employ a continuous steamflooding process.
in the gulf of mexico region, liquids represented approximately 66percent of total
oil-equivalent reserves. production operations are mostly offshore and, as a result, are also
capital intensive. costs include investments in wells, production platforms and other facilities,
such as gathering lines and storage facilities.
in other u.s. areas, the reserves were split about equally between liquids and natural gas.
for production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including waterflood
and co2 injection.
the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables, for the three years ending
december31, 2007, is not necessarily indicative of future trends. apart from acquisitions, the
companys ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and
circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, opec constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.
the companys estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes thereto for the
years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are shown in the tables on pages fs-68 and fs-70.

includes reserves acquired through nonmonetary transactions.
includes reserves disposed of through nonmonetary transactions.
included are year-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (psc)
(refer to page e-23 for the definition of a psc). psc-related reserve quantities are 26
percent, 30percent and 29percent for consolidated
companies for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2007 consist of 97million barrels of
developed reserves and (162)million barrels of undeveloped reserves for consolidated companies and
299million barrels of developed reserves and (312)million barrels of undeveloped reserves for
affiliated companies.
during 2007, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at december31, 2006, transferred
to developed reserves were 8percent and 24percent for consolidated companies and affiliated
companies, respectively.
information on canadian oil sands net proved reserves not included above:
in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, chevron has significant
interests in proved oil sands reserves in canada associated with the athabasca project. for
internal management purposes, chevron views these reserves and their development as an integral
part of total upstream operations. however, sec regulations define these reserves as mining-related
and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves. net proved oil sands reserves were 436million
barrels as of december31, 2007. the oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is found
on page fs-73.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved-reserve changes for 2005 through
2007 are discussed below:
revisions in 2005, net revisions reduced reserves by 239million
and 24million barrels for worldwide consolidated companies and equity affiliates, respectively.
for consolidated companies, the net decrease was 199million barrels in the international areas and
40million barrels in the united states. the largest downward net revisions internationally were
108million barrels in indonesia and
53million barrels in kazakhstan, due primarily to the effect of higher year-end prices on the calculation of reserves
associated with production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts. in the united states, the 40
million-barrel reduction was across many fields in each of the geographic sections. most of the
downward revision for affiliated companies was a 19million-barrel reduction in hamaca,
attributable to revised government royalty provisions. for tco, the downward effect of higher
year-end prices was partially offset by increased reservoir performance.

in 2006, net revisions increased reserves by 39million and 84million barrels for
worldwide consolidated companies and equity affiliates, respectively. international consolidated
companies accounted for the net increase of 39million barrels. the largest upward net revisions
were 61million barrels in indonesia and 27million barrels in thailand. in indonesia, the increase
was the result of infill drilling and improved steamflood performance. the upward revision in
thailand reflected additional drilling and development activity during the year. these upward
revisions were partially offset by reductions in reservoir performance in nigeria and the united
kingdom, which decreased reserves by 43million barrels and by 32million barrels, respectively.
most of the upward revision for affiliated companies was related to a 60million-barrel increase in
tco as a result of improved reservoir performance.
in 2007, net revisions decreased reserves by 146million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and increased reserves by 103million barrels for equity affiliates. for consolidated
companies, the largest downward net revisions were 89million barrels in africa and 66million
barrels in indonesia. in africa, the decrease was mainly based on field performance data for fields
in nigeria and the effect of higher year-end prices in angola and the republic of the congo. in
indonesia, the decline also reflected the impact of higher year-end prices. higher prices also
resulted in downward revisions in karachaganak and azerbaijan. for equity affiliates, most of the
upward revision was related to a 92million-barrel increase for the tengiz field in tco and an 11
million-barrel increase for petroboscan in venezuela, both as a result of improved reservoir
performance. at tco, the upward revision was tempered by the negative impact of higher year-end
prices.
improved recovery in 2005, improved recovery increased liquids
volumes worldwide by 203million barrels for consolidated companies. international areas accounted
for 142million barrels of the increase. indonesia added 42million barrels due to improved
performance. reserve additions of 67million barrels in africa occurred primarily in angola and
resulted from infill drilling, wells workovers and secondary recovery from gas injection. additions
of 29million barrels in the other international area were mainly attributable to improved
waterflood performance offshore eastern canada. an increase of 61million barrels occurred in the
united states, primarily in california due to improved performance on a large heavy oil field under
thermal recovery.
in 2006, improved recovery increased liquids volumes worldwide by 83million barrels for
consolidated companies. reserves in the united states increased 52million barrels, with california
representing 49million barrels of the total increase due to steamflood expansion and revised
modeling activities. internationally, improved recovery increased reserves by 31million barrels,
with no single country accounting for an increase of more than 10million barrels.
in 2007, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 20million barrels worldwide. no
addition was individually significant.
extensions and discoveries in 2005, extensions and discoveries
increased liquids volumes worldwide by 184million barrels for consolidated companies. the largest
increase was 49million barrels in nigeria, reflecting new development drilling, including in the
agbami field, among others. new field developments in brazil contributed another 41million barrels
of discoveries. in the united states, the 44million-barrel addition was associated mainly with the
initial booking of reserves for the blind faith field in the deepwater gulf of mexico.
in 2006, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes worldwide by 107million barrels
for consolidated companies. reserves in nigeria increased by 27million barrels due in part to the
initial booking of reserves for the aparo field. additional drilling activities contributed 19
million barrels in the united kingdom and 14million barrels in argentina. in the united states,
the gulf of mexico added 25million barrels, mainly the result of the initial booking of the great
white field in the deepwater perdido fold belt area.
in 2007, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 60million barrels worldwide.
the largest additions were 25million barrels in the u.s. gulf of mexico, mainly for the deepwater
tahiti and mad dog fields.
purchases in 2005, the acquisition of 572million barrels of
liquids related solely to the acquisition of unocal in august. about three-fourths of the 376
million barrels acquired in the international areas were represented by volumes in azerbaijan and
thailand. most volumes acquired in the united states were in texas and alaska.
in 2006, acquisitions increased liquids volumes worldwide by 21million barrels for
consolidated companies and 119million barrels for equity affiliates. for consolidated companies,
the amount was mainly the result of new agreements in nigeria, which added 13million barrels of
reserves. the other-equity-affiliates quantity reflects the result of the conversion of boscan and
ll-652 operations to joint stock companies in venezuela.
in 2007, acquisitions of 316million barrels for equity affiliates related to the formation of
a new hamaca equity affiliate in venezuela.
sales in 2005, sales of 58million barrels in the other
international area related to the disposition of the former unocal operations onshore in canada.
in 2006, sales decreased reserves by 15million barrels due to the conversion of the ll-652
risked service agreement to a joint stock company in venezuela.
in 2007, affiliated company sales of 432million barrels related to the dissolution of a
hamaca equity affiliate in venezuela.

includes year-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (psc) (refer
to page e-23 for the definition of a psc). psc-related reserve quantities are 37percent,
47percent and 44percent for consolidated companies for 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.
net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2007 consist of 1,548billion cubic feet
of developed reserves and (569)billion cubic feet of undeveloped reserves for consolidated
companies and 403billion cubic feet of developed reserves and (294)billion cubic feet of
undeveloped reserves for affiliated companies.
during 2007, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at december31, 2006, transferred
to developed reserves were 10percent and 27percent for consolidated companies and affiliated
companies, respectively.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas proved-reserve changes for 2005
through 2007 are discussed below:
revisions in 2005, reserves were revised downward by 14billion
cubic feet (bcf)for consolidated companies and 498 bcf for equity affiliates. for consolidated
companies, negative revisions were 428 bcf in the asia-pacific region. most of the decrease was
attributable to one field in kazakhstan, due mainly to the effects of higher year-end prices on
variable-royalty provisions of the production-sharing contract. reserves additions for consolidated
companies totaled 211 bcf and 243 bcf in africa and other,
respectively. the majority of the african region changes were in angola, due to a revised forecast of fuel gas usage,
and in nigeria, from improved reservoir performance. the availability of third-party compression in
colombia accounted for most of the increase in the other region. revisions in the united states
decreased reserves by 9 bcf, as nominal increases in the san joaquin valley were more than offset
by decreases in the gulf of mexico and other region. for the tco affiliate in kazakhstan, a
reduction of 547 bcf reflects the updated forecast of future royalties payable and year-end price
effects, partially offset by volumes added as a result of an updated assessment of reservoir
performance.

in 2006, revisions accounted for a net increase of 481 bcf for consolidated companies and
26 bcf for affiliates. for consolidated companies, net increases of 511 bcf internationally were
partially offset by a 30 bcf downward revision in the united states. drilling and development
activities added 337 bcf of reserves in thailand, while kazakhstan added 200 bcf, largely due to
development activity. trinidad and tobago increased 185 bcf, attributable to improved reservoir
performance and a new contract for sales of natural gas. these additions were partially offset by
downward revisions of 224 bcf in the united kingdom and 130 bcf in australia due to drilling
results and reservoir performance. u.s. other had a downward revision of 102 bcf due to reservoir
performance, which was partially offset by upward revisions of 72 bcf in the gulf of mexico and
california related to reservoir performance and development drilling. tco had an upward revision of
26 bcf associated with additional development activity and updated reservoir performance.
in 2007, revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by a net 395bcf and
increased reserves for affiliated companies by a net 73 bcf. for consolidated companies, net
increases were 209 bcf in the united states and 186 bcf internationally. improved reservoir
performance for many fields in the united states contributed 130 bcf in the other region, 40 bcf
in california and 39 bcf in the gulf of mexico. drilling activities added 360 bcf in thailand and
improved reservoir performance added 188 bcf in trinidad and tobago. these additions were partially
offset by downward revisions of 185 bcf in australia due to drilling results and 136 bcf in nigeria
due to field performance. negative revisions due to the impact of higher prices were recorded in
azerbaijan and kazakhstan. tco had an upward revision of 75 bcf associated with improved reservoir
performance and development activities. this upward revision was net of a negative impact due to
higher year-end prices.
extensions and discoveries in 2005, consolidated companies
increased reserves by 370 bcf, including 167 bcf in the united states and 118 bcf in the
asia-pacific region. in the united states, 99 bcf was added in the other region and 68 bcf in the
gulf of mexico, primarily due to drilling activities. the addition in asia-pacific resulted
primarily from increased drilling in kazakhstan.
in 2006, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of 799 bcf for consolidated
companies, reflecting a 531 bcf increase outside the united states
and a u.s. increase of 268 bcf.
bangladesh added 451 bcf, the result of development activity and field extensions, and thailand
added 59 bcf, the result of drilling activities. u.s. other contributed 157 bcf, approximately
half of which was related to south texas and the piceance basin, and
the gulf of mexico added 111
bcf, partly due to the initial booking of reserves at the great white field in the deepwater
perdido fold belt area.
in 2007, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of 518 bcf worldwide. the
largest addition was 330 bcf in bangladesh, the result of drilling activities. other additions were
not individually significant.
purchases in 2005, all except 7 bcf of the 5,656 bcf total
purchases were associated with the unocal acquisition. international reserve acquisitions were
4,488 bcf, with thailand accounting for about half the volumes. other significant volumes were
added in bangladesh and myanmar.
in 2006, purchases of natural gas reserves were 35 bcf for consolidated companies, about
evenly divided between the companys united states and international operations. affiliated
companies added 54 bcf of reserves, the result of conversion of an operating service agreement to a
joint stock company in venezuela.
in 2007, purchases of natural gas reserves were 141 bcf for consolidated companies, which
included the acquisition of an additional interest in the bibiyana field in bangladesh. affiliated
company purchases of 211 bcf related to the formation of a new hamaca equity affiliate in venezuela
and an initial booking related to the angola lng project.
sales in 2005, sales of 248 bcf in the other international
region related to the disposition of former-unocals onshore properties in canada.
in 2006, sales for consolidated companies totaled 149 bcf, mostly associated with the
conversion of a risked service agreement to a joint stock company in venezuela.
in 2007, sales were 76 bcf and 175 bcf for consolidated companies and equity affiliates,
respectively. the affiliated company sales related to the dissolution of a hamaca equity affiliate
in venezuela.

supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  continued
table vi standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding
proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of fas 69. estimated
future cash inflows from production are computed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to
year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are limited to those
provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. future
development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and
produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of
year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations.
estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates.
these rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax
net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. discounted future net cash flows are
calculated
using 10percent midperiod discount factors. discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when
future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.
the information provided does not represent managements estimate of the companys expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. estimates of proved-reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. moreover, probable and
