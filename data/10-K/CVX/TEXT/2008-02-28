SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON

CORPORATION,

1

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL,

MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS, MINING OPERATIONS, POWER

GENERATION AND ENERGY SERVICES. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

(UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND ALSO MARKETING NATURAL

GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM)

OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM

PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL

CAR. CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING

OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND

FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

ON AUGUST 10, 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED UNOCAL CORPORATION

(UNOCAL), AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

COMPANY. DISCUSSION OF THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION IS IN NOTE 2

ON

PAGE FS-34.

A LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES

E-4

AND

E-5.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, CHEVRON HAD APPROXIMATELY

65,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 6,000 SERVICE STATION

EMPLOYEES). APPROXIMATELY 31,000, OR 48 PERCENT, OF THE

COMPANYS EMPLOYEES WERE EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, AND INDIVIDUAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

CONTROL OVER SOME OF THEM. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES, REGULATING HOW

COMPANIES ARE STRUCTURED AND WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT

THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME

CASES, LIMITING THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THESE COMMODITIES. HOWEVER,

SOME GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE PRICE CONTROLS ON REFINED PRODUCTS SUCH

AS GASOLINE OR DIESEL FUEL. THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE

WORLDS SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL, AND THEIR PRODUCTION

LEVELS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY.

DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS

LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL

ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO

OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. SEASONALITY

IS NOT A PRIMARY DRIVER TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

QUARTERLY EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON

COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR GLOBAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES,

AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES, FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LEASES AND OTHER

PROPERTIES AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR REQUIRED TO DEVELOP

AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS,

CHEVRON ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM

COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION ENTITIES IN THE SALE OR ACQUISITION OF VARIOUS

GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

INCORPORATED

IN DELAWARE IN 1926 AS STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE NAME CHEVRON CORPORATION IN 1984 AND

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION IN 2001. IN 2005, CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION CHANGED ITS NAME TO CHEVRON CORPORATION. AS USED IN

THIS REPORT, THE TERM CHEVRON AND SUCH TERMS AS

THE COMPANY, THE CORPORATION,

OUR, WE AND US MAY REFER TO

CHEVRON CORPORATION, ONE OR MORE OF ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES, OR ALL OF THEM TAKEN AS A WHOLE, BUT UNLESS STATED

OTHERWISE, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE AFFILIATES OF

CHEVRON  I.E., THOSE COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE

EQUITY METHOD (GENERALLY OWNED 50 PERCENT OR LESS) OR

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD. ALL OF THESE TERMS

ARE USED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED AS A PRECISE

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY

AND ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY,

WITH OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA,

THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA AND AUSTRALASIA. TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES, EARNINGS AND INCOME TAXES

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND ASSETS AS

OF THE END OF 2007 AND 2006  FOR THE UNITED STATES

AND THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC

AREAS  ARE IN NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-37.

IN ADDITION, SIMILAR COMPARATIVE DATA FOR THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENTS IN AND INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES AND PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE IN NOTES 11 AND 12 ON PAGES FS-40

TO FS-42.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2007 WERE $20 BILLION,

INCLUDING $2.3 BILLION FOR CHEVRONS SHARE OF

EXPENDITURES BY AFFILIATED COMPANIES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE CASH

OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. IN 2006 AND 2005, EXPENDITURES WERE

$16.6 BILLION AND $11.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES

EXPENDITURES OF $1.9 BILLION AND $1.7 BILLION IN THE

CORRESPONDING PERIODS. THE 2005 AMOUNT EXCLUDES

$17.3 BILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL.

OF THE $20 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2007,

78 PERCENT, OR $15.5 BILLION, RELATED TO UPSTREAM

ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED

FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2006 AND 2005. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS, REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2008, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE 15 PERCENT HIGHER AT

$22.9 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.6 BILLION OF SPENDING BY

AFFILIATES. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE TOTAL, OR

$17.5 BILLION, IS BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES, WITH $12.7 BILLION OF THAT AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 5, WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION OF 2.59 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2007 WAS UP

34,000 BARRELS PER DAY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. WORLDWIDE

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION INCLUDING OTHER PRODUCED

VOLUMES (REFER TO FOOTNOTE 5 TO THE TABLE ON

PAGE 5) WAS 2.62 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN

ABOUT 2 PERCENT FROM 2006. THE DECLINE WAS MOSTLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CHANGE IN THE BOSCAN OPERATING SERVICE

AGREEMENT IN VENEZUELA TO A JOINT-STOCK COMPANY IN OCTOBER 2006.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING

ON

PAGE FS-6

FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE

20052007 CHANGES IN PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL

GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS AVERAGE WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN 2008 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 2.65 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES,

INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE PRICE EFFECT

ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN

FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS,

DELAYS IN PROJECT

START-UPS,

AND PRODUCTION THAT MAY HAVE TO BE SHUT IN DUE TO WEATHER

CONDITIONS, CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING GEOPOLITICS OR OTHER

DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS ALSO ARE

AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG

BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION.

GULF OF MEXICO.

AVERAGE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION DURING 2007 FOR THE COMPANYS COMBINED INTERESTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO SHELF AND DEEPWATER AREAS, AND THE ONSHORE FIELDS IN THE REGION WAS 214,000 BARRELS PER DAY. THE DAILY OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION COMPRISED 105,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, 576 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS AND 13,000 BARRELS OF NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS.

DURING 2007, CHEVRON WAS ENGAGED IN VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO. DEVELOPMENT WORK CONTINUED AT THE 58 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED TAHITI FIELD, WHERE PRODUCTION

START-UP

IS EXPECTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2009. CONSTRUCTION OF

THE SPAR HULL AND TOPSIDES WAS COMPLETED IN 2007; HOWEVER,

INSTALLATION OF THE SPAR HULL WAS DELAYED FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR

WHEN TESTING REVEALED A METALLURGICAL PROBLEM WITH THE MOORING

SHACKLES. SIX DEVELOPMENT WELLS WERE DRILLED IN 2007, AND

FLOW-BACK TESTS FOR FIVE OF THE SIX WERE COMPLETED DURING THE

YEAR. INITIAL BOOKING OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES OCCURRED IN

2003, AND THE TRANSFER OF THESE RESERVES INTO THE PROVED

DEVELOPED CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED NEAR THE TIME OF PRODUCTION

START-UP.

WITH AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE OF 30 YEARS, TAHITI IS

DESIGNED TO HAVE A MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION OF

125,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 70 MILLION CUBIC FEET

OF NATURAL GAS. THE TOTAL COST FOR THIS PROJECT IS ESTIMATED AT

$4.7 BILLION AND INCLUDES A PLANNED SECOND PHASE OF FIELD

DEVELOPMENT AFTER

START-UP

THAT INVOLVES ADDITIONAL WELLS AND FACILITY UPGRADES.

ALSO UNDER DEVELOPMENT IS THE 75 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED

BLIND FAITH DISCOVERY, IN WHICH THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS

OWNERSHIP FROM 63 PERCENT IN JULY 2007. THREE DEVELOPMENT

WELLS WERE DRILLED, AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOPSIDES AND HULL

WAS COMPLETED IN 2007. THE PROJECT INCLUDES A SUBSEA DEVELOPMENT

PLAN, WITH TIEBACK TO A SEMISUBMERSIBLE FLOATING PRODUCTION

FACILITY THAT HAD AN ORIGINAL DAILY-PRODUCTION DESIGN CAPACITY

OF 45,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 45 MILLION CUBIC

FEET OF NATURAL GAS BASED ON THE INITIAL THREE-WELL DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAM. A FOURTH DEVELOPMENT WELL AND ASSOCIATED FACILITY

UPGRADES ARE PLANNED TO COMMENCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008. THE

FACILITY UPGRADES ARE PLANNED TO INCREASE THE DAILY CAPACITY TO

60,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 60 MILLION CUBIC FEET

OF NATURAL GAS. INITIAL DAILY TOTAL PRODUCTION, INCLUDING THE

FOURTH WELL, IS ESTIMATED AT 45,000 TO 60,000 BARRELS OF

CRUDE OIL AND 45 MILLION TO 60 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR THE PROJECT WERE

RECOGNIZED IN 2005. RECLASSIFICATION OF THE RESERVES TO THE

PROVED DEVELOPED CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED NEAR THE TIME OF

PRODUCTION

START-UP

IN

THE SECOND QUARTER 2008. THE ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE OF THE

FIELD IS APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE ULTRA-DEEP PERDIDO

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE PROJECT ENCOMPASSES THE INSTALLATION

OF A PRODUCING HOST FACILITY TO SERVICE MULTIPLE FIELDS,

INCLUDING CHEVRONS 33 PERCENT-OWNED GREAT WHITE,

60 PERCENT-OWNED SILVERTIP AND 58 PERCENT-OWNED

TOBAGO. CHEVRON HAS A 38 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE PERDIDO

REGIONAL HOST. ALL OF THESE FIELDS AND THE PRODUCTION FACILITY

ARE PARTNER-OPERATED. ACTIVITIES DURING 2007 INCLUDED FACILITY

CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING. FIRST OIL IS EXPECTED IN

2010, WITH THE FACILITY CAPABLE OF HANDLING 130,000 BARRELS

OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES RELATED

TO THE PROJECT WERE FIRST RECORDED IN 2006, AND THE PHASED

RECLASSIFICATION OF THESE RESERVES TO THE PROVED DEVELOPED

CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED NEAR THE TIME OF PRODUCTION

START-UP.

THE PROJECT HAS AN EXPECTED LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS.

DEEPWATER EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN 2007 INCLUDED PARTICIPATION

IN 12 EXPLORATORY WELLS  SIX WILDCAT AND SIX

APPRAISAL. EXPLORATORY WORK INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.



BIG FOOT  60 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED. A

SUCCESSFUL APPRAISAL WELL WAS COMPLETED IN JANUARY 2008.

AT THE END OF 2007, THE COMPANY HAD NOT YET RECOGNIZED PROVED

RESERVES FOR ANY OF THE EXPLORATION PROJECTS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

BESIDES THE ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPLORATION PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AREA, CHEVRON ALSO

CONTINUED THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL PERMITTING PROCESS DURING

2007 AND EARLY 2008 FOR A PROPOSED NATURAL GAS IMPORT TERMINAL

AT CASOTTE LANDING IN JACKSON COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI. IN FEBRUARY

2007, THE COMPANY RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL ENERGY

REGULATORY COMMISSION FOR THE PROPOSED TERMINAL. THE TERMINAL

WOULD BE LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE COMPANYS PASCAGOULA

REFINERY AND DESIGNED TO PROCESS IMPORTED LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS

(LNG) FOR DISTRIBUTION TO INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL

CUSTOMERS IN MISSISSIPPI, FLORIDA AND THE NORTHEAST. THE

TERMINAL WOULD HAVE AN INITIAL NATURAL GAS PROCESSING CAPACITY

OF 1.3 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY. THE DECISION TO

CONSTRUCT A FACILITY WILL BE TIMED TO ALIGN WITH THE

COMPANYS LNG SUPPLY PROJECTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO 1 BILLION CUBIC

FEET PER DAY OF REGASIFICATION CAPACITY BEGINNING IN 2009 AT THE

THIRD PARTY-OWNED SABINE PASS LNG TERMINAL THAT IS EXPECTED TO

BE COMMISSIONED IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2008. ALSO IN THE SABINE

PASS AREA IN LOUISIANA, THE COMPANY HAS A BINDING AGREEMENT TO

BE ONE OF THE ANCHOR SHIPPERS IN A

3.2 BILLION-CUBIC-FOOT-PER-DAY THIRD PARTY-OWNED NATURAL

GAS PIPELINE. CHEVRON WILL HAVE 1.6 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER

DAY OF CAPACITY IN THE PIPELINE, OF WHICH 1 BILLION CUBIC

FEET PER DAY IS IN A NEW PIPELINE AND 600 MILLION CUBIC

FEET PER DAY IS INTERCONNECTING CAPACITY TO AN EXISTING

PIPELINE. THE NEW PIPELINE SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO

CHEVRONS SABINE AND BRIDGELINE PIPELINES, WHICH CONNECT TO

THE HENRY HUB. THE HENRY HUB IS THE PRICING POINT FOR NATURAL

GAS FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE

(NYMEX) AND IS LOCATED ON THE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE SYSTEM IN

LOUISIANA. HENRY HUB INTERCONNECTS TO NINE INTERSTATE AND FOUR

INTRASTATE PIPELINES.

OTHER U.S. AREAS.

OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA AND THE

GULF OF MEXICO, THE COMPANY MANAGES OPERATIONS ACROSS THE

MID-CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND ALASKA. DURING 2007 IN THE

PICEANCE BASIN OF NORTHWESTERN COLORADO, THE COMPANY COMMENCED

DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN THE BASINS TIGHT-GAS FORMATION.

FACILITIES TO PRODUCE 50 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS

PER DAY ARE EXPECTED TO START UP IN 2009. THE PICEANCE PROJECT,

IN WHICH THE COMPANY HOLDS A 100 PERCENT OPERATED WORKING

INTEREST, IS SCALABLE, AND THE WORK IS PLANNED TO BE COMPLETED

IN MULTIPLE PHASES OVER THE 15- TO

20-YEAR

PROJECT LIFE. THE PLANS INCLUDE EXPANDING FACILITIES TO A

PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF 450 MILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY. THE

TOTAL COST FOR THIS PROJECT IS ESTIMATED AT $7.3 BILLION.

ALSO DURING 2007, CHEVRON INITIATED REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN

THREE OFFSHORE FIELDS IN ALASKAS COOK INLET, WHERE THE

COMPANY OPERATES 10 OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND FIVE PRODUCING

NATURAL GAS FIELDS. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS NONOPERATED WORKING

INTEREST PRODUCTION AND EXPLORATORY ACREAGE AT THE WHITE HILLS

KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY HOLDS A 50 PERCENT

INTEREST IN TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO), WHICH IS DEVELOPING THE TENGIZ

AND KOROLEV CRUDE-OIL FIELDS LOCATED IN WESTERN KAZAKHSTAN UNDER

A

40-YEAR

CONCESSION THAT EXPIRES IN 2033. CHEVRONS NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2007 FROM THESE FIELDS AVERAGED

176,000 BARRELS PER DAY, COMPOSED OF 144,000 BARRELS

OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND 193 MILLION CUBIC

FEET OF NATURAL GAS.

TCO IS UNDERGOING A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION COMPOSED OF TWO

INTEGRATED PROJECTS REFERRED TO AS THE SECOND GENERATION PLANT

(SGP) AND SOUR GAS INJECTION (SGI). AT A TOTAL COMBINED COST OF

APPROXIMATELY $7.2 BILLION, THESE PROJECTS ARE DESIGNED TO

INCREASE TCOS CRUDE-OIL PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO

540,000 BARRELS PER DAY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2008.

SGP INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LARGE PROCESSING TRAIN FOR

TREATING CRUDE OIL AND THE ASSOCIATED SOUR GAS (I.E., HIGH IN

SULFUR CONTENT). THE SGP DESIGN IS BASED ON THE SAME

CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYED IN THE EXISTING PROCESSING

TRAINS. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH SGP WERE

RECOGNIZED IN 2001. WELLS WERE DRILLED, DEEPENED

AND/OR

COMPLETED SINCE 2002 IN THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV RESERVOIRS TO

PRODUCE VOLUMES REQUIRED FOR THE NEW SGP TRAIN. RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT WERE RECLASSIFIED TO THE PROVED

DEVELOPED CATEGORY. OVER THE NEXT DECADE, ONGOING FIELD

DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF

ADDITIONAL PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO PROVED DEVELOPED.

SGI INVOLVES TAKING A PORTION OF THE SOUR GAS SEPARATED FROM THE

CRUDE-OIL PRODUCTION AT THE SGP PROCESSING TRAIN AND REINJECTING

IT INTO THE TENGIZ RESERVOIR. CHEVRON EXPECTS THAT SGI WILL HAVE

TWO KEY EFFECTS. FIRST, SGI WILL REDUCE THE SOUR GAS PROCESSING

CAPACITY REQUIRED AT SGP, THEREBY INCREASING LIQUID PRODUCTION

CAPACITY AND LOWERING THE QUANTITIES OF SULFUR AND GAS THAT

WOULD OTHERWISE BE GENERATED. SECOND, SGI IS EXPECTED OVER TIME

TO INCREASE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND RECOVERABLE VOLUMES AS THE

INJECTED GAS MAINTAINS HIGHER RESERVOIR PRESSURE AND DISPLACES

OIL TOWARD PRODUCING WELLS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RECOGNIZING

ADDITIONAL PROVED RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SGI EXPANSION IN

LATE 2008. THE PRIMARY SGI RISKS INCLUDE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT

COMPRESSOR PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH INJECTING HIGH-PRESSURE

SOUR GAS AND SUBSURFACE RESPONSES TO INJECTION.

BEING EXPORTED THROUGH THE CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC)

PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM TENGIZ IN KAZAKHSTAN TO TANKER LOADING

FACILITIES AT NOVOROSSIYSK ON THE RUSSIAN COAST OF THE BLACK

SEA. ALSO IN EARLY 2008, CPC WAS SEEKING STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL

FOR AN EXPANSION TO ACCOMMODATE INCREASED TCO VOLUMES BEGINNING

IN 2009. EXPANDED RAIL-CAR LOADING AND RAIL-EXPORT FACILITIES,

DESIGNED TO TRANSPORT MOST OF THE INCREMENTAL SGI/SGP PRODUCTION

PRIOR TO THE CPC EXPANSION, STARTED OPERATION DURING 2007. AS OF

EARLY 2008, OTHER ALTERNATIVES WERE ALSO BEING EXPLORED TO

INCREASE EXPORT CAPACITY.

CHEVRON SOLD ITS 31 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE NEREFCO REFINERY IN THE NETHERLANDS IN MARCH

2007. THIS DECREASED THE COMPANYS SHARE OF OPERABLE

CAPACITY BY ABOUT 124,000 BARRELS PER DAY.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2008, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS 4 PERCENT

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AN AFFILIATE THAT OWNED A REFINERY IN

ABIDJAN, CÔTE DIVOIRE, DECREASING THE COMPANYS

SHARE OF OPERABLE CAPACITY BY ABOUT 2,000 BARRELS PER DAY.

AVERAGE CRUDE OIL DISTILLATION CAPACITY UTILIZATION DURING 2007

WAS 86 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH 90 PERCENT IN 2006. THIS

DECREASE GENERALLY RESULTED FROM UNPLANNED DOWNTIME TO REPAIR

DAMAGE RESULTING FROM FIRES IN THE CRUDE UNITS AT THE RICHMOND

AND PASCAGOULA REFINERIES DURING 2007. THIS IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN CAPACITY UTILIZATION AT THE

PEMBROKE, U.K., REFINERY, WHICH HAD UNPLANNED DOWNTIME IN 2006.

THE CRUDE UNIT AT THE PASCAGOULA REFINERY WAS BACK IN SERVICE IN

FEBRUARY 2008. DESPITE THE OUTAGE AT PASCAGOULA, THE COMPANY WAS

ABLE TO MAINTAIN UNINTERRUPTED PRODUCT SUPPLIES TO CUSTOMERS

THROUGH THE USE OF OTHER FEEDSTOCKS IN ITS GASOLINE-PRODUCING

FACILITIES AT THE REFINERY. AT THE U.S. FUEL REFINERIES,

CRUDE OIL DISTILLATION CAPACITY UTILIZATION AVERAGED

85 PERCENT IN 2007, COMPARED WITH 99 PERCENT IN 2006,

AND CRACKING AND COKING CAPACITY UTILIZATION AVERAGED

78 PERCENT AND 86 PERCENT IN 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. CRACKING AND COKING UNITS, INCLUDING FLUID

CATALYTIC CRACKING UNITS, ARE THE PRIMARY FACILITIES USED IN

FUEL REFINERIES TO CONVERT HEAVIER PRODUCTS INTO GASOLINE AND

OTHER LIGHT PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS FUEL REFINERIES IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE,

CANADA, SOUTH AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA PRODUCE LOW-SULFUR FUELS. IN

2007, SINGAPORE REFINING COMPANY, THE COMPANYS

50 PERCENT-OWNED AFFILIATE, BEGAN AN UPGRADE PROJECT AT ITS

290,000-BARREL-PER-DAY REFINERY IN SINGAPORE TO PRODUCE DIESEL

FUELS THAT MEET EURO IV SPECIFICATIONS.

IN 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED MODIFICATIONS AT ITS REFINERIES

IN EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA, TO ENABLE THE PROCESSING OF HEAVIER

CRUDE OILS INTO GASOLINE, DIESEL AND OTHER LIGHT PRODUCTS, AND

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM TO INCREASE THE CAPABILITY TO PROCESS

CASPIAN-BLEND CRUDE OILS. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY APPROVED

PLANS TO CONSTRUCT A $500 MILLION CONTINUOUS CATALYST

REGENERATION UNIT AT THE PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI, REFINERY,

WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE GASOLINE PRODUCTION BY

10 PERCENT, OR 600,000 GALLONS PER DAY, BY MID-2010. DESIGN

RESEARCH

AND TECHNOLOGY

THE COMPANYS ENERGY TECHNOLOGY COMPANY (ETC) SUPPORTS

CHEVRONS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES. ETC PROVIDES

TECHNOLOGY AND COMPETENCY SUPPORT IN EARTH SCIENCES; RESERVOIR

AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING; DRILLING AND COMPLETIONS; FACILITIES

ENGINEERING; HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY; REFINING; TECHNICAL

COMPUTING; STRATEGIC PLANNING; AND ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY.

TECHNOLOGY VENTURES COMPANY MANAGES INVESTMENTS AND PROJECTS IN

EMERGING ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR INTEGRATION INTO

CHEVRONS CORE BUSINESSES. ITS ACTIVITIES ARE MANAGED

THROUGH FOUR BUSINESS UNITS: VENTURE CAPITAL, BIOFUELS, HYDROGEN

AND EMERGING ENERGY.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPANY INTEGRATES COMPUTING,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA MANAGEMENT, SECURITY AND NETWORK

TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE A STANDARDIZED DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

CHEVRONS GLOBAL OPERATIONS.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO RESEARCH ALLIANCES WITH

TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY, WITH FOCUS ON THE PRODUCTION AND

CONVERSION OF CROPS FOR BIOFUELS FROM CELLULOSE, AND THE

COLORADO CENTER FOR BIOREFINING AND BIOFUEL, WITH FOCUS ON

CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS RESEARCH ALLIANCES

WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS AND THE GEORGIA

INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE FOCUSED ON CONVERTING

CELLULOSIC BIOMASS INTO TRANSPORTATION FUELS.

CHEVRONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE

$562 MILLION, $468 MILLION AND $316 MILLION FOR

THE YEARS 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES IN THE AREAS DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS

PROCESSES, AND ULTIMATE SUCCESSES ARE NOT CERTAIN. ALTHOUGH NOT

ALL INITIATIVES MAY PROVE TO BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, THE

COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA IS NOT

SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND TO

SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. CHEVRON EXPECTS MORE ENVIRONMENT-RELATED REGULATIONS IN

THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS OPERATIONS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF

COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS

OPERATIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING

BUSINESS.

IN 2007, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES.

THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO

RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

NEW FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE

UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM SEGMENTS AND RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR- AND

WATER-QUALITY PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS

REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING

FACILITIES. FOR 2008, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $580 MILLION. THE FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS

OF FULFILLING THIS COMMITMENT ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED

BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND THEIR IMPACT ON

CHEVRON AND ON THE COMPANYS 2007 ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES, REMEDIATION PROVISIONS AND YEAR-END ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES ARE CONTAINED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.    RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS CRUDE-OIL PRICES. EXCEPT

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF RUNNING AN INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

BUSINESS, CHEVRON DOES NOT SEEK TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

CHANGES. A SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT DECLINE IN CRUDE-OIL PRICES

MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND ITS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PLANS.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING

AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE

HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME,

CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE;

AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER

FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL

EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES

AND/OR

TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, 26 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC)  MEMBER

COUNTRIES INCLUDING ANGOLA, INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA.

TWENTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES,

INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT THE SCIENTIFIC

AND POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE AND

EXTENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT,

WILL CONTINUE, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER REGULATION THAT

AFFECTS THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH UNCERTAIN, THESE

DEVELOPMENTS COULD INCREASE COSTS OR REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR THE

PRODUCTS THE COMPANY SELLS. THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION AND

PROCESSING OPERATIONS (E.G., THE PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AT

OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND THE PROCESSING OF NATURAL GAS AT

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITIES) TYPICALLY RESULT IN EMISSIONS

OF GREENHOUSE GASES. LIKEWISE, EMISSIONS ARISE FROM MIDSTREAM

AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL TRANSPORTATION

AND REFINING. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE

COMPANY, THE USE OF PASSENGER VEHICLE FUELS AND RELATED PRODUCTS

BY CONSUMERS ALSO RESULTS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT MAY

BE REGULATED.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, DOMESTIC LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY

MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE CURRENTLY IN

VARIOUS PHASES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. THESE INCLUDE

THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND CURRENT

STATE-LEVEL ACTIONS. SOME OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH CHEVRON

OPERATES HAVE RATIFIED THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, AND THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY COMPLYING WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS WITHIN

THE EUROPEAN UNION. ALTHOUGH RESOLUTIONS SUPPORTING CAP

AND TRADE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE

U.S. CONGRESS, NO BILL RESTRICTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

HAS BEEN PASSED TO DATE.

IN CALIFORNIA, THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT BECAME EFFECTIVE

ON JANUARY 1, 2007. THIS LAW CAPS CALIFORNIAS

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT 1990 LEVELS BY 2020; DIRECTS THE AIR

RESOURCES BOARD, THE RESPONSIBLE STATE AGENCY, TO DETERMINE

CERTAIN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN AND OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA TO

ADOPT MANDATORY REPORTING RULES FOR SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF

GREENHOUSE GASES; DELEGATES TO THE AGENCY THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT

COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS (INCLUDING MARKET-BASED APPROACHES); AND

PERMITS A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE TARGETS UNDER EXTRAORDINARY

CIRCUMSTANCES. RELATED REGULATORY ACTIVITY IS UNDER WAY WITHIN

THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE AIR RESOURCES

BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION ARE ALSO IN THE

PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD FOR

TRANSPORTATION FUELS USED IN CALIFORNIA, AS DIRECTED BY GOVERNOR

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. THE COMPANY EXTRACTS CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS, OPERATES REFINERIES, AND MARKETS AND SELLS

GASOLINE, DIESEL AND JET FUEL IN CALIFORNIA. THE EXTENT TO WHICH

THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES REGULATIONS WILL AFFECT THE

COMPANYS CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS WAS NOT KNOWN AS OF EARLY

2008.

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2007.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING

COUNTRIES: ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, AZERBAIJAN, BANGLADESH, BRAZIL, CAMBODIA, CANADA, CHAD,

CHINA, COLOMBIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, DENMARK, FRANCE, INDIA, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN,

MYANMAR, THE NETHERLANDS, NIGERIA, NORWAY, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND

KUWAIT, THE PHILIPPINES, QATAR, REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, SINGAPORE, SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTH KOREA,

THAILAND, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE UNITED STATES, VENEZUELA AND VIETNAM.

CURRENT AND FUTURE EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY DEPEND LARGELY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM

(EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION) AND DOWNSTREAM (REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION) BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOTH SEGMENTS IS

MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. IN THE DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE LARGEST COST

COMPONENT OF REFINED PRODUCTS.

THE OVERALL TREND IN EARNINGS IS TYPICALLY LESS AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS CHEMICALS

BUSINESS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS. EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANY IN ANY PERIOD MAY ALSO BE

INFLUENCED BY EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE INFREQUENT AND/OR UNUSUAL IN NATURE.

CHEVRON AND THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AT LARGE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN CERTAIN

COSTS THAT EXCEEDS THE GENERAL TREND OF INFLATION IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD. THIS INCREASE IN

COSTS IS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS OPERATING EXPENSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PARTICULARLY FOR THE

UPSTREAM BUSINESS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY UPSTREAM, CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS.

THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND

ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN

SUCH COUNTRIES.

TO SUSTAIN ITS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MUST

DEVELOP AND REPLENISH AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS THAT OFFER ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR THE

INVESTMENT REQUIRED. IDENTIFYING PROMISING AREAS FOR EXPLORATION, ACQUIRING THE NECESSARY RIGHTS TO

EXPLORE FOR AND TO PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, DRILLING SUCCESSFULLY, AND HANDLING THE MANY

TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS IN A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER ARE ALL IMPORTANT FACTORS IN

THIS EFFORT. PROJECTS OFTEN REQUIRE LONG LEAD TIMES AND LARGE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. IN THE CURRENT

ENVIRONMENT OF HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES, CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS HAVE SOUGHT TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACTS OR

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COMPANY. OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY ATTEMPT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS, TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING FUTURE

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHERWISE SEEK TO MITIGATE ANY RISKS TO THE COMPANYS CURRENT

OPERATIONS OR FUTURE PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE, OR TO ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO

ITS ASSET BASE TO HELP AUGMENT THE COMPANYS GROWTH. ASSET SALES DURING 2007 INCLUDED THE COMPANYS

31 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN A REFINERY AND RELATED ASSETS IN THE NETHERLANDS; FUELS MARKETING

BUSINESSES IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG, THE NETHERLANDS AND URUGUAY; AND THE INVESTMENT IN COMMON STOCK

OF DYNEGY INC. OTHER ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES.

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM

EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS OR FEARS THEREOF THAT

MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. MOREOVER, ANY OF THESE

FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY

MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS, AND

ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING ITS FACILITIES AND BUSINESS.

PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND

THE COMPANYS CONTROL. EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION BUT ALSO

PRICES CHARGED BY THE INDUSTRYS MATERIAL- AND SERVICE-PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE

VOLATILITY OF THE INDUSTRYS OWN SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH MATERIALS AND SERVICES. THE

OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES FOR THESE ITEMS SINCE

2005, AND FUTURE PRICE INCREASES MAY CONTINUE TO EXCEED THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION. CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO CAN BE AFFECTED BY DAMAGES TO PRODUCTION

FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST.

INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL INCREASED DURING 2007. THE SPOT PRICE FOR WEST TEXAS

INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE OIL, A BENCHMARK CRUDE OIL, AVERAGED $72 PER BARREL IN 2007, UP

APPROXIMATELY $6 PER BARREL FROM THE 2006 AVERAGE PRICE. THE RISE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES WAS

ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO INCREASING DEMAND IN GROWING ECONOMIES, THE HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN SOME AREAS OF THE WORLD AND SUPPLY CONCERNS IN OTHER KEY PRODUCING

REGIONS. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2008, THE WTI PRICE WAS ABOUT $93 PER BARREL.

AS IN 2006, A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL IN PRICES EXISTED IN 2007 BETWEEN HIGH-QUALITY (I.E.,

HIGH-GRAVITY, LOW SULFUR) CRUDE OILS

AND THOSE OF LOWER QUALITY (I.E., LOW-GRAVITY, HEAVIER TYPES OF CRUDE). THE PRICE FOR THE HEAVIER

CRUDES HAS BEEN DAMPENED BECAUSE OF AMPLE SUPPLY AND LOWER RELATIVE DEMAND DUE TO THE LIMITED

NUMBER OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PROCESS THIS LOWER-QUALITY FEEDSTOCK INTO LIGHT PRODUCTS

(I.E., MOTOR GASOLINE, JET FUEL, AVIATION GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL). THE PRICE FOR

HIGHER-QUALITY CRUDE OIL HAS REMAINED HIGH, AS THE DEMAND FOR LIGHT PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN BE

MORE EASILY MANUFACTURED BY REFINERIES FROM HIGH-QUALITY CRUDE OIL, HAS BEEN STRONG WORLDWIDE.

CHEVRON PRODUCES OR SHARES IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN CALIFORNIA, CHAD,

INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, VENEZUELA AND CERTAIN

FIELDS IN ANGOLA, CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM NORTH SEA. (REFER TO

PAGE FS-L0 FOR THE

COMPANYS AVERAGE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL PRICES.)

IN CONTRAST TO PRICE MOVEMENTS IN

THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL GAS IN MANY REGIONAL MARKETS ARE

MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS IN THOSE MARKETS. IN THE UNITED STATES

DURING 2007, BENCHMARK PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED ABOUT $7 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET (MCF),

COMPARED WITH ABOUT $6.50 IN 2006. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2008, THE HENRY HUB PRICE WAS ABOUT $8

PER MCF. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED

WITH THE VOLUMES PRODUCED IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE INVENTORY IN UNDERGROUND STORAGE RELATIVE

TO CUSTOMER DEMAND. U.S. NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE ALSO TYPICALLY HIGHER DURING THE WINTER PERIOD

WHEN DEMAND FOR HEATING IS GREATEST.

CERTAIN OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE DIFFERENT SUPPLY, DEMAND

AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES, TYPICALLY RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE SALES PRICES FOR

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS. (REFER TO PAGE FS-L0 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS

PRICES FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.) ADDITIONALLY, EXCESS-SUPPLY CONDITIONS THAT EXIST

IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD CANNOT EASILY SERVE TO MITIGATE THE RELATIVELY HIGH-

FS-3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PRICE CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER MARKETS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO

TRANSPORT AND RECEIVE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS.

TO HELP ADDRESS THIS REGIONAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS, CHEVRON IS

PLANNING INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN LONG-TERM PROJECTS IN AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY TO INSTALL

INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER, ALONG WITH INVESTMENTS

AND COMMITMENTS TO REGASIFY THE PRODUCT IN MARKETS WHERE DEMAND IS STRONG AND SUPPLIES ARE NOT AS

PLENTIFUL. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THESE LONG-TERM PROJECTS, THE

NATURAL GAS SALES PRICES IN THE AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY (BEFORE THE NATURAL GAS IS TRANSFERRED TO A

COMPANY-OWNED OR THIRD-PARTY PROCESSING FACILITY) ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN WELL BELOW SALES PRICES

FOR NATURAL GAS THAT IS PRODUCED MUCH NEARER TO AREAS OF HIGH DEMAND AND CAN BE TRANSPORTED IN

EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE NETWORKS (AS IN THE UNITED STATES).

BESIDES THE IMPACT OF THE FLUCTUATION IN PRICE FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, THE LONGER-TERM

TREND IN EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ALSO A FUNCTION OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN

FISCAL TERMS OF CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN TAX RATES ON INCOME, AND THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES.

CHEVRONS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2007, INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL

SANDS, AVERAGED 2.62 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, A DECLINE OF ABOUT 48,000 BARRELS PER DAY FROM 2006,

DUE MAINLY TO THE EFFECT OF A CONVERSION OF OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS IN VENEZUELA TO

JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES. (REFER TO THE TABLE SELECTED OPERATING

DATA ON PAGE FS-L0 FOR A LISTING OF

PRODUCTION VOLUMES FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007.) THE COMPANY ESTIMATES

THAT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2008 WILL AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 2.65 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY.

THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE

PRICE EFFECT ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS

OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS,

DELAYS IN PROJECT START-UPS, WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY SHUT IN PRODUCTION, CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING

GEOPOLITICS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY THE

SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME

LAG BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. MOST OF CHEVRONS UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM PROJECTS

GENERALLY ARE MADE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION.

APPROXIMATELY 28 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2007 OCCURRED IN

THE OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF ANGOLA, INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED

NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. OPEC QUOTAS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT CHEVRONS PRODUCTION LEVEL IN 2007.

THE IMPACT OF OPEC QUOTAS ON THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION IN 2008 IS

UNCERTAIN.

IN OCTOBER 2006, CHEVRONS BOSCAN AND LL-652 OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS IN VENEZUELA WERE

CONVERTED TO EMPRESAS MIXTAS (I.E., JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES), WITH PETRÓLEOS DE VENEZUELA, S.A.

(PDVSA) AS MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER. FROM THAT TIME, CHEVRON REPORTED ITS EQUITY SHARE OF THE BOSCAN

AND LL-652 PRODUCTION, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 85,000 BARRELS PER DAY LESS THAN WHAT THE COMPANY

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED UNDER THE OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS. THE CHANGE TO THE EMPRESA MIXTA

STRUCTURE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA ISSUED A DECREE ANNOUNCING THE GOVERNMENTS

INTENTION FOR PDVSA TO TAKE OVER OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF ALL ORINOCO HEAVY OIL ASSOCIATIONS

EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2007, AND TO INCREASE ITS OWNERSHIP IN ALL SUCH ASSOCIATIONS TO A MINIMUM OF 60

PERCENT. THE DECREE INCLUDED CHEVRONS 30 PERCENT-OWNED HAMACA PROJECT. IN APRIL 2007, CHEVRON

SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) WITH PDVSA THAT SUMMARIZED THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO

TRANSFER CONTROL OF HAMACA OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEBRUARY DECREE. AS PROVIDED IN THE

MOU, A PDVSA-CONTROLLED TRANSITORY OPERATIONAL COMMITTEE, ON WHICH CHEVRON HAD REPRESENTATION,

ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAILY OPERATIONS ON MAY 1, 2007. THE MOU STIPULATED THAT TERMS OF

EXISTING CONTRACTS WERE TO REMAIN IN PLACE DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. IN DECEMBER 2007, CHEVRON

EXECUTED A CONVERSION AGREEMENT AND SIGNED A CHARTER AND BY-LAWS WITH A PDVSA SUBSIDIARY THAT

PROVIDED FOR CHEVRON TO RETAIN ITS 30 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE HAMACA PROJECT. THE NEW ENTITY,

PETROPIAR, COMMENCED ACTIVITIES IN JANUARY 2008. THE CONVERSION AGREEMENT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON CHEVRONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

REFER TO PAGES FS-6 THROUGH FS-7 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS.

DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO MARGINS ON THE REFINING AND

MARKETING OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE GASOLINE, DIESEL, JET FUEL, LUBRICANTS, FUEL OIL AND FEEDSTOCKS

FOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING. INDUSTRY MARGINS ARE SOMETIMES VOLATILE AND CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE

GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND BALANCE FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF

CRUDE OIL USED FOR REFINERY FEEDSTOCK. INDUSTRY MARGINS CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY REFINED-PRODUCT

INVENTORY LEVELS, GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, REFINERY MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES

RESULTING FROM UNPLANNED OUTAGES THAT MAY BE DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER, FIRES OR OTHER OPERATIONAL

EVENTS.

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY FOR DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY AND

EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING NETWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CRUDE-OIL AND

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCT-SUPPLY FUNCTIONS AND THE ECONOMIC RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL.

PROFITABILITY CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF TANKER CHARTER RATES FOR THE COMPANYS

SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRYS DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT

TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND

ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE COMPANYS REFINERY AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

THE COMPANYS MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE

U.S. GULF COAST, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA, SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. CHEVRON

OPERATES OR HAS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REFINERIES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS EXCEPT LATIN AMERICA. FOR

THE INDUSTRY, REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS WERE GENERALLY HIGHER IN 2007 THAN IN 2006. FOR THE COMPANY,

U.S. REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS DURING 2007 WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY PLANNED AND UNPLANNED DOWNTIME

AT ITS THREE LARGEST U.S. REFINERIES.

INDUSTRY MARGINS IN THE FUTURE MAY BE VOLATILE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF

CRUDE OIL USED FOR REFINERY FEEDSTOCK AND BY CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND

REFINED PRODUCTS. THE INDUSTRY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BALANCE CAN BE AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS AT

REFINERIES RESULTING FROM MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND UNPLANNED OUTAGES, INCLUDING WEATHER-RELATED

DISRUPTIONS; REFINED-PRODUCT INVENTORY LEVELS; AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS.

REFER TO PAGE FS-7 THROUGH FS-8 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM

OPERATIONS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS IN THE PETROCHEMICALS BUSINESS ARE CLOSELY TIED TO GLOBAL CHEMICAL DEMAND,

INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS AND PLANT CAPACITY UTILIZATION. FEEDSTOCK AND FUEL COSTS, WHICH TEND TO

FOLLOW CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE MOVEMENTS, ALSO INFLUENCE EARNINGS IN THIS SEGMENT.

REFER TO PAGE FS-8 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF CHEMICALS EARNINGS.

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

KEY OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER EVENTS DURING 2007 AND EARLY 2008 INCLUDED THE

FOLLOWING.

UPSTREAM

ANGOLA

DISCOVERED CRUDE OIL AT THE 31 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED MALANGE-1 WELL IN OFFSHORE

BLOCK 14. ADDITIONAL DRILLING AND GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING STUDIES ARE PLANNED TO APPRAISE THE

DISCOVERY. THE COMPANY AND PARTNERS ALSO MADE THE FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION TO CONSTRUCT A

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) PLANT THAT WILL BE OWNED 36 PERCENT BY CHEVRON. THE PLANT WILL BE

DESIGNED

WITH A CAPACITY TO PROCESS 1 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS PER DAY AND PRODUCE 5.2 MILLION

METRIC TONS A YEAR OF LNG AND RELATED GAS LIQUIDS PRODUCTS.

AUSTRALIA

RECEIVED FEDERAL AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE 50

PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED GORGON LNG PROJECT LOCATED OFF THE NORTHWEST COAST. THE APPROVALS

REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANYS NATURAL GAS RESOURCES

OFFSHORE AUSTRALIA.

GENERATION PLANT EXPANSION PROJECTS AT THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED TENGIZ FIELD. THIS PHASE INCREASED

PRODUCTION CAPACITY BY 90,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER DAY TO APPROXIMATELY 400,000. FULL FACILITY

EXPANSION IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THE SECOND-HALF 2008, INCREASING PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO

540,000 BARRELS PER DAY.

REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

CONFIRMED TWO CRUDE OIL DISCOVERIES IN THE OFFSHORE MOHO-BILONDO PERMIT.

EVALUATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO APPRAISE THE DISCOVERIES, IN WHICH CHEVRON

HOLDS A 32 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST.

THAILAND

SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO INCREASE SALES OF NATURAL GAS FROM COMPANY-OPERATED BLOCKS 10,

11, 12 AND 13 IN THE GULF OF THAILAND TO PTT PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED. CHEVRON HAS OWNERSHIP

INTERESTS RANGING FROM 60 PERCENT TO 80 PERCENT IN THE BLOCKS, WHICH RECEIVED 10-YEAR

PRODUCTION-PERIOD EXTENSIONS TO 2022. THE COMPANY WAS ALSO GRANTED THE CONCESSION RIGHTS FOR A

SIX-YEAR PERIOD TO FOUR PROSPECTIVE OFFSHORE PETROLEUM BLOCKS, THREE OF WHICH IT WILL OPERATE.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SELL NATURAL GAS TO THE NATIONAL GAS COMPANY OF

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO FOR 11 YEARS WITH AN OPTION FOR A FOUR-YEAR EXTENSION. THE GAS IS EXPECTED TO

BE SOURCED FROM CHEVRONS 50 PERCENT-OWNED EAST COAST MARINE AREA.

UNITED STATES

ANNOUNCED THAT FIRST PRODUCTION FROM THE TAHITI PROJECT IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF

MEXICO IS EXPECTED BY THE THIRD QUARTER 2009. THE START-UP IS APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR LATER THAN

U.S.

UPSTREAM INCOME OF $4.5 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION FROM

2006. RESULTS IN 2007 BENEFITED APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION FROM HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS. THIS BENEFIT TO INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

EFFECTS OF A DECLINE IN

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION, OPERATING AND EXPLORATION EXPENSES.

INCOME OF $4.3 BILLION IN 2006 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION FROM 2005. EARNINGS IN

2006 BENEFITED ABOUT $850 MILLION FROM HIGHER AVERAGE PRICES ON OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND THE

EFFECT OF SEVEN ADDITIONAL MONTHS OF PRODUCTION FROM THE UNOCAL PROPERTIES THAT WERE ACQUIRED IN

AUGUST 2005. SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS WERE INCREASES IN OPERATING, EXPLORATION AND

DEPRECIATION EXPENSES. INCLUDED IN THE OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASES WERE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

CARRYOVER EFFECTS OF HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN 2005.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2007 WAS $63.16 PER

BARREL, COMPARED WITH $56.66 IN 2006 AND $46.97 IN 2005. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS

$6.12 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2007, COMPARED WITH $6.29 AND $7.43 IN 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2007 AVERAGED 743,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN 2.6 PERCENT FROM

2006 AND UP 2 PERCENT FROM 2005, WHICH INCLUDED ONLY FIVE MONTHS OF PRODUCTION FROM THE UNOCAL

PROPERTIES ACQUIRED IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR. THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

FOR 2007 AVERAGED 460,000 BARRELS A DAY, WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT COMPARED WITH 2006, AND AN

INCREASE OF 1 PERCENT FROM 2005. NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 1.7 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY

IN 2007, DOWN 6 PERCENT FROM 2006 AND UP 4 PERCENT FROM 2005.

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM INCOME OF $10.3 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED $1.4 BILLION FROM 2006.

EARNINGS IN 2007 BENEFITED APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION FROM HIGHER PRICES, PRIMARILY FOR CRUDE OIL,

AND $300 MILLION FROM INCREASED LIFTINGS. NON-RECURRING INCOME TAX ITEMS ALSO BENEFITED EARNINGS

BETWEEN PERIODS. THESE BENEFITS TO INCOME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER OPERATING

AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES.

INCOME IN 2006 OF APPROXIMATELY $8.9 BILLION INCREASED $1.3 BILLION FROM 2005. EARNINGS IN

2006 BENEFITED APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION FROM HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND AN

ADDITIONAL SEVEN MONTHS OF PRODUCTION FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL PROPERTIES. ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THIS

BENEFIT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES. SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS

WERE INCREASES IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, OPERATING EXPENSE AND EXPLORATION EXPENSE. ALSO ADVERSELY

AFFECTING 2006 INCOME WERE HIGHER TAXES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN TAX RATES IN THE U.K. AND

VENEZUELA AND SETTLEMENT OF TAX CLAIMS AND OTHER TAX ITEMS IN VENEZUELA, ANGOLA AND CHAD. FOREIGN

CURRENCY EFFECTS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $371 MILLION IN 2006, BUT INCREASED INCOME $14 MILLION IN

2005.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2007 WAS $65.01 PER

BARREL, COMPARED WITH $57.65 IN 2006 AND $47.59 IN 2005. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS

$3.90 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2007, COMPARED WITH $3.73 AND $3.19 IN 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF 1.88 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2007 DECLINED ABOUT 2 PERCENT

FROM 2006 AND INCREASED 5 PERCENT FROM 2005. THE VOLUMES FOR EACH YEAR INCLUDED PRODUCTION FROM OIL

SANDS IN CANADA AND AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT IN VENEZUELA UNTIL ITS CONVERSION TO A

JOINT-STOCK COMPANY IN OCTOBER 2006. THE DECLINE BETWEEN 2006 AND 2007 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

IMPACT OF THIS CONTRACT CONVERSION IN VENEZUELA AND THE PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES

CALCULATED UNDER PRODUCTION-SHARING AGREEMENTS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECLINE WAS INCREASED

PRODUCTION IN BANGLADESH, ANGOLA AND AZERBAIJAN. THE INCREASE FROM 2005 WAS DUE TO THAT YEAR HAVING

INCLUDED ONLY FIVE MONTHS OF PRODUCTION FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL PROPERTIES.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS 1.3 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN

2007, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 4 PERCENT FROM 2006 AND 3 PERCENT FROM 2005. NET NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION OF 3.3 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2007 WAS UP 5.5 PERCENT AND 28 PERCENT FROM 2006

AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $966 MILLION IN 2007 DECLINED NEARLY $1 BILLION FROM 2006 AND

WERE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS 2005. THE DECLINE IN 2007 FROM 2006 WAS ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH WEAKER

REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER CRUDE OIL PRICES AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF

HIGHER PLANNED AND UNPLANNED DOWNTIME ON REFINERY PRODUCTION VOLUMES AT THE COMPANYS THREE MAJOR

REFINERIES. OPERATING EXPENSES WERE ALSO HIGHER IN 2007. THE IMPROVEMENT IN 2006 EARNINGS FROM 2005

WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER AVERAGE REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS IN 2006 AND THE ADVERSE EFFECT

OF DOWNTIME IN 2005 AT REFINING, MARKETING AND PIPELINE OPERATIONS THAT WAS CAUSED BY HURRICANES IN

THE GULF OF MEXICO.

SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED PRODUCTS WERE 1.46 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2007, A DECREASE OF 3

PERCENT AND 1 PERCENT FROM 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE REPORTED SALES VOLUME FOR 2007 WAS ON A

DIFFERENT BASIS THAN 2006 AND 2005 DUE TO A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING RULES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE APRIL

1, 2006, FOR CERTAIN PURCHASE AND SALE (BUY/SELL) CONTRACTS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. EXCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD, REFINED-PRODUCT SALES IN 2007 DECREASED 1 PERCENT FROM 2006

AND INCREASED ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM 2005. BRANDED GASOLINE SALES VOLUMES OF 629,000 BARRELS PER DAY

IN 2007 INCREASED ABOUT 2 PERCENT FROM 2006 AND 6 PERCENT FROM 2005, LARGELY DUE TO GROWTH OF THE

TEXACO BRAND.

INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM INCOME OF $2.5 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED ABOUT $500 MILLION FROM

2006 AND $750 MILLION FROM 2005. RESULTS FOR 2007 INCLUDED GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION ON THE

SALE OF ASSETS, INCLUDING AN INTEREST IN A REFINERY AND MARKETING

ASSETS IN THE BENELUX REGION OF

EUROPE. MARGINS ON THE SALE OF REFINED PRODUCTS IN 2007 WERE UP SLIGHTLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER, AND EARNINGS FROM THE COMPANYS SHIPPING OPERATIONS WERE LOWER. THE

INCREASE IN EARNINGS IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 WAS ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER

REFINED-PRODUCT SALES MARGINS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC AREA AND CANADA AND IMPROVED RESULTS FROM

CRUDE-OIL AND REFINED-PRODUCT TRADING ACTIVITIES.

REFINED-PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES WERE 2.03 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2007, ABOUT 5 PERCENT AND

10 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, DUE LARGELY TO THE IMPACT OF ASSET SALES AND THE

ACCOUNTING-STANDARD CHANGE FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS. EXCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING CHANGE, SALES DECREASED

ABOUT 4 PERCENT AND 5 PERCENT FROM 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

IMPROVED MARGINS ON SALES OF LUBRICANTS AND FUEL ADDITIVES BY ORONITE WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE

EFFECT OF LOWER MARGINS ON THE SALE OF COMMODITY CHEMICALS BY CPCHEM. IN 2006, EARNINGS OF $539

MILLION INCREASED ABOUT $240 MILLION FROM 2005 DUE TO HIGHER MARGINS FOR COMMODITY CHEMICALS AT

AT YEAR-END 2006. IN FEBRUARY 2008, $750 MILLION OF CHEVRON CANADA FUNDING COMPANY BONDS MATURED.

THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALED $5.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, DOWN FROM $6.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2006. OF THESE AMOUNTS, $4.4 BILLION AND $4.5 BILLION WERE

RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END 2007, SETTLEMENT OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL WITHIN ONE YEAR, AS THE

COMPANY HAD THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE

THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

AT YEAR-END 2007, THE COMPANY HAD $5 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR

BANKS, WHICH PERMIT THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE

FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING AND ALSO CAN BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS

UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT INTEREST RATES BASED ON LONDON INTERBANK

OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS

REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE

FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

IN MARCH 2007, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) AN

AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2010. THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS FOR AN

UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF NON-CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY. AT THE

SAME TIME, THE COMPANY WITHDREW THREE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS ON FILE WITH THE SEC THAT

PERMITTED THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO $3.8 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING PUBLIC BONDS ISSUED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION

PROFIT SHARING/SAVINGS PLAN TRUST FUND, CHEVRON CANADA FUNDING COMPANY (FORMERLY CHEVRONTEXACO

CAPITAL COMPANY), TEXACO CAPITAL INC. AND UNION OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES

ARE GUARANTEED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ARE RATED AA BY STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND AAL

BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE. THE RATING BY MOODYS REFLECTS AN UPGRADE IN DECEMBER FROM AA2. THE

COMPANYS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-L+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND P-1 BY MOODYS. ALL OF

THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY, INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE

CAPITAL-SPENDING PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH

DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE COMPANYS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

A $5 BILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM INITIATED IN

DECEMBER 2006 WAS COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER 2007. DURING 2007, ABOUT 61.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES WERE

ACQUIRED UNDER THIS PROGRAM AT A TOTAL COST OF $4.9 BILLION. UPON COMPLETION OF THIS PROGRAM, THE

COMPANY AUTHORIZED THE ACQUISITION OF UP TO $15 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES FROM TIME TO

TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, AS PERMITTED BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SUBJECT

TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE PROGRAM IS FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO THREE YEARS AND MAY BE

DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, 23.5 MILLION SHARES HAD BEEN ACQUIRED UNDER THE NEW

PROGRAM FOR $2.1 BILLION. PURCHASES THROUGH MID-FEBRUARY 2008 INCREASED THE TOTAL SHARES ACQUIRED

TO 34.2 MILLION AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2007 WERE $20 BILLION,

INCLUDING $2.3 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE

CASH OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. IN 2006 AND 2005, EXPENDITURES WERE $16.6 BILLION AND $11.1 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF $1.9 BILLION AND $1.7

BILLION IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS. THE 2005 AMOUNT EXCLUDES $17.3 BILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF

UNOCAL CORPORATION.

OF THE $20 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2007, ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS, OR $15.5 BILLION, RELATED TO

UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN

2006 AND 2005. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES

THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2008, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WILL BE 15 PERCENT HIGHER

AT $22.9 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.6 BILLION OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE

TOTAL, OR $17.5 BILLION, IS BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $12.7 BILLION

OF THIS AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SPENDING IN 2008 IS PRIMARILY TARGETED FOR EXPLORATORY

PROSPECTS IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO AND WESTERN AFRICA AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN

ANGOLA, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN, NIGERIA, THAILAND, THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO,

THE PICEANCE BASIN IN COLORADO AND AN OIL SANDS PROJECT IN CANADA.

WORLDWIDE DOWNSTREAM SPENDING IN 2008 IS ESTIMATED AT $4.1 BILLION, WITH ABOUT $2.3 BILLION

FOR PROJECTS IN THE UNITED STATES. CAPITAL PROJECTS INCLUDE UPGRADES TO REFINERIES IN THE UNITED

STATES AND SOUTH KOREA AND CONSTRUCTION OF GAS-TO-LIQUIDS FACILITIES IN SUPPORT OF ASSOCIATED

UPSTREAM PROJECTS.

INVESTMENTS IN CHEMICALS, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER CORPORATE BUSINESSES IN 2008 ARE BUDGETED AT

$1.3 BILLION. TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS INCLUDE PROJECTS RELATED TO UNCONVENTIONAL HYDROCARBONS

TECHNOLOGIES, OIL AND GAS RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT AND GAS-FIRED AND RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS

IN 2007, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $317 MILLION

(APPROXIMATELY $78 MILLION TO THE U.S. PLANS). THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2008

WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT

RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS.

ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN

OPERATIONAL BY 2012. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE

AMOUNT WILL REDUCE OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY OF ANY

AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON CARRIES NO LIABILITY FOR ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THIS

GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON

AND MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE

INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO

MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300 MILLION. THROUGH THE END OF 2007, THE COMPANY HAD PAID $48 MILLION

UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION

PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND NO

LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO

MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED ANY

LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL

AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED

FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

SECURITIZATION

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS U.S. PROPRIETARY CONSUMER

CREDIT CARD BUSINESS AND RELATED RECEIVABLES. THIS TRANSACTION INCLUDED TERMINATING THE QUALIFYING

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (SPE) THAT WAS USED TO SECURITIZE ASSOCIATED RETAIL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

THROUGH THE USE OF ANOTHER QUALIFYING SPE, THE COMPANY HAD $675 MILLION OF SECURITIZED TRADE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RELATED TO ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007. THIS ARRANGEMENT HAS

THE EFFECT OF ACCELERATING CHEVRONS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. CHEVRONS TOTAL

ESTIMATED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THIS SECURITIZATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS $65 MILLION. IN THE

EVENT THAT THE SPE EXPERIENCES MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES, CHEVRON BELIEVES

THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO ADDITIONAL LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN THIS

SECURITIZATION.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF $204 MILLION RELATED TO MINORITY INTERESTS

IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS

TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS,

UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS

ARE: 2008  $4.7 BILLION; 2009  $3.3 BILLION; 2010  $3.3 BILLION; 2011  $1.9 BILLION; 2012 

$1.3 BILLION; 2013 AND AFTER  $4.9 BILLION. A PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS MAY ULTIMATELY BE

DETERMINABLE.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN MARKET RISK OCCURRED BETWEEN 2006 AND 2007 FOR THE FINANCIAL AND

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW. THE HYPOTHETICAL VARIANCES USED IN THIS SECTION WERE

SELECTED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATION OF MARKET

CHANGES. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS

DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS IN

PART 1, ITEM 1A, OF THE COMPANYS 2007 ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM 10-K.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO THE PRICE

VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS

AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF

ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND

STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY

REFINERIES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES.

THE RESULTS OF THIS ACTIVITY WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, NET INCOME OR

CASH FLOWS IN 2007.

FS-14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS MARKET EXPOSURE POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN

INTERNAL RISK CONTROL GROUP TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES THAT

HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES, OPTIONS, AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NYMEX (NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE) AND ON ELECTRONIC PLATFORMS OF ICE (INTER-CONTINENTAL EXCHANGE) AND GLOBEX (CHICAGO

MERCANTILE EXCHANGE). IN ADDITION, CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCT SWAP CONTRACTS AND

OPTION CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND

GAS COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES

REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM PUBLISHED MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER

INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES.

EFFECTIVE WITH 2007 YEAR-END REPORTING, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MODEL USED TO QUANTIFY

INFORMATION ABOUT MARKET RISK FOR ITS COMMODITY DERIVATIVES FROM A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS APPROACH

TO VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). THE MAJOR REASON FOR THE CHANGE IS THAT VAR ALLOWS ESTIMATION OF A

PORTFOLIOS AGGREGATE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN TRADING

ASSETS. THEREFORE, IT REFLECTS RISK REDUCTION DUE TO DIVERSIFICATION OR HEDGING ACTIVITIES. MOST OF

THE COMPANYS MARKET POSITIONS ARE TIME AND COMMODITY SPREADS, AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT VAR IS

A MORE ACCURATE TOOL TO MEASURE THIS TYPE OF EXPOSURE THAN THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS MODEL. THE

COMPANY FULLY DEVELOPED AND TESTED ITS VAR MODEL DURING 2007.

VAR IS THE MAXIMUM LOSS NOT TO BE EXCEEDED WITHIN A GIVEN PROBABILITY OR CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER

A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANYS VAR MODEL USES THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION METHOD THAT

INVOLVES GENERATING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS FROM THE SPECIFIED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION AND

CONSTRUCTING A FULL DISTRIBUTION OF A POTENTIAL PORTFOLIOS VALUES.

THE VAR MODEL UTILIZES AN EXPONENTIALLY-WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE FOR COMPUTING HISTORICAL

VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL, AND ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD. THAT IS,

THE COMPANYS 95 PERCENT, ONE-DAY VAR CORRESPONDS TO THE UNREALIZED LOSS IN PORTFOLIO VALUE THAT

WOULD NOT BE EXCEEDED ON AVERAGE MORE THAN ONE IN EVERY 20 TRADING DAYS, IF THE PORTFOLIO WERE HELD

CONSTANT FOR ONE DAY.

THE ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT MARKET-RISK POSITIONS CAN BE

LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED WITHIN ONE DAY. FOR HEDGING AND RISK MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY USES CONVENTIONAL

EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS, AS WELL AS NON-EXCHANGE-TRADED SWAPS, MOST

OF WHICH CAN BE LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED EFFECTIVELY WITHIN ONE DAY. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS 95

PERCENT/ONE-DAY VAR FOR EACH OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY RISK EXPOSURES IN THE AREA OF COMMODITY

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR THE COMPANYS OPEN COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER

THE SAME HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN PRICES OF THESE COMMODITIES WOULD RESULT IN

APPROXIMATELY THE SAME OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS. THE HYPOTHETICAL

EFFECT ON THESE CONTRACTS WAS ESTIMATED BY CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL AND CURRENT MARKET PRICES MULTIPLIED BY THE CONTRACT AMOUNTS.

THE CHANGE IN THE AMOUNTS BETWEEN YEARS IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS

IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN COMMODITY PRICES, VOLUMES HEDGED AND THE USE OF LONGER-TERM

CONTRACTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF

180 DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE

AND ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE

COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT

YEAR-END 2007 WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION. THE EFFECT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE FOR A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT DECREASE

IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT YEAR-END 2007.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO

MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE

BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY

REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO

FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES

REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT YEAR-END 2007, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST-RATE SWAPS ON FLOATING-RATE

DEBT. AT YEAR-END 2007, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS

LESS THAN ONE YEAR. A HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE OR DECREASE OF 10 BASIS POINTS IN FIXED INTEREST RATES

WOULD HAVE A

DE MINIMIS

IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RECEIVE FIXED SWAPS.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY

ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS. LONG-TERM

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE IN PLACE WITH THE COMPANYS REFINING AFFILIATE

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY

BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO 88 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE OF

MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGES OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER. CHEVRON HAS

AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO A TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT OF 60 PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS. THE TERMS OF THIS

AGREEMENT, WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY A NUMBER OF PARTIES, INCLUDING THE COURT, ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND

NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

RESOLUTION OF REMAINING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR

AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER

PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY

CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE REFERENCED 60 LAWSUITS DID NOT

SET ANY PRECEDENTS RELATED TO STANDARDS OF LIABILITY TO BE USED TO JUDGE THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMS,

CORRECTIVE MEASURES REQUIRED OR MONETARY DAMAGES TO BE ASSESSED FOR THE REMAINING LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS OR FUTURE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO

PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN

ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

RFG PATENT

FOURTEEN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT BY CONSUMERS OF REFORMULATED GASOLINE

(RFG) ALLEGING THAT UNOCAL MISLED THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD INTO ADOPTING STANDARDS FOR

COMPOSITION OF RFG THAT OVERLAPPED WITH UNOCALS UNDISCLOSED AND PENDING PATENTS. ELEVEN LAWSUITS

WERE CONSOLIDATED IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WHERE A CLASS

ACTION HAS BEEN CERTIFIED, AND THREE WERE CONSOLIDATED IN A STATE COURT ACTION. UNOCAL IS ALLEGED

TO HAVE MONOPOLIZED, CONSPIRED AND ENGAGED IN UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION, RESULTING IN INJURY TO

CONSUMERS OF RFG. PLAINTIFFS IN BOTH CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS SEEK UNSPECIFIED ACTUAL AND PUNITIVE

DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS FEES, AND INTEREST ON BEHALF OF AN ALLEGED CLASS OF CONSUMERS WHO

PURCHASED

SUMMERTIME RFG IN CALIFORNIA FROM JANUARY 1995 THROUGH AUGUST 2005. THE PARTIES HAVE REACHED A

TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE ABOVE MATTERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION. THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE

CONFIDENTIAL, AND SUBJECT TO FURTHER NEGOTIATION AND APPROVAL, INCLUDING BY THE COURTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE,

BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL

FIELDS,

SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS

THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE

ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY

BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

INCLUDED IN THE $1,539 MILLION YEAR-END 2007 RESERVE BALANCE WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

OF 240 SITES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR

OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER

REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE

COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2007 WAS $123 MILLION. THE FEDERAL

SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON TO ASSUME

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT EXPECTED

TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF

THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2007 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,416 MILLION, $864 MILLION

RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 2,000 SITES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS) AND

PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $552 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL

DOWNSTREAM ($146 MILLION), UPSTREAM ($267 MILLION), CHEMICALS ($105 MILLION) AND OTHER ($34

MILLION). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION

OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL

EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF

PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND

MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2007 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT (FASB) NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143).

UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED WHEN

THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE LIABILITY BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $8.3 BILLION FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2007 RELATED PRIMARILY TO UPSTREAM AND MINING PROPERTIES.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS FACILITIES,

NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS REACH THE

END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS BEEN

MADE, AS THE INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED. REFER TO NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-43 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH TAX

RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR ALL TAX

JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A FINAL

DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS. THE

ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITY OR

DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AN INCREASE OF $421

MILLION FROM 2006 AND AN INCREASE OF $551 MILLION FROM 2005.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED

WITH WELL WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS

TO WHETHER THE WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. THE EFFECT ON

EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE $1.7 BILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END 2007 IS

UNCERTAIN PENDING FUTURE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NORMAL PROJECT EVALUATION AND ADDITIONAL DRILLING.

REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-47, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUSPENDED WELLS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY

PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER

WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT

ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR

THE FOUR ZONES. FOR THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX

LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO

CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT

WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING

PARTNERS; U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS;

INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE

SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE

EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY

OWNED FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION

MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT NON-CHEVRON SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE

BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO

FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED

ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT

STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON

ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2007 AT APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION FOR ITS

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1.8 BILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION,

CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR

DIVESTED SITES AND THE ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR 2008, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $1.9 BILLION.

THESE CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS AND THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR

EXISTING FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE TO.

PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY

WITH EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY

PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER

DIFFERENT REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING

TO THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY

AND JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH

MATTERS TO CHANGE; AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

FS-18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH

NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

RULES THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER

EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES THAT REQUIRE ...

GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA (THAT) DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY (RESERVES) TO BE

RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS,

I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY

INFORMATION, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-66, FOR THE CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND TO TABLE VII, CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED

FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FROM PROVED RESERVES ON PAGE FS-74 FOR ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE VALUES

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007, WHICH WERE BASED ON YEAR-END PRICES AT THE

TIME. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32, INCLUDES A

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE

TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-20, INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS

UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES. THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO ESTIMATES,

UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32. THE

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED

CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT

WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE

COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS

AND EXPENSE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN

OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE

AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING OPEB OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES.

NOTE 20, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-48, INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OPEB

PLANS AT THE END OF 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE FOR

THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THOSE PERIODS.

PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN OPERATING

EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE YEAR-END 2007 AND 2006 FUNDED STATUS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS AND

OBLIGATIONS, OF EACH OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IS RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET. THE FUNDED STATUS OF OVERFUNDED PENSION PLANS IS RECORDED AS A LONG-TERM ASSET IN

DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS. THE FUNDED STATUS OF UNDERFUNDED OR UNFUNDED PENSION AND OPEB

PLANS IS RECORDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR RESERVES FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. AMOUNTS YET TO

BE RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF PENSION OR OPEB EXPENSE ARE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THE COMPANY USES

A PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED

FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS FACTORS.

ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE

STUDIES. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 67

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8 PERCENT SINCE 2002. FOR THE 10

YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007, ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS AVERAGED 8.7 PERCENT FOR THIS PLAN.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS

OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY

MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET

VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 6.3

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THIS RATE WAS SELECTED

BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE CITIGROUP

PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END 2007. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF 2006 AND 2005

WERE 5.8 PERCENT AND 5.5 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE

PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2007 WAS $620 MILLION. AS AN

INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. PENSION

PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $70

FS-19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MILLION. A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR

ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN

EXPENSE FOR 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION.

AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION OBLIGATION, THUS CHANGING THE

FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE TOTAL PENSION LIABILITY ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, FOR UNDERFUNDED PLANS WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.7

BILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION, A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S.

PENSION PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION, WHICH WOULD HAVE

INCREASED THE PLANS OVER-FUNDED STATUS FROM APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION TO $410 MILLION. OTHER

PLANS WOULD BE LESS UNDERFUNDED AS DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE. THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN

THE WORLDS FINANCIAL MARKETS.

IN 2007, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $317 MILLION (INCLUDING $78 MILLION TO

THE U.S. PLANS). IN 2008, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION.

ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2007 WAS $233 MILLION AND THE TOTAL LIABILITY, WHICH

REFLECTED THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AT THE END OF 2007, WAS $2.9 BILLION.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2007, A

1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED

FOR ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE DECREASED OPEB EXPENSE BY

APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION. A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE SAME PLAN, WHICH

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 87 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE DECREASED TOTAL OPEB

LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2007 BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION.

FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS

LIMITED TO 4 PERCENT PER YEAR. THE CAP BECOMES EFFECTIVE IN THE YEAR OF RETIREMENT FOR

PRE-MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES RETIRING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2005. THE CAP WAS EFFECTIVE AS

OF JANUARY 1, 2005, FOR PRE-MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES RETIRING BEFORE THAT DATE AND ALL

MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES. FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES UNDER AGE 65 WHOSE CLAIMS EXPERIENCES

ARE COMBINED FOR RATING PURPOSES, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES START WITH 8 PERCENT IN

2008 AND GRADUALLY DROP TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2014 AND BEYOND. AS AN INDICATION OF THE HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF

OPEB EXPENSE IN 2007, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN

THE RATES FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 87 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB

LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE INCREASED OPEB EXPENSE $8 MILLION.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE EXPENSE AND THE FUNDED STATUS OF

EACH PLAN AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN BENEFIT PLAN COSTS IN THE YEAR THE DIFFERENCE

OCCURS. INSTEAD, THE DIFFERENCES ARE INCLUDED IN ACTUARIAL GAIN/LOSS AND UNAMORTIZED AMOUNTS HAVE

BEEN REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. REFER

TO NOTE 20, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-48, FOR INFORMATION ON THE $3.3 BILLION OF BEFORE-TAX ACTUARIAL

LOSSES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007; A DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD USED TO AMORTIZE

THOSE COSTS; AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EXPENSE DURING 2008.

IMPAIRMENT

OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY

ASSESSES ITS PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND,

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED

PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF

THE ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL

MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED

PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

NO

MAJOR INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E WERE RECORDED FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2007. AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN

USED IN IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF

THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE

CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS,

WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO

BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS

WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN

THE

FS-20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS

DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME. IN

MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS

SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND

THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT

TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD

AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES THAT NO WRITE-DOWN

IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SIGNIFICANT

DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD OR

CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET

REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY

PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE

ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED

OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A

DECISION IS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS. THAT IS, THE ASSETS WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THEY ARE CLASSIFIED

AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, LESS COSTS TO SELL, ARE LESS THAN THE

ASSETS ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS



PURCHASE-PRICE ALLOCATION

ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

REQUIRES THE ALLOCATION OF THE COMPANYS PURCHASE PRICE TO THE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. THE COMPANY USES ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION

TO MAKE THESE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS, AND FOR MAJOR ACQUISITIONS, MAY HIRE AN INDEPENDENT

APPRAISAL FIRM TO ASSIST IN MAKING FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. IN SOME INSTANCES, ASSUMPTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH AN ASSET MIGHT

HAVE TO BE USED IN DETERMINING ITS FAIR VALUE. ACTUAL TIMING AND AMOUNT OF NET CASH FLOWS FROM

REVENUES AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THAT ASSET OVER TIME MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INITIAL

ESTIMATES, AND IF THE TIMING IS DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY OR IF THE NET CASH FLOWS DECLINE

SIGNIFICANTLY, THE ASSET COULD BECOME IMPAIRED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS

REQUIRED BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH

GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF

AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR

CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY

FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS

FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON

CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION,

THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION, AND

IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS GENERALLY RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES

IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECORDS

THESE LOSSES AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS HANDLING IS FOR INCOME TAX MATTERS, FOR

WHICH BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT (I.E. LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION. FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES, REFER TO NOTE 15

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-43. REFER

ALSO TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS SECTION FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE

THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN

USED IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT

MUST BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FASB STATEMENT NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (FAS 157)

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 157, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2008. THIS STANDARD DEFINES FAIR VALUE,

ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. FAS 157 DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BUT APPLIES TO ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 157 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

FASB

STAFF POSITION FAS NO. 157-1, APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157

TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 13 AND ITS RELATED INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ADDRESS LEASING TRANSACTIONS (FSP

157-1)

IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP 157-1, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2008. THIS FSP EXCLUDES FASB STATEMENT NO. 13, ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES, AND ITS RELATED

INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION.

STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY), UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2009. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES  INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115 (FAS 159)

IN

FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 159, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2008.

THIS STANDARD PERMITS COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE MANY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER

ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE AND REPORT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN EARNINGS. SUCH ACCOUNTING IS OPTIONAL

AND IS GENERALLY TO BE APPLIED INSTRUMENT BY INSTRUMENT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 159 DID NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 141 (REVISED 2007), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (FAS 141-R)

IN DECEMBER

2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 141-R, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS

HAVING AN ACQUISITION DATE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES THE ACQUIRING ENTITY

IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AND ANY

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AT THE ACQUISITION DATE TO BE MEASURED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE

FAIR VALUES. THE STATEMENT REQUIRES ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, AS WELL AS RESTRUCTURING COSTS THE

ACQUIRER EXPECTS TO INCUR FOR

WHICH IT IS NOT OBLIGATED AT ACQUISITION DATE, TO BE RECORDED AGAINST

INCOME RATHER THAN INCLUDED IN PURCHASE-PRICE DETERMINATION. IT ALSO REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF

CONTINGENT ARRANGEMENTS AT THEIR ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUES, WITH SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE GENERALLY REFLECTED IN INCOME.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AN

AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51 (FAS 160)

THE FASB ISSUED FAS 160 IN DECEMBER 2007, WHICH WILL

BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY JANUARY 1, 2009, WITH RETROACTIVE ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENTS

PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING MINORITY INTERESTS. THIS STANDARD WILL

REQUIRE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES HELD BY PARTIES OTHER THAN THE PARENT TO BE PRESENTED

WITHIN THE EQUITY SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION BUT SEPARATE FROM THE

PARENTS EQUITY. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE AMOUNT OF CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

PARENT AND THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST TO BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND PRESENTED ON THE FACE OF THE

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT. CERTAIN CHANGES IN A PARENTS OWNERSHIP INTEREST ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS AND WHEN A SUBSIDIARY IS DECONSOLIDATED, ANY NONCONTROLLING EQUITY

INVESTMENT IN THE FORMER SUBSIDIARY IS TO BE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 160 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE PRESENTATION OF ITS

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT OR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

AND THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAVE FREE AND DIRECT ACCESS TO THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF MANAGEMENT.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A15(F). THE

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE; FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE

OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON

A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE

DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN

THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED

IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS ON APRIL 1, 2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS ON JANUARY 1, 2007.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ON DECEMBER 31,

2006.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT

OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND MARKETING NATURAL GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR.

CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR

INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES SUBJECT THE

COMPANY TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT

IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS

ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH

THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURES AND

CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO

AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO

50 PERCENT OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY

DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY

CURRENTLY IN INCOME.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND THE

AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A

DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF

THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO

RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN

THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT

CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF

OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE

ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANYS

ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE

AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY WHEN APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED

TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY,

GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT

TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN

CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS COMMODITY TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES, GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. INTEREST RATE SWAPS  HEDGING A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT  ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. WHERE

CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, FAIR VALUE RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE AMOUNTS

RECOGNIZED FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE OFFSET ON THE BALANCE

SHEET.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE IN

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET, WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST, USING A

LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET. MATERIALS,

SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED

PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED

PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ARE ALSO CAPITALIZED FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT HAVE

FOUND CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED WHEN

THE DRILLING IS COMPLETED, PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF

RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. ALL OTHER

EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-47, FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, ARE

ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR

A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN

INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION,

DEVELOPMENT AREA OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN THE REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND

CHEMICAL AREAS, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE GENERALLY DONE ON THE BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A

MARKETING AREA OR MARKETING ASSETS BY COUNTRY. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE

EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE

LOWER VALUE.

AS REQUIRED UNDER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143), THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS RECORDED AS AN

ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL

OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A

LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER

ALSO TO NOTE 23, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-57,

RELATING TO AROS.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED.

DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC

VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE

EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR MINING ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD AS THE PROVEN RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE DECLINING-BALANCE

METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED

LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES AND FROM SALES AS OTHER

INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE (INCLUDING

THOSE FOR PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS), REPAIRS AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN

OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE

CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED

BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT

THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT

OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING

UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS OR TO

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR

CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR

CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND

CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE

REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND MINERAL PRODUCING PROPERTIES,

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED

A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS MADE, FOLLOWING FAS

143. REFER TO NOTE 23, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-57, FOR A DISCUSSION OF FAS 143.

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY

FOR ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER PARTIES

ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE

COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE COMPANYS OWN

INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR REIMBURSEMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL, PETROLEUM AND

CHEMICALS PRODUCTS, AND ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, NET OF

ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FROM

PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON THE

BASIS OF THE COMPANYS NET WORKING INTEREST (ENTITLEMENT METHOD). EXCISE, VALUE-ADDED AND SIMILAR

TAXES ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY ON A REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTION BETWEEN A SELLER AND

A CUSTOMER ARE PRESENTED ON A GROSS BASIS. THE ASSOCIATED AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN AS A FOOTNOTE TO THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ON PAGE FS-27. REFER TO NOTE 13, ON PAGE FS-42, FOR A DISCUSSION

OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS.

NOTE 7

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW, NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN MARKET RISK

OCCURRED RELATIVE TO THE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN 2006.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO PRICE VOLATILITY OF

CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY

FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF ITS

ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND

STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY

REFINERIES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY USES INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS TO GOVERN DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE COMPANY

IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY AND ALSO

HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET MARKED-TO-MARKET

EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND

IS A REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO USES OTHER NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES  NET AND DEFERRED

CREDITS AND OTHER NONCURRENT OBLIGATIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED AS EITHER SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES OR PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND

PRODUCTS, WHEREAS TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180

DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND

ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE

COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

FS-36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 7

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  CONTINUED

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED AS OTHER

INCOME.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO

MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE

BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY

REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES, OTHER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES

OR, IF NOT AVAILABLE, THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE

CASH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SETTLED AT YEAR-END.

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $2,132 AND $5,131 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $2,325 AND $5,621 AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. PORTFOLIOS.

EURODOLLAR BONDS, FLOATING-RATE NOTES, TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE THE PRIMARY

INSTRUMENTS HELD. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD CARRYING/FAIR VALUES OF $5,427 AND

$9,200 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. OF

THESE BALANCES, $4,695 AND $8,247 AT THE RESPECTIVE YEAR-ENDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS

THAT HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES UNDER 90 DAYS. THE REMAINDER, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES, HAD

AVERAGE MATURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, RESTRICTED CASH WITH A

CARRYING/FAIR VALUE OF $799 THAT IS RELATED TO CAPITAL-INVESTMENT PROJECTS AT THE COMPANYS

PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI REFINERY AND ANGOLA LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PROJECT WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM

CASH EQUIVALENTS TO A LONG-TERM DEFERRED ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THIS RESTRICTED

CASH WAS INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT THE END OF 2007 AND 2006 WERE NOT

MATERIAL.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE

PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED

INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

RISK. SIMILAR STANDARDS OF DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE

DISPERSED AMONG THE

COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF

ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, REQUIRING

LETTERS OF CREDIT IS A PRINCIPAL METHOD USED TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 8

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

LITIGATION

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO 88 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE MAJORITY

OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE IN

CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGES OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER. CHEVRON HAS AGREED

IN PRINCIPLE TO A TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT OF 60 PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS. THE TERMS OF THIS

AGREEMENT, WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY A NUMBER OF PARTIES, INCLUDING THE COURT, ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND

NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

RESOLUTION OF

REMAINING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE

ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES.

ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE

FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE REFERENCED 60 LAWSUITS DID NOT SET ANY

PRECEDENTS RELATED TO STANDARDS OF LIABILITY TO BE USED TO JUDGE THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMS,

CORRECTIVE MEASURES REQUIRED OR MONETARY DAMAGES TO BE ASSESSED FOR THE REMAINING LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS OR FUTURE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO

PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN

ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED

STATES.

RFG PATENT

FOURTEEN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT BY CONSUMERS OF REFORMULATED GASOLINE

(RFG) ALLEGING THAT UNOCAL MISLED THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD INTO ADOPTING STANDARDS FOR

COMPOSITION OF RFG THAT OVERLAPPED WITH UNOCALS UNDISCLOSED AND PENDING PATENTS. ELEVEN LAWSUITS

WERE CONSOLIDATED IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WHERE A CLASS

ACTION HAS BEEN CERTIFIED, AND THREE WERE CONSOLIDATED IN A STATE COURT ACTION. UNOCAL IS ALLEGED

TO HAVE MONOPOLIZED, CONSPIRED AND ENGAGED IN UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION, RESULTING IN INJURY TO

CONSUMERS OF RFG. PLAINTIFFS IN BOTH CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS SEEK UNSPECIFIED ACTUAL AND PUNITIVE

DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS FEES, AND INTEREST ON BEHALF OF AN ALLEGED CLASS OF CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED

SUMMERTIME RFG IN CALIFORNIA FROM JANUARY 1995 THROUGH AUGUST 2005. THE PARTIES HAVE REACHED A

TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE ABOVE MATTERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR

FINANCIAL POSITION. THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE

CONFIDENTIAL, AND SUBJECT TO FURTHER NEGOTIATION AND APPROVAL, INCLUDING BY THE COURTS.

IN 2007, DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1,000 FROM THE AMOUNT REPORTED IN

2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR PROPERTIES, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1,900 IN 2007. THE INCREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO

ADDITIONAL FOREIGN TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM EARNINGS IN HIGH-TAX-RATE INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS.

THIS INCREASE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY VALUATION ALLOWANCES.

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS

AND TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR WHICH NO BENEFIT IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS

EXIST IN MANY INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. WHEREAS SOME OF THESE TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS DO NOT HAVE

AN EXPIRATION DATE, OTHERS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES FROM 2008 THROUGH 2029. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS OF $3,138 WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN 2008 AND 2017.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, DEFERRED TAXES WERE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

INCOME TAXES ARE NOT ACCRUED FOR UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OR

ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES FOR WHICH NO DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR POSSIBLE

FUTURE REMITTANCES TOTALED $20,557 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS EARNINGS REINVESTED

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS ONGOING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE

AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT MIGHT BE PAYABLE ON THE EVENTUAL REMITTANCE OF EARNINGS THAT ARE INTENDED TO

BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. AT THE END OF 2007, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WERE RECORDED FOR THE

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY NO LONGER INTENDS

TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THE EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT

ADDITIONAL TAXES ON REMITTANCES OF EARNINGS THAT ARE NOT INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

 AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

(FIN 48), WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE UNCERTAIN IN NATURE. THIS

INTERPRETATION WAS INTENDED BY THE STANDARD-SETTERS TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE THAT

EXISTED IN THIS AREA OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

UNDER FIN 48, A COMPANY RECOGNIZES A TAX BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITION ONLY IF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A

LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION BASED SOLELY ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TERM TAX POSITION IN FIN 48 REFERS TO A POSITION IN A

PREVIOUSLY FILED TAX RETURN OR A POSITION EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A FUTURE TAX RETURN THAT IS

REFLECTED IN MEASURING CURRENT OR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL

PERIODS. THE ACCOUNTING INTERPRETATION ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY,

DERECOGNITION THRESHOLDS, FINANCIAL STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION AND DISCLOSURES, RECOGNITION OF

INTEREST AND PENALTIES, AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AT THE DATE OF

ADOPTION. UPON ADOPTION OF FIN 48 ON JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT

ADJUSTMENT THAT REDUCED RETAINED EARNINGS BY $35.

THE ONLY INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR 2007 WAS A REDUCTION IN AN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT

FOR A POSITION PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN BUT SUBSEQUENTLY NOT TAKEN ON A 2006 TAX RETURN.

ALTHOUGH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUAL TAX POSITIONS MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE DURING

2008, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NO CHANGE WILL BE INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT DURING 2008.

APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE $2,199 OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WOULD

HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE OVERALL TAX RATE IF SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED.

TAX POSITIONS FOR CHEVRON AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX AUDITS BY MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS, EXAMINATIONS OF TAX RETURNS FOR

CERTAIN PRIOR TAX YEARS HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN THIS REGARD, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED A FINAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDIT REPORT FOR YEARS 2002 AND 2003 IN MARCH 2007. IN

EARLY 2008, THE COMPANYS 2004 AND 2005 TAX RETURNS WERE UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE. FOR OTHER MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS, THE LATEST YEARS FOR WHICH INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS HAD

BEEN FINALIZED WERE AS FOLLOWS: NIGERIA  1994, ANGOLA  2001 AND SAUDI ARABIA  2003.

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THE COMPANY REPORTS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO LIABILITIES

FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, ACCRUALS OF $198 FOR

ANTICIPATED INTEREST AND PENALTY OBLIGATIONS WERE INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. FOR

THE YEAR 2007, INCOME TAX EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST AND PENALTIES WAS NOT MATERIAL.

ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. FAS 157 DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BUT APPLIES TO ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE UNDER OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THE

JANUARY 1, 2008. THIS FSP EXCLUDES FASB STATEMENT NO. 13, ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES, AND ITS RELATED

INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

THE COMPANY JANUARY 1, 2009, WITH RETROACTIVE ADOPTION OF THE STATEMENTS PRESENTATION AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING MINORITY INTERESTS. THIS STANDARD WILL REQUIRE OWNERSHIP

INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES HELD BY PARTIES OTHER THAN THE PARENT TO BE PRESENTED WITHIN THE EQUITY

SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION BUT SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY.

IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE AMOUNT OF CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PARENT AND THE

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST TO BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND PRESENTED ON THE FACE OF THE CONSOLIDATED

INCOME STATEMENT. CERTAIN CHANGES IN A PARENTS OWNERSHIP INTEREST ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

EQUITY TRANSACTIONS AND WHEN A SUBSIDIARY IS DECONSOLIDATED, ANY NONCONTROLLING EQUITY INVESTMENT

IN THE FORMER SUBSIDIARY IS TO BE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 160 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE PRESENTATION OF ITS CONSOLIDATED INCOME

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY PREFUNDS

DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS AS REQUIRED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS OR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE PREFUNDING

PROVIDES ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL QUALIFIED PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT TYPICALLY FUND U.S.

NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAWS AND REGULATIONS

BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT RETURNS MAY BE

LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA) BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY IN

2008. THESE PROVISIONS CHANGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE INTEREST

RATE TO BE USED IN CALCULATING LUMP-SUM BENEFITS. THIS CHANGE IN METHODOLOGY INCREASED THE LUMP-SUM

INTEREST RATE AND LOWERED THE COMPANYS PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY ABOUT $300 AT DECEMBER 31,

2007. THE EFFECT OF THE INTEREST RATE CHANGE ON PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS DURING 2008 IS EXPECTED

TO BE

DE MINIMIS

, AS THE COMPANYS FUNDED PENSION PLANS ARE CONSIDERED WELL-FUNDED UNDER PPA

PROVISIONS.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS, AS

WELL AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS ARE UNFUNDED,

AND THE COMPANY AND RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES IN

THE COMPANYS MAIN U.S. MEDICAL PLAN IS SECONDARY TO MEDICARE (INCLUDING PART D) AND THE INCREASE

TO THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 4 PERCENT PER

YEAR. CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF

NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, FOR

THE COMPANYS U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE BEING

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER APPROXIMATELY 10, 13 AND 10 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE

AMORTIZATION PERIODS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO

RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLANS. THESE LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED 10 PERCENT

OF THE HIGHER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. THE

AMOUNT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION IS DETERMINED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $59, $80 AND $39 WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES AN ADDITIONAL $78 WILL BE RECOGNIZED FROM

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS DURING 2008 RELATED TO LUMP-SUM SETTLEMENT COSTS FROM U.S.

PENSION PLANS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR RECOGNIZING PRIOR SERVICE COSTS

(CREDITS) RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS

APPROXIMATELY NINE AND 11 YEARS FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND SIX

YEARS FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES PRIOR SERVICE

(CREDITS) COSTS OF $(7), $25 AND $(81) WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

LOSS FOR U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY.

2

THE 2006 U.S. DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS REMEASUREMENT ON JULY 1, 2006, DUE TO PLAN COMBINATIONS AND CHANGES, PRIMARILY SEVERAL

UNOCAL PLANS INTO RELATED CHEVRON PLANS.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS

IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE

PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET-CLASS

RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY

STUDIES, AND THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002 FOR

U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 67 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8 PERCENT.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION

EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE,

AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM

DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS,

MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 6.3

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THIS RATE WAS BASED ON A

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT

YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END 2007. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF 2006 AND 2005 WERE 5.8 PERCENT

AND 5.5 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES START WITH 8 PERCENT IN 2008 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2014 AND

BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES STARTED

WITH 9 PERCENT IN 2007 AND GRADUALLY DECLINED TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2011 AND BEYOND. IN BOTH

MEASUREMENTS, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS WAS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR

RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE IMPACT IS MITIGATED BY THE 4 PERCENT CAP ON THE COMPANYS MEDICAL

CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PLAN. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE IN THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

THE PLANS INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY

BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE CHEVRON BOARD OF DIRECTORS

HAS APPROVED THE FOLLOWING PERCENTAGE ASSET-ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES 4070, FIXED INCOME/CASH

2060, REAL ESTATE 015 AND OTHER 05. THE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ALSO HAVE

ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES THAT VARY BY EACH PLAN. ACTUAL ASSET

ALLOCATION WITHIN APPROVED RANGES IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

AND CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET CATEGORY RISK.

EQUITIES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNT OF $36 AND $17 AT DECEMBER

31, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE OTHER ASSET CATEGORY INCLUDES MINIMAL INVESTMENTS IN

PRIVATE-EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

IN 2007, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $78 AND $239 TO ITS U.S.

AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2008, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $300 AND $200 TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL

CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF CHEVRON AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES

PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP).

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE FUNDED

EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE RELEASE OF

COMMON STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

(LESOP), WHICH FOLLOWS.

TOTAL COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE ESIP WERE $206, $169 AND $145

IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF SHARES RELEASED FROM

THE LESOP TOTALING

$33, $6 AND $4 IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING AMOUNTS,

TOTALING $173, $163 AND $141 IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENT OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRON ESIP IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP).

IN 1989, CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LESOP AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES PARTIAL

PREFUNDING OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

AS PERMITTED BY AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION

93-6,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO CONTINUE

ITS PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3,

ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR

CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

, AND SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS OF THE EITF OF THE FASB. THE DEBT

OF THE LESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLAN TRUST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS DIVIDENDS

RECEIVED AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE. INTEREST ACCRUED ON LESOP DEBT IS RECORDED AS

INTEREST EXPENSE. DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF RETAINED EARNINGS.

ALL LESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE COMPUTATIONS.

TOTAL (CREDITS) EXPENSES RECORDED FOR THE LESOP WERE $(1), $(1) AND $94 IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $16, $17 AND $18 OF INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO LESOP DEBT AND A (CREDIT)

CHARGE TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $(17), $(18) AND $76.

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES, $8, $59 AND $55 WERE USED IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. THE AMOUNT IN 2006 INCLUDED $28 OF LESOP DEBT SERVICE THAT WAS

SCHEDULED FOR PAYMENT ON THE FIRST BUSINESS DAY OF JANUARY 2007 AND WAS PAID IN LATE DECEMBER 2006.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2005 OF $98 TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE IN EXCESS

OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY THE LESOP. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED IN 2007 OR 2006 AS DIVIDENDS

RECEIVED BY THE LESOP WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE.

SHARES HELD IN THE LESOP ARE

RELEASED AND ALLOCATED TO THE ACCOUNTS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS BASED ON DEBT SERVICE DEEMED TO BE PAID

IN THE YEAR IN PROPORTION TO THE TOTAL OF CURRENT YEAR AND REMAINING DEBT SERVICE. LESOP SHARES AS OF

BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS

TEXACO ESTABLISHED A BENEFIT PLAN TRUST FOR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF

ITS BENEFIT PLANS. AT YEAR-END 2007, THE TRUST CONTAINED 14.2 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRON TREASURY

STOCK. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS. THE TRUST

WILL SELL THE SHARES OR USE THE DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT

THE COMPANY DOES NOT PAY SUCH BENEFITS. THE TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS

INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUSTS BENEFICIARIES. THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED

OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE PURPOSES UNTIL DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD BY THE TRUST IN PAYMENT OF

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

UNOCAL ESTABLISHED VARIOUS GRANTOR TRUSTS TO FUND OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS,

INCLUDING THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

2006, TRUST ASSETS OF $69 AND $98, RESPECTIVELY, WERE INVESTED PRIMARILY IN INTEREST-EARNING

ACCOUNTS.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

CHEVRON HAS TWO INCENTIVE PLANS, THE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN (MIP) AND

THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), FOR OFFICERS AND OTHER REGULAR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. MIP IS AN ANNUAL

CASH INCENTIVE PLAN THAT LINKS AWARDS TO PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CASH AWARDS MAY

BE DEFERRED BY THE RECIPIENTS BY CONVERSION TO STOCK UNITS OR OTHER INVESTMENT FUND ALTERNATIVES.

AGGREGATE CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR MIP WERE $184, $180 AND $155 IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

AWARDS UNDER LTIP CONSIST OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE

21 BELOW.

THROUGH 2007 THE COMPANY HAD A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDED ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, OTHER THAN THOSE COVERED

BY MIP AND LTIP, WITH AN ANNUAL CASH BONUS IF THE COMPANY ACHIEVES CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND SAFETY

GOALS. CHARGES FOR THE PROGRAM WERE $431, $329 AND $324 IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

EFFECTIVE IN 2008, THIS PROGRAM WAS MODIFIED TO MIRROR THE DESIGN OF MIP AND BOTH WERE COMBINED

INTO A SINGLE PLAN NAMED THE CHEVRON INCENTIVE PLAN (CIP).

NOTE 21

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

STATEMENT NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R)

,

FOR ITS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE

COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR THESE PLANS UNDER THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

, AND RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD AND, ACCORDINGLY, RESULTS FOR

PRIOR PERIODS WERE

NOT RESTATED. REFER TO NOTE 1, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32, FOR THE PRO FORMA EFFECT

ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR-VALUE RECOGNITION

PROVISIONS OF FAS 123R FOR THE FULL YEAR 2005.

FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS WAS $146 ($95 AFTER TAX), $125 ($81

AFTER TAX) AND $65 ($42 AFTER TAX), RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS, PERFORMANCE UNITS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WAS $205 ($133 AFTER TAX), $113

($73 AFTER TAX) AND $59 ($39 AFTER TAX) FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WERE NO

SIGNIFICANT STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS THAT WERE CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006.

CASH RECEIVED IN PAYMENT FOR OPTION EXERCISES UNDER ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR 2007,

2006 AND 2005 WAS $445, $444 AND $297, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS REALIZED FOR THE TAX

DEDUCTIONS FROM OPTION EXERCISES WERE $94, $91 AND $71 FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH PAID TO SETTLE PERFORMANCE UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS WAS $88, $68 AND $110 FOR 2007,

2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PAID IN 2005 INCLUDED $73 FOR UNOCAL AWARDS PAID UNDER

CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PLAN PROVISIONS.

THE COMPANY PRESENTS THE TAX BENEFITS OF DEDUCTIONS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AS FINANCING

CASH INFLOWS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. IN 2006, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED THE

TRANSITION METHOD OF FASB STAFF POSITION FAS 123R-3,

TRANSITION ELECTION RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR

THE TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS

, FOR CALCULATING THE BEGINNING BALANCE OF THE POOL OF

EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND DETERMINING THE SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON THE

POOL OF EMPLOYEE AWARDS THAT WERE FULLY VESTED AND OUTSTANDING UPON THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R. THE

COMPANYS REPORTED TAX EXPENSE FOR THE PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 123R WAS NOT

AFFECTED BY THIS ELECTION. REFER TO NOTE 3, ON PAGE FS-35, FOR INFORMATION ON EXCESS TAX

BENEFITS REPORTED ON THE COMPANYS STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

CHEVRON LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)

AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND NONSTOCK GRANTS. FROM APRIL 2004 THROUGH JANUARY 2014, NO MORE THAN 160

MILLION SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP, AND NO MORE THAN 64 MILLION OF THOSE SHARES MAY BE IN

A FORM OTHER THAN A STOCK OPTION, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT OR AWARD REQUIRING FULL PAYMENT FOR

SHARES BY THE AWARD RECIPIENT.

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP EXTEND FOR 10 YEARS FROM GRANT

TEXACO STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (TEXACO SIP)

ON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF TEXACO IN OCTOBER

2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRON OPTIONS. THESE

OPTIONS, WHICH HAVE 10-YEAR CONTRACTUAL LIVES EXTENDING INTO 2011, RETAINED A PROVISION FOR BEING

RESTORED. THIS PROVISION ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISES A STOCK OPTION TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS

EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WHO HAS SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING

OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE

RESTORED OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE

IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED OPTION IS GRANTED. BEGINNING IN

2007, RESTORED OPTIONS WERE GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP. NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE

FORMER TEXACO PLANS.

UNOCAL SHARE-BASED PLANS (UNOCAL PLANS)

WHEN CHEVRON ACQUIRED UNOCAL IN AUGUST 2005, OUTSTANDING

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS UNOCAL PLANS WERE EXCHANGED FOR

FULLY VESTED CHEVRON OPTIONS AND APPRECIATION RIGHTS. THESE AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME PROVISIONS AS

THE ORIGINAL UNOCAL PLANS. AWARDS ISSUED PRIOR TO 2004 GENERALLY MAY BE EXERCISED FOR UP TO THREE

YEARS AFTER TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT (DEPENDING UPON THE TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AWARD AGREEMENTS)

OR THE ORIGINAL EXPIRATION DATE, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER. AWARDS ISSUED SINCE 2004 GENERALLY REMAINED

EXERCISABLE UNTIL THE END OF THE NORMAL OPTION TERM IF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OCCURRED PRIOR TO

AUGUST 10, 2007. OTHER AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE UNOCAL PLANS, INCLUDING RESTRICTED STOCK, STOCK

UNITS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES, BECAME VESTED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE, AND

SHARES OR CASH WERE ISSUED TO RECIPIENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PROVISIONS OF THE

PLANS.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  CONTINUED

PERIOD FOR RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH VESTING PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANYS

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS FOR AWARDS ISSUED AFTER ADOPTION OF FAS 123R. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, THERE WAS $160 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED BEFORE-TAX COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO NONVESTED

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS GRANTED OR RESTORED UNDER THE PLANS. THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO

BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF TWO YEARS.

AT JANUARY 1, 2007, THE NUMBER OF LTIP PERFORMANCE UNITS OUTSTANDING WAS EQUIVALENT TO 2,110,196

SHARES. DURING 2007, 931,200 UNITS WERE GRANTED, 784,364 UNITS VESTED WITH CASH PROCEEDS

DISTRIBUTED TO RECIPIENTS AND 32,017 UNITS WERE FORFEITED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, UNITS OUTSTANDING

WERE 2,225,015, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS $205. IN

ADDITION, OUTSTANDING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS

LTIP AND FORMER TEXACO AND UNOCAL PROGRAMS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION EQUIVALENT SHARES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007. A LIABILITY OF $38 WAS RECORDED FOR THESE AWARDS.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN ADDITION TO THE PLANS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON GRANTED ALL

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTIONS OR EQUIVALENTS IN 1998. THE OPTIONS VESTED IN FEBRUARY 2000 AND

EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2008. A TOTAL OF 9,641,600 OPTIONS WERE AWARDED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$38.16 PER SHARE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS ESTIMATED AT $9.54 USING

THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL FOR THE PRECEDING 10 YEARS. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MODEL, BASED ON A

10-YEAR AVERAGE, WERE: A RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 7 PERCENT, A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 4.2 PERCENT, AN

EXPECTED LIFE OF SEVEN YEARS AND A VOLATILITY OF 24.7 PERCENT.

AT JANUARY 1, 2007, THE NUMBER OF BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING WAS 1,306,059.

DURING 2007, EXERCISES OF 637,044 SHARES AND FORFEITURES OF 16,300 SHARES REDUCED OUTSTANDING

OPTIONS TO 652,715. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THESE INSTRUMENTS HAD AN AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF

$36 AND THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THESE OPTIONS WAS 0.1 YEAR. THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF

THESE OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WAS $30, $10 AND $9, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED. REFER TO NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-43 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH TAX

RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR ALL TAX

JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT

SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

GUARANTEES

THE COMPANYS GUARANTEE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER

A TERMINAL USE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY A COMPANY AFFILIATE. THE TERMINAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

OPERATIONAL BY 2012. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE

AMOUNT WILL REDUCE OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY OF ANY

AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON CARRIES NO LIABILITY FOR ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THIS

GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE

INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO

MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300. THROUGH THE END OF 2007, THE COMPANY PAID $48 UNDER THESE

INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES RELATED

TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND NO

LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO

MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED ANY

LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL

AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES

RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES.

THE ACQUIRER SHARES IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF $200,

WHICH HAD NOT BEEN REACHED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  CONTINUED

SECURITIZATION

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS U.S. PROPRIETARY CONSUMER CREDIT

CARD BUSINESS AND RELATED RECEIVABLES. THIS TRANSACTION INCLUDED TERMINATING THE QUALIFYING SPECIAL

PURPOSE ENTITY (SPE) THAT WAS USED TO SECURITIZE ASSOCIATED RETAIL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

THROUGH THE USE OF ANOTHER QUALIFYING SPE, THE COMPANY HAD $675 OF SECURITIZED TRADE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE RELATED TO ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. THIS ARRANGEMENT HAS THE

EFFECT OF ACCELERATING CHEVRONS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. CHEVRONS TOTAL ESTIMATED

FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THIS SECURITIZATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS $65. IN THE EVENT THAT THE

SPE EXPERIENCES MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD

HAVE NO ADDITIONAL LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN THIS SECURITIZATION.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY

PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS, UTILITIES, AND

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE

AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE: 2008 

$4,700; 2009  $3,300; 2010  $3,300; 2011  $1,900; 2012  $1,300; 2013 AND AFTER  $4,900. A

PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SHARED WITH PROJECT PARTNERS. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER

THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $3,700 IN 2007, $3,000 IN 2006 AND $2,100 IN 2005.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF $204 RELATED TO MINORITY INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARY

COMPANIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE,

BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL

FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS

THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE

ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL

PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

CHEVRONS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WAS $1,539. INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE WERE

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OF 240 SITES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR

ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2007 WAS $123.

THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON

TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2007 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,416,

$864 RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 2,000 SITES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS) AND

PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $552 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN THE INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM

($146), UPSTREAM ($267), CHEMICALS ($105) AND OTHER ($34). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO

REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE

OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE

CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL;

GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE

CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH

IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR LOCAL

REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2007 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS MATERIAL

TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE RECORDED,

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY

DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR

PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE

ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO

EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK HILLS,

CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES.

FOR THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT

APPROXIMATELY $200, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED

AT ABOUT $150. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE

UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS;

U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS.

THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY

PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE,

ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS

AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY

RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 23

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (ARO) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT (FASB) NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143).

THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO THAT IS RECORDED WHEN

THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE

LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THESE ASSETS

REQUIRE RECOGNITION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING

ASSET FOR AN ARO, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT LIABILITY

AND DEPRECIATION OF THE ASSET, AND

(3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND DISCOUNT RATES. IN 2005, THE FASB ISSUED

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 47,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  AN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 143

(FIN 47), WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON DECEMBER

31, 2005. FIN 47 CLARIFIES THAT THE PHRASE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION, AS USED IN

FAS 143, REFERS TO A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY FOR WHICH THE TIMING

AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT ARE CONDITIONAL ON A FUTURE EVENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE WITHIN THE

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. THE OBLIGATION TO PERFORM THE ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL

EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF A CONDITIONAL ARO SHOULD BE FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF

THE LIABILITY WHEN

SUFFICIENT INFORMATION EXISTS. FAS 143 ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN SOME CASES, SUFFICIENT INFORMATION MAY

NOT BE AVAILABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ARO. FIN 47 ALSO CLARIFIES WHEN AN

ENTITY WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ARO. IN

ADOPTING FIN 47, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES FOR CONDITIONAL AROS DUE

TO AN INABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR

INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES.

FAS 143 AND FIN 47 PRIMARILY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCING ASSETS. NO SIGNIFICANT AROS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE REFINING,

MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED, AS

INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED

ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION.

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE

CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM

ENGINEERS, THE WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS. THE

SYSTEM CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS AT THE TIME OF

REPORTING  THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND THREE NONCOMMERCIAL. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL CLASSIFICATION

ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES OF UNPROVED: PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE NONCOMMERCIAL

CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE

WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING

ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS. NET PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY

OTHERS AND REFLECT CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE

ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

ARE THE QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND

ENGINEERS. AS PART OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS A RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE RESERVES MANAGER,

WHO IS A MEMBER OF A CORPORATE DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL OF THE RAC

MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN SEC GUIDELINES FOR PROVED RESERVES CLASSIFICATION. THE RAC COORDINATES

ITS ACTIVITIES THROUGH TWO OPERATING COMPANY-LEVEL RESERVES MANAGERS. THESE TWO RESERVES MANAGERS

ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE RAC SO AS TO PRESERVE THE CORPORATE-LEVEL INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OF THE

BUSINESS UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVE CHANGES; CONFIRM THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND

APPROPRIATE STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH

PROVIDES STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON

RESERVES.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION 

CONTINUED

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM

BUSINESS UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR

CHANGES ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND PLANNING COMMITTEE AND THE EXECUTIVE

COMMITTEE, WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE

COMPANYS ANNUAL RESERVE ACTIVITY IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IF MAJOR CHANGES TO

RESERVES WERE TO OCCUR BETWEEN THE ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE

BOARD.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE THE

LARGEST PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED-RESERVE

RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL.

RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS WERE 7.9 BILLION BARRELS. (REFER TO THE

TERM RESERVES ON PAGE E-24 FOR

THE DEFINITION OF OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.) APPROXIMATELY 28 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RESERVES WERE IN

THE UNITED STATES. FOR THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUITY AFFILIATES, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES WERE

2.9 BILLION BARRELS, 84 PERCENT OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN

TCO.

ASIDE FROM THE TCO OPERATIONS, NO SINGLE PROPERTY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. FEWER THAN 20 OTHER INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES IN THE

COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS EACH CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT AND 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 37 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PROVED RESERVES TOTAL. THESE PROPERTIES WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED, LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES, SOUTH AMERICA, WEST AFRICA AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

IN THE UNITED STATES, TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2007 WERE 2.2 BILLION BARRELS.

OF THIS AMOUNT, 41 PERCENT, 21 PERCENT AND 38 PERCENT WERE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, THE GULF OF

MEXICO AND OTHER U.S. AREAS, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CALIFORNIA, LIQUIDS RESERVES REPRESENTED 94 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH MOST CLASSIFIED AS

HEAVY OIL. BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE NEED TO EMPLOY ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS,

THE PRODUCING OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE IN NATURE. MOST OF THE COMPANYS HEAVY-OIL FIELDS IN

CALIFORNIA EMPLOY A CONTINUOUS STEAMFLOODING PROCESS.

IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION, LIQUIDS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 66 PERCENT OF TOTAL

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE AND, AS A RESULT, ARE ALSO

CAPITAL INTENSIVE. COSTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN WELLS, PRODUCTION PLATFORMS AND OTHER FACILITIES,

SUCH AS GATHERING LINES AND STORAGE FACILITIES.

IN OTHER U.S. AREAS, THE RESERVES WERE SPLIT ABOUT EQUALLY BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS.

FOR PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, INCLUDING WATERFLOOD

AND CO

2

INJECTION.

THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES, FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2007, IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EVENTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE COMPANYS CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT PERMITTING,

PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CHANGES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS,

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND CHANGES THERETO FOR THE

YEARS 2005, 2006 AND 2007 ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLES ON PAGES FS-68 AND FS-70.

DEVELOPED RESERVES AND (162) MILLION BARRELS OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

299 MILLION BARRELS OF DEVELOPED RESERVES AND (312) MILLION BARRELS OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

5

DURING 2007, THE PERCENTAGES OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, TRANSFERRED

TO DEVELOPED RESERVES WERE 8 PERCENT AND 24 PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND AFFILIATED

COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES, CHEVRON HAS SIGNIFICANT

INTERESTS IN PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATHABASCA PROJECT. FOR

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, CHEVRON VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SEC REGULATIONS DEFINE THESE RESERVES AS MINING-RELATED

AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES. NET PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES WERE 436 MILLION

BARRELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE OIL SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE STANDARDIZED

MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES, WHICH IS FOUND

ON PAGE FS-73.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF LIQUIDS PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2005 THROUGH

2007 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2005, NET REVISIONS REDUCED RESERVES BY 239 MILLION

AND 24 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE NET DECREASE WAS 199 MILLION BARRELS IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREAS AND

40 MILLION BARRELS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE LARGEST DOWNWARD NET REVISIONS INTERNATIONALLY WERE

108 MILLION BARRELS IN INDONESIA AND

53 MILLION BARRELS IN KAZAKHSTAN, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY CONTRACTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 40

MILLION-BARREL REDUCTION WAS ACROSS MANY FIELDS IN EACH OF THE GEOGRAPHIC SECTIONS. MOST OF THE

DOWNWARD REVISION FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES WAS A 19 MILLION-BARREL REDUCTION IN HAMACA,

ATTRIBUTABLE TO REVISED GOVERNMENT ROYALTY PROVISIONS. FOR TCO, THE DOWNWARD EFFECT OF HIGHER

YEAR-END PRICES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION 

CONTINUED

IN 2006, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 39 MILLION AND 84 MILLION BARRELS FOR

WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES, RESPECTIVELY. INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR THE NET INCREASE OF 39 MILLION BARRELS. THE LARGEST UPWARD NET REVISIONS

WERE 61 MILLION BARRELS IN INDONESIA AND 27 MILLION BARRELS IN THAILAND. IN INDONESIA, THE INCREASE

WAS THE RESULT OF INFILL DRILLING AND IMPROVED STEAMFLOOD PERFORMANCE. THE UPWARD REVISION IN

THAILAND REFLECTED ADDITIONAL DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY DURING THE YEAR. THESE UPWARD

REVISIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA AND THE UNITED

KINGDOM, WHICH DECREASED RESERVES BY 43 MILLION BARRELS AND BY 32 MILLION BARRELS, RESPECTIVELY.

MOST OF THE UPWARD REVISION FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES WAS RELATED TO A 60 MILLION-BARREL INCREASE IN

TCO AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

IN 2007, NET REVISIONS DECREASED RESERVES BY 146 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES AND INCREASED RESERVES BY 103 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, THE LARGEST DOWNWARD NET REVISIONS WERE 89 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA AND 66 MILLION

BARRELS IN INDONESIA. IN AFRICA, THE DECREASE WAS MAINLY BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE DATA FOR FIELDS

IN NIGERIA AND THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES IN ANGOLA AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO. IN

INDONESIA, THE DECLINE ALSO REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES. HIGHER PRICES ALSO

RESULTED IN DOWNWARD REVISIONS IN KARACHAGANAK AND AZERBAIJAN. FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES, MOST OF THE

UPWARD REVISION WAS RELATED TO A 92 MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR THE TENGIZ FIELD IN TCO AND AN 11

MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR PETROBOSCAN IN VENEZUELA, BOTH AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE. AT TCO, THE UPWARD REVISION WAS TEMPERED BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF HIGHER YEAR-END

PRICES.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN 2005, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS

VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 203 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INTERNATIONAL AREAS ACCOUNTED

FOR 142 MILLION BARRELS OF THE INCREASE. INDONESIA ADDED 42 MILLION BARRELS DUE TO IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE. RESERVE ADDITIONS OF 67 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN ANGOLA AND

RESULTED FROM INFILL DRILLING, WELLS WORKOVERS AND SECONDARY RECOVERY FROM GAS INJECTION. ADDITIONS

OF 29 MILLION BARRELS IN THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREA WERE MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED

WATERFLOOD PERFORMANCE OFFSHORE EASTERN CANADA. AN INCREASE OF 61 MILLION BARRELS OCCURRED IN THE

UNITED STATES, PRIMARILY IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON A LARGE HEAVY OIL FIELD UNDER

THERMAL RECOVERY.

IN 2006, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 83 MILLION BARRELS FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. RESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED 52 MILLION BARRELS, WITH CALIFORNIA

REPRESENTING 49 MILLION BARRELS OF THE TOTAL INCREASE DUE TO STEAMFLOOD EXPANSION AND REVISED

MODELING ACTIVITIES. INTERNATIONALLY, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED RESERVES BY 31 MILLION BARRELS,

WITH NO SINGLE COUNTRY ACCOUNTING FOR AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 10 MILLION BARRELS.

IN 2007, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 20 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE. NO

ADDITION WAS INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2005, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 184 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. THE LARGEST

INCREASE WAS 49 MILLION BARRELS IN NIGERIA, REFLECTING NEW DEVELOPMENT DRILLING, INCLUDING IN THE

AGBAMI FIELD, AMONG OTHERS. NEW FIELD DEVELOPMENTS IN BRAZIL CONTRIBUTED ANOTHER 41 MILLION BARRELS

OF DISCOVERIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 44 MILLION-BARREL ADDITION WAS ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH THE

INITIAL BOOKING OF RESERVES FOR THE BLIND FAITH FIELD IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO.

IN 2006, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 107 MILLION BARRELS

FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. RESERVES IN NIGERIA INCREASED BY 27 MILLION BARRELS DUE IN PART TO THE

INITIAL BOOKING OF RESERVES FOR THE APARO FIELD. ADDITIONAL DRILLING ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTED 19

MILLION BARRELS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 14 MILLION BARRELS IN ARGENTINA. IN THE UNITED STATES,

THE GULF OF MEXICO ADDED 25 MILLION BARRELS, MAINLY THE RESULT OF THE INITIAL BOOKING OF THE GREAT

WHITE FIELD IN THE DEEPWATER PERDIDO FOLD BELT AREA.

IN 2007, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 60 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE.

THE LARGEST ADDITIONS WERE 25 MILLION BARRELS IN THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO, MAINLY FOR THE DEEPWATER

TAHITI AND MAD DOG FIELDS.

PURCHASES

IN 2005, THE ACQUISITION OF 572 MILLION BARRELS OF

LIQUIDS RELATED SOLELY TO THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL IN AUGUST. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE 376

MILLION BARRELS ACQUIRED IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREAS WERE REPRESENTED BY VOLUMES IN AZERBAIJAN AND

THAILAND. MOST VOLUMES ACQUIRED IN THE UNITED STATES WERE IN TEXAS AND ALASKA.

IN 2006, ACQUISITIONS INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 21 MILLION BARRELS FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND 119 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

THE AMOUNT WAS MAINLY THE RESULT OF NEW AGREEMENTS IN NIGERIA, WHICH ADDED 13 MILLION BARRELS OF

RESERVES. THE OTHER-EQUITY-AFFILIATES QUANTITY REFLECTS THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSION OF BOSCAN AND

LL-652 OPERATIONS TO JOINT STOCK COMPANIES IN VENEZUELA.

IN 2007, ACQUISITIONS OF 316 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF

A NEW HAMACA EQUITY AFFILIATE IN VENEZUELA.

SALES

IN 2005, SALES OF 58 MILLION BARRELS IN THE OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AREA RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS ONSHORE IN CANADA.

IN 2006, SALES DECREASED RESERVES BY 15 MILLION BARRELS DUE TO THE CONVERSION OF THE LL-652

RISKED SERVICE AGREEMENT TO A JOINT STOCK COMPANY IN VENEZUELA.

IN 2007, AFFILIATED COMPANY SALES OF 432 MILLION BARRELS RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF A

HAMACA EQUITY AFFILIATE IN VENEZUELA.

TO DEVELOPED RESERVES WERE 10 PERCENT AND 27 PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND AFFILIATED

COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF NATURAL GAS PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2005

THROUGH 2007 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2005, RESERVES WERE REVISED DOWNWARD BY 14 BILLION

CUBIC FEET (BCF) FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND 498 BCF FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, NEGATIVE REVISIONS WERE 428 BCF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. MOST OF THE DECREASE WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE FIELD IN KAZAKHSTAN, DUE MAINLY TO THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON

VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF THE PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT. RESERVES ADDITIONS FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES TOTALED 211 BCF AND 243 BCF IN AFRICA AND OTHER,

RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF THE AFRICAN REGION CHANGES WERE IN ANGOLA, DUE TO A REVISED FORECAST OF FUEL GAS USAGE,

AND IN NIGERIA, FROM IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE. THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY COMPRESSION IN

COLOMBIA ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE INCREASE IN THE OTHER REGION. REVISIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

DECREASED RESERVES BY 9 BCF, AS NOMINAL INCREASES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WERE MORE THAN OFFSET

BY DECREASES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER REGION. FOR THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, A

REDUCTION OF 547 BCF REFLECTS THE UPDATED FORECAST OF FUTURE ROYALTIES PAYABLE AND YEAR-END PRICE

EFFECTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VOLUMES ADDED AS A RESULT OF AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION 

CONTINUED

IN 2006, REVISIONS ACCOUNTED FOR A NET INCREASE OF 481 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

26 BCF FOR AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET INCREASES OF 511 BCF INTERNATIONALLY WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 30 BCF DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE UNITED STATES. DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES ADDED 337 BCF OF RESERVES IN THAILAND, WHILE KAZAKHSTAN ADDED 200 BCF, LARGELY DUE TO

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO INCREASED 185 BCF, ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE AND A NEW CONTRACT FOR SALES OF NATURAL GAS. THESE ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF 224 BCF IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 130 BCF IN AUSTRALIA DUE TO DRILLING

RESULTS AND RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE. U.S. OTHER HAD A DOWNWARD REVISION OF 102 BCF DUE TO RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UPWARD REVISIONS OF 72 BCF IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND

CALIFORNIA RELATED TO RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING. TCO HAD AN UPWARD REVISION OF

26 BCF ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND UPDATED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

IN 2007, REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY A NET 395 BCF AND

INCREASED RESERVES FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES BY A NET 73 BCF. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET

INCREASES WERE 209 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES AND 186 BCF INTERNATIONALLY. IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE FOR MANY FIELDS IN THE UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTED 130 BCF IN THE OTHER REGION, 40 BCF

IN CALIFORNIA AND 39 BCF IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. DRILLING ACTIVITIES ADDED 360 BCF IN THAILAND AND

IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE ADDED 188 BCF IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. THESE ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF 185 BCF IN AUSTRALIA DUE TO DRILLING RESULTS AND 136 BCF IN NIGERIA

DUE TO FIELD PERFORMANCE. NEGATIVE REVISIONS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES WERE RECORDED IN

AZERBAIJAN AND KAZAKHSTAN. TCO HAD AN UPWARD REVISION OF 75 BCF ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THIS UPWARD REVISION WAS NET OF A NEGATIVE IMPACT DUE TO

HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2005, CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

INCREASED RESERVES BY 370 BCF, INCLUDING 167 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES AND 118 BCF IN THE

ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. IN THE UNITED STATES, 99 BCF WAS ADDED IN THE OTHER REGION AND 68 BCF IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO, PRIMARILY DUE TO DRILLING ACTIVITIES. THE ADDITION IN ASIA-PACIFIC RESULTED

PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED DRILLING IN KAZAKHSTAN.

IN 2006, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF 799 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, REFLECTING A 531 BCF INCREASE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

AND A U.S. INCREASE OF 268 BCF.

BANGLADESH ADDED 451 BCF, THE RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND FIELD EXTENSIONS, AND THAILAND

ADDED 59 BCF, THE RESULT OF DRILLING ACTIVITIES. U.S. OTHER CONTRIBUTED 157 BCF, APPROXIMATELY

HALF OF WHICH WAS RELATED TO SOUTH TEXAS AND THE PICEANCE BASIN, AND

THE GULF OF MEXICO ADDED 111

BCF, PARTLY DUE TO THE INITIAL BOOKING OF RESERVES AT THE GREAT WHITE FIELD IN THE DEEPWATER

PERDIDO FOLD BELT AREA.

IN 2007, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF 518 BCF WORLDWIDE. THE

LARGEST ADDITION WAS 330 BCF IN BANGLADESH, THE RESULT OF DRILLING ACTIVITIES. OTHER ADDITIONS WERE

NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES

IN 2005, ALL EXCEPT 7 BCF OF THE 5,656 BCF TOTAL

PURCHASES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION. INTERNATIONAL RESERVE ACQUISITIONS WERE

4,488 BCF, WITH THAILAND ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT HALF THE VOLUMES. OTHER SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES WERE

ADDED IN BANGLADESH AND MYANMAR.

IN 2006, PURCHASES OF NATURAL GAS RESERVES WERE 35 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, ABOUT

EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE COMPANYS UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AFFILIATED

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 69. ESTIMATED

FUTURE CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO

YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE LIMITED TO THOSE

PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND

PRODUCE YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF

YEAR-END ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END STATUTORY TAX RATES.

THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PRETAX

NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE

CALCULATED

USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN

FUTURE EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES

ARE IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND

POSSIBLE RESERVES, WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE

ARBITRARY VALUATION PRESCRIBED UNDER FAS 69 REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND

SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL

AND GAS RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED MEASURE NET CASH FLOWS REFERS TO THE
