cautionary
statement relevant to forward-looking information
for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the
private securities litigation reform act of 1995
this annual report on
form10-k
of chevron corporation contains forward-looking statements
relating to chevrons operations that are based on
managements current expectations, estimates and
projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
energy-related industries. words such as
anticipates, expects,
intends, plans, targets,
projects, believes, seeks,
schedules, estimates,
budgets and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. these statements are
not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
the companys control and are difficult to predict.
therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
statements. the reader should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. unless legally required, chevron undertakes no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.
among the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
are crude-oil and natural-gas prices; refining, marketing and
chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing
of exploration expenses; timing of crude-oil liftings; the
competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product
substitutes; technological developments; the results of
operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the
inability or failure of the companys joint-venture
partners to fund their share of operations and development
activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net
production from existing and future crude-oil and natural-gas
development projects; potential delays in the development,
construction or
start-up of
planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of
the companys net production or manufacturing facilities or
delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents,
political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude-oil
production quotas that might be imposed by opec (organization of
petroleum exporting countries); the potential liability for
remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment
or product changes under existing or future environmental
statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability
resulting from pending or future litigation; the companys
acquisition or disposition of assets; gains and losses from
asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales,
divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes,
changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company
operations; foreign currency movements compared with the
u.s.dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under
generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by
rule-setting bodies; and the factors set forth under the heading
risk factors on pages 30 and 31 in this report. in
addition, such statements could be affected by general domestic
and international economic and political conditions.
unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report
could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking
statements.

description of chevron
chevron
corporation,1
a delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
management and technology support to u.s.and international
subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
generation and energy services. exploration and production
(upstream) operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural
gas. refining, marketing and transportation (downstream)
operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail
car. chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing
of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and
fuel and lubricant oil additives.
a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pages e-125
and e-126.
as of december31, 2008, chevron had approximately
67,000employees (including about 5,000 service station
employees). approximately 32,000employees (including about
4,000 service station employees), or 48percent, were
employed in u.s.operations.
overview
of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
control over some of them. governmental policies, particularly
in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
their operations and formulate their products and, in some
cases, limiting their profits directly. prices for crude oil and
natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
determined by supply and demand for these commodities. however,
some governments impose price controls on refined products such
as gasoline or diesel fuel. the members of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec) are typically the
worlds swing producers of crude oil, and their production
levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
other energy sources also play a significant part. seasonality
is not a primary driver to changes in the companys
quarterly earnings during the year.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron
competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies,
as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the
acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other
properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop
and operate those properties. in its downstream business,
chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum
companies and other independent refining, marketing and
transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various
goods or services in many national and international markets.

in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations for a discussion of the
companys current business environment and outlook.
1incorporated
in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the
company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and
chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. in 2005, chevrontexaco
corporation changed its name to chevron corporation. as used in
this report, the term chevron and such terms as
the company, the corporation,
our, we and us may refer to
chevron corporation, one or more of its consolidated
subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
otherwise, it does not include affiliates of
chevron i.e., those companies accounted for by the
equity method (generally owned 50percent or less) or
investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms
are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.

(b)description
of business and properties
the upstream, downstream and chemicals activities of the company
and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically,
with operations in north america, south america, europe, africa,
the middle east, asia and australia. tabulations of segment
sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes
for the three years ending december31, 2008, and assets as
of the end of 2008 and 2007 for the united states
and the companys international geographic
areas are in note9 to the consolidated
financial statements beginning on
pagefs-38.
similar comparative data for the companys investments in
and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
equipment are in notes12 and 13 on pages fs-41 to fs-43.
capital
and exploratory expenditures
total expenditures for 2008 were $22.8billion, including
$2.3billion for chevrons share of expenditures by
affiliated companies, which did not require cash outlays by the
company. in 2007 and 2006, expenditures were $20billion
and $16.6billion, respectively, including the
companys share of affiliates expenditures of
$2.3billion and $1.9billion in the corresponding
periods.
of the $22.8billion in expenditures for 2008, about
three-fourths, or $17.5billion, was related to upstream
activities. approximately the same percentage was also expended
for upstream operations in 2007 and 2006. international upstream
accounted for about 70percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in each of the three years, reflecting the
companys continuing focus on opportunities that are
available outside the united states.
in 2009, the company estimates capital and exploratory
expenditures will be $22.8billion, including
$1.8billion of spending by affiliates. about three-fourths
of the total, or $17.5billion, is budgeted for exploration
and production activities, with $13.9billion of that
amount outside the united states.

exploratory expenditures on

worldwide oil-equivalent production, including volumes from oil
sands (refer to footnote 1 above), was 2.53million barrels
per day, down about 3percent from 2007. the decline was
mostly attributable to damages to facilities caused by september
2008 hurricanes in the u.s.gulf of mexico and the impact
of higher prices on certain production-sharing and
variable-royalty agreements outside the united states. refer to
the results of operations section beginning on
pagefs-6
for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
2006 2008 changes in production for crude oil and
natural gas liquids and natural gas.
table of contents
the company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent
production in 2009 will be approximately 2.63million
barrels per day. this estimate is subject to many uncertainties,
including quotas that may be imposed by opec, the price effect
on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in
fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
delays in project
start-ups,
fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, and
production that may have to be shut in due to weather
conditions, civil unrest, changing geopolitics or other
disruptions to operations. future production levels also are
affected by the size and number of economic investment
opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag
between initial exploration and the beginning of production.

activities in key areas, beginning on page9, for a
discussion of the companys major oil and gas development
projects.

of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the
three-year period ending december31, 2008. during 2008,
the company provided oil and gas reserves estimates for 2007 to
the department of energy, energy information administration
(eia), that agree with the 2007 reserve volumes in table v. this
reporting fulfilled the requirement that such estimates are to
be consistent with, and do not differ more than 5percent
from, the information furnished to the securities and exchange
commission in the companys 2007 annual report on

table of contents
delivery
commitments
the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
operations under a variety of contractual obligations. most
contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
quantities, as discussed below.
in the united states, the company is contractually committed to
deliver to third parties and affiliates 414billion cubic
feet of natural gas through 2011. the company believes it can
satisfy these contracts from quantities available from
production of the companys proved developed
u.s.reserves. these contracts include a variety of pricing
terms, including both index and fixed-price contracts.
outside the united states, the company is contractually
committed to deliver to third parties a total of
865billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2009 through
2011 from argentina, australia, canada, colombia, denmark and
the philippines. the sales contracts contain variable pricing
formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market
price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at
the time of delivery. the company believes it can satisfy these
contracts from quantities available from production of the
companys proved developed reserves in argentina,
australia, colombia, denmark and the philippines. the company
plans to meet its canadian contractual delivery commitments of
28billion cubic feet through third-party purchases.

indicates the fractional number of
wells completed during the year, regardless of when drilling was
initiated. completion refers to the installation of permanent
equipment for the production of crude oil or natural gas or, in
the case of a dry well, the reporting of abandonment to the
appropriate agency. some exploratory wells are not drilled with
the intention of producing from the well bore. in such cases,
completion refers to the completion of drilling.
further categorization of productive or dry is based on the
determination as to whether hydrocarbons in a sufficient
quantity were found to justify completion as a producing well,
whether or not the well is actually going to be completed as a
producer.
represents wells that are in the
process of drilling but have been neither abandoned nor
completed as of the last day of the year, including wells for
which drilling was not completed and which were temporarily

consolidated
operations
chevron has production and exploration activities in most of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. the companys upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural-gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas business. the map at left indicates chevrons primary areas of production and exploration.
a)
united
states
upstream activities in the united states are concentrated in
california, the gulf of mexico, louisiana, texas,
newmexico, the rocky mountains and alaska. average net
oil-equivalent production in the united states during 2008 was
671,000barrels per day, composed of 421,000barrels
of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 1.5billion cubic
feet of natural gas. refer to table v beginning on
pagefs-67
for a discussion of the net proved reserves and different
hydrocarbon characteristics for the companys major
u.s.producing areas.
california:the company has significant production
in the sanjoaquin valley. in 2008, average net
oil-equivalent production was 215,000barrels per day,
composed of 196,000barrels of crude oil, 88million
cubic feet of natural gas and 5,000barrels of natural gas
liquids. approximately 84percent of the crude-oil
production is considered heavy oil (typically with api gravity
lower than 22 degrees).
gulf of mexico:average net oil-equivalent
production during 2008 for the companys combined interests
in the gulf of mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore
fields in the region was 160,000barrels per day. the daily
oil-equivalent production comprised 76,000barrels of crude
oil, 439million cubic feet of natural gas and
10,000barrels of natural gas liquids.
production levels in 2008 were adversely affected by damage to
facilities caused by hurricanes gustav and ike in september. at
the end of 2008, approximately 50,000barrels per day of
oil-equivalent production remained offline, with restoration of
the volumes to occur as repairs to third-party pipelines and
producing facilities are completed.
table of contents
during 2008, chevron was engaged in various development and
exploration activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico.
production
start-up
occurred in fourth quarter 2008 at the 75percent-owned and
operated blind faith project. the project was designed for daily
production capacity of 65,000barrels of crude oil and
55million cubic feet of natural gas from subsea wells tied
back to a semisubmersible hull. proved undeveloped reserves were
initially recorded in 2005, and a portion was transferred to the
proved-developed category in 2008 coincident with project
start-up.
the production life of the field is estimated to be
approximately 20years.
at caesar/tonga, the company participated in a successful
appraisal well in 2008. the tonga and caesar partnerships have
formed a unit agreement for the area, with chevron having a
20percent nonoperated working interest. first oil is
expected by 2011. development plans include a subsea tie-back to
a nearby third-party production facility.
the company is also participating in the ultra-deep perdido
regional development. the project encompasses the installation
of a producing host facility to service multiple fields,
including chevrons 33percent-owned great white,
60percent-owned silvertip and 58percent-owned
tobago. chevron has a 38percent interest in the perdido
regional host. all of these fields and the production facility
are partner-operated. activities during 2008 included facility
construction, development drilling and spar installation. first
oil is expected in early 2010, with the facility capable of
handling 130,000barrels of oil-equivalent per day. the
project has an expected life of approximately 25years.
proved undeveloped reserves related to the project were first
recorded in 2006, and the phased reclassification of these
reserves to the proved-developed category is anticipated near
the time of production
start-up.
at the 58percent-owned and operated tahiti field,
development work continued following a delay in 2007 due to
metallurgical problems with the facilitys mooring
shackles, which problems have been resolved. the project is
designed as a subsea development, with the wells tied back to a
truss-spar floating production facility. production
start-up is
expected in mid-2009. initial booking of proved undeveloped
reserves occurred in 2003 for the project, with the transfer of
a portion of these reserves into the proved-developed category
anticipated near the time of production
start-up.
with an estimated production life of 30years, tahiti is
designed to have a maximum total daily production of
125,000barrels of crude oil and 70million cubic feet
of natural gas. in early 2009, a possible second phase of field
development was under evaluation.
deepwater exploration activities in 2008 and early 2009 included
participation in 12 exploratory wells four wildcat
and eight appraisal. exploratory work included the following:
big foot 60percent-owned and operated. a
successful appraisal well was completed in first quarter 2008. a
final appraisal well began drilling in november 2008, and was
completed in january 2009. as of late february 2009, evaluation
of the drilling results was under way.
buckskin 55percent-owned and operated. a
successful wildcat well was completed in early 2009.
jack& st. malo 50percent- and
41percent-owned and operated interests, respectively. the
prospects are being evaluated together due to their relative
proximity. successful appraisal wells were drilled during 2008
at both jack and st. malo, bringing the total wells drilled to
three at jack and four at st. malo.
knotty head 25percent-owned and nonoperated
working interest. subsurface studies continued during 2008 at
this 2005 discovery, with an appraisal well planned for third
quarter 2009.
puma 22percent-owned and nonoperated working
interest. an appraisal well began drilling in late 2008 and was
scheduled for completion in second quarter 2009.
tubular bells 30percent-owned and nonoperated
working interest. an appraisal well was completed in 2008.
at the end of 2008, the company had not yet recognized proved
reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above.
besides the activities connected with the development and
exploration projects in the gulf of mexico, the company also has
access to liquefied natural gas (lng) for the north america
natural gas market through the sabine pass lng terminal in
louisiana. the terminal was completed in mid-2008, and chevron
has contracted for 1billion cubic feet per day of
regasification capacity at the facility beginning in july 2009.
the company also has completed the permitting process to develop
the casotte landing regasification facility adjacent to the
companys pascagoula refinery in mississippi. casotte
landing remains a development option for chevron to bring lng
into the united states.
also in the sabine pass area of louisiana, the company has a
binding agreement to be one of the anchor shippers in a
3.2billion-cubic-feet-per-day third-party-owned natural
gas pipeline. chevron has contracted to have 1.6billion
cubic
table of contents
feet per day of capacity in the pipeline, of which
1billion cubic feet per day is in a new pipeline and
600million cubic feet per day is interconnecting capacity
to an existing pipeline. the new pipeline system, expected to be
completed in second quarter 2009, will provide access to
chevrons sabine and bridgeline pipelines, which connect to
the henry hub. the henry hub interconnects to nine interstate
and four intrastate pipelines and is the pricing point for
natural gas futures contracts traded on the nymex (new york
mercantile exchange).
other u.s.areas:outside california and the
gulf of mexico, the company manages operations across the
mid-continental united states and alaska. during 2008, the
companys u.s.production outside california and the
gulf of mexico averaged 296,000net oil-equivalent barrels
per day, composed of 101,000barrels of crude oil,
974million cubic feet of natural gas and
33,000barrels of natural gas liquids.
in the piceance basin in northwestern colorado, the company is
continuing a natural-gas development in which it holds a
100percent operated working interest. a pipeline to
transport the gas to a gathering system was completed in 2008
and facilities to produce 60million cubic feet of natural
gas per day are expected to be completed in mid-2009.
development drilling began in 2007, and reserves will be
recognized over the life of the project based upon drilling
results.

averaged 33,000barrels of liquids per day. activities in
2008 included development drilling at the benguela belize-lobito
tomboco (bblt) project and the ongoing evaluation of the negage
project. development and production rights for the various
fields in block14 expire between 2027 and 2029.
also in block14, development of the tombua and landana
fields continued. installation of producing facilities was
completed in late 2008, with expected
start-up in
the second half of 2009. production from the landana north
reservoir is expected to continue to utilize the bblt
infrastructure after
start-up.
the maximum total production from tombua and landana of
100,000barrels of crude oil per day is expected to occur
in 2011. proved undeveloped reserves were recognized for tombua
and landana in 2001 and 2002, respectively. reclassification
from proved undeveloped to proved developed for landana occurred
in 2006 and 2007. further reclassification is expected between
2009 and 2012 as the
tombua-landana
facilities and the drilling program are completed.
table of contents
during 2008, in the lucapa provisional development area of
block14, exploratory drilling included an appraisal well
that was the second successful appraisal of the 2006 lucapa
discovery. studies to evaluate development alternatives at
lucapa began in second quarter 2008. at the end of 2008, proved
reserves had not been recognized. at the 20percent-owned

100percent interest in the onshore block177
exploration license. a two-well exploration program is scheduled
for 2009.
nigeria:chevron holds a 40percent interest in 13 concessions predominantly in the onshore and near-offshore region of the niger delta. the company operates under a joint-venture arrangement in this region with the nigerian national petroleum corporation (nnpc), which owns a 60percent interest. the company also owns varying interests in deepwater offshore blocks. in 2008, the companys net oil-equivalent production in nigeria averaged 154,000barrels per day, composed of 142,000barrels of liquids and 72million cubic feet of natural gas.in deepwater offshore, initial production occurred in july 2008 at the 68percent-owned and operated agbami field in oml 127 and oml 128. the project is a subsea design, with wells tied back to a floating production, storage and offloading (fpso) vessel. by year-end 2008, total crude-oil production was averaging approximately 130,000barrels per day. maximum total production of crude oil and natural gas liquids of 250,000barrels per day is expected to be achieved by year-end 2009. the company initially recognized proved undeveloped reserves for agbami in 2002. a portion of the proved undeveloped reserves was reclassified to proved developed in 2008 at production start-up. the total cost for the first phase of
table of contents
this project was $7billion.  additional development
drilling is being evaluated. the leases that contain the agbami
field expire in 2023 and 2024.
also in the deepwater area, the aparo field in oml 132 and oml
140 and the bonga sw field in offshore oml 118share a
common geologic structure and are planned to be jointly
developed under a proposed unitization agreement. work continued
in early 2009 on agreements between chevron and partners in oml
118. at the end of 2008, the company had not recognized proved
reserves for this project.
chevron operates and holds a 95percent interest in the
deepwater nsiko discovery on oml 140. development activities

start-up is
scheduled for 2012. maximum total production of
180,000barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
achieved within one year of
start-up.
the company recognized proved undeveloped reserves for the
project in 2004, and a portion is expected to be reclassified to
the proved-developed category near production
start-up.
chevron participated in three successful deepwater exploration
wells during 2008. hydrocarbons were confirmed in two wells in
opl 214 and one well in oml 113. additional reservoir studies
are scheduled for 2009, and one exploration well is planned
later in the year. the company has 20percent and
18percent nonoperated working interests in the two leases,
respectively. at the end of 2008, proved reserves had not been
recognized for these activities.
in the niger delta, construction is under way on the phase 3a
expansion of the escravos gas plant (egp), which is expected to
be installed in late 2009 and start up production in 2010. phase
3a scope includes offshore natural-gas gathering and compression
infrastructure and a second gas processing facility, which
potentially would increase processing capacity from
285million to 680million cubic feet of natural gas
per day and increase lpg and condensate export capacity from
15,000 to 58,000barrels per day. egp phase 3a is designed
to process natural gas from the meji, delta south, okan and mefa
fields. proved undeveloped reserves associated with egp phase 3a
were recognized in 2002. these reserves are expected to be
reclassified to proved developed as various project milestones
are reached and related projects are completed. the anticipated
life of egp phase 3a is 25years. phase 3b of the egp
project is designed to gather natural gas from eight offshore
fields and to compress and transport natural gas to onshore
facilities beginning in 2013.
engineering and procurement activities continued during 2008 for
certain onshore fields that had been shut in since 2003 due to
civil unrest. the 40percent-owned and operated onshore
asset gas management project is designed to restore
approximately 125million cubic feet of natural gas per day
to the nigerian domestic gas market. a major construction
contract is expected to be awarded in 2010.

c)asia-pacific
major producing countries in the asia-pacific region include
australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, kazakhstan, the partitioned
neutral zone located between saudi arabia and kuwait, and
thailand.
australia:during 2008, the average net oil-equivalent production from chevrons interests in australia was 96,000barrels per day, composed of 34,000barrels of liquids and 376million cubic feet of natural gas.chevron has a 17percent nonoperated working interest in the north west shelf (nws) venture offshore western australia. daily net production from the project during 2008 averaged 25,000barrels of crude oil and condensate, 374million cubic feet of natural gas, and 4,000barrels of lpg. approximately 70percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of lng to major utilities in japan, south korea and china, primarily under long-term contracts. the remaining natural gas was sold to the western australia domestic market.in september 2008, a fifth lng train increased processing and export capacity from approximately 12million metric tons per year to more than 16million. part of the natural gas for these expanded facilities is being supplied from the angel natural-gas field, which started production in october 2008. additional supply will be provided by the north rankin 2 project, for which an investment decision was made in march 2008. the project is scheduled to start production in 2013.proved undeveloped reserves were booked in prior years and will be reclassified to proved developed upon completion of the project.
the nws venture is also advancing plans to extend the period of
crude-oil production. the nws oil redevelopment project is
designed to replace an fpso and a portion of existing subsea
infrastructure that services production from the cossack,
hermes, lambert and wanaea offshore fields. a final investment
decision was made in november 2008 and
start-up is
expected early 2011. the project is expected to extend
production past 2020. the concession for the nws venture expires
in 2034.
on barrow and thevenard islands off the northwest coast of
australia, chevron operates crude-oil producing facilities that
had combined net production of 5,000barrels per day in
2008. chevrons interests in these operations are
57percent for barrow and 51percent for thevenard.
also off the northwest coast of australia, chevron is the
operator of the gorgon development and has a 50percent
ownership interest across most of the greater gorgon area.
chevron and two joint-venture participants are planning for the
combined development of gorgon and nearby natural-gas fields as
one large-scale project. environmental approvals were in process
and a final investment decision is expected to be made in the
second half of 2009 for a three-train,
15million-metric-ton-per-year lng facility. natural gas
for the project is expected to be supplied from the gorgon and
io/jansz fields. the gorgon project has an expected economic
life of at least 40years.
at the end of 2008, the company had not recognized proved
reserves for any of the greater gorgon area fields. recognition
is contingent on securing sufficient lng sales agreements and
achieving other key project milestones, including receipt of
environmental permits. in 2008, negotiations continued to
finalize sales agreements with three utility customers in japan
and gs caltex, a chevron affiliated company. purchases by each
of these customers are expected to range from 250,000 metric
tons per year to 1.5million metric tons per year over
25years.
table of contents
in 2008, the company also announced plans for a multi-train lng
plant to process natural gas from its wholly owned wheatstone
discovery located on the northwest cost of mainland australia.
the project is expected to begin feed during the second half of
2009. during 2008, chevron conducted appraisal drilling in the
wheatstone and iago fields. during 2009, the company plans to
drill multiple exploration and appraisal wells in its operated
acreage. at the end of 2008, the company had not recognized
proved reserves for this project.
in the browse basin, the company conducted successful appraisal
drilling programs in the calliance and torosa fields. a
commitment well was also drilled to test the northern extension
of the ichthys field in the eastern browse basin. at the end of
2008, proved reserves had not been recognized.
azerbaijan:chevron holds a 10percent nonoperated working interest in the azerbaijan international operating company (aioc), which produces crude oil in the caspian sea from the azeri-chirag-gunashli (acg) project. chevron also has a 9percent interest in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc) affiliate, which transports aioc production by pipeline from baku, azerbaijan, through georgia to mediterranean deepwater port facilities in ceyhan, turkey. (refer to pipelines under transportation operations beginning on page26 for a discussion of the btc operations.)in 2008, the companys daily net production from aioc averaged 29,000barrels of oil-equivalent. first oil from phaseiii of acg development occurred during the second quarter 2008. reserves were reclassified to proved developed shortly before start-up. in early 2009, total production was averaging about 670,000barrels per day. the aioc operations are conducted under a 30-year production-sharing contract (psc) that expires in 2024.kazakhstan:chevron holds a 20percent nonoperated working interest in the karachaganak project, which is being developed in phases. during 2008, karachaganak net oil-equivalent production averaged 66,000barrels per day, composed of 41,000barrels of liquids and 153million cubic feet of natural gas. in 2008, access to the caspian pipeline consortium (cpc) and atyrau-samara (russia) pipelines enabled karachaganak sales of
approximately 163,000barrels per day (30,000net
barrels) of processed liquids at world-market prices. the
remaining liquids were sold into russian markets. during 2008,
work continued on a fourth train that is designed to increase
the export of processed liquids by 56,000barrels per day
(11,000net barrels). the fourth train is expected to start
up in 2011.
during 2008, partners continued to evaluate alternatives for a
phaseiii development of karachaganak. timing for the
recognition of phaseiii proved reserves is uncertain and
depends on finalizing a phaseiii project design and
achievement of project milestones. karachaganak operations are
conducted under a
40-year psc
that expires in 2038.

thailand:chevron has operated and nonoperated working interests in several different offshore blocks. the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2008 averaged 217,000barrels per day, composed of 67,000barrels of crude oil and condensate and 894million cubic feet of natural gas. all of the companys natural gas production is sold to ptt under long-term sales contracts.operated interests are in pattani and other fields with ownership interests ranging from 35percent to 80percent in blocks10 through 13, b12/27, b8/32, 9a, g4/43 and g4/48. blocks b8/32 and 9a produce crude oil and natural gas from six operating areas, and blocks10 through 13 and b12/27 produce crude oil, condensate and natural gas from 16 operating areas. first production from block g4/43 occurred in first quarter 2008.
for blocks10 through 13, a final investment decision was
made in march 2008 for the construction of a second central
natural-gas processing facility in the platong area. the
70percent-owned and operated platong gasii project
is designed to add 420million cubic feet per day of
processing capacity in 2011. the company expects to reclassify
proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed throughout the
projects life as the wellhead platforms are installed.
concessions for blocks10 through 13 expire in 2022.
chevron has a 16percent nonoperated working interest in
blocks14a, 15a, 16a, g9/48 and g8/50, known collectively
as the arthit field. first production from arthit occurred in
2008 and averaged 10,000net oil-equivalent barrels per day
through the end of the year.
during 2008, 13 exploration wells were drilled in the gulf of
thailand, and all were successful. in block g4/50, an
exploratory joint operating agreement was signed in late 2008. a
3-d seismic
survey and geological studies are scheduled for 2009. three
exploratory wells are planned for 2010. at the end of 2008,
proved reserves had not been recognized for these activities. in
addition, chevron holds exploration interests in a number of
blocks that are currently inactive, pending resolution of border
issues between thailand and cambodia.
vietnam:the company operates off the southwest
coast and has a 42percent interest in a psc that includes

psc for block52/97. chevron also has a third psc with a
50percent-owned and operated interest in block b122
offshore eastern vietnam. no production occurred in these areas
during 2008.
in the blocks off the southwest coast, the vietnam gas project
is aimed at developing an area in the malay basin to supply
natural gas to state-owned petrovietnam. the project includes
installation of wellhead and hub platforms, an fso vessel, field
pipelines and a central processing platform. the timing of first
natural-gas production is dependent upon the outcome of
commercial negotiations. maximum total production of
approximately 500million cubic feet of natural gas per day
is projected within five years of
start-up. at
the end of 2008, proved reserves had not been recognized for
this project.
during the year, two exploratory wells confirmed hydrocarbons in
block b and block52/97. in block122,
2-d seismic
information was purchased in late 2008, with processing
scheduled for 2009. proved reserves had not been recognized as
of the end of 2008. future activity in block122may
be affected by an ongoing territorial dispute between vietnam
and china.

western kazakhstan, under a
40-year
concession that expires in 2033. chevrons net
oil-equivalent production in 2008 from these fields averaged
201,000barrels per day, composed of 168,000barrels
of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 195million cubic
feet of natural gas.
in 2008, tco completed a significant expansion composed of two
integrated projects referred to as second generation plant (sgp)
and sour gas injection (sgi). total cost of the project was
$7.4billion. the projects increased tcos daily
production capacity to 540,000barrels of crude oil,
760million cubic feet of natural gas and
46,000barrels of natural gas liquids. the sgi facility
injects approximately one-third of the sour gas separated from
the crude oil back into the reservoir. the injected gas
maintains higher reservoir pressure and displaces oil towards
producing wells. the company recognized additional proved
reserves associated with sgi in 2008. tco is evaluating options
for another expansion project based on sgi/sgp technologies.
during 2008, the majority of tcos production was exported
through the caspian pipeline consortium (cpc) pipeline that runs
from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities at
novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black sea. the majority
of the incremental production from sgi/sgp was moved by rail to
black sea ports. other export routes included shipment via
tanker to baku for transport by the btc pipeline to ceyhan or by
rail to black sea ports. (refer to pipelines under
transportation operations beginning on page26
for a discussion of cpc operations.)

chevron holds 100percent of
the common stock issued by chevron south africa (pty) limited,
which owns the cape town refinery. a consortium of south african
partners owns preferred shares ultimately convertible to a
25percent equity interest in chevron south africa (pty)
limited. none of the preferred shares had been converted as of
february 2009.
chevron sold its 31percent
interest in the nerefco refinery in the netherlands in march
2007. during 2008, the company sold its 4percent ownership
interest in a refinery in abidjan, cte divoire, and
its 8percent ownership interest in a refinery in cameroon,
decreasing the companys combined share of operable
capacity by about 5,000barrels per day.
average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2008
was 87percent, compared with 85percent in 2007. this
increase generally resulted from an improvement in utilization
at the refineries in richmond and el segundo, california. at the
u.s.fuel refineries, crude oil distillation capacity
utilization averaged 95percent in 2008, compared with
85percent in 2007, and cracking and coking capacity
utilization averaged 86percent and 78percent in 2008
and 2007, respectively. cracking and coking units are the
primary facilities used in fuel refineries to convert heavier
feedstocks into gasoline and other light products.
the companys refineries in the united states, the united
kingdom, canada, south africa and australia produce low-sulfur
fuels. gs caltex, the companys 50percent-owned
affiliate, completed construction in 2008 on projects to produce
low-sulfur fuels at the
700,000barrel-per-day
yeosu refining complex in south korea. other projects completed
during the year at yeosu included a new hydrocracker complex and
distillation unit that increases high-value product yield and
lowers feedstock costs. in 2009, construction continues at the
yeosu complex on projects designed to further improve processing
of higher-sulfur crude oils and reduce fuel-oil production. at
the companys 50percent-owned singapore refining
company, construction continued during 2008 and into early 2009
to enable the refinery to meet regional specifications for clean
diesel fuels.
at the pascagoula refinery, various projects were completed
during 2008 that enhanced the ability to process heavier,
higher-sulfur crudes, resulting in lower crude-acquisition
costs. in addition, construction progressed on a continuous
catalytic reformer that is expected to improve refinery
reliability and increase daily gasoline production at the
refinery by 10percent, or 600,000 gallons per day, by
mid-2010. at the richmond and el segundo refineries,
construction continued and design and engineering work advanced
during 2008 to further increase the ability to process
high-sulfur crude oils and improve high-value product yields.

federal law requires that cargo transported between
u.s.ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
united states, owned and operated by u.s.entities, and
manned by u.s.crews. in 2008, the companys
u.s.flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting
refined products between the gulf coast and the east coast and
from california refineries to terminals on the west coast and in
alaska and hawaii. one
u.s.-flagged
product tanker, capable of carrying 300,000barrels of
cargo, was delivered in 2008 and two additional
u.s.-flagged
product tankers are scheduled for delivery in 2010.
the foreign-flagged vessels were engaged primarily in
transporting crude oil from the middle east, asia, the black
sea, mexico and west africa to ports in the united states,
europe, australia and asia. refined products were also
transported by tanker worldwide.
in addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
one-sixth interest in each of seven lng tankers transporting
cargoes for the north west shelf (nws) venture in australia. the
nws project also has two lng tankers under long-term time
charter. in 2008, the company sold its two lng shipbuilding
contracts with samsung heavy industries, but retained the option
to purchase two new lng vessels.
the federal oil pollution act of 1990 requires the phase-out by
year-end 2010 of all single-hull tankers trading to
u.s.ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
u.s.exclusive economic zone. as of the end of 2008, the
companys owned and bareboat-chartered fleet was completely
double-hulled. the company is a member of many
oil-spill-response cooperatives in areas in which it operates
around the world.

50percent interest in youngs creek mining company llc, a
joint venture to develop a coal mine in northern wyoming. coal
sales from wholly owned mines were 11million tons, down
about 1million tons from 2007.
at year-end 2008, chevron controlled approximately
200million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in
the united states, including reserves of environmentally
desirable low-sulfur coal. the company is contractually
committed to deliver between 8million and 11million
tons of coal per year through the end of 2010 and believes it
will satisfy these contracts from existing coal reserves.
in addition to the coal operations, chevron owns and operates
the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico. at year-end 2008,
chevron controlled approximately 53million pounds of
proven molybdenum reserves at questa.
in 2008, the company sold the petroleum coke calciner assets of
chicago carbon company, a wholly owned subsidiary in illinois.
the company also sold its lanthanides processing facilities and
rare-earth mineral mine in mountain pass, california, and its
33percent interest in sumikin molycorp, a manufacturer and

chevron energy solutions (ces) is a wholly owned subsidiary that
provides public institutions and businesses with sustainable
energy projects designed to increase energy efficiency and
reliability, reduce energy costs, and utilize renewable and
alternative-power technologies. since 2000, ces has developed
hundreds of projects that will help government, education and
other customers reduce their energy costs and carbon footprint.
major projects completed by ces in 2008 included several large
solar panel installations in california.
research
and technology
the companys energy technology organization supports
chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by providing
technology, services and competency development in earth
sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and
completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process
technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health,
environment and safety. the information technology organization
integrates computing, telecommunications, data management,
security and network technology to provide a standardized
digital infrastructure and enable chevrons global
operations and business processes.
chevron technology ventures (ctv) manages investments and
projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
into chevrons core businesses. as of the end of 2008, ctv
was investigating technologies such as next-generation biofuels,
advanced solar power and enhanced geothermal.
chevrons research and development expenses were
$835million, $562million and $468million for
the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, and ultimate successes are not certain. although not
all initiatives may prove to be economically viable, the
companys overall investment in this area is not
significant to the companys consolidated financial
position.
environmental
protection
virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are
subject to various u.s.federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
similar laws and regulations in other countries. these
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. chevron expects more environment-related regulations in
the countries where it has operations. most of the costs of
complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its
operations are embedded in the normal costs of conducting
business.
in 2008, the companys u.s.capitalized environmental
expenditures were approximately $780million, representing
approximately 9percent of the companys total
consolidated u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures.
these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with
new facilities. the expenditures relate mostly to air- and
water-quality projects and activities at the companys
refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
facilities. for 2009, the company estimates u.s.capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
approximately $1billion. the future annual capital costs
are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
future changes to regulatory requirements.

item1a.
risk
factors
chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a
diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a
history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. nevertheless,
some inherent risks could materially impact the companys
financial results of operations or financial condition.
chevron
is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
prices.
chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the
companys results of operations is the price of crude oil,
which can be influenced by general economic conditions and
geopolitical risk.
during extended periods of historically low prices for crude
oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and
exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected.
upstream assets may also become impaired. the impact on
downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for
refined products and the associated margins on refined-product
sales.
the
scope of chevrons business will decline if the company
does not successfully develop resources.
the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron
is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
produces with good prospects for future production, the
companys business will decline. creating and maintaining
an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including
obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce
hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time,
capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and schedule;
and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.
the
companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human
factors.
chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
inhospitable regions. the companys operations and
facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes, including hurricanes, floods and other
forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political
events, fires, earthquakes, and explosions, any of which could
result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the
natural environment.
chevrons
business subjects the company to liability risks.
the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
companys business. chevron operations also produce
byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. any of these
activities could result in liability, either as a result of an
accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
on the effects of the companys operations on human health
or the environment.
political
instability could harm chevrons business.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
governments to increase public ownership of the companys
partially or wholly owned businesses
and/or to
impose additional taxes or royalties.
in certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal
unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
government and the company or other governments may affect the
companys operations. those developments have, at times,
significantly affected the companys related operations and
results and are carefully considered by management when
evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries. at december31, 2008, 29percent of the
companys net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan.
the company also has significant interests in organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec)-member countries including
angola, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned neutral
zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. twenty-three percent of
the companys net proved reserves, including affiliates,
were located in opec countries at december31, 2008
(excluding reserves in indonesia, which relinquished its opec
membership at the end of 2008).
table of contents
regulation
of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons
operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons
products.
management expects continued political attention to issues
concerning climate change, and the role of human activity in it
and potential remediation or mitigation through regulation that
could materially affect the companys operations.
international agreements and national or regional legislation
and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are
currently in various phases of discussion or implementation. the
kyoto protocol, californias global warming solutions act
and australias proposed carbon pollution reduction scheme,
along with other actual or pending federal, state and provincial
regulations, envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
through market-based trading schemes. the company is currently
complying with greenhouse gas emissions limits within the
european union.
as a result of these and other environmental regulations, the
company expects to incur substantial capital, compliance,
operating, maintenance and remediation costs. the level of
expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations
is uncertain and may vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws
enacted in each jurisdiction and the companys activities
in it. the companys production and processing operations
(e.g., the production of crude oil at offshore platforms and the
processing of natural gas at liquefied natural gas facilities)
typically result in emission of greenhouse gases. likewise,
emissions arise from power and downstream operations, including
crude oil transportation and refining. finally, although beyond
the control of the company, the use of passenger vehicle fuels
and related products by consumers also results in greenhouse gas
emissions that may be regulated.
the companys financial performance will depend on a number
of factors, including, among others, the greenhouse gas
emissions reductions required by law, the price and availability
of emission allowances and credits, the extent to which chevron
would be entitled to receive emission allowances or need to
purchase them in the open market or through auctions and the
impact of legislation on the companys ability to recover
the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys
products. material cost increases or incentives to conserve or
use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products
the company currently sells. to the extent these costs are not
ultimately reflected in the price of the companys
products, the companys operating results will be adversely
affected.

legal
proceedings
ecuadorchevron is a defendant in a civil
lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio,
ecuador, brought in may 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be
representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil
production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit
alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and
production operations, and seeks unspecified damages to fund
environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged
environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. until
1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of texaco
inc., was a minority member of this consortium with
petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the
majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted
solely by petroecuador. at the conclusion of the consortium and
following an independent third-party environmental audit of the
concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the
republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate
specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to
texpets ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to
that agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation
program at a cost of $40million. after certifying that the
sites were properly remediated, the government granted texpet
and all related corporate entities a full release from any and
all environmental liability arising from the consortium
operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this
lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. as to matters of law, the
company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over
chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the
action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively to
chevron; third, that the claims are barred by the
table of contents
statute of limitations in ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit
is also barred by the releases from liability previously given
to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador. with
regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence
confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted
and that the remaining environmental damage reflects
petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal
obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since
assuming full control over the operations.
in april 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to
identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to
specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report
recommending that the court assess $8billion, which would,
according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for
purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for,
among other items, environmental remediation, health care
systems, and additional infrastructure for petroecuador. the
engineers report also asserted that an additional
$8.3billion could be assessed against chevron for unjust
enrichment. the engineers report is not binding on the
court. chevron also believes that the engineers work was
performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law
and in violation of the courts orders. chevron submitted a
rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to strike the
report in its entirety. in november 2008, the engineer revised
the report and, without additional evidence, recommended an
increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to
a total of $18.9billion and an increase in the assessment
for purported unjust enrichment to a total of $8.4billion.
chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, and chevron
will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition of
liability.
management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible
loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the
defects associated with the engineers report, management
does not believe the report itself has any utility in
calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).
moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the
case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably
possible loss (or a range of loss).

business environment and outlook
chevron is a global energy company with
significant business activities in the following
countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan,
bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad, china,
colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark,
france, india, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the
netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned neutral
zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines,
qatar, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa,
south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united
kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.
earnings of the company depend largely on the
profitability of its upstream (exploration and
production) and downstream (refining, marketing and
transportation) business segments. the single biggest
factor that affects the
results of operations for both segments is
movement in the price of crude oil. in the downstream
business, crude oil is the largest cost component of
refined products. the overall trend in earnings is
typically less affected by results from the companys
chemicals business and other activities and invest-
ments. earnings for the company in any period
may also be influenced by events or transactions that
are infrequent and/ or unusual in nature.
in recent
years and through most of 2008, chevron and the oil
and gas industry at large experienced an increase in
certain costs that exceeded the general trend of
inflation in many areas of the world. this increase in
costs affected the companys operating expenses and
capital programs for all business segments, but
particularly for upstream. these cost pressures began
to soften somewhat in late 2008. as the price of crude
oil dropped precipitously from a record high in
mid-year, the demand for some goods and services in
the industry began to slacken. this cost trend is
expected to continue during 2009 if crude-oil prices
do not significantly rebound. (refer to the upstream
section on next page for a discussion of the trend in
crude-oil prices.)
the companys operations,
especially upstream, can also be affected by changing
economic, regulatory and political environments in the
various countries in which it operates, including the
united states. civil unrest, acts of violence or
strained relations between a government and the
company or other governments may impact the companys
operations or investments. those developments have at
times significantly affected the companys operations
and results and are carefully considered by management
when evaluating the level of current and future
activity in such countries.
to sustain its long-term competitive position in
the upstream business, the company must develop and
replenish an inventory of projects that offer adequate
financial returns for the investment required.
identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring
the necessary rights to explore for and to produce
crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and
handling the many technical and operational details in
a safe and cost-effective manner are all important
factors in this effort. projects often require long
lead times and large capital commitments. from time to
time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate
contracts or impose additional costs on the company.
governments may attempt to do so in the future. the
company will continue to monitor these developments,
take them into account in evaluating future investment
opportunities, and otherwise seek to mitigate any risks
to the companys current operations or future
prospects.
the company also continually evaluates
opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to
acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset
base to help augment the companys growth. refer to the
results of operations section beginning on page fs-6
for discussions of net gains on asset sales during
2008. asset dispositions and
restructurings may occur in future periods and
could result in significant gains or losses.
fs-2
table of contents
the company has been closely monitoring the ongoing uncertainty in financial and credit
markets, the rapid decline in crude-oil prices that began in the second half of 2008, and the
general contraction of worldwide economic activity. management is taking these developments into
account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning. the company remains confident of its underlying financial strength to deal with potential problems presented in this
environment.
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:
upstreamearnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. crude-oil and natural-gas prices are subject to external
factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic
conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum
exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and
regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil
unrest or political uncertainty. moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit the companys
production capacity in an affected region. the company monitors developments closely in the
countries in which it operates and holds investments, and attempts to manage risks in operating its
facilities and business.
price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the efficient production of crude oil and natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the
companys control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation but also
prices charged by the industrys material- and service-providers, which can be affected by the
volatility of the industrys own supply and demand conditions for such materials and services.
capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses also can be affected by damages to
production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.
industry price levels for crude oil were volatile during 2008. the spot price for west texas
intermediate (wti)crude oil, a benchmark crude, started 2008 at $96 per barrel and peaked at $147
in early july. at the end of the year, the wti price had fallen to $45 per barrel. as of
mid-february2009, the wti price was $38 per barrel. the collapse in price during the second half
of 2008 was largely driven by a decline in the demand for crude oil that was associated with a
significant weakening in world economies. the wti price averaged $100 per barrel for the full-year
2008, compared with $72 in 2007.
as in 2007, a wide differential in prices existed in 2008 between high-quality (i.e.,
high-gravity, low-sulfur) crude oils and those of lower quality (i.e., low-gravity, high-sulfur
crude). the relatively lower price for the high-sulfur crudes has been associated with an ample
supply and relatively lower demand due to the limited number of refineries that are able to
process this lower-quality feedstock into light products (i.e., motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation
gasoline and diesel fuel). chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in
california, chad, indonesia, the partitioned neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait,
venezuela and certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom north sea. (refer to page
fs-10 for the companys average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)
in contrast to
price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional
markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. in the united
states during 2008, benchmark prices at henry hub averaged about $9 per thousand cubic feet (mcf),
compared with about $7 in 2007. at december31, 2008, and as of mid-february2009,
fs-3
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
the henry hub price was about $5.60 and $4.70 per mcf, respectively. fluctuations in the price
for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with the volumes produced in north
america and the inventory in underground storage relative to customer demand. u.s. natural gas
prices are also typically higher during the winter period when demand for heating is greatest.
certain other regions of the world in which the company operates have different supply, demand
and regulatory circumstances, typically resulting in lower average sales prices for the companys
production of natural gas. (refer to page fs-10 for the companys average natural gas realizations
for the u.s. and international regions.) additionally, excess-supply conditions that exist in
certain parts of the world cannot easily serve to mitigate the relatively higher-price conditions
in the united states and other markets because of the lack of infrastructure to transport and
receive liquefied natural gas.
to help address this regional imbalance between supply and demand for natural gas, chevron
continues to invest in long-term projects in areas of excess supply to install infrastructure to
produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker, along with investments and commitments to
regasify the product in markets where demand is strong and supplies are not as plentiful. due to
the significance of the overall investment in these long-term projects, the natural gas sales
prices in the areas of excess supply (before the natural gas is transferred to a processing
facility) are expected to remain below sales prices for natural gas that is produced much nearer to
areas of high demand and can be transported in existing natural gas pipeline networks (as in the
united states or thailand).
besides the impact of the fluctuation in price for crude oil and natural gas, the longer-term
trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the
companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes
in fiscal terms of contracts, changes in tax rates on income, and the cost of goods and services.
chevrons worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2008, including volumes produced from oil
sands, averaged 2.53million barrels per day, a decline of about 90,000 barrels per day from 2007
due mainly to the impact of higher prices on volumes recovered under certain production-sharing and
variable-royalty agreements outside the united states and damage to production facilities in
september2008 caused by hurricanes gustav and ike in the u.s. gulf of mexico. (refer to the
discussion of u.s. upstream production trends in the results of
operations section on page fs-6.
refer also to the selected operating data table on page
fs-10 for a listing of production volumes
for each of the three years ending december31, 2008.)
the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2009 will average approximately 2.63
million barrels per day. this estimate is subject to many uncertainties, including quotas that may
be imposed by opec, price effects on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the
scope of company operations, delays in project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in
various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing
geopolitics, or other disruptions to operations. future production levels also are affected by the
size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time
lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. most of chevrons upstream
investment is currently being made outside the united states. investments in upstream projects
generally are made well in advance of the start of the associated production of crude oil and
natural gas.
approximately 20percent of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2008 occurred in
the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned neutral zone
between saudi arabia and kuwait. (this production statistic excludes volumes produced in indonesia,
which relinquished its opec membership at the end of 2008.) at a meeting on december17, 2008, opec
announced a reduction of 4.2million barrels per day, or 14percent, from actual september2008
production of 29million barrels per day. the reduction became effective january1, 2009. opec
quotas did not significantly affect chevrons production level in 2007 or in 2008. the companys
current and future production levels could be affected by the cutbacks announced by opec in
december2008.
refer to the results of operations section on pages fs-6 through fs-7 for
additional discussion of the companys upstream operations.
downstreamearnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining
and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil and
feedstocks for chemical manufacturing. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected
by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and by changes in the
price of crude oil used for refinery feedstock. industry margins can also be influenced by refined-product inventory levels, geopolitical events, refinery maintenance programs and disruptions
at refineries resulting from unplanned outages that may be due to severe weather or other
operational events.
other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the companys refining and marketing network, the effectiveness of
fs-4
table of contents
the crude-oil and product-supply functions and the economic returns on invested capital. profitability can also
be affected by the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the companys shipping operations, which
are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the
companys control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the companys
refinery and distribution network.
the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s.
gulf coast, latin america, asia, southern africa and the united kingdom. chevron operates or has
ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas except latin america. downstream
earnings, especially in the united states, were weak from mid-2007 through mid-2008 due mainly to
increasing prices of crude oil used in the refining process that were not always fully recovered
through sales prices of refined products. margins significantly improved in the second half of 2008 as the price of crude oil declined.
as part of its downstream strategy to focus on areas of market strength, the company announced
plans to sell marketing businesses in several countries. refer to the discussion in operating
developments below.
industry margins in the future may be volatile and are influenced by changes
in the price of crude oil used for refinery feedstock and by changes in the supply and demand for
crude oil and refined products. the industry supply-and-demand balance can be affected by
disruptions at refineries resulting from maintenance programs and unplanned outages, including
weather-related disruptions; refined-product inventory levels; and geopolitical events.
refer to pages fs-7 through fs-8 for additional discussion of the companys downstream
operations.
chemicalsearnings in the petrochemicals business are closely tied to global chemical demand,
industry inventory levels and plant capacity utilization. feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to
follow crude oil and natural gas price movements, also influence earnings in this segment.
refer to the results of operations section on page fs-8 for additional discussion of
chemicals earnings.
operating developments
key operating developments and other events during 2008 and early 2009 included the following:
upstream
australiastarted production from train 5 of the 17percent-owned north west shelf venture
onshore liquefied-natural-gas (lng)facility in west australia, increasing export capacity from
about 12million metric tons annually to more than 16million. the company also announced plans for
an lng project that initially will have a capacity of 5million tons per year and process natural
gas from chevrons 100percent-owned wheatstone discovery located on the northwest coast of
mainland australia.
canadafinalized agreements with the government of newfoundland and labrador to develop the 27
percent-owned hebron heavy-oil project off the eastern coast.
indonesiaachieved first oil at north duri field area 12, which chevron operates with a 100
percent interest. maximum total crude-oil production of 34,000 barrels per day is expected in 2012.
kazakhstancompleted the second phase of a major
expansion of production operations and processing
facilities at the 50percent-owned tengizchevroil
affiliate, increasing
total crude-oil production capacity from 400,000 to 540,000 barrels per day.
middle eastsigned an agreement with the kingdom of saudi arabia to extend to 2039 the
companys operation of the kingdoms 50percent interest in oil and gas resources of the onshore
area of the partitioned neutral zone between the kingdom and the state of kuwait.
nigeria started production offshore at the 68percent-owned and operated agbami field, with total oil production
expected to reach a maximum of 250,000 barrels per day by the end of 2009. the company and partners also

u.s upstream income of $7.1billion in 2008 increased $2.6billion from 2007. higher average prices
for crude oil and natural gas increased earnings by $3.1billion between periods. also contributing
to the higher earnings were gains of approximately $1billion on asset sales, including a $600
million gain on an asset-exchange transaction. partially offsetting these benefits were adverse
effects of about $1.6billion associated with lower oil-equivalent production and higher operating
expenses, which included approximately $400million of expenses resulting from damage to facilities
in the gulf of mexico caused by hurricanes gustav and ike in september.
income of $4.5billion in 2007 increased approximately $260million from 2006. results in 2007
benefited approximately $700million from higher prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids.
this benefit to income was partially offset by the effects of a decline in oil-equivalent
production and an increase in depreciation, operating and exploration expenses.
the companys average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 was $88.43 per
barrel, compared with $63.16 in 2007 and $56.66 in 2006. the average natural gas realization was
$7.90 per thousand cubic feet in 2008, compared with $6.12 and $6.29 in 2007 and 2006,
respectively.
net oil-equivalent production in 2008 averaged 671,000 barrels per day, down 9.7percent and
12.1percent from 2007 and 2006, respectively. the decrease between 2007 and 2008 was mainly due to
normal field declines and the adverse impact of the hurricanes. the decline in 2007 from 2006 was
due primarily to normal field declines. the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for
2008 averaged 421,000 barrels per day, down approximately 8percent from 2007 and down 9percent
compared with 2006. net natural gas production averaged 1.5billion cubic feet per day in 2008,
down 12percent from 2007 and down 17percent from 2006.

international upstream income of $14.6billion in 2008 increased $4.3billion from 2007.
higher prices for crude oil and natural gas increased earnings by $4.9billion. partially
offsetting the benefit of higher prices was an impact of about $1.8billion associated with a
reduction of crude-oil sales volumes due to
timing of certain cargo liftings and higher depreciation and operating expenses. foreign
currency effects benefited earnings by $873million in 2008, compared with reductions to earnings
of $417million in 2007 and $371million in 2006.

income in 2007 of $10.3billion increased $1.4billion from 2006. earnings in 2007 benefited
approximately $1.6billion from higher prices, primarily for crude oil, and $300million from
increased liftings. non-recurring income-tax items also benefited earnings between periods. these
benefits to income were partially offset by the impact of higher operating and depreciation
expenses.
the companys average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 was $86.51 per
barrel, compared with $65.01 in 2007 and $57.65 in 2006. the average natural gas realization was
$5.19 per thousand cubic feet in 2008, compared with $3.90 and $3.73 in 2007 and 2006,
respectively.
net oil-equivalent production of 1.86million
barrels per day in 2008 declined about 1percent and 2
percent from 2007 and 2006, respectively. the volumes
for each year included production from oil sands in
canada. volumes in 2006 also included production under
an operating service agreement in venezuela until its
conversion to a joint-stock company in october of that
year. absent the impact of higher prices on certain
production-sharing and variable-royalty agreements, net
oil-equivalent production increased between 2007 and
2008. the decline in 2007 from 2006 was associated with
the impact of the contract conversion in venezuela and
the impact of higher prices on production-sharing
agreements.
the net liquids component of oil-equivalent
production was 1.3million barrels per day in 2008, a
decrease of 5percent from 2007 and 9percent from
2006. net natural gas production of 3.6billion cubic
feet per day in 2008 was up 9percent and 15percent
from 2007 and 2006, respectively.

u.s downstream earnings of $1.4billion in 2008
increased about $400million from 2007 due mainly to
improved margins on the sale of refined products and
gains on derivative commodity instruments. operating
expenses were higher between periods. income of $966
million in 2007 decreased nearly $1billion from 2006.
the decline was associated mainly with lower refined-product margins and higher planned and unplanned
refinery downtime than a year earlier. operating
expenses were also higher in 2007 than in 2006.
sales volumes of refined products were 1.41million barrels
per day in 2008, a decrease of 3percent from 2007.
the decline was associated with reduced sales of
gasoline and fuel oil. sales volumes of refined
products were 1.46million barrels per day in 2007, a
decrease of 3percent from 2006. the reported sales
volume for 2007 was on a different basis than 2006 due
to a change in accounting rules that became effective
april1, 2006, for certain purchase-and-sale (buy/
sell) contracts with the same counterparty. excluding
the
impact of this accounting standard, refined-product sales in 2007 decreased 1percent from
2006. branded gasoline sales volumes of 601,000 barrels per day in 2008 was
down about 4percent and 2percent from 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

in 2007 included gains of approximately $1billion on
the sale of assets, which included an interest in a
refinery and marketing assets in the benelux region of
europe. the $500million improvement otherwise between
years was associated primarily with a benefit from
gains on derivative commodity instruments that was only
partially offset by the impact of lower margins on the
sale of refined products. foreign currency effects
increased earnings by $193million in 2008, compared
with $62million in 2007. income in 2007 of $2.5
billion increased $500million from 2006, largely due
to the gains on asset sales. margins on the sale of
refined products in 2007 were up slightly from 2006.

earnings were $182million, compared with $396million
and $539million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
earnings declined in 2008 due to lower sales volumes of
commodity chemicals by cpchem. higher expenses for
planned maintenance activities also contributed to the
earnings decline. earnings also declined for the
companys oronite subsidiary due to lower volumes and
higher operating expenses. in 2007, earnings of $396
million decreased $143million from 2006 due to the impact
of lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals by
cpchem that were only partially offset by improved
margins on oronites sales of additives for lubricants

results in 2008 included net
unfavorable
corporate tax items and increased costs of environmental remediation for sites that previously had been
closed or sold. foreign exchange effects also contributed to the
increase in net charges between years. net charges of $26million in
2007 decreased $490million from 2006 due mainly to the

income from equity affiliates increased in 2008 from 2007 on improved upstream-related
earnings at tengizchevroil (tco)due to higher prices for crude oil. lower income from equity affiliates
between 2006 and 2007 was mainly due to a decline in earnings from cpchem, dynegy (sold in
may2007) and downstream affiliates in the asia-pacific area. partially offsetting these declines
were improved results for tco and income for a full year from petroboscan, which was converted from

effective income tax rates were 44percent in 2008, 42percent in 2007 and 46percent in 2006.
rates were higher between 2007 and 2008 primarily due to a greater proportion of income earned in
tax jurisdictions with higher income tax rates. in addition, the 2007 period included a relatively
low effective tax rate on the sale of the companys investment in dynegy common stock and the sale
of downstream assets in europe. rates were lower in 2007 compared with 2006 due mainly to the
impact of nonrecurring items in 2007 mentioned above and the absence of 2006 charges related to a
tax-law change that increased tax rates on upstream operations in the u.k. north sea and the
settlement of a tax claim in venezuela. refer also to the discussion of income taxes in note 16

liquidity and capital resources
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total balances were $9.6billion and $8.1billion
at december31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was
$29.6billion, compared with $25.0billion in 2007 and $24.3billion in 2006.
cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
approximately $800million, $300million and $400million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
cash provided by investing activities included proceeds from asset sales of $1.5billion in 2008,
$3.3billion in 2007 and $1.0billion in 2006.
at december31, 2008, restricted cash of $367million associated with capital-investment projects
at the companys pascagoula, mississippi, refinery and angola liquefied natural gas project was
invested in short-term marketable securities and reclassified from cash equivalents to a long-term
asset on the consolidated balance sheet.
dividends the company paid dividends of approximately $5.2billion in 2008, $4.8billion in
2007 and $4.4billion in 2006. in april2008, the company increased its quarterly common stock
dividend by 12.1percent to $0.65 per share.
debt, capital lease and minority interest obligations total debt and capital lease balances
were $8.9billion at december 31, 2008, up from $7.2billion at year-end 2007. the company also
had minority interest obligations of $469million and $204million at december31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
the $1.7billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2008 included the
net effect of an approximate $2.7billion increase in commercial paper and $749million of chevron
canada funding company bonds that matured. the companys debt and capital lease obligations due
within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper and the current portion of long-term
debt, totaled $7.8billion at december31, 2008, up from $5.5billion at year-end 2007. of these
amounts, $5.0billion and $4.4billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period,
respectively. at year-end 2008, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use
of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by
committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.
at year-end 2008, the company had $5billion in committed credit facilities with various major
banks, which permit the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these
facilities support commercial-paper borrowing and also can be used for general corporate purposes. the companys
practice has been to continually
fs-10
table of contents
replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining
levels management believes appropriate. terms of new commitments in the future will be subject to
market conditions at the time of renewal. any borrowings under the facilities would be
unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on london interbank offered rate or an average of
base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong
credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2008. in
addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in march2010 for
an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. in
january2009, the companys board of directors authorized the issuance of one or more series of
notes or debentures in an aggregate amount up to $5billion for a term not to exceed ten years.
at december31, 2008, the company had outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation
profit sharing/savings plan trust fund, texaco capital inc. and union oil company of california.
all of these securities are guaranteed by chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and
poors corporation and aa1 by moodys investors service. the companys u.s. commercial paper is
rated a-1+ by standard and poors and p-1 by moodys. all of these ratings denote high-quality,
investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. during periods of
low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity
chemicals, the company has the flexibility to increase borrowings and/or modify capital-spending
plans to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the companys high-quality debt
ratings.
common stock repurchase program in september2007, the company authorized the acquisition of
up to $15billion of additional common shares from time to time at prevailing prices, as permitted
by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors.
the program is for a period of up to three years and may be discontinued at any time. through
december31, 2008, 119million shares had been acquired under the program for $10.1billion,
including $8.0billion in 2008. these amounts include shares acquired in october2008 as part of an
asset-exchange transaction described in note 2 beginning on page fs-34. the company did not acquire
any shares in early 2009 and does not plan to acquire any shares in the 2009 first quarter.
capital and exploratory expenditures total reported expenditures for 2008 were $22.8billion,
including $2.3billion for the companys share of affiliates expenditures, which did not require
cash outlays by the company. in 2007 and 2006, expenditures were $20.0billion and $16.6billion,
respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $2.3billion and $1.9
billion in the corresponding periods.
of the $22.8billion in expenditures for 2008, about three-fourths, or $17.5billion, related
to upstream activities. approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream operations
in 2007 and 2006. international upstream accounted for about 70percent of the worldwide
upstream
investment in each of the three years, reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities
that are available outside the united states.
the company estimates that in 2009, capital and exploratory expenditures will be $22.8
billion, including $1.8billion of spending by affiliates. about three-fourths of the total, or
$17.5billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $13.9billion of this
amount outside the united states. spending in 2009 is primarily targeted for exploratory prospects
in the deepwater u.s. gulf of mexico, western africa, and the gulf of thailand and major
development projects in angola, australia, brazil, indonesia, nigeria, thailand and the deepwater
u.s. gulf of mexico. also included are one-time payments associated with upstream operating
agreements in china and the partitioned neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait.

worldwide downstream spending in 2009 is
estimated at $4.3billion, with about $2.0billion
for projects in the united states. capital projects
include upgrades to refineries in the united states
and south korea and construction of a gas-to-liquids
facility in support of associated upstream projects.
investments in chemicals, technology and other
corporate businesses in 2009 are budgeted at $1.0
billion. technology investments include projects
related to unconventional hydrocarbon technologies, oil
and gas reservoir management, and gas-fired and
renewable power generation.
pension obligationsin 2008, the companys
pension plan contributions were $839million (including
$577million to the u.s. plans). the company estimates
contributions in 2009 will be approximately $800
million. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon
plan-investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic
factors. additional funding may be required if
investment returns are insufficient to offset
increases in plan obligations. refer also to the
discussion of pension accounting in critical
accounting estimates and assumptions, beginning on

there are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the
affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of
any amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has
recorded no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.
indemnificationsthe company provided certain
indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and
motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in
connection with the february2002 sale of the companys
interests in those investments. the company would be
required to perform if the indemnified liabilities
become actual losses. were that to occur, the company
could be required to make future payments up to $300
million. through the end of 2008, the company had paid
$48million under these indemnities and continues to be
obligated for possible additional indemnification
payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating
to contingent environmental liabilities related to
assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon
and motiva joint ventures and environmental conditions
that existed prior to the formation of equilon and
motiva or that occurred during the period of texacos
ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general,
the environmental conditions or events that are subject
to these indemnities must have arisen prior to december
2001. claims must be asserted no later than february
2009 for equilon indemnities and no later than february
2012 for motiva indemnities. under the terms of these
indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of
potential future payments. in february2009, shell delivered a
letter to the company purporting to preserve
unmatured claims for certain equilon indemnities. the letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount,
and management does not believe the letter provides a basis to estimate the amount, if any, of a range of loss or potential
range of loss with respect to equilon or the motiva indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral
and has made no payments under the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described
above are to be net of amounts recovered from insurance
carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by
equilon or motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any
applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed
certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that
were sold in 1997. under the indemnification
agreement, the companys liability is unlimited until
april2022, when the indemnification expires. the
acquirer shares in certain environmental remediation
costs up to a maximum obligation of $200million, which
had not been reached as of december31, 2008.
securitizationduring 2008, the company terminated
the program used to securitize downstream-related trade
accounts receivable. at year-end 2007, the balance of
securitized receivables was $675million. as of
december31, 2008, the company had no other
securitization arrangements in place.
minority intereststhe company has commitments of $469million
related to minority interests in subsidiary companies.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreementsthe company and its subsidiaries have
certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to
suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and
storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the
ordinary course of the companys business. the
aggregate approximate amounts of required payments
under these various commitments are: 2009  $6.4
billion; 2010  $4.0billion; 2011  $3.6billion;
2012  $1.5billion; 2013  $1.3billion; 2014 and
after  $4.3billion. a portion of these commitments
may ultimately be shared with project partners. total
payments under the agreements were approximately $5.1
billion in 2008, $3.7billion in 2007 and $3.0
billion in 2006.

derivative
commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related
to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas,
natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments
to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity,
including firm commitments and anticipated
transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of
crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas
liquids and feedstock for company refineries. the
company also uses derivative commodity instruments for
limited trading purposes. the results of this activity
were not material to the companys financial position,
net income or cash flows in 2008.
the companys market
exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily
basis by an internal risk control group to ensure
compliance with the companys risk management policies
that have been approved by the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
the derivative instruments used in the companys
risk management and trading activities consist mainly
of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the
nymex (new york mercantile exchange) and on electronic
platforms of ice (inter-continental exchange) and
globex (chicago mercantile exchange). in addition,
crude oil, natural gas and refined-product swap
contracts and option contracts are entered into
principally with major financial institutions and
other oil and gas companies in the over-the-counter
markets.
virtually all derivatives beyond those
designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance
sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in
income. fair values are derived principally from
published market quotes and other independent
third-party quotes. the change in fair value from
chevrons derivative commodity instruments in 2008 was
a quarterly average increase of $160million in total
assets and a quarterly average decrease of $1million
in total liabilities.
the company uses a value-at-risk
(var) model to estimate the potential loss in fair
value on a single day from the effect of adverse
changes in market conditions on derivative instruments
held or issued, which are recorded on the balance sheet
at december31, 2008, as derivative instruments in
accordance with fas statement no.133, accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities, as
amended (fas 133). var is the maximum loss not to be
exceeded within a given probability or confidence
level over a given period of time. the companys var
model uses the monte carlo simulation method that
involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the
specified probability distribution and constructing a
full distribution of a portfolios potential values.
the var model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving
average for computing historical volatilities and
correlations, a 95percent confidence level, and a
one-day holding period. that is, the companys 95
percent, one-day var corresponds to the unrealized loss
in portfolio value that would not be exceeded on
average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the
portfolio were held constant for one day.
the one-day holding period is based on the
assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated
or hedged within one day. for hedging and risk
management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options
as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most of which can
be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. the
table below presents the 95percent/one-day var for
each of the companys primary risk exposures in the
area of derivative commodity instruments at december
31, 2008 and 2007. the higher amounts in 2008 were
associated with an increase in price volatility for
these commodities during the year.

foreign currencythe company enters into forward
exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180days
or less, to manage some of its foreign currency
exposures. these exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign
currency capital expenditures and lease commitments,
forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward
exchange contracts are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical 10percent
increase in the value of the u.s. dollar at year-end
2008 would be a reduction in the fair value of the
foreign exchange contracts of approximately $100
million. the effect would be the opposite for a
hypothetical 10percent decrease in the value of the
u.s. dollar at year-end 2008.
interest
rates the company enters into
interest-rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on
its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net cash
settlements are based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated
by reference to agreed notional principal amounts.
interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair
value hedges. interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at year-end 2008, the company had no
interest-rate swaps on floating-rate debt. the
companys only interest-rate swaps on fixed-rate debt
matured in january2009.

transactions with related parties
chevron enters into a number of business arrangements
with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. these arrangements include long-term supply or
offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements.

agreements
have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an
unrelated party.
litigation and other contingencies
mtbechevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. in october2008, 59 cases were settled in which the company
was a party and which related to the use of mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged
seepage of mtbe into groundwater. the terms of this agreement are confidential and not material to
the companys results of operations, liquidity or financial position.
chevron is a party to 37 other pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous
other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately
require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior
release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and claims related to the use
of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. the settlement of the 59
lawsuits did not set any precedents related to standards of liability to be used to judge the
merits of the claims, corrective measures required or monetary damages to be assessed for the
remaining lawsuits and claims or future lawsuits and claims. as a result, the companys ultimate
exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but could be
material to net income in any one period. the company no longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of
gasoline in the united states.
rfg patentfourteen purported class actions were brought by consumers who purchased
reformulated gasoline (rfg)from january1995 through august2005, alleging that unocal misled the
california air resources board into adopting standards for composition of rfg that overlapped with
unocals undisclosed and pending patents. the parties agreed to a settlement that calls for, among
other things, unocal to pay $48million and for the establishment of a cy pres fund to administer
payout of the award. the court approved the final settlement in november2008.
ecuadorchevron is a
defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio, ecuador,
brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain residents of an area
where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit alleges damage to the
environment from the oil exploration and production operations, and seeks unspecified damages to
fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health
monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of texaco inc., was
a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned
oil company, as
the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador. at the
conclusion of the consortium and following an
independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, texpet entered into a
formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific
sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the consortium.
pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40
million. after certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted texpet
and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising
from the consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively to chevron; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of
limitations in ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability
previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador. with regard to the facts,
the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted
and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its
legal obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the
operations.
in april2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $8billion, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems, and additional infrastructure for
petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an additional $8.3billion could be assessed
against chevron for unjust enrichment. the engineers report is not binding on the court. chevron
also believes that the engineers work was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary
to law and in violation of the courts orders. chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which
it asked the court to strike the report in its entirety. in november2008, the engineer revised the
report and, without additional evidence, recommended an increase in the financial compensation for
purported damages to a total of $18.9billion and an increase in the assessment for purported
unjust enrichment to a total of $8.4billion. chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report,
and chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition of liability.
management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can
be made in this case. due to the defects associated with the engineers report, management does not
believe the report itself has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of
loss). moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no
basis for management to
fs-15
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
estimate a reasonable possible loss (or a range of loss).
environmental the company is
subject to loss contingencies pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations that in
the future may require the company to take
action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release
of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the company
or other parties. such
contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under
state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and
mining operations, whether operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown
timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such
costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

included in the $1,818million year-end 2008 reserve balance were remediation activities of
248 sites for which
the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise
involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)or other regulatory
agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws. the companys
remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2008 was $120million. the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint
and several liability for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other
regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the companys
consolidated financial position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2008 environmental reserves balance of $1,698million, $968million
related to current and former sites for the companys u.s. downstream operations, including
refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), and
pipelines. the remaining $730million was associated with various sites in international downstream
($117million), upstream ($390million), chemicals ($154million) and other ($69million).
liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the
companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and
other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite
disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum
hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the
natural attenuation of the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2008 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
the company accounts for asset retirement obligations in
accordance with fasb statement no.143, accounting for asset retirement obligations (fas 143).
under fas 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when
there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability
can be
fs-16
table of contents
reasonably estimated. the liability balance of approximately $9.4billion for asset
retirement obligations at year-end 2008 related primarily to upstream properties.
for the companys
other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made
for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful
lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the
indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of
the asset retirement obligation.

in 2005 of fasb interpretation no. (fin)47, accounting for conditional asset retirement
obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no.143 (fin 47), and the discussion of
environmental matters below.
income taxesthe company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. refer to note 16 beginning on page fs-45 for a discussion of the periods for which tax
returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax
jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the company does not
expect that settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have
a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008, which contained a number of energy and tax-related
provisions, known as the energy improvement and extension act of 2008 (the act), was signed into
u.s. law in october2008. the act includes two provisions that affect chevrons tax liability,
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008. the act freezes at 6percent the domestic manufacturers
deduction on income from u.s. oil and gas operations that was scheduled to increase to 9percent in
2010. effective in 2009, the act expands the current foreign tax credit (ftc)limitation for
foreign oil and gas extraction income to also include foreign downstream income, known as foreign
oil related income. this change is expected to impact chevrons utilization of ftcs.
suspended wellsthe company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude oil and natural gas fields. the
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity or
development decisions or both. at december31, 2008, the company had approximately $2.1billion of
suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $458
million from 2007. the 2007 balance reflected an increase of $421million from 2006.
the future
trend of the companys exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated with well
write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as to whether
the well had found reserves
that could be classified as proved. the effect on exploration expenses
in future periods of the $2.1billion of suspended wells at year-end 2008 is uncertain pending
future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.

to note 20, beginning on page fs-48, for additional discussion of suspended wells.
equity redeterminationfor oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide
for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves.
these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve at elk hills,
california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the u.s.
department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
for this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200million, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to chevron is
estimated at about $150million. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this
range of estimates are uncertain.
other contingencies chevron receives claims from and submits
claims to customers; trading partners; u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies;
governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in
the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell,
exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve
competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains
or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. an obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill
these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past
operations followed practices and procedures that were con-

acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to
meet current standards.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2008 at approximately $3.1billion for its
consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were approximately $1.3billion of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.8billion of costs
associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of
hazardous substances and pollutants
from operating, closed or divested
sites, and the abandonment and
restoration of sites.
for 2009, total worldwide
environmental capital expenditures are
estimated at $2.2billion. these
capital costs are in addition to the
ongoing costs of complying with
environmental regulations and the
costs to remediate previously
contaminated sites.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the
amount of additional investments in new or existing
facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs
to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control,
reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials
into the environment; comply with existing and new
environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and
restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous
materials. although these costs may be significant to
the results of operations in any single period, the
company does not expect them to have a material effect
on the companys liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and assumptions in
the application of generally accepted accounting
principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on
the companys consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures and on the comparability of such
information over different reporting periods. all such
estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on managements
experience and other information available prior to the
issuance of the financial statements. materially
different results can occur as circumstances change and
additional information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of critical
accounting estimates or assumptions is according to
the disclosure guidelines of the securities and
exchange commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates or
assumptions is material due to the levels of
subjectivity and judgment neces-
sary to
account for highly uncertain matters or the
susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.
the impact of the estimates and
assumptions on the companys financial
condition or operating performance is
material.
besides those meeting these critical criteria,
the company makes many other accounting estimates and
assumptions in preparing its financial statements and
related disclosures. although not associated with
highly uncertain matters, these estimates and
assumptions are also subject to revision as
circumstances warrant, and materially different
results may sometimes occur.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets
requires an assessment under the accounting rules that
the future realization of the associated tax benefits
be more likely than not. another example is the
estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves under
sec rules that require ... geological and engineering
data (that)demonstrate with reasonable certainty
(reserves)to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the
estimate is made. refer to table v, reserve quantity
information, beginning on page fs-67, for the changes
in these estimates for the three years ending december
31, 2008, and to table vii, changes in the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows from proved reserves on page fs-74 for estimates
of proved-reserve values for each of the three years
ended december31, 2008, which were based on year-end
prices at the time. note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, beginning on page fs-32, includes
a description of the successful efforts method of
accounting for oil and gas exploration and production
activities. the estimates of crude oil and natural gas
reserves are important to the timing of expense
recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical accounting policy
for impairment of properties, plant and equipment
and investments in affiliates, beginning on page
fs-20, includes reference to conditions under which
downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could
result in impairments of oil and gas properties. this
commentary should be read in conjunction with
disclosures elsewhere in this discussion and in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements
related to estimates, uncertainties, contingencies
and new accounting standards. significant accounting
policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, beginning on page fs-32. the
development and selection of accounting estimates
fs-18
table of contents
and
assumptions, including those deemed critical, and
the associated disclosures in this discussion have
been discussed by management with the audit committee
of the board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated
critical estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plans
the determination of pension-plan obligations and
expense is based on a number of actuarial
assumptions. two critical assumptions are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. for other postretirement benefit (opeb)
plans, which provide for certain health care and life
insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees
and which are not funded, critical assumptions in
determining opeb obligations and expense are the
discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend
rates.
note 22, beginning on page fs-51, includes
information on the funded status of the companys
pension and opeb plans at the end of 2008 and 2007; the
components of pension and opeb expense for the three
years ending december31, 2008; and the underlying
assumptions for those periods.
pension and opeb expense is recorded on the
consolidated statement of income in operating
expenses or selling, general and administrative
expenses and applies to all business segments. the
year-end 2008 and 2007 funded status, measured as the
difference between plan assets and obligations, of each
of the companys pension and opeb plans is recognized
on the consolidated balance sheet. the funded status of
overfunded pension plans is recorded as a long-term
asset in deferred charges and other assets. the
funded status of underfunded or unfunded pension and
opeb plans is recorded in accrued liabilities or
reserves for employee benefit plans. amounts yet to
be recognized as components of pension or opeb expense
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
to estimate the long-term rate of return on
pension assets, the company uses a process that
incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and
an assessment of expected future performance and takes
into consideration external actuarial advice and
asset-class factors. asset allocations are periodically
updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and
the determination of the companys estimates of
long-term rates of return are consistent with these
studies. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s.
pension plan assets, which account for 68percent of
the companys pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8
percent since 2002. for the 10years ending december
31, 2008, actual asset returns averaged 3.7percent for
this plan. the actual asset returns for the 10years
ending december31, 2007, averaged 8.7percent. the
actual return for 2008 was negative and was associated
with the broad decline in the financial markets in the
second half of the year.
the year-end market-related value of assets of the
major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market value in the
preceding three months, as opposed to the maximum
allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting
rules. management considers the three-month period long
enough to minimize the effects of distortions from
day-to-day market volatility and still be
contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other
plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in
calculating the pension expense.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine
u.s. and international pension and postretirement
benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the
prevailing rates available on high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. at december 31, 2008,
the company selected a 6.3percent discount rate for
the major u.s. pension and postretirement plans. this
rate was selected based on a cash flow analysis that
matched estimated future benefit payments to the
citigroup pension discount yield curve as of year-end
2008. the discount rates at the end of 2007 and 2006
were 6.3percent and 5.8percent, respectively.
an increase in the expected long-term return on
plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension
plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2008 was
$770million. as an indication of the sensitivity of
pension expense to the long-term rate of return
assumption, a 1percent increase in the expected rate
of return on assets of the companys primary u.s.
pension plan would have reduced total pension plan
expense for 2008 by approximately $70million. a 1
percent increase in the discount rate for this same
plan, which accounted for about 61percent of the
companywide pension obligation, would have reduced
total pension plan expense for 2008 by approximately
$140million.
an increase in the discount rate would decrease
the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status
of a plan recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
the total pension liability on the consolidated balance
sheet at december31, 2008, for underfunded plans was
approximately $4.0billion. as an indication of the
sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount
rate assumption, a 0.25percent increase in the
discount rate applied to the companys primary u.s.
pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by
approximately $250million, which would have decreased
the plans underfunded status from approximately $2.0
billion to $1.8billion. other plans would be less
under-funded as discount rates increase. the actual
rates of return on plan assets and discount rates may
vary significantly from estimates because of
unanticipated changes in the worlds financial
markets.
in 2008, the companys pension plan contributions
were $839million (including $577million to the u.s.
plans). in 2009, the company estimates contributions
will be approximately $800million. actual contribution
amounts are
fs-19
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
dependent upon plan-investment results,
changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements
and other economic factors. additional funding may be
required if investment returns are insufficient to
offset increases in plan obligations.
for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2008
was $179million and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of
2008, was $2.9billion.
as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to
the determination of opeb expense in 2008, a 1percent
increase in the discount rate for the companys primary
u.s. opeb plan, which accounted for about 67percent of
the companywide opeb expense, would have decreased opeb
expense by approximately $20million. a 0.25percent
increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 86percent of the companywide opeb
liabilities, would have decreased total opeb
liabilities at the end of 2008 by approximately $56
million.
for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the
annual increase to company contributions is limited to
4percent per year. for active employees and retirees
under age 65 whose claims experiences are combined for
rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend
rates start with 7percent in 2009 and gradually drop
to 5percent for 2017 and beyond. as an indication of
the health care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the
determination of opeb expense in 2008, a 1percent
increase in the rates for the main u.s. opeb plan,
which accounted for 86percent of the companywide opeb
liabilities, would have increased opeb expense $8
million.
differences between the various assumptions used
to determine expense and the funded status of each
plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference occurs.
instead, the differences are included in actuarial
gain/loss and unamortized amounts have been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on
the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 22,
beginning on page fs-51, for information on the $6.0
billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by
the company as of december31, 2008; a description of
the method used to amortize those costs; and an
estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense
during 2009.
impairment of properties, plant and equipment and
investments in affiliatesthe company assesses its
properties, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not
be recoverable. such indicators include changes in the
companys business plans, changes in commodity prices
and, for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated
proved-reserve
quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds
the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the
asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess
of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair
value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset
is impaired involves management estimates on highly
uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the
effects of inflation and technology improvements on
operating expenses, production profiles, and the
outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand
conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity
chemicals and refined products. however, the
impairment reviews and calculations are based on
assumptions that are consistent with the companys
business plans and long-term investment decisions.
no major individual impairments of pp&e were
recorded for the three years ending december31, 2008.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these
periods if other assumptions had been used in
impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not
practicable, given the broad range of the companys
pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in the
estimates. that is, favorable changes to some
assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any
assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable
changes might have caused an additional unknown
number of other assets to become impaired.
investments in common stock of affiliates that
are accounted for under the equity method, as well as
investments in other securities of these equity
investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair
value of the investment falls below the companys
carrying value. when such a decline is deemed to be
other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded
to the income statement for the difference between the
investments carrying value and its estimated fair
value at the time. in making the determination as to whether a decline is
other than temporary, the company considers such
factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the
investees financial performance, and the companys
ability and intention to retain its investment for a
period that will be sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
differing assumptions could affect whether an
investment is impaired in any period or the amount of
the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity
analysis.
from time to time, the company performs
impairment reviews and determines whether any
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset
group is required. for example, when significant
downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas
reserves are made for any single field or concession,
an impairment review is performed to determine if the
carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. also,
if the expectation
fs-20
table of contents
of sale of a particular asset or
asset group in any period has been deemed more likely
than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the
asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required.
such calculations are reviewed each period until the
asset or asset group is disposed of. assets that are
not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly
become impaired if a decision is made to sell such
assets. that is, the assets would be impaired if they
are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated
proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less
than the assets associated carrying values.
business combinations  purchase-price allocationaccounting
for business combinations requires the
allocation of the companys purchase price to the
various assets and liabilities of the acquired business
at their respective fair values. the company uses all
available information to make these fair value
determinations, and for major acquisitions, may hire an
independent appraisal firm to assist in making fair
value estimates. in some instances, assumptions with
respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and
expenses associated with an asset might have to be used
in determining its fair value. actual timing and amount
of net cash flows from revenues and expenses related
to that asset over time may differ materially from
those initial estimates, and if the timing is delayed
significantly or if the net cash flows decline significantly, the asset could become impaired. effective
january1, 2009, the accounting for business
combinations will change. refer to note 19 on page
fs-48.
goodwillgoodwill
resulting from a business
combination is not subject to amortization. as required
by fasb statement no.142, goodwill and other
intangible assets, the company tests such goodwill at
the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual
basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount.
contingent lossesmanagement also makes judgments
and estimates in recording liabilities for claims,
litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation.
actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a
variety of reasons. for example, the costs from
settlement of claims and litigation can vary from
estimates based on differing interpretations of laws,
opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount
of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in
laws, regulations and their interpretation, the
determination of additional information on the extent
and nature of site contamination, and improvements in
technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is
generally recorded for these types of contingencies if
management determines the loss to be both probable and
estimable. the company generally records these losses
as operating expenses or selling, general and
administrative expenses on the consolidated statement
of income. an exception to this handling is for income
tax matters, for which ben-
efits are recognized only
if management determines the tax position is more
likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50
percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. for
additional discussion of income tax uncertainties,
refer to note 16 beginning on page fs-45. refer also to
the business segment discussions elsewhere in this
section for the effect on earnings from losses
associated with certain litigation, and environmental
remediation and tax matters for the three years ended
december31, 2008.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for
these periods if other assumptions had been used in
recording these liabilities is not practicable because
of the number of contingencies that must be assessed,
the number of underlying assumptions and the wide
range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms
of the probability of loss and the estimates of such
loss.
new accounting standards
fasb statement no.141 (revised 2007), business
combinations (fas 141-r)in
december2007, the fasb
issued fas 141-r, which became effective for business
combination transactions having an acquisition date on
or after january1, 2009. this standard requires the
acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize
the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
acquisition date to be measured at their respective
fair values. it also requires acquisition-related
costs, as well as restructuring costs the acquirer
expects to incur for which it is not obligated at
acquisition date, to be recorded against income rather
than included in purchase-price determination. finally,
the standard requires recognition of contingent
arrangements at their acquisition-date fair values,
with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in income.
fasb
staff position fas 141(r)-a accounting for assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination (fsp fas
141(r)-a)in february 2009, the fasb approved
for issuance fsp fas 141(r)-a, which became effective for business
combinations having an acquisition date on or after january1,
2009. this standard requires an asset or liability arising from a
contingency in a business combination to be recognized at fair value
if fair value can be reasonably determined. if it cannot be
reasonably determined then the asset or liability will need to be
recognized in accordance with fasb statement no. 5, accounting for
contingencies, and fasb interpretation no. 14, reasonable estimation
of the amount of the loss.
fasb statement no.160, noncontrolling interests
in consolidated financial statements, an amendment of
arb no.51 (fas 160)the
fasb issued fas 160 in
december2007, which became effective for the company
january1, 2009, with retroactive adoption of the
standards presentation and
disclosure requirements for existing minority
interests. this standard requires ownership interests
in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
to be presented within the
fs-21
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
equity section of the
consolidated balance sheet but separate from the
parents equity. it also requires the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified
and presented on the face of the consolidated
statement of income. certain changes in a parents
ownership interest are to be accounted for as equity
transactions and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated,
any noncontrolling equity investment in the former
subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value.
implementation of fas 160 will not significantly
change the presentation of the companys consolidated
statement of income or consolidated balance sheet.
fasb statement no.161, disclosures about
derivative instruments and hedging activities (fas 161)in
march2008, the fasb issued fas 161, which became
effective for the company on january1, 2009. this
standard amends and expands the disclosure requirements
of fasb statement no.133, accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities. fas 161 requires
disclosures related to objectives and strategies for
using derivatives; the fair-value amounts of, and gains
and losses on, derivative instruments; and
credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative
agreements. the companys disclosures for derivative
instruments will
be expanded to include a tabular
representation of the location and fair value amounts
of derivative instruments on the balance sheet, fair
value gains and losses on the income statement and
gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges
recognized in earnings and other comprehensive income.
fasb staff position fas 132(r)-1, employers
disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets
(fsp fas 132(r)-1)in
december2008, the fasb issued
fsp fas 132(r)-1, which becomes effective with the
companys reporting at december31, 2009. this standard
amends and expands the disclosure requirements on the
plan assets of defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans to provide users of financial
statements with an understanding of: how investment
allocation decisions are made; the major categories of
plan assets; the inputs and valuation techniques used
to measure the fair value of plan assets; the effect of
fair-value measurements using significant unobservable
inputs on changes in plan assets for the period; and
significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
the company does not prefund its other postretirement
plan obligations, and the effect on the companys
disclosures for its pension plan assets as a result of
the adoption of fsp fas 132(r)-1 will depend on the
companys plan assets at that time.

report
of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevron corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of chevron corporation and its
subsidiaries at december31, 2008 and december31, 2007
and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended december31, 2008 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america. in addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. also in our opinion, the company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of december31, 2008
based on criteria established in internal control
integrated framework issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission
(coso). the companys management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying managements report on internal control
over financial reporting. our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the
financial statement schedule, and on the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the public company accounting
oversight board (united states). those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
as discussed in note 14 to the consolidated
financial statements, the company changed its method
of accounting for buy/sell contracts on april1, 2006.
as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated
financial statements, the company changed its method
of accounting for uncertain income tax positions on
january1, 2007.
a companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. a companys internal
control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

summary of significant accounting policies
generalexploration and production (upstream)operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas and marketing natural gas. refining, marketing and
transportation (downstream)operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude
oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car.
chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.
the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.
the nature of the companys operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. the company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent-owned and variable-interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to
50percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity
currently in income.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of
the investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investees financial
performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period
that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. the
new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in
fair value.
differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying
equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets
and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the
difference. when appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between
these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values.
derivativesthe majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. for the companys commodity trading activity and foreign currency exposures, gains
and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. interest rate swaps
hedging a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt  are accounted for as fair value hedges,
whereas interest rate swaps relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded
at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in
income. where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable
amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are offset on the
balance sheet.
short-term investmentsall short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents.
the balance of the short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and is
marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income.
inventoriescrude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost, using a
last-in, first-out (lifo)method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials,
supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost.

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies - continued
properties, plant and equipmentthe successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have
found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when
the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. all other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 20, beginning
on page fs-48, for additional
discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.

are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the united states, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. in the refining, marketing, transportation and
chemical areas, impairment reviews are generally done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a
marketing area or marketing assets by country. impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value.
as required under financial accounting standards board (fasb)statement no.143, accounting
for asset retirement obligations (fas 143), the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as
an asset and a liability when there is a
legal obligation associated with the retirement of a
long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. refer also to note 24, beginning on
page fs-58, relating to aros.
depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude
oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the
unit-of-production method generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are
produced. depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using
the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced.
periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are
expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses for mining assets are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. the capitalized costs of all other
plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the
straight-line method generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as other income.
expenditures for maintenance (including
those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in
operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. major replacements and renewals are
capitalized.
goodwillgoodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as required
by fasb statement no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets, the company tests such goodwill at
the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit below its carrying amount.
environmental expendituresenvironmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and
canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future
remediation commitment will be required. for crude oil, natural gas and

is made, following fas 143. refer to note 24,
beginning on page fs-58, for a discussion of fas 143.
for federal superfund sites and analogous sites
under state laws, the company records a liability for
its designated share of the probable and estimable
costs and probable amounts for other potentially
responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory
agencies because the other parties are not able to pay
their respective shares.
the gross amount of environmental liabilities is
based on the companys best estimate of future costs
using currently available technology and applying
current regulations and the companys own internal
environmental policies. future amounts are not
discounted. recoveries or reimbursements are recorded
as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translationthe u.s. dollar is the functional
currency for substantially all of the companys
consolidated operations and those of its equity
affiliates. for those operations, all gains and losses
from currency translations are currently included in
income. the cumulative translation effects for those
few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using
functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar are
included in the currency translation adjustment in
stockholders equity.
revenue recognitionrevenues associated with sales of
crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and chemicals
products, and all other sources are recorded when title
passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and
allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas
production from properties in which chevron has an
interest with other producers are generally recognized
on the basis of the companys net working interest
(entitlement method). excise, value-added and similar
taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a
customer are presented on a gross basis. the associated
amounts are shown as a footnote to the consolidated
statement of income on page fs-27. refer to note 14, on
page fs-43, for a discussion of the accounting for
buy/sell arrangements.
stock options and other share-based compensationthe
company issues stock options and other share-based
compensation to its employees and accounts for these
transactions under the provisions of fasb statement
no.123r, share-based payment (fas 123r). for equity
awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost
is based on the grant date fair value and for
liability awards,
such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation
cost is based on the settlement
value. the company recognizes stock-based
compensation expense for all awards over the service
period required to earn the award, which is the
shorter of the vesting period or the time period an
employee becomes eligible to retain the award at
retirement. stock options and stock appreciation
rights granted under the companys long-term incentive
plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third
of each award vests on the first, second and third
anniversaries of the date of grant. the company
amortizes these newly issued graded awards on a
straight-line basis.

options are presented as financing cash inflows in the

in accordance with the cash-flow classification
requirements of fas 123r, share-based payment, the net
decrease in operating working capital includes
reductions of $106, $96 and $94 for excess income tax
benefits associated with stock options exercised during
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. these amounts are
offset by net purchases of treasury shares.
in 2008, net purchases of other short-term
investments consist of $367 in restricted cash
associated with capital-investment projects at the
companys pascagoula, mississippi refinery and the
angola liquefied natural gas project that was invested
in short-term marketable securities and reclassified
from cash and cash equivalents to deferred charges
and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. in
2007, the company issued a $650 tax exempt mississippi
gulf opportunity zone bond as a source of funds for the
pascagoula refinery project.
the net purchases of treasury shares represents
the cost of common shares less the cost of shares
issued for share-based compensation plans. purchases
totaled $8,011, $7,036 and $5,033 in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.
the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2008
excludes changes to the consolidated balance sheet that
did not affect cash. net purchases of treasury shares
excludes $680 of treasury shares acquired in exchange
for a u.s. upstream property and $280 in cash. the
carrying value of this property in properties, plant
and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet was
not significant. the increase in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities excludes a $2,450 increase in
accrued liabilities that was offset to properties,
plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet.
this amount related to accruals associated with
upstream operating agreements outside the united
states. capital expenditures excludes a $1,400
increase in properties, plant and equipment (ppe)
related to the acquisition of an additional interest in
an equity affiliate that required a change to the
consolidated method of accounting for the investment
during 2008. this addition to ppe was offset primarily
by reductions in investments and advances and working
capital and an increase in noncurrent deferred income
tax liabilities. refer also to note 24 beginning on

financial and derivative instruments
derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to
market risks related to price volatility of crude oil,
refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids,
liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments
to manage these exposures on a portion of its
activity, including firm commitments and anticipated
transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of
crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas
liquids and feedstock for company refineries. from
time to time, the company also uses derivative
commodity instruments for limited trading
purposes.
the company uses international swaps and
derivatives association agreements to govern derivative
contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate
credit risk. depending on the nature of the derivative
transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may
also be required. when the company is engaged in more
than one outstanding derivative transaction with the
same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable
netting agreement with that counterparty, the net
mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the
positive and negative exposures with that counterparty
and is a reasonable measure of the companys credit
risk exposure. the company also uses other netting
agreements with certain counterparties with which it
conducts significant transactions to mitigate credit
risk.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are
reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable,
long-term receivables  net and deferred credits
and other noncurrent obligations. gains and losses on
the companys risk management activities
fs-36
table of contents
note 7
financial and
derivative instruments - continued
are reported as either sales and other operating
revenues or purchased crude oil and products,
whereas trading gains and losses are reported as other
income.
foreign currencythe company enters into forward
exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180days or
less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures.
these exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions, including foreign currency
capital expenditures and lease commitments, forecasted
to occur within 180days. the forward exchange
contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance
sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in
income.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are
reported on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts
and notes receivable or accounts payable, with gains
and losses reported as other income.
interest ratesthe company enters into interest rate
swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy
to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the
terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are based on
the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed
notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related
to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt are
accounted for as fair value hedges.
fair values of the interest rate swaps are
reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable or accounts payable.
interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at
year-end 2008, the company had no interest-rate swaps
on floating-rate debt.
fair valuefair values are derived from quoted market
prices, other independent third-party quotes or, if not
available, the present value of the expected cash flows. the fair values reflect the cash that would have
been received or paid if the instruments were settled
at year-end.
long-term debt of $1,221 and $2,132 had estimated
fair values of $1,414 and $2,354 at december31, 2008
and 2007, respectively.
the company holds cash equivalents and marketable
securities in u.s. and non-u.s. portfolios. the
instruments held are primarily time deposits, money
market funds and fixed rate bonds. cash equivalents and
marketable securities had carrying/fair values of
$7,271 and $5,427 at december31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. of these balances, $7,058 and $4,695 at
the respective year-ends were classified as cash
equivalents that had average maturities under 90days. the remainder, classified as marketable
securities, had average maturities of approximately one
year. at december31, 2008,
restricted cash with a
carrying/fair value of $367 that is related to
capital-investment projects at the companys
pascagoula, mississippi refinery and angola liquefied
natural gas project was reclassified from cash and
cash equivalents to deferred charges and other
assets on the consolidated balance sheet. this
restricted cash was invested in short-term marketable
securities.
fair values of other financial and derivative
instruments at the end of 2008 and 2007 were not
material.
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial
instruments that are exposed to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents,
marketable securities, derivative financial instruments
and trade receivables. the companys short-term
investments are placed with a wide array of financial
institutions with high credit ratings. this diversified
investment policy limits the companys exposure both to
credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk.
similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are
applied to the companys counterparties in derivative
instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the
companys diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed
among the companys broad customer base worldwide. as a
consequence, the company believes concentrations of
credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses
the financial strength of its customers. when the
financial strength of a customer is not considered
sufficient, requiring letters of credit is a principal
method used to support sales to customers.
note 8
fair value measurements
the company implemented fasb statement no.157, fair
value measurements (fas 157), as of january1, 2008.
fas 157 was amended in february2008 by fasb staff
position (fsp)fas no.157-1, application of fasb
statement no.157 to fasb statement no.13 and its
related interpretive accounting pronouncements that
address leasing transactions, and by fsp fas 157-2,
effective date of fasb statement no.157, which delayed
the companys application of fas 157 for nonrecurring
nonfinancial assets and liabilities until january1,
2009. fas 157 was further amended in october2008 by
fsp fas 157-3, determining the fair value of a
financial asset when the market for that asset is not
active, which clarifies the application of fas 157 to
assets participating in inactive markets.
implementation of fas 157 did not have a material
effect on the companys results of operations or
consolidated financial position and had no effect on
the companys existing fair-value measurement
practices. however, fas 157 requires disclosure of a
fair-value hierarchy of inputs the

company uses to value an asset or a liability. the
three levels of the fair-value hierarchy are described
as follows:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted)in active
markets for identical assets and liabilities. for
the company, level 1 inputs include
exchange-traded futures contracts for which the
parties are willing to transact at the
exchange-quoted price and marketable securities
that are actively traded.
level 2: inputs other than level 1 that are
observable, either directly or indirectly. for the
company, level 2 inputs include quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained
through third-party broker quotes, and prices that
can be corroborated with other observable inputs
for substantially the complete term of a contract.
level 3: unobservable inputs. the company does
not use level 3 inputs for any of its recurring
fair-value measurements. beginning january1,
2009, level 3 inputs may be required for the
determination of fair value associated with
certain nonrecurring measurements of
nonfinancial assets and liabilities.

derivativesthe company records its derivative
instruments  other than any commodity derivative
contracts that are designated as normal purchase and
normal sale  on the consolidated balance sheet at
fair value, with virtually all the offsetting amount
to income. for derivatives with identical or similar
provisions as contracts that are publicly traded on a
regular basis, the company uses the market values of
the publicly traded instruments as an input for
fair-value calculations.
the companys derivative instruments principally
include crude oil, natural gas and refined-product
futures, swaps, options and forward contracts, as well
as interest-rate swaps and foreign currency forward
contracts. derivatives
classified as level 1 include
futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active
markets such as the nymex (new york mercantile
exchange).
derivatives classified as level 2 include
swaps (including interest rate), options, and forward
(including foreign currency) contracts principally
with financial institutions and other oil and gas
companies, the fair values for which are obtained from
third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services
and exchanges. the company obtains multiple sources of
pricing information for the level 2 instruments. since
this pricing information is generated from observable
market data, it has historically been very consistent.
the company does not materially adjust this
information. the company incorporates internal review,
evaluation and assessment procedures, including a
comparison of level 2 fair values derived from the
companys internally developed forward curves (on a
sample basis) with the pricing information to document
reasonable, logical and supportable fair-value
determinations and proper level of classification.

operating segments and geographic data
although each subsidiary of chevron is responsible for
its own affairs, chevron corporation manages its
investments in these subsidiaries and their
affiliates. for this purpose, the investments are
grouped as follows: upstream  exploration and
production; downstream  refining, marketing and
transportation; chemicals; and all other. the first
three of these groupings represent the companys
reportable segments and operating segments as
defined in financial accounting standards board (fasb)
statement no.131, disclosures about segments of an
enterprise and related information (fas 131).
the segments are separately managed for investment
purposes under a structure that includes segment
managers who report to the companys chief operating
decision maker (codm) (terms as defined in fas 131).
the codm is the companys executive committee, a
committee of senior officers that includes the chief
executive officer and that, in turn, reports to the
board of directors of chevron corporation.
the operating segments represent components of the
company as described in fas 131 terms that engage in
activities (a)from which revenues are earned and
expenses are incurred; (b)whose operating results are
regularly reviewed by the codm, which makes decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segments and to
assess their performance; and (c)for which discrete
financial information is available.
segment managers for the reportable segments are
accountable directly to and maintain regular contact
with the companys codm to discuss the segments
operating activities and financial performance. the
codm approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at

descriptions of major affiliates, including
significant differences between the companys
carrying value of its investments and its
underlying equity in the net assets of the
affiliates, are as follows:

ownership interest in tengizchevroil (tco), a joint
venture formed in 1993 to develop the tengiz and

emerging issues task force (eitf)issue no.04-13,
accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with
the same counterparty (issue 04-13), on a prospective
basis from april1, 2006. issue 04-13 requires that two
or more legally separate exchange transactions with the
same counterparty, including buy/sell transactions, be
combined
and considered as a single arrangement for purposes of
applying the provisions of accounting principles board
opinion no.29, accounting for nonmonetary
transactions, when the transactions are entered into
in
contemplation of one another. in prior periods,
the company accounted for buy/sell transactions in the
consolidated statement of income as a monetary
transaction  purchases were reported as purchased
crude oil and products; sales were reported as sales
and other operating revenues.
with the companys
adoption of issue 04-13, buy/sell transactions
beginning in the second quarter 2006 are netted against
each other on the consolidated statement of income,
with no effect on net income. the amount associated
with buy/sell transactions in the first quarter 2006

litigation
mtbechevron and many other companies in the petroleum
industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe)
as a gasoline additive. in october2008, 59 cases were
settled in which the company was a party and which
related to the use of mtbe in certain oxygenated
gasolines and the alleged seepage of mtbe into
groundwater. the terms of this agreement are
confidential and not material to the companys results
of operations, liquidity or financial position.
chevron is a party to 37 other pending
lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve
numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners.
resolution of these lawsuits and claims may
ultimately require the company to correct or
ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment
of prior release of mtbe by the company or other
parties. additional lawsuits and claims related to
the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims,
may be filed in the future. the settlement of the
59 lawsuits did not set any precedents related to
standards of liability to be used to judge the
merits of the claims, corrective measures required
or monetary damages to be assessed for the
remaining lawsuits and claims or future lawsuits
and claims. as a result, the companys ultimate
exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is
not currently determinable, but could be material
to net income in any one period. the company no
longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in
the united states.
rfg patentfourteen purported class actions were
brought by consumers who purchased reformulated
gasoline (rfg)from january1995 through august2005,
alleging that unocal misled the california air
resources board into adopting standards for composition
of rfg that overlapped with unocals undisclosed and
pending patents. the parties agreed to a settlement
that calls for, among other things, unocal to pay $48
and for the establishment of a cy pres fund to
administer payout of the award. the court approved the
final settlement in november2008.

ecuador, brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim
to be representatives of certain residents of an area
where an oil production consortium formerly had
operations. the lawsuit alleges damage to the
environment from the oil exploration and production
operations, and seeks unspecified damages to fund
environmental remediation and restoration of the
alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring
program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company
(texpet), a subsidiary of texaco inc., was a minority
member of this consortium with petroecuador, the
ecuadorian state-owned
oil company, as the majority
partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador. at
the conclusion of the consortium and following an
independent third-party environmental audit of the
concession area, texpet entered into a formal
agreement with the republic of ecuador and
petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites
assigned by the government in proportion to texpets
ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to that
agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation
program at a cost of $40. after certifying that the
sites were properly remediated, the government granted
texpet and all related corporate entities a full
release from any and all environmental liability
arising from the consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron
believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual
merit. as to matters of law, the company believes
first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over
chevron; second, that the law under which
plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999,
cannot be applied retroactively to chevron; third,
that the claims are barred by the statute of
limitations in ecuador; and, fourth, that the
lawsuit is also barred by the releases from
liability previously given to texpet by the
republic of ecuador and petroecuador. with regard
to the facts, the company believes that the
evidence confirms that texpets remediation was
properly conducted and that the remaining
environmental damage reflects petroecuadors
failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and
petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full
control over the operations.
in april2008, a mining engineer appointed by
the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed
to remediate it, issued a report recommending that
the court assess $8,000, which would, according to
the engineer, provide financial compensation for
purported damages, including wrongful death
claims, and pay for, among other items,
environmental remediation, health care systems,
and additional infrastructure for petroecuador.
the engineers report also asserted that an
additional $8,300 could be assessed against
chevron for unjust enrichment. the engineers
report is not binding on the court. chevron also
believes that the engineers work was performed
and his report prepared in a manner contrary to
law and in violation of the courts orders.
chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in
which it asked the court to strike the report in
its entirety. in november2008, the engineer
revised the report and, without additional
evidence, recommended an increase in the financial
compensation for purported damages to a total of
$18,900 and an increase in the assessment for
purported unjust enrichment to a
fs-44
table of contents
note 15 litigation - continued
total of $8,400.
chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised
report, and chevron will continue a vigorous
defense of any attempted imposition of liability.
management does not believe an
estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range
of loss) can be made in this case. due to the
defects associated with the engineers report,
management does not believe the report itself has
any utility in calculating a reasonably possible
loss (or a range of loss). moreover, the highly
uncertain legal environment surrounding the case
provides no basis for management to estimate a
reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

in 2008, before-tax income for u.s. operations,
including related corporate and other charges, was
$10,682, compared with before-tax income of $7,794 and
$9,131 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. for
international operations, before-tax income was
$32,275, $24,373 and $22,845 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. u.s. federal income tax expense was
reduced by $198, $132 and $116 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,

the companys effective tax rate increased from
41.9percent in 2007 to 44.3percent in 2008. the
increase in the effect of income taxes from
international operations at rates different from the
u.s. statutory rate from 8.3percent in 2007 to 10.2
percent in 2008 was mainly due to a greater proportion
of income being earned in 2008 in tax jurisdictions
with higher tax rates. in addition, the 2007 period
included a relatively low tax rate on the sale of
downstream assets in europe. the change in other from
a negative 1.8percent to a negative 0.7percent
primarily related to a lower effective tax rate on the
sale of the companys investment in dynegy common stock
in 2007.

deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2008
increased by approximately $1,300 from year-end 2007.
the increase was primarily related to increased
temporary differences for properties, plant and
equipment.
deferred tax assets increased by approximately
$5,300 in 2008. the increase related primarily to
deferred credits recorded for future tax benefits
earned from a new field in africa ($2,200); increased
deferred tax benefits for pension-related obligations
($1,300); and additional foreign tax credits arising
from earnings in high-tax-rate international
jurisdictions ($1,600), which were substantially
offset by valuation allowances.
the overall valuation allowance relates to
foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss
carryforwards and temporary differences for which no
benefit is expected to
be realized. tax loss carryforwards exist in
many international jurisdictions. whereas some of
these tax loss carryforwards do not have an
expiration date, others expire at various times from

income taxes are not accrued for unremitted

are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
undistributed earnings of international consolidated
subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred
income tax provision has been made for possible future
remittances totaled $22,428 at december31, 2008. this
amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the
companys ongoing international business. it is not
practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might
be payable on the eventual remittance of earnings that
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. at the
end of 2008, deferred income taxes were recorded for
the undistributed earnings of certain international
operations for which the company no longer intends to
indefinitely reinvest the earnings. the company does
not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes
on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely
reinvested.
uncertain income tax positionsfinancial accounting
standards board (fasb)interpretation no.48,
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an
interpretation of fasb statement no.109 (fin 48),
provides the accounting guidance for income tax benefits that are uncertain in nature. under fin 48, a
company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial
statements for an uncertain tax position only if
managements assessment is that the position is more
likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50
percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based
solely on the technical merits of the position. the
term tax position in fin 48 refers to a position in
a previously filed tax return or a position expected
to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected
in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and
liabilities for interim or annual periods.
the following table indicates the changes to the
companys unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended
december31, 2008. the term unrecognized tax
benefits in fin 48 refers to the differences between
a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return and the benefit measured and recognized in the
financial statements in accordance with the guidelines
of fin 48. interest and penalties are not included.

although unrecognized tax benefits for individual
tax positions may increase or decrease during 2009, the
company believes that no change will be individually
significant during 2009. approximately 85percent of
the $2,696 of unrecognized tax benefits at december
31, 2008, would have an impact on the effective tax
rate if subsequently recognized.
tax positions for
chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are
subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions
throughout the world. for the companys major tax
jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain
prior tax years had not been completed as of december
31, 2008. for these jurisdictions, the latest years for
which income tax examinations had been finalized were
as follows: united states  2003, nigeria  1994,
angola  2001 and saudi arabia  2003.
on the
consolidated statement of income, the company reports
interest and penalties related to liabilities for
uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. as of
december31, 2008, accruals of $276 for anticipated
interest and penalty obligations were included on the
consolidated balance sheet, compared with accruals of
$198 as of year-end 2007. income tax expense associated
with interest and penalties was $79 and $70 in 2008 and
2007, respectively.

redeemable long-term obligations consist
primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that
are included as current liabilities because they
become redeemable at the option of the bondholders
within one year following the balance sheet date.
the company periodically enters into interest rate
swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. see note 7,
beginning on page fs-36, for information concerning the
companys debt-related derivative activities.
at december31, 2008, the company had $4,950 of
committed credit facilities with banks worldwide,
which permit
the company to refinance short-term obligations
on a long-term basis. the facilities support the
companys commercial paper borrowings. interest on
borrowings under the terms of specific agreements may
be based on the london interbank offered rate or bank
prime rate. no amounts were outstanding under these
credit agreements during 2008 or at year-end.

classified $4,950 and $4,382, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these

combinations (fas 141-r) in december2007, the fasb
issued fas 141-r, which became effective for business
combination transactions having an acquisition date on
or after january1, 2009. this standard requires the
acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize
the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
acquisition date to be measured at their respective
fair values. it also requires acquisition-related
costs, as well as restructuring costs the acquirer
expects to incur for which it is not obligated at
acquisition date, to be recorded against income rather
than included in purchase-price determination. finally,
the standard requires recognition of contingent
arrangements at their acquisition-date fair values,
with subsequent changes in fair value generally
reflected in income.

date on or after january1, 2009. this standard requires an asset or liability arising from a contingency in a business
combination to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably determined. if it cannot be reasonably determined then the
asset or liability will need to be recognized in accordance with fasb
statement no. 5, accounting for contingencies, and fasb
interpretation no. 14, reasonable estimation of the amount of the loss.

2007, which became effective for the company january1,
2009, with retroactive adoption of the standards
presentation and disclosure requirements for existing
minority interests. this standard requires ownership
interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than
the parent to be presented within the equity section of
the consolidated balance sheet but separate from the
parents equity. it also requires the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified
and presented on the face of the consolidated statement
of income. certain changes in a parents ownership
interest are to be accounted for as equity transactions
and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any
noncontrolling equity investment in the former
subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value.
implementation of fas 160 will not significantly change
the presentation of the companys consolidated
statement of income or consolidated balance sheet.

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities. fas 161 requires disclosures related to
objectives and strategies for using derivatives; the
fair-value amounts of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments; and
credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative
agreements. the companys disclosures for derivative
instruments will be expanded to include a tabular

accounting for suspended exploratory wells
the company accounts for the cost of exploratory wells
in accordance with fasb statement no.19, financial and
reporting by oil and gas producing companies (fas 19),
as amended by fasb staff position (fsp)fas 19-1,
accounting for suspended well costs, which provides
that exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized
after the completion of drilling when (a)the well has
found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify
completion as a producing well and (b)the enterprise
is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves
and the economic and operating viability of the
project. if either condition is not met or if an
enterprise obtains information that raises substantial
doubt about the economic or operational viability of
the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to
be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value,
would be charged to expense.

of the $1,559 of exploratory well costs

2008, $874 (27 projects) is related to projects that
had drilling activities under way or firmly planned for
the near future. an additional $279 (four projects) is
related to projects that had drilling activity during
2008. the $406 balance is related to 19 projects in
areas requiring a major capital expenditure before
production could begin and for which additional
drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned
for the near future. additional drilling was not deemed
necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had
already been established, and other activities were in
process to enable a future decision on project
development.
the projects for the $406 referenced above had
the following activities associated with assessing
the reserves and the projects economic viability:
(a) $107 (two projects)
government approval of the
plan of
development received in fourth quarter 2008; (b)
$73 (two projects)  continued unitization efforts
on adjacent discoveries that span inter-national boundaries; (c) $49 (one project)
alignment of project stakeholders regarding scope and
commercial strategy; (d) $46 (one project)
subsurface and facilities engineering studies ongoing
with front-end-engineering and design expected in
late 2009; (e) $40 (one project) continued review of
development options; (f) $91  miscellaneous
activities for 12 projects with smaller amounts
suspended. while progress was being made on all 50
projects, the decision on the recognition of proved
reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur
for several years because of the complexity, scale
and negotiations connected with the projects. the
majority of these decisions are expected to occur in
the next three years.
the $1,559 of suspended well costs capitalized

chevron long-termincentive plan (ltip) awards under the ltip may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. from april2004 through january2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the ltip, and no more than 64million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient.
texaco stock incentive plan (texaco sip)on the closing of the acquisition of texaco in october
2001, outstanding options granted under the texaco sip were converted to chevron options. these
options, which have 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. this provision enables a participant who exercises a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. the
restored options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price
is the market value of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. beginning in
2007, restored options were granted under the ltip. no further awards may be granted under the
former texaco plans.
unocal share-based plans (unocal plans)when chevron acquired unocal in august2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various unocal plans were exchanged for
fully vested chevron options and appreciation rights. these awards retained the same provisions as
the original unocal plans. if not exercised, these awards will expire between early 2009 and early
2015.
the fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2008, 2007
and 2006 were measured on the date of grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model, with the

as of december31, 2008, there was $179 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans.
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9years.
at january1, 2008, the number of ltip performance units outstanding was equivalent to
2,225,015 shares. during 2008, 888,300 units were granted, 652,897 units vested with cash proceeds
distributed to recipients and 59,863 units were forfeited. at december31, 2008, units outstanding
were 2,400,555, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $201. in
addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various
ltip and former texaco and unocal programs totaled approximately 1.4million equivalent shares as
of december31, 2008. a liability of $35 was recorded for these awards.
broad-based employee stock optionsin addition to the plans described above, chevron granted all
eligible employees stock options or equivalents in 1998. the options vested in february2000 and
expired in february2008. a total of 9,641,600 options were awarded with an exercise price of
$38.16 per share.
the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated at $9.54 using
the black-scholes model for the preceding 10years. the assumptions used in the model, based on a
10-year average, were: a risk-free interest rate of 7percent, a dividend yield of 4.2percent, an
expected life of seven years and a volatility of 24.7percent.
at january1, 2008, the number of broad-based employee stock options outstanding was 652,715.
through the conclusion of the program in february2008, 396,875 shares were exercised and 255,840
shares were forfeited. the total intrinsic value of these options exercised during 2008, 2007 and
2006 was $18, $30, and $10, respectively.
note 22
employee benefit plans
the company has defined-benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically prefunds
defined-benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding
provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified plans are subject to the
employee retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the company does not
typically fund u.s. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under
laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and
investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives.
the company also sponsors other postretirement (opeb)plans that provide medical and dental
benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans
are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. medical coverage for medicare-eligible
retirees in the companys main u.s. medical plan is secondary to medicare (including partd), and
the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4
percent per year. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
effective december31, 2006, the company implemented the recognition and measurement
provisions of financial accounting standards board (fasb)statement no.158,
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of
fasb statements no.87, 88, 106 and 132(r), which requires the recognition of the overfunded or
underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb as an asset or liability, with
the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
the funded status of the companys pension
and other postretirement benefit plans for 2008 and 2007 is on the following page:

net actuarial losses recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive loss at december31, 2008, for the
companys u.s. pension, international pension and opeb
plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
approximately 10, 13 and 10years, respectively. these
amortization periods represent the estimated average
remaining service of employees expected to receive
benefits under the plans. these losses are amortized to
the extent they exceed 10percent of the higher of the
projected benefit obligation or market-related value of
plan assets. the amount subject to amortization is
determined on a plan-by-plan basis. during 2009, the
company estimates actuarial losses of $298, $103 and
$28 will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international
pension and opeb plans, respectively. in
addition, the company estimates an additional $201
will be recognized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss during 2009 related to lump-sum
settlement costs from
u.s. pension plans.
the weighted average amortization period for
recognizing prior service costs (credits)recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31,
2008, was approximately nine and 13years for u.s. and
international pension plans, respectively, and eight
years for other postretirement benefit plans. during
2009, the company estimates prior service (credits)
costs of $(7), $25 and $(81) will be amortized from
accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s.
pension, international pension and opeb plans,
respectively.

1 the 2006 u.s. discount rate reflects remeasurement on july1, 2006, due to plan
combinations and changes, primarily several unocal plans into related chevron plans.
expected return on plan assets the companys estimated
long-term rate of return on pension assets is driven
primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an
assessment of expected future performance, advice from
external actuarial firms and the incorporation of
specific asset-class risk factors. asset allocations
are periodically updated using pension plan
asset/liability studies, and the companys estimated
long-term rates of return are consistent with these
studies.
there have been no changes in the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002 for
u.s. plans, which account for 68percent of the
companys pension plan assets. at december31, 2008,
the estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension
plan assets was 7.8percent.
the market-related value of assets of the major
u.s. pension plan used in the determination of pension
expense was based on the market values in the three
months preceding the year-end measurement date, as
opposed to the
maximum allowable period of five years under u.s.
accounting rules. management considers the three-month
time period long enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still
be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other
plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in
calculating the pension expense.
discount ratethe discount rate assumptions used to
determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense
reflect the prevailing rates available on high-quality,
fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2008,
the company selected a 6.3percent discount rate for
the major u.s. pension and postretirement plans. this
rate was based on a cash flow analysis that matched
estimated future benefit payments to the citigroup
pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2008. the
discount rates at the end of 2007 and 2006 were 6.3
percent and 5.8percent, respectively.
other benefit assumptionsfor the measurement of
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
december31, 2008, for the main u.s. postretirement
medical plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates
start with 7percent in 2009 and gradually decline to 5
percent for 2017 and beyond. for this measurement at
december31, 2007, the assumed health care cost-trend
rates started with 8percent in 2008 and gradually
declined to 5percent for 2014 and beyond. in both
measurements, the annual increase to company
contributions was capped at 4percent.
assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree
health care costs. the impact is mitigated by the 4
percent cap on the companys medical contributions for
the primary u.s. plan. a one-percentage-point change
in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have
the following effects:

note 22 employee benefit plans - continued
the pension plans invest primarily in asset
categories with sufficient size, liquidity and cost
efficiency to permit investments of reasonable size.
the pension plans invest in asset categories that
provide diversification benefits and are easily
measured. to assess the plans investment performance,
long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been
established.
for the primary u.s. pension plan, the chevron
board of directors has approved the following
percentage asset-allocation ranges: equities 4070,
fixed income/cash 2060, real estate 015 and other
05. the significant international pension plans also
have established maximum and minimum asset allocation
ranges that vary by each plan. actual asset allocation,
within approved ranges, is based on a variety of
current economic and market conditions and
consideration of specific asset category risk.
equities include investments in the companys
common stock in the amount of $22 and $36 at december
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. the other asset
category includes minimal investments in
private-equity limited partnerships.
cash contributions and benefit paymentsin 2008, the
company contributed $577 and $262 to its u.s. and
international pension plans, respectively. in 2009, the
company expects contributions to be approximately $550
and $250 to its u.s. and international pension plans,
respectively. actual contribution amounts are dependent
upon plan-investment returns, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory environments and other economic
factors. additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset
increases in plan obligations.
the company anticipates paying other
postretirement benefits of approximately $209 in
2009, as compared with $188 paid in 2008.

estimated future service, are expected to be paid in

employee savings investment planeligible
employees of chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the chevron employee
savings investment plan (esip).
charges to expense for the esip represent the
companys contributions to the plan, which are funded
either through the purchase of shares of common stock
on the open market or through the release of common
stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership
plan (lesop), which follows. total company matching
contributions to employee accounts within the esip were
$231, $206 and $169 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. this cost was reduced by the value of
shares released from the lesop totaling $40, $33 and $6
in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. the remaining
amounts, totaling $191, $173 and $163 in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively, represent open market purchases.
employee stock ownership planwithin the chevron esip
is an employee stock ownership plan (esop). in 1989,
chevron established a lesop as a constituent part of
the esop. the lesop provides partial prefunding of
the companys future commitments to the esip.
as permitted by american institute of certified
public accountants (aicpa)statement of position 93-6,
employers accounting for employee stock ownership
plans, the company has elected to continue its
practices, which are based on aicpa statement of
position 76-3, accounting practices for certain
employee stock ownership plans, and subsequent
consensus of the eitf of the fasb. the debt of the
lesop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as
collateral are reported as deferred compensation and
benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet
and the consolidated statement of stockholders equity.
the company reports compensation expense equal to
lesop debt principal repayments less dividends received
and used by the lesop for debt service. interest
accrued on lesop debt is recorded as interest expense.
dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a
reduction of retained earnings. all lesop shares are
considered outstanding for earnings-per-share
computations.
a net credit to expense of $1 was recorded for
the lesop each year in 2008, 2007 and 2006. the net
credit for the respective years was composed of
credits to compensation expense of $15, $17 and $18
and charges to interest expense for lesop debt of
$14, $16 and $17.
of the dividends paid on the lesop shares, $35,
$8 and $59 were used in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, to service lesop debt. the amount in
2006 included $28
of lesop debt service that was scheduled for
payment on the first business day of january2007 and
was paid in late december2006. no contributions were
required in 2008, 2007 or 2006 as dividends received
by the lesop were sufficient to satisfy lesop debt
service.

of chevron treasury stock. the trust will sell the
shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay
benefits only to the extent that the company does not
pay such benefits. the company intends to continue to
pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the
trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as
instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the shares
held in the trust are not considered outstanding for
earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold
by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
prior to its acquisition by chevron, unocal
established various grantor trusts to fund obligations
under some of its benefit plans, including the
deferred compensation and supplemental retirement
plans. at december31, 2008 and 2007, trust assets of
$60 and $69, respectively, were invested primarily in
interest-earning accounts.
employee incentive planseffective january2008, the
company established the chevron incentive plan (cip), a
single annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees
that links awards to corporate, unit and individual
performance in the prior year. this plan replaced other
cash bonus programs, which primarily included the
management incentive plan (mip)and the chevron success
sharing program. in 2008, charges to expense for cash
bonuses were $757. charges to expense for mip were $184
and $180 in 2007 and 2006, respectively. charges for
other cash bonus programs were $431 and $329 in 2007
and 2006, respectively. chevron also has a long-term
incentive plan (ltip)for officers and other regular
salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries
who hold positions of significant responsibility.
awards under ltip consist of stock options and other
share-based compensation that are described in note 21
on page fs-49.

other contingencies and
commitments
income taxesthe company calculates its income tax
expense and liabilities quarterly. these liabilities
generally are subject to audit and are not finalized
with the individual taxing authorities until several
years after the end of the annual
period for which
income taxes have been calculated. refer to note 16
beginning on page fs-45 for a discussion of the periods
for which tax returns have been audited for the
companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for
all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the
amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. the company does not expect settlement
of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax
positions will have a material effect on its results of
operations, consolidated financial position or
liquidity.
guaranteesthe company has issued a guarantee of
approximately $600 associated with certain payments
under a terminal use agreement entered into by a
company affiliate. the terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. over the approximate 16-year term
of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will
reduce over time as certain fees are paid by the
affiliate. there are numerous cross-indemnity
agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to
permit recovery of any amounts paid under the
guarantee. chevron carries no liability for its
obligation under this guarantee.
indemnificationsthe company provided certain
indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and
motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection
with the february2002 sale of the companys interests
in those investments. the company would be required to
perform if the indemnified liabilities become actual
losses. were that to occur, the company could be
required to make future payments up to $300. through
the end of 2008, the company paid $48 under these
indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible
additional indemnification payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities
relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco
to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the
formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the period of texacos ownership interest in
the joint ventures. in general, the environmental
conditions or events that are subject to these
indemnities must have arisen prior to december
2001. claims must be asserted no later than
february2009 for equilon indemnities and no later
than february2012 for motiva indemnities. under
the terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum
limit on the amount of potential future payments.
in february 2009, shell delivered a letter to the company purporting
to preserve unmatured claims for certain equilon indemnities. the
letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount, and
management does not believe the letter provides a basis to estimate
the amount, if any, of a range of loss or potential range of loss
with respect to the equilon or the motiva indemnities. the
company posts no assets as collateral and has made no
payments under the indemnities.
fs-56

note 23
other contingencies and
commitments - continued
the amounts payable for the indemnities
described on the previous page are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and
others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon
or motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any
applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company
assumed certain indemnities relating to
contingent environmental liabilities associated
with assets that were sold in 1997. under the
indemnification agreement, the companys
liability is unlimited until april2022, when the
indemnification expires. the acquirer shares in
certain environmental remediation costs up to a
maximum obligation of $200, which had not been
reached as of december31, 2008.
securitizationduring 2008, the company terminated the
program used to securitize downstream-related trade
accounts receivable. at year-end 2007, the balance of
securitized receivables was $675million. as of
december31, 2008, the company had no other
securitization arrangements in place.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreementsthe company and its subsidiaries have
certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers
financing arrangements. the agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and
storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary
course of the companys business. the aggregate
approximate amounts of required payments under these
various commitments are: 2009  $6,405; 2010
$3,964; 2011  $3,578; 2012  $1,473; 2013  $1,329;
2014 and after  $4,333. a portion of these
commitments may ultimately be shared with project
partners. total payments under the agreements were
approximately $5,100 in 2008 $3,700 in 2007 and $3,000
in 2006.
minority intereststhe company has commitments of
$469 related to minority interests in subsidiary
companies.
environmentalthe company is subject to loss
contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company
to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on
the
environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum
substances, including mtbe, by the company or other
parties. such contingencies may exist for various
sites, including, but not limited to, federal
superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws,
refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land
development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. these future costs are
not fully determinable due to such factors as the
unknown magnitude of possible contamination,
the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions
that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible
parties, and the extent to which such costs are
recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known
environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional
future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are
recognized. the company does not expect these costs
will have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position or liquidity. also, the company
does not believe its obligations to make such
expenditures have had, or will have, any
significant impact on the companys competitive
position relative to other u.s. or international
petroleum or chemical companies.
chevrons environmental reserve as of december
31, 2008, was $1,818. included in this balance were
remediation activities of 248 sites for which the
company had been identified as a potentially
responsible party or otherwise involved in the
remediation by the u.s. environmental protection
agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the
provisions of the federal superfund law or
analogous state laws. the companys remediation
reserve for these sites at year-end 2008 was $120.
the federal superfund law and analogous state laws
provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. any future actions by the epa
or other regulatory agencies to require chevron to
assume other potentially responsible parties costs
at designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the companys
results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2008 environmental
reserves balance of $1,698, $968 related to the
companys u.s. downstream operations, including
refineries and other plants, marketing locations
(i.e., service stations and terminals), and
pipelines. the remaining $730 was associated with
various sites in international downstream ($117),
upstream ($390), chemicals ($154) and other
businesses ($69). liabilities at all sites, whether
operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the companys plans and activities
to remediate soil or groundwater
contamination or both. these and other
activities include one or more of the following:
site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal
of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation
and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid
and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and
treatment; and monitoring of the natural
attenuation of the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities
under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource
conservation and recovery act and various state or local regulations. no single
remediation site at year-end 2008 had a recorded
liability that was material to the companys results of
operations, consolidated financial position or
liquidity.

it is likely that the company will continue to
incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to
past operations. these future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown
magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown
timing and extent of the corrective actions that
may be required, the determination of the companys
liability in proportion to other responsible
parties, and the extent to which such costs are

equity redeterminationfor oil and gas producing
operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated
crude oil and natural gas reserves. these activities,
individually or together, may result in gains or losses
that could be material to earnings in any given period.
one such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for chevrons interests in four
producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve at elk
hills, california, for the time when the remaining
interests in these zones were owned by the u.s.
department of energy. a wide range remains for a
possible net settlement amount for the four zones. for
this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum
possible net before-tax liability at approximately
$200, and the possible maximum net amount that could be
owed to chevron is estimated at about $150. the timing
of the settlement and the exact amount within this
range of estimates are uncertain.
other contingencieschevron receives claims from and
submits claims to customers; trading partners; u.s.
federal, state and local regulatory bodies;
governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. the
amounts of these claims, individually and in the
aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods
to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue
to review and analyze their operations and may
close,
abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or
restructure assets to achieve operational or
strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness
and profitability. these activities, individually
or together, may result in gains or losses in
future periods.
note 24
asset retirement obligations
the company accounts for asset retirement obligations
(aro)in accordance with financial accounting standards
board (fasb)statement no.143, accounting for asset
retirement obligations (fas 143) and fasb
interpretation no.47, accounting for conditional asset
retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb
statement no.143 (fin 47). fas 143 applies to the fair
value of a liability for an aro that is recorded when
there is a legal obligation associated with the
retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. obligations associated
with the retirement of these assets require recognition
in certain circumstances: (1)the present value of a
liability and offsetting asset for an aro, (2)the
subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation
of the asset, and (3)the periodic review of the aro
liability estimates and discount rates. fin 47
clarifies that the phrase conditional asset retirement
obligation, as used in fas 143, refers to a legal
obligation to perform asset retirement activity for
which the timing and/or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be
within the control of the company. the obligation to
perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional
even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or
method of settlement. uncertainty about the timing
and/or method of settlement of a conditional aro
should be factored into the measurement of the
liability when sufficient information exists. fas 143
acknowledges that in some cases, sufficient information
may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair
value of an aro. fin 47 also clarifies when an entity
would have sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the fair value of an aro.
fas 143 and fin 47 primarily affect the companys
accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing
assets. no significant aros associated with any legal
obligations to retire refining, marketing and
transportation (downstream)and chemical long-lived
assets have been recognized, as indeterminate
settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent
estimation of the fair value of the associated aro. the
company performs periodic reviews of its downstream and
chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and
circumstances that might require recognition of a
retirement obligation.
the following table indicates the changes to the
companys before-tax asset retirement obligations in
2008, 2007 and 2006:

table v  reserve quantity information
reserves governancethe company has adopted a
comprehensive reserves and resource classification
system modeled after a system developed and approved by
the society of petroleum engineers, the world petroleum
congress and the american association of petroleum
geologists. the system classifies recoverable
hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status
at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and
three noncommercial. within the commercial
classification are proved reserves and two categories
of unproved: probable and possible. the noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent
resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all sec and company standards.
proved reserves are the estimated quantities that
geologic and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions. net proved reserves exclude
royalties and interests owned by others and reflect
contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in
effect at the time of the estimate.
proved reserves are classified as either developed
or undeveloped. proved developed reserves are the
quantities expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited
nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are
subject to change as additional information becomes
available.
proved reserves are estimated by company
asset teams composed of earth scientists and
engineers. as part of the internal control process
related to reserves estimation, the company maintains
a reserves advisory committee (rac)that is
chaired by the corporate reserves manager, who is
a member of a corporate department that reports
directly to the executive vice president responsible
for the companys worldwide exploration and production
activities. all of the rac members are knowledgeable
in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification.
the rac coordinates its activities through two
operating company-level reserves managers. these two
reserves managers are not members of the rac so as to
preserve the corporate-level independence.
the rac has the following primary
responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the
business units recommended reserve changes; confirm
that proved reserves are recognized in accordance
with sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes
are calculated using consistent and appropriate
standards, procedures and technology; and maintain
the corporate reserves manual, which provides
standardized procedures used corporatewide for
classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
fs-67
table of contents
supplemental information
on oil and gas producing activities
table v reserve quantity information - continued
during the year, the rac is represented in
meetings with each of the companys upstream business
units to review and discuss reserve changes
recommended by the various asset teams. major changes
are also reviewed with the companys strategy and
planning committee and the executive committee, whose
members include the chief executive officer and the
chief financial officer. the companys annual reserve
activity is also reviewed with the board of directors.
if major changes to reserves were to occur between the
annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed
with the board.
rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during
the year of many of the fields that have the largest
proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an
examination of the proved-reserve records and
documentation of their alignment with the corporate
reserves manual.
modernization of oil and gas reportingin december
2008, the sec issued its final rule, modernization of
oil and gas reporting (release nos. 33-8995; 34-59192;
fr-78). the disclosure requirements under the final
rule will become effective for the company in its form
10-k filing for the year ending december31, 2009. the
final rule changes a number of oil and gas reserve
estimation and disclosure requirements under sec
regulations s-k and s-x.
among the principal changes
in the final rule are requirements to use a price based
on a 12-month average for reserve estimation and
disclosure instead of a single end-of-year price;
expanding the definition of oil and gas producing
activities to include nontraditional sources such as
bitumen extracted from oil sands; permitting the use of
new reliable technologies to establish reasonable
certainty of proved reserves; allowing optional
disclosure of probable and possible reserves; modifying
the definition of geographic area for disclosure of
reserve estimates and production; amending disclosures
of proved reserve quantities to include separate
disclosures of synthetic oil and gas; expanding proved,
undeveloped reserve disclosures (puds), including
discussion of puds five years old or more; and
disclosure of the qualifications of the chief technical
person who oversees the companys overall reserves
estimation process.
reserve quantitiesat december31,
2008, oil-equivalent reserves for the companys
consolidated operations were 7.9billion barrels.
(refer to the term reserves on page e-147 for the
definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) approximately
25percent of the total reserves were in the united
states. for the companys interests in equity
affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves were 3.3billion
barrels, 82percent of which were associated with the
companys 50percent ownership in tco.
aside from the
tengiz field in the tco affiliate, no single property
accounted for more than 5percent of the companys
total oil-equivalent proved reserves. about 20 other
individual properties in the companys portfolio of
assets
each contained between 1percent and 5percent
of the companys oil-equivalent proved reserves, which
in the aggregate accounted for approximately 40percent
of the companys total proved reserves. these
properties were geographically dispersed, located in
the united states, south america, west africa, the
middle east and the asia-pacific region.
in the united
states, total oil-equivalent reserves at year-end 2008
were 2.0billion barrels. of this amount, 43percent,
22percent and 35percent were located in california,
the gulf of mexico and other u.s. areas, respectively.
in california, liquids reserves represented 94
percent of the total, with most classified as heavy
oil. because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need
to employ enhanced recovery methods, the producing
operations are capital intensive in nature. most of the
companys heavy-oil fields in california employ a
continuous steamflooding process.
in the gulf of mexico region, liquids represented
approximately 66percent of total oil-equivalent
reserves. production operations are mostly offshore
and, as a result, are also capital intensive. costs
include investments in wells, production platforms and
other facilities, such as
gathering lines and storage facilities.
in other u.s. areas, the reserves were split about
equally between liquids and natural gas. for production
of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery
methods, including
water-flood and
co2 injection.
the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables, for the three years ending december
31, 2008, is not necessarily indicative of future
trends. apart from acquisitions, the companys ability
to add proved reserves is affected by, among other
things, events and circumstances that are outside the
companys control, such as delays in government
permitting, partner approvals of development plans,
declines in oil and gas prices, opec constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest.
the upward revision in thailand reflected
additional drilling and development activity during
the year. these upward revisions were partially offset
by reductions in reservoir performance in nigeria and
the united kingdom, which decreased reserves by 43
million barrels and by 32million barrels,
respectively. most of the upward revision for
affiliated companies was related to a 60
million-barrel increase in tco as a result of improved
reservoir performance.
in 2007, net revisions decreased reserves by 146
million barrels for worldwide consolidated companies
and increased reserves by 103million barrels for
equity affiliates. for consolidated companies, the
largest downward net revisions were 89million barrels
in africa and 66million barrels in indonesia. the
companys estimated net proved oil and natural gas
reserves and changes thereto for the years 2006, 2007
and 2008 are shown in the tables on pages fs-69 and
fs-71.

net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2008 consist of 770million barrels of
developed reserves and (180)million barrels of undeveloped reserves for consolidated companies and
180million barrels of developed reserves and 97million barrels of undeveloped reserves for
affiliated companies.
during 2008, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at december31, 2007,
transferred to developed reserves were 18percent and 2percent for consolidated companies and
affiliated companies, respectively.
information on canadian oil sands net proved reserves not included above:
in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, chevron has a 20percent
nonoperated working interest in the athabasca oil-sands project in canada. as of year-end 2008, sec
regulations defined oil-sands reserves as mining-related and not a part of conventional oil and gas
reserves. net proved oil-sands reserves were 436million and 443million as of december31, 2007
and 2006, respectively. the oil-sands quantities were not classified as proved reserves at the end
of 2008 because under the provisions of sec industry guide 7, description of property by issuers
engaged or to be engaged in significant mining operations, a mineral deposit must be economically
producible at the time of the reserve determination in order to be classified as proved. due to the
decline in crude-oil prices at the end of 2008, the operating costs of the athabasca project
exceeded the revenues from crude-oil sales at that time. the inability to classify the oil-sands
volumes as proved at the end of 2008 did not affect the daily operations of the athabasca project
nor the activities under way to expand those operations. during 2008, bitumen production for the
project averaged 126,000 barrels per day (27,000 net). the expansion project is designed to
increase production capacity to 255,000 barrels per day in late 2010. the oil-sands proved reserves for
2007 and 2006 are not included in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for
conventional oil and gas reserves on page fs-73.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids
proved-reserve changes for 2006 through 2008 are
discussed below:
revisionsin 2006, net revisions
increased reserves by 39million and 84million barrels
for worldwide consolidated companies and equity
affiliates, respectively. international consolidated
companies accounted for the net increase of 39million
barrels. the largest upward net revisions were 61
mil-
lion barrels in indonesia and 27million barrels in
thailand. in indonesia, the increase was the result of infill
drilling and improved steamflood and waterflood
performance.
in africa, the decrease was mainly based
on field performance data for fields in nigeria and
the effect of higher year-end prices in angola and
republic of the congo. in indonesia, the decline also
reflected the impact of higher
fs-69

year-end prices.
higher prices also resulted in downward revisions in
karachaganak and azerbaijan. for equity affiliates, most of the upward revision was related to a 92
million-barrel increase for tcos tengiz field and an
11million-barrel increase for petroboscan in
venezuela, both as a result of improved reservoir
performance. at tco, the upward revision was tempered
by the negative impact of higher year-end prices.
in 2008, net revisions increased reserves by 536
million barrels for worldwide consolidated companies
and increased reserves by 267million barrels for
equity affiliates. for consolidated companies,
international areas added 552million barrels. the
largest increase was in the asia-pacific region, which
added 384million barrels. the majority of the increase
was in the partitioned neutral zone as a result of a
concession extension. upward revisions were also
recorded in kazakhstan and azerbaijan and were mainly
associated with the effect of lower year-end prices on
the calculation of reserves associated with
production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts. in
indonesia, reserves increased 191million barrels due
mainly to the impact of lower year-end prices on the
reserve calculations for production-sharing contracts,
as well as a result of development drilling and
improved waterflood and steamflood performance. for
affiliate companies, the 249million-barrel increase
for tco was due to the effect of lower year-end prices
on the royalty determination and facility optimization
at the tengiz and korolev fields.
improved recoveryin
2006, improved recovery increased liquids volumes
worldwide by 83million barrels for consolidated
companies. reserves in the united
states increased 52million barrels, with
california representing 49million barrels of the total
increase due to steamflood expansion and revised
modeling activities. internationally, improved recovery
increased reserves by 31million barrels, with no
single country accounting for an increase of more than
10million barrels.
in 2007, improved recovery
increased liquids volumes by 20million barrels
worldwide. no addition was individually significant.
in
2008, improved recovery increased worldwide liquids
volumes by 37million barrels. international
consolidated companies accounted for 22million barrels
and the united states accounted for 5million barrels.
the largest addition
was related to gas reinjection in
kazakhstan. affiliated companies increased reserves 10
million barrels due to improved secondary recovery at
boscan.
extensions and discoveriesin 2006, extensions and
discoveries increased liquids volumes worldwide by 107
million barrels for consolidated companies. reserves in
nigeria increased by 27million barrels due in part to
the initial booking of reserves for the aparo field.
additional drilling activities contributed 19million
barrels in the united kingdom and 14million barrels in
argentina. in the united states, the gulf of mexico
added 25million barrels, mainly the result of the
initial booking of the great white field in the
deepwater perdido fold belt area.
in 2007, extensions and discoveries increased
liquids volumes by 60million barrels worldwide. the
largest additions were 25million barrels in the u.s.
gulf of mexico, mainly for the deepwater tahiti and mad
dog fields.
in 2008, extensions and discoveries
increased consolidated company reserves 33million
barrels worldwide. the united states increased reserves
17million barrels, primarily in the gulf of mexico.
international companies increased reserves 16million
barrels with no one country resulting in additions
greater than 5million barrels.
purchasesin 2006, acquisitions increased liquids
volumes worldwide by 21million barrels for
consolidated companies and 119million
barrels for equity affiliates. for consolidated
companies, the amount was mainly the result of new
agreements in nigeria, which added 13million barrels
of reserves. the other-equity-affiliates quantity
reflects the result of the conversion of boscan and
ll-652 operations to joint stock companies in
venezuela.
in 2007, acquisitions of 316million barrels for
equity affiliates related to the formation of a new
hamaca equity affiliate in venezuela.
salesin 2006, sales decreased reserves by 15
million barrels due to the conversion of the ll-652
risked service agreement to a joint stock company
in venezuela.
in 2007, affiliated company sales of 432million
barrels related to the dissolution of a hamaca equity
affiliate in venezuela.

net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2008 consist of 1,936billion cubic
feet of developed reserves and (255)billion cubic feet of undeveloped reserves for consolidated
companies and 324billion cubic feet of developed reserves and 806billion cubic feet of
undeveloped reserves for affiliated companies.
during 2008, the percentages of
undeveloped reserves at december31, 2007, transferred to developed reserves were 12percent and 0
percent for consolidated companies and affiliated companies, respectively.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural
gas proved-reserve changes for 2006 through 2008 are
discussed below:
revisions
in 2006, revisions accounted
for a net increase of 481billion cubic feet (bcf)for
consolidated companies and 26 bcf for affiliates. for
consolidated companies, net increases of 511 bcf
internationally were partially offset by a 30 bcf
downward revision in the united states. drilling and
development activities added 337 bcf of reserves in
thailand, while kazakhstan added 200 bcf, largely due
to development activity. trinidad and tobago increased
185 bcf, attributable to improved reservoir performance
and a
new contract for sales of natural gas. these
additions were partially offset by downward revisions
of 224 bcf in the united kingdom and 130 bcf in australia due to
drilling results and reservoir performance. u.s.
other had a downward revision of 102 bcf due to
reservoir performance, which was partially offset by
upward revisions of 72 bcf in the gulf of mexico and
california related to reservoir performance and
development drilling. tco had an upward revision of 26
bcf associated with additional development activity and
updated reservoir performance.
in 2007, revisions increased reserves for
consolidated companies by a net 395 bcf and increased
reserves for affili-

ated companies by a net 73 bcf. for consolidated
companies, net increases were 209 bcf in the united
states and 186 bcf internationally. improved reservoir
performance for many fields in the united states
contributed 130 bcf in the other region, 40 bcf in
california and 39 bcf in the gulf of mexico. drilling
activities added 360 bcf in thailand and improved
reservoir performance added 188 bcf in trinidad and
tobago. these additions were partially offset by
downward revisions of 185 bcf in australia due to
drilling results and 136 bcf in nigeria due to field
performance. negative revisions due to the impact of
higher prices were recorded in azerbaijan and
kazakhstan. tco had an upward revision of 75 bcf
associated with improved reservoir performance and
development activities. this upward revision was net of
a negative impact due to higher year-end prices.
in 2008, revisions increased reserves for consolidated
companies by a net 1,166 bcf and increased reserves for
affiliated companies by 1,130 bcf. in the asia-pacific
region, positive revisions totaled 961 bcf for
consolidated companies. almost half of the increase was
attributed to the karachaganak field in kazakhstan, due
mainly to the effects of low year-end prices on the
production-sharing contract and the results of
development drilling and improved recovery. other large
upward revisions were recorded for the pattani field in
thailand due to a successful drilling campaign. for the
tco affiliate in kazakhstan, an increase of 498 bcf
reflected the impacts of lower year-end prices on the

accounted for a majority of the 632 bcf increase in
other affiliated companies.
extensions and discoveriesin 2006, extensions and
discoveries accounted for an increase of 799 bcf for
consolidated companies, reflecting a 531 bcf increase
outside the united states and a u.s. increase of 268
bcf. bangladesh added 451 bcf, the result of
development activity and field extensions, and thailand
added 59 bcf, the result of drilling activities. u.s.
other contributed 157 bcf, approximately half of
which was related to south texas and the piceance basin, and the gulf of
mexico added 111 bcf, partly due to the initial booking
of reserves at the great white field in the deepwater
perdido fold belt area.
in 2007, extensions and discoveries accounted for
an increase of 518 bcf worldwide. the largest addition
was 330 bcf in bangladesh, the result of drilling
activities. other additions were not individually
significant.
purchasesin 2006, purchases of natural
gas reserves were 35 bcf for consolidated companies,
about evenly divided between the companys u.s. and
international operations. affiliated companies added
54 bcf of reserves, the result of conversion of an
operating service agreement to a joint stock company
in venezuela.
in 2007, purchases of natural gas reserves were
141 bcf for consolidated companies, which include the
acquisition of an additional interest in the bibiyana
field in bangladesh. affiliated company purchases of
211 bcf related to the formation of a new hamaca
equity affiliate in venezuela and an initial booking
related to the angola lng project.
salesin 2006, sales for consolidated companies totaled 149 bcf,
mostly associated with the conversion of a risked
service agreement to a joint stock company in
venezuela.
in 2007, sales were 76 bcf and 175 bcf for
consolidated companies and equity affiliates,
respectively. the affiliated company sales related to
the dissolution of a hamaca equity affiliate in
venezuela.
table
vi  standardized measure of discounted
futurenet
cash flows related to proved
oiland
gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and
gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the
requirements of fas 69. estimated future cash inflows
from production are computed by applying year-end
prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of
estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are
limited to those provided by contractual arrangements
in existence at the end of each reporting year. future
development and production costs are those estimated
future expenditures necessary to develop and produce
year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end
cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end
economic conditions, and include estimated costs for
asset retirement obligations. estimated future income
taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end
statutory tax rates. these rates reflect allowable
deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated
future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of
related assets. discounted future net cash flows are
calculated using 10percent midperiod discount factors.
discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when
future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves
will be produced.
the information provided does not represent
managements estimate of the companys expected future
cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.
estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise
and change over time as new information becomes
available. moreover, probable and possible reserves,
which may become proved in the future, are excluded
from the calculations. the arbitrary valuation prescribed
under fas 69 requires assumptions as to the timing and
amount of future development and production costs. the
calculations are made as of december31 each year and
should not be relied upon as an indication of the
companys future cash flows or value of its oil and
gas reserves. in the following table, standardized
measure net cash flows refers to the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows.
