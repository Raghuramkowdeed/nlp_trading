SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON

CORPORATION,

1

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL,

MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS, MINING OPERATIONS, POWER

GENERATION AND ENERGY SERVICES. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

(UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND ALSO MARKETING NATURAL

GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM)

OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM

PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL

CAR. CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING

OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND

FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

A LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES

E-125

AND

E-126.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, CHEVRON HAD APPROXIMATELY

67,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 5,000 SERVICE STATION

EMPLOYEES). APPROXIMATELY 32,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT

4,000 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES), OR 48 PERCENT, WERE

EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, AND INDIVIDUAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

CONTROL OVER SOME OF THEM. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES, REGULATING HOW

COMPANIES ARE STRUCTURED AND WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT

THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME

CASES, LIMITING THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THESE COMMODITIES. HOWEVER,

SOME GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE PRICE CONTROLS ON REFINED PRODUCTS SUCH

AS GASOLINE OR DIESEL FUEL. THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE

WORLDS SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL, AND THEIR PRODUCTION

LEVELS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY.

DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS

LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL

ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO

OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. SEASONALITY

IS NOT A PRIMARY DRIVER TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

QUARTERLY EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON

COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR GLOBAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES,

AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES, FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LEASES AND OTHER

PROPERTIES AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR REQUIRED TO DEVELOP

AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS,

CHEVRON ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM

COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION ENTITIES IN THE SALE OR ACQUISITION OF VARIOUS

GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

AND ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY,

WITH OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA,

THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA AND AUSTRALIA. TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT

PAGE FS-38.

SIMILAR COMPARATIVE DATA FOR THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN

AND INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT ARE IN NOTES 12 AND 13 ON PAGES FS-41 TO FS-43.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2008 WERE $22.8 BILLION, INCLUDING

$2.3 BILLION FOR CHEVRONS SHARE OF EXPENDITURES BY

AFFILIATED COMPANIES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE CASH OUTLAYS BY THE

COMPANY. IN 2007 AND 2006, EXPENDITURES WERE $20 BILLION

AND $16.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF

$2.3 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION IN THE CORRESPONDING

PERIODS.

OF THE $22.8 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2008, ABOUT

THREE-FOURTHS, OR $17.5 BILLION, WAS RELATED TO UPSTREAM

ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED

FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2007 AND 2006. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS, REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE

AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2009, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE $22.8 BILLION, INCLUDING

$1.8 BILLION OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS

OF THE TOTAL, OR $17.5 BILLION, IS BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $13.9 BILLION OF THAT

AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION, INCLUDING VOLUMES FROM OIL

SANDS (REFER TO FOOTNOTE 1 ABOVE), WAS 2.53 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY, DOWN ABOUT 3 PERCENT FROM 2007. THE DECLINE WAS

MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DAMAGES TO FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEPTEMBER

2008 HURRICANES IN THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO AND THE IMPACT

OF HIGHER PRICES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTION-SHARING AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY AGREEMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. REFER TO

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON

2006  2008 CHANGES IN PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS AVERAGE WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN 2009 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 2.63 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES,

INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE PRICE EFFECT

ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN

FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS,

DELAYS IN PROJECT

START-UPS,

FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN VARIOUS MARKETS, AND

PRODUCTION THAT MAY HAVE TO BE SHUT IN DUE TO WEATHER

CONDITIONS, CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING GEOPOLITICS OR OTHER

DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS ALSO ARE

AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG

BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2008, CHEVRON WAS ENGAGED IN VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO.

PRODUCTION

START-UP

OCCURRED IN FOURTH QUARTER 2008 AT THE 75 PERCENT-OWNED AND

OPERATED BLIND FAITH PROJECT. THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED FOR DAILY

PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF 65,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND

55 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS FROM SUBSEA WELLS TIED

BACK TO A SEMISUBMERSIBLE HULL. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WERE

INITIALLY RECORDED IN 2005, AND A PORTION WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE

PROVED-DEVELOPED CATEGORY IN 2008 COINCIDENT WITH PROJECT

START-UP.

THE PRODUCTION LIFE OF THE FIELD IS ESTIMATED TO BE

APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS.

AT CAESAR/TONGA, THE COMPANY PARTICIPATED IN A SUCCESSFUL

APPRAISAL WELL IN 2008. THE TONGA AND CAESAR PARTNERSHIPS HAVE

FORMED A UNIT AGREEMENT FOR THE AREA, WITH CHEVRON HAVING A

20 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST. FIRST OIL IS

EXPECTED BY 2011. DEVELOPMENT PLANS INCLUDE A SUBSEA TIE-BACK TO

A NEARBY THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTION FACILITY.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE ULTRA-DEEP PERDIDO

REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE PROJECT ENCOMPASSES THE INSTALLATION

OF A PRODUCING HOST FACILITY TO SERVICE MULTIPLE FIELDS,

INCLUDING CHEVRONS 33 PERCENT-OWNED GREAT WHITE,

60 PERCENT-OWNED SILVERTIP AND 58 PERCENT-OWNED

TOBAGO. CHEVRON HAS A 38 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE PERDIDO

REGIONAL HOST. ALL OF THESE FIELDS AND THE PRODUCTION FACILITY

ARE PARTNER-OPERATED. ACTIVITIES DURING 2008 INCLUDED FACILITY

CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND SPAR INSTALLATION. FIRST

OIL IS EXPECTED IN EARLY 2010, WITH THE FACILITY CAPABLE OF

HANDLING 130,000 BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY. THE

PROJECT HAS AN EXPECTED LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES RELATED TO THE PROJECT WERE FIRST

RECORDED IN 2006, AND THE PHASED RECLASSIFICATION OF THESE

RESERVES TO THE PROVED-DEVELOPED CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED NEAR

THE TIME OF PRODUCTION

START-UP.

AT THE 58 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED TAHITI FIELD,

DEVELOPMENT WORK CONTINUED FOLLOWING A DELAY IN 2007 DUE TO

METALLURGICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE FACILITYS MOORING

SHACKLES, WHICH PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. THE PROJECT IS

DESIGNED AS A SUBSEA DEVELOPMENT, WITH THE WELLS TIED BACK TO A

TRUSS-SPAR FLOATING PRODUCTION FACILITY. PRODUCTION

START-UP

IS

EXPECTED IN MID-2009. INITIAL BOOKING OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES OCCURRED IN 2003 FOR THE PROJECT, WITH THE TRANSFER OF

A PORTION OF THESE RESERVES INTO THE PROVED-DEVELOPED CATEGORY

ANTICIPATED NEAR THE TIME OF PRODUCTION

START-UP.

WITH AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE OF 30 YEARS, TAHITI IS

DESIGNED TO HAVE A MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION OF

125,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 70 MILLION CUBIC FEET

OF NATURAL GAS. IN EARLY 2009, A POSSIBLE SECOND PHASE OF FIELD

DEVELOPMENT WAS UNDER EVALUATION.

DEEPWATER EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN 2008 AND EARLY 2009 INCLUDED

PARTICIPATION IN 12 EXPLORATORY WELLS  FOUR WILDCAT

AND EIGHT APPRAISAL. EXPLORATORY WORK INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.

PROVIDES PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND BUSINESSES WITH SUSTAINABLE

ENERGY PROJECTS DESIGNED TO INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND

RELIABILITY, REDUCE ENERGY COSTS, AND UTILIZE RENEWABLE AND

ALTERNATIVE-POWER TECHNOLOGIES. SINCE 2000, CES HAS DEVELOPED

HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS THAT WILL HELP GOVERNMENT, EDUCATION AND

OTHER CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR ENERGY COSTS AND CARBON FOOTPRINT.

MAJOR PROJECTS COMPLETED BY CES IN 2008 INCLUDED SEVERAL LARGE

SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATIONS IN CALIFORNIA.

RESEARCH

AND TECHNOLOGY

THE COMPANYS ENERGY TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS

CHEVRONS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES BY PROVIDING

TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES AND COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT IN EARTH

SCIENCES; RESERVOIR AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING; DRILLING AND

COMPLETIONS; FACILITIES ENGINEERING; MANUFACTURING; PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY; CATALYSIS; TECHNICAL COMPUTING; AND HEALTH,

ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY. THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION

INTEGRATES COMPUTING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA MANAGEMENT,

SECURITY AND NETWORK TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE A STANDARDIZED

DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENABLE CHEVRONS GLOBAL

OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES.

CHEVRON TECHNOLOGY VENTURES (CTV) MANAGES INVESTMENTS AND

PROJECTS IN EMERGING ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR INTEGRATION

INTO CHEVRONS CORE BUSINESSES. AS OF THE END OF 2008, CTV

WAS INVESTIGATING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS NEXT-GENERATION BIOFUELS,

CHEVRONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE

$835 MILLION, $562 MILLION AND $468 MILLION FOR

THE YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES IN THE AREAS DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS

PROCESSES, AND ULTIMATE SUCCESSES ARE NOT CERTAIN. ALTHOUGH NOT

ALL INITIATIVES MAY PROVE TO BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, THE

COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA IS NOT

SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND TO

SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. CHEVRON EXPECTS MORE ENVIRONMENT-RELATED REGULATIONS IN

THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS OPERATIONS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF

COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS

OPERATIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING

BUSINESS.

IN 2008, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $780 MILLION, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 9 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES.

THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO

RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

NEW FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR- AND

WATER-QUALITY PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS

REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING

FACILITIES. FOR 2009, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION. THE FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS

ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL,

WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

GEOPOLITICAL RISK.

DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF HISTORICALLY LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM EARNINGS AND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. THE IMPACT ON

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED-PRODUCT

SALES.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING

AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE

HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME,

CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE;

AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER

FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL

EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES

AND/OR

TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, 29 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING

ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL

ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES,

WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

(EXCLUDING RESERVES IN INDONESIA, WHICH RELINQUISHED ITS OPEC

MEMBERSHIP AT THE END OF 2008).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS CONTINUED POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES

CONCERNING CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT

AND POTENTIAL REMEDIATION OR MITIGATION THROUGH REGULATION THAT

COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION

AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS ARE

CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS PHASES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. THE

KYOTO PROTOCOL, CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT

AND AUSTRALIAS PROPOSED CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME,

ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUAL OR PENDING FEDERAL, STATE AND PROVINCIAL

REGULATIONS, ENVISION A REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

THROUGH MARKET-BASED TRADING SCHEMES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

COMPLYING WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS WITHIN THE

EUROPEAN UNION.

AS A RESULT OF THESE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE,

OPERATING, MAINTENANCE AND REMEDIATION COSTS. THE LEVEL OF

EXPENDITURE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

IS UNCERTAIN AND MAY VARY BY JURISDICTION DEPENDING ON THE LAWS

ENACTED IN EACH JURISDICTION AND THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES

IN IT. THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS

(E.G., THE PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AT OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND THE

PROCESSING OF NATURAL GAS AT LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITIES)

TYPICALLY RESULT IN EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES. LIKEWISE,

EMISSIONS ARISE FROM POWER AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

CRUDE OIL TRANSPORTATION AND REFINING. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH BEYOND

THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE USE OF PASSENGER VEHICLE FUELS

AND RELATED PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS ALSO RESULTS IN GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS THAT MAY BE REGULATED.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY

OF EMISSION ALLOWANCES AND CREDITS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON

WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCES OR NEED TO

PURCHASE THEM IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH AUCTIONS AND THE

IMPACT OF LEGISLATION ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER

THE COSTS INCURRED THROUGH THE PRICING OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. MATERIAL COST INCREASES OR INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE OR

USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY SELLS. TO THE EXTENT THESE COSTS ARE NOT

ULTIMATELY REFLECTED IN THE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL

LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO,

ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE

REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL

PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT

ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL

1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO

INC., WAS A MINORITY MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH

PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, AS THE

MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED

SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND

FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE

CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE

SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO

TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO

THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION

PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40 MILLION. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE

SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET

AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND

ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM

OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS

LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER

CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE

ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY TO

CHEVRON; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT

IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY GIVEN

TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR. WITH

REGARD TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE

CONFIRMS THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED

AND THAT THE REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS

PETROECUADORS FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS AND PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE

ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO

IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO

SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT

RECOMMENDING THAT THE COURT ASSESS $8 BILLION, WHICH WOULD,

ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR

PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR,

AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE

SYSTEMS, AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PETROECUADOR. THE

ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL

$8.3 BILLION COULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST

ENRICHMENT. THE ENGINEERS REPORT IS NOT BINDING ON THE

COURT. CHEVRON ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE ENGINEERS WORK WAS

PERFORMED AND HIS REPORT PREPARED IN A MANNER CONTRARY TO LAW

AND IN VIOLATION OF THE COURTS ORDERS. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A

REBUTTAL TO THE REPORT IN WHICH IT ASKED THE COURT TO STRIKE THE

REPORT IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE ENGINEER REVISED

THE REPORT AND, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE, RECOMMENDED AN

INCREASE IN THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES TO

A TOTAL OF $18.9 BILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENT

FOR PURPORTED UNJUST ENRICHMENT TO A TOTAL OF $8.4 BILLION.

CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REVISED REPORT, AND CHEVRON

WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION OF

LIABILITY.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE

LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE

DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENGINEERS REPORT, MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT BELIEVE THE REPORT ITSELF HAS ANY UTILITY IN

CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE

CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE A REASONABLY

POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-6 FOR A DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL

RESULTS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH

SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING

COUNTRIES: ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, AZERBAIJAN,

BANGLADESH, BRAZIL, CAMBODIA, CANADA, CHAD, CHINA,

COLOMBIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, DENMARK,

FRANCE, INDIA, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN, MYANMAR, THE

NETHERLANDS, NIGERIA, NORWAY, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL

ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, THE PHILIPPINES,

QATAR, REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, SINGAPORE, SOUTH AFRICA,

SOUTH KOREA, THAILAND, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, THE UNITED

KINGDOM, THE UNITED STATES, VENEZUELA, AND VIETNAM.

EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY DEPEND LARGELY ON THE

PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM (EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION) AND DOWNSTREAM (REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION) BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST

FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOTH SEGMENTS IS

MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. IN THE DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE LARGEST COST COMPONENT OF

REFINED PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL TREND IN EARNINGS IS

TYPICALLY LESS AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS

CHEMICALS BUSINESS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND INVEST-

MENTS. EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANY IN ANY PERIOD

MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT

ARE INFREQUENT AND/ OR UNUSUAL IN NATURE.

IN RECENT

YEARS AND THROUGH MOST OF 2008, CHEVRON AND THE OIL

AND GAS INDUSTRY AT LARGE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN

CERTAIN COSTS THAT EXCEEDED THE GENERAL TREND OF

INFLATION IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD. THIS INCREASE IN

COSTS AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATING EXPENSES AND

CAPITAL PROGRAMS FOR ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, BUT

PARTICULARLY FOR UPSTREAM. THESE COST PRESSURES BEGAN

TO SOFTEN SOMEWHAT IN LATE 2008. AS THE PRICE OF CRUDE

OIL DROPPED PRECIPITOUSLY FROM A RECORD HIGH IN

MID-YEAR, THE DEMAND FOR SOME GOODS AND SERVICES IN

THE INDUSTRY BEGAN TO SLACKEN. THIS COST TREND IS

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DURING 2009 IF CRUDE-OIL PRICES

DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REBOUND. (REFER TO THE UPSTREAM

SECTION ON NEXT PAGE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE TREND IN

CRUDE-OIL PRICES.)

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS,

ESPECIALLY UPSTREAM, CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE

VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE

UNITED STATES. CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR

STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND THE

COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT

TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT

WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE

ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

TO SUSTAIN ITS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION IN

THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MUST DEVELOP AND

REPLENISH AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS THAT OFFER ADEQUATE

FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED.

IDENTIFYING PROMISING AREAS FOR EXPLORATION, ACQUIRING

THE NECESSARY RIGHTS TO EXPLORE FOR AND TO PRODUCE

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, DRILLING SUCCESSFULLY, AND

HANDLING THE MANY TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS IN

A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER ARE ALL IMPORTANT

FACTORS IN THIS EFFORT. PROJECTS OFTEN REQUIRE LONG

LEAD TIMES AND LARGE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. FROM TIME TO

TIME, CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS HAVE SOUGHT TO RENEGOTIATE

CONTRACTS OR IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COMPANY.

GOVERNMENTS MAY ATTEMPT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS,

TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING FUTURE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHERWISE SEEK TO MITIGATE ANY RISKS

TO THE COMPANYS CURRENT OPERATIONS OR FUTURE

PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUALLY EVALUATES

OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE OR TO

ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO ITS ASSET

BASE TO HELP AUGMENT THE COMPANYS GROWTH. REFER TO THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-6

FOR DISCUSSIONS OF NET GAINS ON ASSET SALES DURING

2008. ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND

RESTRUCTURINGS MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING THE ONGOING UNCERTAINTY IN FINANCIAL AND CREDIT

MARKETS, THE RAPID DECLINE IN CRUDE-OIL PRICES THAT BEGAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008, AND THE

GENERAL CONTRACTION OF WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. MANAGEMENT IS TAKING THESE DEVELOPMENTS INTO

ACCOUNT IN THE CONDUCT OF DAILY OPERATIONS AND FOR BUSINESS PLANNING. THE COMPANY REMAINS CONFIDENT OF ITS UNDERLYING FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DEAL WITH POTENTIAL PROBLEMS PRESENTED IN THIS

ENVIRONMENT.

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE-OIL AND NATURAL-GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL

FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM

EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS OR FEARS THEREOF THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL

UNREST OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. MOREOVER, ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IN THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS, AND ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING ITS

FACILITIES AND BUSINESS.

PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE

COMPANYS CONTROL. EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION BUT ALSO

PRICES CHARGED BY THE INDUSTRYS MATERIAL- AND SERVICE-PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE

VOLATILITY OF THE INDUSTRYS OWN SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH MATERIALS AND SERVICES.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO CAN BE AFFECTED BY DAMAGES TO

PRODUCTION FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST.

INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL WERE VOLATILE DURING 2008. THE SPOT PRICE FOR WEST TEXAS

INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE OIL, A BENCHMARK CRUDE, STARTED 2008 AT $96 PER BARREL AND PEAKED AT $147

IN EARLY JULY. AT THE END OF THE YEAR, THE WTI PRICE HAD FALLEN TO $45 PER BARREL. AS OF

MID-FEBRUARY 2009, THE WTI PRICE WAS $38 PER BARREL. THE COLLAPSE IN PRICE DURING THE SECOND HALF

OF 2008 WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A

SIGNIFICANT WEAKENING IN WORLD ECONOMIES. THE WTI PRICE AVERAGED $100 PER BARREL FOR THE FULL-YEAR

2008, COMPARED WITH $72 IN 2007.

AS IN 2007, A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL IN PRICES EXISTED IN 2008 BETWEEN HIGH-QUALITY (I.E.,

HIGH-GRAVITY, LOW-SULFUR) CRUDE OILS AND THOSE OF LOWER QUALITY (I.E., LOW-GRAVITY, HIGH-SULFUR

CRUDE). THE RELATIVELY LOWER PRICE FOR THE HIGH-SULFUR CRUDES HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH AN AMPLE

SUPPLY AND RELATIVELY LOWER DEMAND DUE TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO

PROCESS THIS LOWER-QUALITY FEEDSTOCK INTO LIGHT PRODUCTS (I.E., MOTOR GASOLINE, JET FUEL, AVIATION

GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL). CHEVRON PRODUCES OR SHARES IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN

CALIFORNIA, CHAD, INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT,

VENEZUELA AND CERTAIN FIELDS IN ANGOLA, CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM NORTH SEA. (REFER TO PAGE

FS-10 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS.)

IN CONTRAST TO

PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL GAS IN MANY REGIONAL

MARKETS ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS IN THOSE MARKETS. IN THE UNITED

STATES DURING 2008, BENCHMARK PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED ABOUT $9 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET (MCF),

COMPARED WITH ABOUT $7 IN 2007. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2009,

FS-3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE HENRY HUB PRICE WAS ABOUT $5.60 AND $4.70 PER MCF, RESPECTIVELY. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE

FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUMES PRODUCED IN NORTH

AMERICA AND THE INVENTORY IN UNDERGROUND STORAGE RELATIVE TO CUSTOMER DEMAND. U.S. NATURAL GAS

PRICES ARE ALSO TYPICALLY HIGHER DURING THE WINTER PERIOD WHEN DEMAND FOR HEATING IS GREATEST.

CERTAIN OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE DIFFERENT SUPPLY, DEMAND

AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES, TYPICALLY RESULTING IN LOWER AVERAGE SALES PRICES FOR THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS. (REFER TO PAGE FS-10 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS

FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.) ADDITIONALLY, EXCESS-SUPPLY CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN

CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD CANNOT EASILY SERVE TO MITIGATE THE RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICE CONDITIONS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER MARKETS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO TRANSPORT AND

RECEIVE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS.

TO HELP ADDRESS THIS REGIONAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS, CHEVRON

CONTINUES TO INVEST IN LONG-TERM PROJECTS IN AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO

PRODUCE AND LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER, ALONG WITH INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO

REGASIFY THE PRODUCT IN MARKETS WHERE DEMAND IS STRONG AND SUPPLIES ARE NOT AS PLENTIFUL. DUE TO

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THESE LONG-TERM PROJECTS, THE NATURAL GAS SALES

PRICES IN THE AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY (BEFORE THE NATURAL GAS IS TRANSFERRED TO A PROCESSING

FACILITY) ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW SALES PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS THAT IS PRODUCED MUCH NEARER TO

AREAS OF HIGH DEMAND AND CAN BE TRANSPORTED IN EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE NETWORKS (AS IN THE

UNITED STATES OR THAILAND).

BESIDES THE IMPACT OF THE FLUCTUATION IN PRICE FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, THE LONGER-TERM

TREND IN EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ALSO A FUNCTION OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES

IN FISCAL TERMS OF CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN TAX RATES ON INCOME, AND THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES.

CHEVRONS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2008, INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL

SANDS, AVERAGED 2.53 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, A DECLINE OF ABOUT 90,000 BARRELS PER DAY FROM 2007

DUE MAINLY TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES ON VOLUMES RECOVERED UNDER CERTAIN PRODUCTION-SHARING AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY AGREEMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND DAMAGE TO PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN

SEPTEMBER 2008 CAUSED BY HURRICANES GUSTAV AND IKE IN THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO. (REFER TO THE

DISCUSSION OF U.S. UPSTREAM PRODUCTION TRENDS IN THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGE

FS-6.

REFER ALSO TO THE SELECTED OPERATING DATA TABLE ON PAGE

FS-10 FOR A LISTING OF PRODUCTION VOLUMES

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008.)

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2009 WILL AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 2.63

MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY

BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE

SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS, DELAYS IN PROJECT STARTUPS, FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN

VARIOUS MARKETS, WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY SHUT IN PRODUCTION, CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING

GEOPOLITICS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY THE

SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME

LAG BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. MOST OF CHEVRONS UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM PROJECTS

GENERALLY ARE MADE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS.

APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2008 OCCURRED IN

THE OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE

BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. (THIS PRODUCTION STATISTIC EXCLUDES VOLUMES PRODUCED IN INDONESIA,

WHICH RELINQUISHED ITS OPEC MEMBERSHIP AT THE END OF 2008.) AT A MEETING ON DECEMBER 17, 2008, OPEC

ANNOUNCED A REDUCTION OF 4.2 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, OR 14 PERCENT, FROM ACTUAL SEPTEMBER 2008

PRODUCTION OF 29 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. THE REDUCTION BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009. OPEC

QUOTAS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT CHEVRONS PRODUCTION LEVEL IN 2007 OR IN 2008. THE COMPANYS

CURRENT AND FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE CUTBACKS ANNOUNCED BY OPEC IN

DECEMBER 2008.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGES FS-6 THROUGH FS-7 FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM OPERATIONS.

DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO MARGINS ON THE REFINING

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE GASOLINE, DIESEL, JET FUEL, LUBRICANTS, FUEL OIL AND

FEEDSTOCKS FOR CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING. INDUSTRY MARGINS ARE SOMETIMES VOLATILE AND CAN BE AFFECTED

BY THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND BALANCE FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND BY CHANGES IN THE

PRICE OF CRUDE OIL USED FOR REFINERY FEEDSTOCK. INDUSTRY MARGINS CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY REFINED-PRODUCT INVENTORY LEVELS, GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, REFINERY MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND DISRUPTIONS

AT REFINERIES RESULTING FROM UNPLANNED OUTAGES THAT MAY BE DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER OR OTHER

OPERATIONAL EVENTS.

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY FOR DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY AND

EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING NETWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CRUDE-OIL AND PRODUCT-SUPPLY FUNCTIONS AND THE ECONOMIC RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL. PROFITABILITY CAN ALSO

BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF TANKER-CHARTER RATES FOR THE COMPANYS SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH

ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRYS DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE

COMPANYS CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE COMPANYS

REFINERY AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

THE COMPANYS MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE U.S.

GULF COAST, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA, SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. CHEVRON OPERATES OR HAS

OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REFINERIES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS EXCEPT LATIN AMERICA. DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, WERE WEAK FROM MID-2007 THROUGH MID-2008 DUE MAINLY TO

INCREASING PRICES OF CRUDE OIL USED IN THE REFINING PROCESS THAT WERE NOT ALWAYS FULLY RECOVERED

THROUGH SALES PRICES OF REFINED PRODUCTS. MARGINS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008 AS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL DECLINED.

AS PART OF ITS DOWNSTREAM STRATEGY TO FOCUS ON AREAS OF MARKET STRENGTH, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

PLANS TO SELL MARKETING BUSINESSES IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES. REFER TO THE DISCUSSION IN OPERATING

DEVELOPMENTS BELOW.

INDUSTRY MARGINS IN THE FUTURE MAY BE VOLATILE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY CHANGES

IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL USED FOR REFINERY FEEDSTOCK AND BY CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS. THE INDUSTRY SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND BALANCE CAN BE AFFECTED BY

DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES RESULTING FROM MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND UNPLANNED OUTAGES, INCLUDING

WEATHER-RELATED DISRUPTIONS; REFINED-PRODUCT INVENTORY LEVELS; AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS.

REFER TO PAGES FS-7 THROUGH FS-8 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM

OPERATIONS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS IN THE PETROCHEMICALS BUSINESS ARE CLOSELY TIED TO GLOBAL CHEMICAL DEMAND,

INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS AND PLANT CAPACITY UTILIZATION. FEEDSTOCK AND FUEL COSTS, WHICH TEND TO

FOLLOW CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE MOVEMENTS, ALSO INFLUENCE EARNINGS IN THIS SEGMENT.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGE FS-8 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF

CHEMICALS EARNINGS.

U.S UPSTREAM INCOME OF $7.1 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED $2.6 BILLION FROM 2007. HIGHER AVERAGE PRICES

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $3.1 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING

TO THE HIGHER EARNINGS WERE GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION ON ASSET SALES, INCLUDING A $600

MILLION GAIN ON AN ASSET-EXCHANGE TRANSACTION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS WERE ADVERSE

EFFECTS OF ABOUT $1.6 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND HIGHER OPERATING

EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF EXPENSES RESULTING FROM DAMAGE TO FACILITIES

IN THE GULF OF MEXICO CAUSED BY HURRICANES GUSTAV AND IKE IN SEPTEMBER.

INCOME OF $4.5 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION FROM 2006. RESULTS IN 2007

BENEFITED APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION FROM HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

THIS BENEFIT TO INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF A DECLINE IN OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION AND AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION, OPERATING AND EXPLORATION EXPENSES.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2008 WAS $88.43 PER

BARREL, COMPARED WITH $63.16 IN 2007 AND $56.66 IN 2006. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS

$7.90 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2008, COMPARED WITH $6.12 AND $6.29 IN 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2008 AVERAGED 671,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN 9.7 PERCENT AND

12.1 PERCENT FROM 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE BETWEEN 2007 AND 2008 WAS MAINLY DUE TO

NORMAL FIELD DECLINES AND THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF THE HURRICANES. THE DECLINE IN 2007 FROM 2006 WAS

DUE PRIMARILY TO NORMAL FIELD DECLINES. THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FOR

2008 AVERAGED 421,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT FROM 2007 AND DOWN 9 PERCENT

COMPARED WITH 2006. NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 1.5 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2008,

DOWN 12 PERCENT FROM 2007 AND DOWN 17 PERCENT FROM 2006.

HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $4.9 BILLION. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER PRICES WAS AN IMPACT OF ABOUT $1.8 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH A

REDUCTION OF CRUDE-OIL SALES VOLUMES DUE TO

TIMING OF CERTAIN CARGO LIFTINGS AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND OPERATING EXPENSES. FOREIGN

INCREASED LIFTINGS. NON-RECURRING INCOME-TAX ITEMS ALSO BENEFITED EARNINGS BETWEEN PERIODS. THESE

BENEFITS TO INCOME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER OPERATING AND DEPRECIATION

EXPENSES.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2008 WAS $86.51 PER

CANADA. VOLUMES IN 2006 ALSO INCLUDED PRODUCTION UNDER

AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT IN VENEZUELA UNTIL ITS

CONVERSION TO A JOINT-STOCK COMPANY IN OCTOBER OF THAT

YEAR. ABSENT THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES ON CERTAIN

PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY AGREEMENTS, NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION INCREASED BETWEEN 2007 AND

2008. THE DECLINE IN 2007 FROM 2006 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE IMPACT OF THE CONTRACT CONVERSION IN VENEZUELA AND

THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING

AGREEMENTS.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION WAS 1.3 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2008, A

DECREASE OF 5 PERCENT FROM 2007 AND 9 PERCENT FROM

GAINS ON DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS. OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE HIGHER BETWEEN PERIODS. INCOME OF $966

MILLION IN 2007 DECREASED NEARLY $1 BILLION FROM 2006.

THE DECLINE WAS ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH LOWER REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS AND HIGHER PLANNED AND UNPLANNED

REFINERY DOWNTIME THAN A YEAR EARLIER. OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE ALSO HIGHER IN 2007 THAN IN 2006.

SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED PRODUCTS WERE 1.41 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY IN 2008, A DECREASE OF 3 PERCENT FROM 2007.

THE DECLINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED SALES OF

GASOLINE AND FUEL OIL. SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED

PRODUCTS WERE 1.46 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2007, A

DECREASE OF 3 PERCENT FROM 2006. THE REPORTED SALES

VOLUME FOR 2007 WAS ON A DIFFERENT BASIS THAN 2006 DUE

TO A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING RULES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE

INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES INCREASED IN 2008 FROM 2007 ON IMPROVED UPSTREAM-RELATED

EARNINGS AT TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO) DUE TO HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL. LOWER INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES

BETWEEN 2006 AND 2007 WAS MAINLY DUE TO A DECLINE IN EARNINGS FROM CPCHEM, DYNEGY (SOLD IN

MAY 2007) AND DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC AREA. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE DECLINES

WERE IMPROVED RESULTS FOR TCO AND INCOME FOR A FULL YEAR FROM PETROBOSCAN, WHICH WAS CONVERTED FROM

AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT TO A JOINT-STOCK COMPANY IN OCTOBER 2006. REFER TO NOTE 12,

COMPLETION OF HIGHER-COST DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND ASSET-RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. THE INCREASE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE 44 PERCENT IN 2008, 42 PERCENT IN 2007 AND 46 PERCENT IN 2006.

RATES WERE HIGHER BETWEEN 2007 AND 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO A GREATER PROPORTION OF INCOME EARNED IN

TAX JURISDICTIONS WITH HIGHER INCOME TAX RATES. IN ADDITION, THE 2007 PERIOD INCLUDED A RELATIVELY

LOW EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK AND THE SALE

OF DOWNSTREAM ASSETS IN EUROPE. RATES WERE LOWER IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 DUE MAINLY TO THE

IMPACT OF NONRECURRING ITEMS IN 2007 MENTIONED ABOVE AND THE ABSENCE OF 2006 CHARGES RELATED TO A

TAX-LAW CHANGE THAT INCREASED TAX RATES ON UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN THE U.K. NORTH SEA AND THE

SETTLEMENT OF A TAX CLAIM IN VENEZUELA. REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAXES IN NOTE 16

TOTAL BALANCES WERE $9.6 BILLION AND $8.1 BILLION

$29.6 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $25.0 BILLION IN 2007 AND $24.3 BILLION IN 2006.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS NET OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS OF

APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION, $300 MILLION AND $400 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES OF $1.5 BILLION IN 2008,

$3.3 BILLION IN 2007 AND $1.0 BILLION IN 2006.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, RESTRICTED CASH OF $367 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL-INVESTMENT PROJECTS

AT THE COMPANYS PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI, REFINERY AND ANGOLA LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PROJECT WAS

INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RECLASSIFIED FROM CASH EQUIVALENTS TO A LONG-TERM

ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY PAID DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION IN 2008, $4.8 BILLION IN

2007 AND $4.4 BILLION IN 2006. IN APRIL 2008, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND BY 12.1 PERCENT TO $0.65 PER SHARE.

DEBT, CAPITAL LEASE AND MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS

TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE BALANCES

WERE $8.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, UP FROM $7.2 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2007. THE COMPANY ALSO

HAD MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS OF $469 MILLION AND $204 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE $1.7 BILLION INCREASE IN TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DURING 2008 INCLUDED THE

NET EFFECT OF AN APPROXIMATE $2.7 BILLION INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL PAPER AND $749 MILLION OF CHEVRON

CANADA FUNDING COMPANY BONDS THAT MATURED. THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE

WITHIN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT, TOTALED $7.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, UP FROM $5.5 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2007. OF THESE

AMOUNTS, $5.0 BILLION AND $4.4 BILLION WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD,

RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END 2008, SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE

OF WORKING CAPITAL WITHIN ONE YEAR, AS THE COMPANY HAD THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY

COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

AT YEAR-END 2008, THE COMPANY HAD $5 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR

BANKS, WHICH PERMIT THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE

FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL-PAPER BORROWING AND ALSO CAN BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANYS

PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY

FS-10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING

LEVELS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. TERMS OF NEW COMMITMENTS IN THE FUTURE WILL BE SUBJECT TO

MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE

UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT INTEREST RATES BASED ON LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF

BASE LENDING RATES PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG

CREDIT RATING. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2010 FOR

AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY. IN

JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE ISSUANCE OF ONE OR MORE SERIES OF

NOTES OR DEBENTURES IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT UP TO $5 BILLION FOR A TERM NOT TO EXCEED TEN YEARS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING PUBLIC BONDS ISSUED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION

PROFIT SHARING/SAVINGS PLAN TRUST FUND, TEXACO CAPITAL INC. AND UNION OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA.

ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE GUARANTEED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ARE RATED AA BY STANDARD AND

POORS CORPORATION AND AA1 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANYS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS

RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND P-1 BY MOODYS. ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY,

INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE

CAPITAL-SPENDING PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. DURING PERIODS OF

LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY

CHEMICALS, THE COMPANY HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE BORROWINGS AND/OR MODIFY CAPITAL-SPENDING

PLANS TO CONTINUE PAYING THE COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE COMPANYS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT

RATINGS.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY AUTHORIZED THE ACQUISITION OF

UP TO $15 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, AS PERMITTED

BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE PROGRAM IS FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO THREE YEARS AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2008, 119 MILLION SHARES HAD BEEN ACQUIRED UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR $10.1 BILLION,

INCLUDING $8.0 BILLION IN 2008. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDE SHARES ACQUIRED IN OCTOBER 2008 AS PART OF AN

ASSET-EXCHANGE TRANSACTION DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34. THE COMPANY DID NOT ACQUIRE

ANY SHARES IN EARLY 2009 AND DOES NOT PLAN TO ACQUIRE ANY SHARES IN THE 2009 FIRST QUARTER.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2008 WERE $22.8 BILLION,

INCLUDING $2.3 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE

CASH OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. IN 2007 AND 2006, EXPENDITURES WERE $20.0 BILLION AND $16.6 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF $2.3 BILLION AND $1.9

BILLION IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS.

OF THE $22.8 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2008, ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS, OR $17.5 BILLION, RELATED

TO UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS

IN 2007 AND 2006. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE

UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THE THREE YEARS, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES

THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IN 2009, CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WILL BE $22.8

BILLION, INCLUDING $1.8 BILLION OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE TOTAL, OR

$17.5 BILLION, IS BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $13.9 BILLION OF THIS

AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SPENDING IN 2009 IS PRIMARILY TARGETED FOR EXPLORATORY PROSPECTS

IN THE DEEPWATER U.S. GULF OF MEXICO, WESTERN AFRICA, AND THE GULF OF THAILAND AND MAJOR

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN ANGOLA, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, INDONESIA, NIGERIA, THAILAND AND THE DEEPWATER

U.S. GULF OF MEXICO. ALSO INCLUDED ARE ONE-TIME PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH UPSTREAM OPERATING

AGREEMENTS IN CHINA AND THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN

INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE COMPANYS

INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES

BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY

COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300

MILLION. THROUGH THE END OF 2008, THE COMPANY HAD PAID

$48 MILLION UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE

OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION

PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING

TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO

ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON

AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL,

THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT

TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER

2001. CLAIMS MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY

2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY

2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE

INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2009, SHELL DELIVERED A

LETTER TO THE COMPANY PURPORTING TO PRESERVE

UNMATURED CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN EQUILON INDEMNITIES. THE LETTER ITSELF PROVIDES NO ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE CLAIM AMOUNT,

AND MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE LETTER PROVIDES A BASIS TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF A RANGE OF LOSS OR POTENTIAL

RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO EQUILON OR THE MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL

AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE

CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY

EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY

APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED

CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT

WERE SOLD IN 1997. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED UNTIL

APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE

ACQUIRER SHARES IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF $200 MILLION, WHICH

HAD NOT BEEN REACHED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

SECURITIZATION

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED

THE PROGRAM USED TO SECURITIZE DOWNSTREAM-RELATED TRADE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AT YEAR-END 2007, THE BALANCE OF

SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES WAS $675 MILLION. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER

SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF $469 MILLION

RELATED TO MINORITY INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO

DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED

TO THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS,

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY,

INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND STORAGE OF

CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY REFINERIES. THE

COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR

LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF THIS ACTIVITY

WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS IN 2008.

THE COMPANYS MARKET

EXPOSURE POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY

BASIS BY AN INTERNAL RISK CONTROL GROUP TO ENSURE

COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS

RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING ACTIVITIES CONSIST MAINLY

OF FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE

NYMEX (NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE) AND ON ELECTRONIC

PLATFORMS OF ICE (INTER-CONTINENTAL EXCHANGE) AND

GLOBEX (CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE). IN ADDITION,

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED-PRODUCT SWAP

CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO

PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER

MARKETS.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE

DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN

INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM

PUBLISHED MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT

THIRD-PARTY QUOTES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE FROM

CHEVRONS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IN 2008 WAS

A QUARTERLY AVERAGE INCREASE OF $160 MILLION IN TOTAL

ASSETS AND A QUARTERLY AVERAGE DECREASE OF $1 MILLION

IN TOTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY USES A VALUE-AT-RISK

(VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN FAIR

VALUE ON A SINGLE DAY FROM THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE

CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

HELD OR ISSUED, WHICH ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FAS STATEMENT NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS

AMENDED (FAS 133). VAR IS THE MAXIMUM LOSS NOT TO BE

EXCEEDED WITHIN A GIVEN PROBABILITY OR CONFIDENCE

LEVEL OVER A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANYS VAR

MODEL USES THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION METHOD THAT

INVOLVES GENERATING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS FROM THE

SPECIFIED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION AND CONSTRUCTING A

FULL DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTFOLIOS POTENTIAL VALUES.

THE VAR MODEL UTILIZES AN EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING

AVERAGE FOR COMPUTING HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND

CORRELATIONS, A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL, AND A

ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD. THAT IS, THE COMPANYS 95

PERCENT, ONE-DAY VAR CORRESPONDS TO THE UNREALIZED LOSS

IN PORTFOLIO VALUE THAT WOULD NOT BE EXCEEDED ON

AVERAGE MORE THAN ONE IN EVERY 20 TRADING DAYS, IF THE

PORTFOLIO WERE HELD CONSTANT FOR ONE DAY.

THE ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD IS BASED ON THE

ASSUMPTION THAT MARKET-RISK POSITIONS CAN BE LIQUIDATED

OR HEDGED WITHIN ONE DAY. FOR HEDGING AND RISK

MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY USES CONVENTIONAL

EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS

AS WELL AS NON-EXCHANGE-TRADED SWAPS, MOST OF WHICH CAN

BE LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED EFFECTIVELY WITHIN ONE DAY. THE

TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE 95 PERCENT/ONE-DAY VAR FOR

EACH OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY RISK EXPOSURES IN THE

AREA OF DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER

31, 2008 AND 2007. THE HIGHER AMOUNTS IN 2008 WERE

ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN PRICE VOLATILITY FOR

THESE COMMODITIES DURING THE YEAR.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180 DAYS

OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND

ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN

CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS,

FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT YEAR-END

2008 WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $100

MILLION. THE EFFECT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE FOR A

HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE

U.S. DOLLAR AT YEAR-END 2008.

INTEREST

RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

INTEREST-RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS

OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON

ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH

SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED

BY REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT YEAR-END 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NO

INTEREST-RATE SWAPS ON FLOATING-RATE DEBT. THE

COMPANYS ONLY INTEREST-RATE SWAPS ON FIXED-RATE DEBT

MATURED IN JANUARY 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS

WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR

OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS AND LONG-TERM PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

REFER TO OTHER INFORMATION IN NOTE 12 OF THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PAGE FS-42, FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE

AGREEMENTS

HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH AN

UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. IN OCTOBER 2008, 59 CASES WERE SETTLED IN WHICH THE COMPANY

WAS A PARTY AND WHICH RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED

SEEPAGE OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER. THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT MATERIAL TO

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO 37 OTHER PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS

OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS. RESOLUTION OF THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR

RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE

OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE SETTLEMENT OF THE 59

LAWSUITS DID NOT SET ANY PRECEDENTS RELATED TO STANDARDS OF LIABILITY TO BE USED TO JUDGE THE

MERITS OF THE CLAIMS, CORRECTIVE MEASURES REQUIRED OR MONETARY DAMAGES TO BE ASSESSED FOR THE

REMAINING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS OR FUTURE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE

EXPOSURE RELATED TO PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF

GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

RFG PATENT

FOURTEEN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE BROUGHT BY CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED

REFORMULATED GASOLINE (RFG) FROM JANUARY 1995 THROUGH AUGUST 2005, ALLEGING THAT UNOCAL MISLED THE

CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD INTO ADOPTING STANDARDS FOR COMPOSITION OF RFG THAT OVERLAPPED WITH

UNOCALS UNDISCLOSED AND PENDING PATENTS. THE PARTIES AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT THAT CALLS FOR, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, UNOCAL TO PAY $48 MILLION AND FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A

CY PRES

FUND TO ADMINISTER

PAYOUT OF THE AWARD. THE COURT APPROVED THE FINAL SETTLEMENT IN NOVEMBER 2008.

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A

DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO, ECUADOR,

BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF AN AREA

WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE

ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO

FUND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH

MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO INC., WAS

A MINORITY MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED

OIL COMPANY, AS

THE MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE

CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN

INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A

FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC

SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM.

PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40

MILLION. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET

AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING

FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR

FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION

OVER CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT

BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY TO CHEVRON; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS IN ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY

PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED

AND THAT THE REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE

OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING

THAT THE COURT ASSESS $8 BILLION, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL

COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER

ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS, AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

PETROECUADOR. THE ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL $8.3 BILLION COULD BE ASSESSED

AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. THE ENGINEERS REPORT IS NOT BINDING ON THE COURT. CHEVRON

ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE ENGINEERS WORK WAS PERFORMED AND HIS REPORT PREPARED IN A MANNER CONTRARY

TO LAW AND IN VIOLATION OF THE COURTS ORDERS. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REPORT IN WHICH

IT ASKED THE COURT TO STRIKE THE REPORT IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE ENGINEER REVISED THE

REPORT AND, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE, RECOMMENDED AN INCREASE IN THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR

PURPORTED DAMAGES TO A TOTAL OF $18.9 BILLION AND AN INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENT FOR PURPORTED

UNJUST ENRICHMENT TO A TOTAL OF $8.4 BILLION. CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REVISED REPORT,

AND CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS) CAN

BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENGINEERS REPORT, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

BELIEVE THE REPORT ITSELF HAS ANY UTILITY IN CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF

LOSS). MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO

BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO

FS-15

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN

THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE

ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE

OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY

OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH

CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER

STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND

MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY

DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN

TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH

COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

INCLUDED IN THE $1,818 MILLION YEAR-END 2008 RESERVE BALANCE WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OF

248 SITES FOR WHICH

THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE

INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY

AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS

REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2008 WAS $120 MILLION. THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT

AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER

REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT

DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2008 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,698 MILLION, $968 MILLION

RELATED TO CURRENT AND FORMER SITES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), AND

PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $730 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM

($117 MILLION), UPSTREAM ($390 MILLION), CHEMICALS ($154 MILLION) AND OTHER ($69 MILLION).

LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND

OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE

DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM

HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE

NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2008 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143).

UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED WHEN

THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY

CAN BE

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE LIABILITY BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $9.4 BILLION FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2008 RELATED PRIMARILY TO UPSTREAM PROPERTIES.

FOR THE COMPANYS

OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS FACILITIES, NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE

FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS REACH THE END OF THEIR USEFUL

LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS BEEN MADE, AS THE

INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 143

(FIN 47), AND THE DISCUSSION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS BELOW.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED. REFER TO NOTE 16 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-45 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH TAX

RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR ALL TAX

JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THAT SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008, WHICH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF ENERGY AND TAX-RELATED

PROVISIONS, KNOWN AS THE ENERGY IMPROVEMENT AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 (THE ACT), WAS SIGNED INTO

U.S. LAW IN OCTOBER 2008. THE ACT INCLUDES TWO PROVISIONS THAT AFFECT CHEVRONS TAX LIABILITY,

BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THE ACT FREEZES AT 6 PERCENT THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS

DEDUCTION ON INCOME FROM U.S. OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS THAT WAS SCHEDULED TO INCREASE TO 9 PERCENT IN

2010. EFFECTIVE IN 2009, THE ACT EXPANDS THE CURRENT FOREIGN TAX CREDIT (FTC) LIMITATION FOR

FOREIGN OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION INCOME TO ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN DOWNSTREAM INCOME, KNOWN AS FOREIGN

OIL RELATED INCOME. THIS CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT CHEVRONS UTILIZATION OF FTCS.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A FINAL

DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS. THE

ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITY OR

DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION OF

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AN INCREASE OF $458

MILLION FROM 2007. THE 2007 BALANCE REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $421 MILLION FROM 2006.

THE FUTURE

TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH WELL

WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER

THE WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES

THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. THE EFFECT ON EXPLORATION EXPENSES

IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE $2.1 BILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END 2008 IS UNCERTAIN PENDING

FUTURE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NORMAL PROJECT EVALUATION AND ADDITIONAL DRILLING.

REFER

TO NOTE 20, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-48, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUSPENDED WELLS.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE

FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES.

THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO

EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK HILLS,

CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES.

FOR THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT

APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRON IS

ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS

RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS

CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS; U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES;

GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN

THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL,

EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE

COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS

OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE

EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY

OWNED FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION

MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT NON-CHEVRON SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE

BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL

THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST

OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CON-

SIDERED

ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO

MEET CURRENT STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON

ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2008 AT APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION FOR ITS

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1.8 BILLION OF COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION,

CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS

FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED

SITES, AND THE ABANDONMENT AND

RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR 2009, TOTAL WORLDWIDE

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE

ESTIMATED AT $2.2 BILLION. THESE

CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE

ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE

COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY

CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR EXISTING

FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS

TO BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE TO: PREVENT, CONTROL,

REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY WITH EXISTING AND NEW

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND

RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN

THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH

INFORMATION OVER DIFFERENT REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS

DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE PRIOR TO THE

ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING TO

THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES OR

ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF

SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT NECES-

SARY TO

ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE

SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE; AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS

MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA,

THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH NOT ASSOCIATED WITH

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REVISION AS

CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES THAT

THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS

BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE

ESTIMATION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES UNDER

SEC RULES THAT REQUIRE ... GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING

DATA (THAT) DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY

(RESERVES) TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN

RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING

CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE

ESTIMATE IS MADE. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY

INFORMATION, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-67, FOR THE CHANGES

IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER

31, 2008, AND TO TABLE VII, CHANGES IN THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH

FLOWS FROM PROVED RESERVES ON PAGE FS-74 FOR ESTIMATES

OF PROVED-RESERVE VALUES FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHICH WERE BASED ON YEAR-END

PRICES AT THE TIME. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32, INCLUDES

A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE TIMING OF EXPENSE

RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY

FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES, BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-20, INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH

DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD

RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. THIS

COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH

DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN THE

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RELATED TO ESTIMATES, UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES

AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

FS-18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND

ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED CRITICAL, AND

THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE

BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED

CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE

COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION-PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND

EXPENSE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND

THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN

OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPEB)

PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES

AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN

DETERMINING OPEB OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE ARE THE

DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND

RATES.

NOTE 22, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-51, INCLUDES

INFORMATION ON THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AT THE END OF 2008 AND 2007; THE

COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE FOR THE THREE

YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008; AND THE UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS FOR THOSE PERIODS.

PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE IS RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN OPERATING

EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE

YEAR-END 2008 AND 2007 FUNDED STATUS, MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS, OF EACH

OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IS RECOGNIZED

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE FUNDED STATUS OF

OVERFUNDED PENSION PLANS IS RECORDED AS A LONG-TERM

ASSET IN DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS. THE

FUNDED STATUS OF UNDERFUNDED OR UNFUNDED PENSION AND

OPEB PLANS IS RECORDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR

RESERVES FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. AMOUNTS YET TO

BE RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF PENSION OR OPEB EXPENSE

ARE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON

PENSION ASSETS, THE COMPANY USES A PROCESS THAT

INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND

AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TAKES

INTO CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND

ASSET-CLASS FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY

UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND

THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF

LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE

STUDIES. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 68 PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8

PERCENT SINCE 2002. FOR THE 10 YEARS ENDING DECEMBER

31, 2008, ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS AVERAGED 3.7 PERCENT FOR

THIS PLAN. THE ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS FOR THE 10 YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007, AVERAGED 8.7 PERCENT. THE

ACTUAL RETURN FOR 2008 WAS NEGATIVE AND WAS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE BROAD DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE

MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF

PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE

PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM

ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING

RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG

ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM

DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE

CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER

PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN

CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE

PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE COMPANY SELECTED A 6.3 PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR

THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THIS

RATE WAS SELECTED BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT

MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE

CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END

2008. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF 2007 AND 2006

WERE 6.3 PERCENT AND 5.8 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE PENSION

PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2008 WAS

$770 MILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF

PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

ASSUMPTION, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE

OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S.

PENSION PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN

EXPENSE FOR 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION. A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME

PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 61 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED

TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY

$140 MILLION.

AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE

THE PENSION OBLIGATION, THUS CHANGING THE FUNDED STATUS

OF A PLAN RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE TOTAL PENSION LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, FOR UNDERFUNDED PLANS WAS

APPROXIMATELY $4.0 BILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE

SENSITIVITY OF PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE DISCOUNT

RATE ASSUMPTION, A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE

DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S.

PENSION PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PLAN OBLIGATION BY

APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION, WHICH WOULD HAVE DECREASED

THE PLANS UNDERFUNDED STATUS FROM APPROXIMATELY $2.0

BILLION TO $1.8 BILLION. OTHER PLANS WOULD BE LESS

UNDER-FUNDED AS DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE. THE ACTUAL

RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES MAY

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLDS FINANCIAL

MARKETS.

IN 2008, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS

WERE $839 MILLION (INCLUDING $577 MILLION TO THE U.S.

PLANS). IN 2009, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS

WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION

AMOUNTS ARE

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2008

WAS $179 MILLION AND THE TOTAL LIABILITY, WHICH REFLECTED THE UNFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AT THE END OF

2008, WAS $2.9 BILLION.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO

THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2008, A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 67 PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE DECREASED OPEB

EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION. A 0.25 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE SAME PLAN, WHICH

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 86 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB

LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE DECREASED TOTAL OPEB

LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2008 BY APPROXIMATELY $56

MILLION.

FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE

ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS LIMITED TO

4 PERCENT PER YEAR. FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES

UNDER AGE 65 WHOSE CLAIMS EXPERIENCES ARE COMBINED FOR

RATING PURPOSES, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND

RATES START WITH 7 PERCENT IN 2009 AND GRADUALLY DROP

TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2017 AND BEYOND. AS AN INDICATION OF

THE HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE

DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2008, A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE RATES FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN,

WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 86 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB

LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE INCREASED OPEB EXPENSE $8

MILLION.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED

TO DETERMINE EXPENSE AND THE FUNDED STATUS OF EACH

PLAN AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN BENEFIT PLAN COSTS IN THE YEAR THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS.

INSTEAD, THE DIFFERENCES ARE INCLUDED IN ACTUARIAL

GAIN/LOSS AND UNAMORTIZED AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. REFER TO NOTE 22,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-51, FOR INFORMATION ON THE $6.0

BILLION OF BEFORE-TAX ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED BY

THE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008; A DESCRIPTION OF

THE METHOD USED TO AMORTIZE THOSE COSTS; AND AN

ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EXPENSE

DURING 2009.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY ASSESSES ITS

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT

BE RECOVERABLE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES

AND, FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED

PROVED-RESERVE

QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS

THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED FROM THE

ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS

OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET

IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN MATTERS, SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS ON

OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE

OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL MARKET SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND

CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY

CHEMICALS AND REFINED PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON

ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

NO MAJOR INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E WERE

RECORDED FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE

PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT

PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS

PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE

ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME

ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR ANY

ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS, WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE

CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN

NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS WELL AS

INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY

INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED

TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE AT THE TIME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH

FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE

INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS

ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A

PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY

ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE.

DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN

INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY

ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES WHETHER ANY

WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET

GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SIGNIFICANT

DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD OR CONCESSION,

AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO,

IF THE EXPECTATION

FS-20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP IN ANY PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE

ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS REQUIRED.

SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE

ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED OF. ASSETS THAT ARE

NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY

BECOME IMPAIRED IF A DECISION IS MADE TO SELL SUCH

ASSETS. THAT IS, THE ASSETS WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THEY

ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND THE ESTIMATED

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, LESS COSTS TO SELL, ARE LESS

THAN THE ASSETS ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  PURCHASE-PRICE ALLOCATION

ACCOUNTING

FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES THE

ALLOCATION OF THE COMPANYS PURCHASE PRICE TO THE

VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS

AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. THE COMPANY USES ALL

AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO MAKE THESE FAIR VALUE

DETERMINATIONS, AND FOR MAJOR ACQUISITIONS, MAY HIRE AN

INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL FIRM TO ASSIST IN MAKING FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES. IN SOME INSTANCES, ASSUMPTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE REVENUES AND

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH AN ASSET MIGHT HAVE TO BE USED

IN DETERMINING ITS FAIR VALUE. ACTUAL TIMING AND AMOUNT

OF NET CASH FLOWS FROM REVENUES AND EXPENSES RELATED

TO THAT ASSET OVER TIME MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

THOSE INITIAL ESTIMATES, AND IF THE TIMING IS DELAYED

SIGNIFICANTLY OR IF THE NET CASH FLOWS DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY, THE ASSET COULD BECOME IMPAIRED. EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2009, THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS WILL CHANGE. REFER TO NOTE 19 ON PAGE

FS-48.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL

RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS

COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED

BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT

THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL

BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS

AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS,

LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION.

ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY FROM ESTIMATES FOR A

VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM

SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM

ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS,

OPINIONS ON CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT

OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION, THE

DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT

AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS

GENERALLY RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES IF

MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND

ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECORDS THESE LOSSES

AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS HANDLING IS FOR INCOME

TAX MATTERS, FOR WHICH BEN-

EFITS ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY

IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE TAX POSITION IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50

PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION. FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES,

REFER TO NOTE 16 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-45. REFER ALSO TO

THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS

SECTION FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM LOSSES

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2008.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR

THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN

RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE

OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT MUST BE ASSESSED,

THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE

RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS

OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH

LOSS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FASB STATEMENT NO. 141 (REVISED 2007), BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS (FAS 141-R)

IN

DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB

ISSUED FAS 141-R, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS HAVING AN ACQUISITION DATE ON

OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES THE

ACQUIRING ENTITY IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO RECOGNIZE

THE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AND ANY

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AT THE

ACQUISITION DATE TO BE MEASURED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE

FAIR VALUES. IT ALSO REQUIRES ACQUISITION-RELATED

COSTS, AS WELL AS RESTRUCTURING COSTS THE ACQUIRER

EXPECTS TO INCUR FOR WHICH IT IS NOT OBLIGATED AT

ACQUISITION DATE, TO BE RECORDED AGAINST INCOME RATHER

THAN INCLUDED IN PURCHASE-PRICE DETERMINATION. FINALLY,

THE STANDARD REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF CONTINGENT

ARRANGEMENTS AT THEIR ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUES,

WITH SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE GENERALLY REFLECTED IN INCOME.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE FASB APPROVED

FOR ISSUANCE FSP FAS 141(R)-A, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS HAVING AN ACQUISITION DATE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1,

2009. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES AN ASSET OR LIABILITY ARISING FROM A

CONTINGENCY IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE

IF FAIR VALUE CAN BE REASONABLY DETERMINED. IF IT CANNOT BE

REASONABLY DETERMINED THEN THE ASSET OR LIABILITY WILL NEED TO BE

THE

FASB ISSUED FAS 160 IN

DECEMBER 2007, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY

JANUARY 1, 2009, WITH RETROACTIVE ADOPTION OF THE

STANDARDS PRESENTATION AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING MINORITY

IN SUBSIDIARIES HELD BY PARTIES OTHER THAN THE PARENT

TO BE PRESENTED WITHIN THE

FS-21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EQUITY SECTION OF THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET BUT SEPARATE FROM THE

PARENTS EQUITY. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE AMOUNT OF

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PARENT AND

THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST TO BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED

AND PRESENTED ON THE FACE OF THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME. CERTAIN CHANGES IN A PARENTS

OWNERSHIP INTEREST ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY

TRANSACTIONS AND WHEN A SUBSIDIARY IS DECONSOLIDATED,

ANY NONCONTROLLING EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE FORMER

SUBSIDIARY IS TO BE INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 160 WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY

CHANGE THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME OR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 161, DISCLOSURES ABOUT

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (FAS 161)

IN

MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 161, WHICH BECAME

EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2009. THIS

STANDARD AMENDS AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

FAS 161 REQUIRES

DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR

USING DERIVATIVES; THE FAIR-VALUE AMOUNTS OF, AND GAINS

AND LOSSES ON, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS; AND

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES IN DERIVATIVE

AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURES FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS WILL

BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A TABULAR

REPRESENTATION OF THE LOCATION AND FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS

OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ON THE BALANCE SHEET, FAIR

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED

FSP FAS 132(R)-1, WHICH BECOMES EFFECTIVE WITH THE

COMPANYS REPORTING AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THIS STANDARD

AMENDS AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON THE

PLAN ASSETS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS TO PROVIDE USERS OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF: HOW INVESTMENT

ALLOCATION DECISIONS ARE MADE; THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF

PLAN ASSETS; THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED

TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS; THE EFFECT OF

FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS ON CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PERIOD; AND

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT PREFUND ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLAN OBLIGATIONS, AND THE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

DISCLOSURES FOR ITS PENSION PLAN ASSETS AS A RESULT OF

THE ADOPTION OF FSP FAS 132(R)-1 WILL DEPEND ON THE

COMPANYS PLAN ASSETS AT THAT TIME.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME,

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007

AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR

OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN CONFORMITY

WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION,

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX

APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN

READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE,

FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, AND ON THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR

INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE

THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE

OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING

THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS

EXISTS, AND

TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND

OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE

ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH

OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS ON APRIL 1, 2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS ON

JANUARY 1, 2007.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES

THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL,

ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND MARKETING NATURAL GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR.

CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR

INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES SUBJECT THE

COMPANY TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT

IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS

ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH

THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURES AND

CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO

AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO

50 PERCENT OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY

DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY

CURRENTLY IN INCOME.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND

THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A

DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF

THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD

THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE

NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN

FAIR VALUE.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING

EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE

DIFFERENCE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED

TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY,

GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT

TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN

CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS COMMODITY TRADING ACTIVITY AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES, GAINS

AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. INTEREST RATE SWAPS 

HEDGING A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT  ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES,

WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN

INCOME. WHERE CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, FAIR VALUE RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE

AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE OFFSET ON THE

BALANCE SHEET.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE IN

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND IS

MARKED-TO-MARKET, WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST, USING A

LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET. MATERIALS,

SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED

PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED

PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE CAPITALIZED FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT HAVE

FOUND CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED WHEN

THE DRILLING IS COMPLETED, PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF

RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. ALL OTHER

EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE 20, BEGINNING

ON PAGE FS-48, FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES,

ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR

A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN

INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION,

DEVELOPMENT AREA OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN THE REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND

CHEMICAL AREAS, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE GENERALLY DONE ON THE BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A

MARKETING AREA OR MARKETING ASSETS BY COUNTRY. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE

EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE

LOWER VALUE.

AS REQUIRED UNDER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING

FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143), THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS RECORDED AS

AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A

LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A

LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 24, BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-58, RELATING TO AROS.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD GENERALLY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD, AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING

THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED.

PERIODIC VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE

EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR MINING ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD AS THE PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE

DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO

AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES AND FROM SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE (INCLUDING

THOSE FOR PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS), REPAIRS AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN

OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE

CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED

BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT

THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT

OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING

UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS OR TO

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR

CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR

CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND

CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE

REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES

UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY FOR

ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE

COSTS AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR OTHER POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE REGULATORY

AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY

THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS

BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE COSTS

USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING

CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE COMPANYS OWN INTERNAL

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT

DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECORDED

AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO

MARKET RISKS RELATED TO PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL,

REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS,

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF ITS

ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND STORAGE OF

CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY REFINERIES. FROM

TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING

PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY USES INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND

DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS TO GOVERN DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY

ALSO BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE

THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION WITH THE

SAME COUNTERPARTY AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE

NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET

MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE NETTING OF THE

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY

AND IS A REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT

RISK EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO USES OTHER NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT

CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS TO MITIGATE CREDIT

RISK.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ARE REPORTED AS EITHER SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES OR PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS,

WHEREAS TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS OTHER

INCOME.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180 DAYS OR

LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES.

THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED

PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED

TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE

SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN

INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS

AND LOSSES REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE

SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY

TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE

INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED

TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE

REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH

RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT

YEAR-END 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST-RATE SWAPS

ON FLOATING-RATE DEBT.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED FROM QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, OTHER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES OR, IF NOT

AVAILABLE, THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE

BEEN RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SETTLED

AT YEAR-END.

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $1,221 AND $2,132 HAD ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES OF $1,414 AND $2,354 AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE

SECURITIES IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. PORTFOLIOS. THE

INSTRUMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY TIME DEPOSITS, MONEY

MARKET FUNDS AND FIXED RATE BONDS. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD CARRYING/FAIR VALUES OF

$7,271 AND $5,427 AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE BALANCES, $7,058 AND $4,695 AT

THE RESPECTIVE YEAR-ENDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS THAT HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES UNDER 90 DAYS. THE REMAINDER, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE

SECURITIES, HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY ONE

YEAR. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

RESTRICTED CASH WITH A

CARRYING/FAIR VALUE OF $367 THAT IS RELATED TO

CAPITAL-INVESTMENT PROJECTS AT THE COMPANYS

PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI REFINERY AND ANGOLA LIQUEFIED

NATURAL GAS PROJECT WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS TO DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER

ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THIS

RESTRICTED CASH WAS INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE

SECURITIES.

FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AT THE END OF 2008 AND 2007 WERE NOT

MATERIAL.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS,

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED

INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO

CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.

SIMILAR STANDARDS OF DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE

APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE DISPERSED

AMONG THE COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A

CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES

THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE

FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED

SUFFICIENT, REQUIRING LETTERS OF CREDIT IS A PRINCIPAL

METHOD USED TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 8

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED FASB STATEMENT NO. 157,

FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(FAS 157), AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008.

FAS 157 WAS AMENDED IN FEBRUARY 2008 BY FASB STAFF

POSITION (FSP) FAS NO. 157-1,

APPLICATION OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 157 TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 13 AND ITS

RELATED INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT

ADDRESS LEASING TRANSACTIONS,

AND BY FSP FAS 157-2,

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157,

WHICH DELAYED

THE COMPANYS APPLICATION OF FAS 157 FOR NONRECURRING

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES UNTIL JANUARY 1,

2009. FAS 157 WAS FURTHER AMENDED IN OCTOBER 2008 BY

FSP FAS 157-3,

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT

ACTIVE,

WHICH CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF FAS 157 TO

ASSETS PARTICIPATING IN INACTIVE MARKETS.

IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 157 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND HAD NO EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS EXISTING FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENT

PRACTICES. HOWEVER, FAS 157 REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF A

FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE

NOTE

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS - CONTINUED

COMPANY USES TO VALUE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY. THE

THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED

AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1: QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE

MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR

THE COMPANY, LEVEL 1 INPUTS INCLUDE

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR WHICH THE

PARTIES ARE WILLING TO TRANSACT AT THE

EXCHANGE-QUOTED PRICE AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

THAT ARE ACTIVELY TRADED.

LEVEL 2: INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE

OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. FOR THE

COMPANY, LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR

SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, PRICES OBTAINED

THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES, AND PRICES THAT

CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS

FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE COMPLETE TERM OF A CONTRACT.

LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT USE LEVEL 3 INPUTS FOR ANY OF ITS RECURRING

FAIR-VALUE MEASUREMENTS. BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2009, LEVEL 3 INPUTS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH

CERTAIN NONRECURRING MEASUREMENTS OF

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE FAIR-VALUE HIERARCHY FOR ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE COMPANY CALCULATES FAIR

VALUE FOR ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS  OTHER THAN ANY COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND

NORMAL SALE  ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT

FAIR VALUE, WITH VIRTUALLY ALL THE OFFSETTING AMOUNT

TO INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR

PROVISIONS AS CONTRACTS THAT ARE PUBLICLY TRADED ON A

REGULAR BASIS, THE COMPANY USES THE MARKET VALUES OF

THE PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS AS AN INPUT FOR

FAIR-VALUE CALCULATIONS.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PRINCIPALLY

INCLUDE CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED-PRODUCT

FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS, AS WELL

AS INTEREST-RATE SWAPS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS. DERIVATIVES

CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 INCLUDE

FUTURES, SWAPS AND OPTIONS CONTRACTS TRADED IN ACTIVE

MARKETS SUCH AS THE NYMEX (NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE).

DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INCLUDE

SWAPS (INCLUDING INTEREST RATE), OPTIONS, AND FORWARD

(INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY) CONTRACTS PRINCIPALLY

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS

COMPANIES, THE FAIR VALUES FOR WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM

THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES, INDUSTRY PRICING SERVICES

AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY OBTAINS MULTIPLE SOURCES OF

PRICING INFORMATION FOR THE LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS. SINCE

THIS PRICING INFORMATION IS GENERATED FROM OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA, IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY CONSISTENT.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT MATERIALLY ADJUST THIS

INFORMATION. THE COMPANY INCORPORATES INTERNAL REVIEW,

EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES, INCLUDING A

COMPARISON OF LEVEL 2 FAIR VALUES DERIVED FROM THE

COMPANYS INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORWARD CURVES (ON A

SAMPLE BASIS) WITH THE PRICING INFORMATION TO DOCUMENT

REASONABLE, LOGICAL AND SUPPORTABLE FAIR-VALUE

DETERMINATIONS AND PROPER LEVEL OF CLASSIFICATION.

NOTE 9

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ALTHOUGH EACH SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

THE SEGMENTS ARE SEPARATELY MANAGED FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES UNDER A STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES SEGMENT

MANAGERS WHO REPORT TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING

DECISION MAKER (CODM) (TERMS AS DEFINED IN FAS 131).

THE CODM IS THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, A

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

THE OPERATING SEGMENTS REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE

COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN FAS 131 TERMS THAT ENGAGE IN

ACTIVITIES (A) FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND

EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE

REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM, WHICH MAKES DECISIONS

ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS AND TO

ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE

FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT MANAGERS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE

ACCOUNTABLE DIRECTLY TO AND MAINTAIN REGULAR CONTACT

DESCRIPTIONS OF MAJOR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND ITS

UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE

AFFILIATES, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

TENGIZCHEVROIL

CHEVRON HAS A 50 PERCENT EQUITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO), A JOINT

VENTURE FORMED IN 1993 TO DEVELOP THE TENGIZ AND

KOROLEV CRUDE OIL FIELDS IN KAZAKHSTAN OVER A

40-YEAR PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN TCO WAS ABOUT

$210 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

TCO NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE RESULTS FROM

CHEVRON ACQUIRING A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN TCO

AT A VALUE GREATER THAN THE UNDERLYING EQUITY FOR

THAT PORTION OF TCOS ASSETS.

PETROPIAR

CHEVRON HAS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST IN

PETROPIAR, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2008 TO

OPERATE THE HAMACA HEAVY OIL PRODUCTION AND UPGRADING

PROJECT. THE PROJECT, LOCATED IN VENEZUELAS ORINOCO

BELT, HAS A 25-YEAR CONTRACT TERM. PRIOR TO THE

FORMATION OF PETROPIAR, CHEVRON HAD A 30 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE HAMACA PROJECT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN

PETROPIAR WAS APPROXIMATELY $250 LESS THAN THE AMOUNT

OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROPIAR NET ASSETS. THE

DIFFERENCE REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF CHEVRONS

UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROPIARS NET ASSETS OVER THE

NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE

VENTURE.

PETROBOSCAN

CHEVRON HAS A 39 PERCENT INTEREST IN

PETROBOSCAN, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2006 TO

OPERATE THE BOSCAN FIELD IN VENEZUELA UNTIL 2026.

CHEVRON PREVIOUSLY OPERATED THE FIELD UNDER AN

OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN

PETROBOSCAN WAS APPROXIMATELY $290 HIGHER THAN THE

AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCAN NET ASSETS.

THE DIFFERENCE REFLECTS THE EXCESS OF THE NET BOOK

VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY CHEVRON OVER ITS

UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCANS NET ASSETS.

ANGOLA LNG LTD.

CHEVRON HAS A 36 PERCENT INTEREST IN

ANGOLA LNG LTD., WHICH WILL PROCESS AND LIQUEFY NATURAL

INTEREST IN THE CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM, WHICH

PROVIDES THE CRITICAL EXPORT ROUTE FOR CRUDE OIL FROM

BOTH TCO AND KARACHAGANAK.

STAR PETROLEUM REFINING COMPANY LTD.

ESCRAVOS GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

CHEVRON NIGERIA LIMITED (CNL)

HAS A 75 PERCENT INTEREST IN ESCRAVOS GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

(EGTL) WITH THE OTHER 25 PERCENT OF THE JOINT VENTURE

OWNED BY NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANY. UNTIL

DECEMBER 1, 2008, SASOL LTD. PROVIDED 50 PERCENT OF

CNLS FUNDING REQUIRE-

MENTS FOR THE VENTURE AS

RISK-BASED FINANCING (RETURNS ARE BASED ON PROJECT

PERFORMANCE). EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008, CHEVRON

ACQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL 37 PERCENT OF THE OBLIGATION

FROM SASOL, WITH SASOL RETAINING 13 PERCENT OF THE

FUNDING OBLIGATION. ON THAT DATE, CHEVRON CHANGED ITS

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR ITS EGTL INVESTMENT FROM EQUITY TO

CONSOLIDATED. THIS VENTURE WAS FORMED TO CONVERT

NATURAL GAS PRODUCED FROM CHEVRONS NIGERIAN

OPERATIONS INTO LIQUID PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

CALTEX AUSTRALIA LTD.

CHEVRON HAS A 50 PERCENT EQUITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN CALTEX AUSTRALIA LTD. (CAL). THE

REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF CAL IS PUBLICLY OWNED. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF CHEVRONS SHARE OF

VALUE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF $723

MILLION AT THE END OF 2008 WAS DEEMED TEMPORARY.

CHEVRON OWNS AN APPROXIMATE

23 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE

COMPANY. THE COLONIAL PIPELINE SYSTEM RUNS FROM TEXAS

TO NEW JERSEY AND TRANSPORTS PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IN A

CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN COLONIAL PIPELINE

WAS APPROXIMATELY $560 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF

UNDERLYING EQUITY IN COLONIAL PIPELINE NET ASSETS. THIS

DIFFERENCE PRIMARILY RELATES TO PURCHASE PRICE

ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL CORPORATION.

CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC

CHEVRON OWNS

50 PERCENT OF CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC

(CPCHEM), WITH THE OTHER HALF OWNED BY

CONOCOPHILLIPS CORPORATION.

LITIGATION

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM

INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL ETHER (MTBE)

AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. IN OCTOBER 2008, 59 CASES WERE

SETTLED IN WHICH THE COMPANY WAS A PARTY AND WHICH

RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED

GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGE OF MTBE INTO

GROUNDWATER. THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE

CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO 37 OTHER PENDING

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE

NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS.

RESOLUTION OF THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY

ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR

AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT

OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER

PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO

THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS,

MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE SETTLEMENT OF THE

59 LAWSUITS DID NOT SET ANY PRECEDENTS RELATED TO

STANDARDS OF LIABILITY TO BE USED TO JUDGE THE

MERITS OF THE CLAIMS, CORRECTIVE MEASURES REQUIRED

OR MONETARY DAMAGES TO BE ASSESSED FOR THE

REMAINING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS OR FUTURE LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE

EXPOSURE RELATED TO PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS

NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL

TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO

LONGER USES MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN

THE UNITED STATES.

RFG PATENT

FOURTEEN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE

BROUGHT BY CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED REFORMULATED

GASOLINE (RFG) FROM JANUARY 1995 THROUGH AUGUST 2005,

ALLEGING THAT UNOCAL MISLED THE CALIFORNIA AIR

RESOURCES BOARD INTO ADOPTING STANDARDS FOR COMPOSITION

OF RFG THAT OVERLAPPED WITH UNOCALS UNDISCLOSED AND

PENDING PATENTS. THE PARTIES AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT

THAT CALLS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNOCAL TO PAY $48

AND FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A

CY PRES

FUND TO

ADMINISTER PAYOUT OF THE AWARD. THE COURT APPROVED THE

FINAL SETTLEMENT IN NOVEMBER 2008.

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT

BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO,

ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM

TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF AN AREA

WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD

OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE

ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

OPERATIONS, AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE

ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING

PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY

(TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO INC., WAS A MINORITY

MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE

ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED

OIL COMPANY, AS THE MAJORITY

PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT

THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN

INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE

CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL

AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND

PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES

ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO TEXPETS

OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT

AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION

PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE

SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED

TEXPET AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL

RELEASE FROM ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY

ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON

BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR FACTUAL

MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER

CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH

PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999,

CANNOT BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY TO CHEVRON; THIRD,

THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS IN ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE

LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM

LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR. WITH REGARD

TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS

PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE REMAINING

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS

FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND

PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL

CONTROL OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY

THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED

TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING THAT

THE COURT ASSESS $8,000, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO

THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR

PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH

CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER ITEMS,

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS,

AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PETROECUADOR.

THE ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN

ADDITIONAL $8,300 COULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST

CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. THE ENGINEERS

REPORT IS NOT BINDING ON THE COURT. CHEVRON ALSO

BELIEVES THAT THE ENGINEERS WORK WAS PERFORMED

AND HIS REPORT PREPARED IN A MANNER CONTRARY TO

LAW AND IN VIOLATION OF THE COURTS ORDERS.

CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REPORT IN

WHICH IT ASKED THE COURT TO STRIKE THE REPORT IN

ITS ENTIRETY. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE ENGINEER

REVISED THE REPORT AND, WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

EVIDENCE, RECOMMENDED AN INCREASE IN THE FINANCIAL

COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES TO A TOTAL OF

$18,900 AND AN INCREASE IN THE ASSESSMENT FOR

PURPORTED UNJUST ENRICHMENT TO A

LITIGATION - CONTINUED

TOTAL OF $8,400.

CHEVRON SUBMITTED A REBUTTAL TO THE REVISED

REPORT, AND CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS

DEFENSE OF ANY ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN

ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE

OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE

DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENGINEERS REPORT,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE REPORT ITSELF HAS

ANY UTILITY IN CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE

LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS). MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE

PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE A

REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM

41.9 PERCENT IN 2007 TO 44.3 PERCENT IN 2008. THE

INCREASE IN THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAXES FROM

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AT RATES DIFFERENT FROM THE

U.S. STATUTORY RATE FROM 8.3 PERCENT IN 2007 TO 10.2

PERCENT IN 2008 WAS MAINLY DUE TO A GREATER PROPORTION

OF INCOME BEING EARNED IN 2008 IN TAX JURISDICTIONS

WITH HIGHER TAX RATES. IN ADDITION, THE 2007 PERIOD

INCLUDED A RELATIVELY LOW TAX RATE ON THE SALE OF

DOWNSTREAM ASSETS IN EUROPE. THE CHANGE IN OTHER FROM

A NEGATIVE 1.8 PERCENT TO A NEGATIVE 0.7 PERCENT

PRIMARILY RELATED TO A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON THE

SALE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

IN 2007.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS DEFERRED TAXES ON A

TAX-JURISDICTION BASIS AND CLASSIFIES THOSE NET AMOUNTS AS

CURRENT OR NONCURRENT BASED ON THE BALANCE SHEET

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2008

INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1,300 FROM YEAR-END 2007.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASED

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

$5,300 IN 2008. THE INCREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO

DEFERRED CREDITS RECORDED FOR FUTURE TAX BENEFITS

EARNED FROM A NEW FIELD IN AFRICA ($2,200); INCREASED

DEFERRED TAX BENEFITS FOR PENSION-RELATED OBLIGATIONS

($1,300); AND ADDITIONAL FOREIGN TAX CREDITS ARISING

FROM EARNINGS IN HIGH-TAX-RATE INTERNATIONAL

JURISDICTIONS ($1,600), WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIALLY

OFFSET BY VALUATION ALLOWANCES.

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO

FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, TAX LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS AND TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR WHICH NO

BENEFIT IS EXPECTED TO

BE REALIZED. TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS EXIST IN

MANY INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. WHEREAS SOME OF

THESE TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS DO NOT HAVE AN

UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

(FIN 48),

PROVIDES THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR INCOME TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE UNCERTAIN IN NATURE. UNDER FIN 48, A

COMPANY RECOGNIZES A TAX BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POSITION IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50

PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION BASED

SOLELY ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE

TERM TAX POSITION IN FIN 48 REFERS TO A POSITION IN

A PREVIOUSLY FILED TAX RETURN OR A POSITION EXPECTED

TO BE TAKEN IN A FUTURE TAX RETURN THAT IS REFLECTED

IN MEASURING CURRENT OR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIODS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE INDICATES THE CHANGES TO THE

COMPANYS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE TERM UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS IN FIN 48 REFERS TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX

RETURN AND THE BENEFIT MEASURED AND RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES

OF FIN 48. INTEREST AND PENALTIES ARE NOT INCLUDED.

ALTHOUGH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUAL

TAX POSITIONS MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE DURING 2009, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NO CHANGE WILL BE INDIVIDUALLY

SIGNIFICANT DURING 2009. APPROXIMATELY 85 PERCENT OF

THE $2,696 OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT DECEMBER

31, 2008, WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE IF SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED.

TAX POSITIONS FOR

CHEVRON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE

SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX AUDITS BY MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX

JURISDICTIONS, EXAMINATIONS OF TAX RETURNS FOR CERTAIN

PRIOR TAX YEARS HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2008. FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE LATEST YEARS FOR

WHICH INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS HAD BEEN FINALIZED WERE

AS FOLLOWS: UNITED STATES  2003, NIGERIA  1994,

ANGOLA  2001 AND SAUDI ARABIA  2003.

ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THE COMPANY REPORTS

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO LIABILITIES FOR

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, ACCRUALS OF $276 FOR ANTICIPATED

INTEREST AND PENALTY OBLIGATIONS WERE INCLUDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, COMPARED WITH ACCRUALS OF

$198 AS OF YEAR-END 2007. INCOME TAX EXPENSE ASSOCIATED

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-36, FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

COMPANYS DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD $4,950 OF

COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH BANKS WORLDWIDE,

WHICH PERMIT

THE COMPANY TO REFINANCE SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS

ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE FACILITIES SUPPORT THE

COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. INTEREST ON

BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERMS OF SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS MAY

BE BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR BANK

PRIME RATE. NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE

CREDIT AGREEMENTS DURING 2008 OR AT YEAR-END.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY

CLASSIFIED $4,950 AND $4,382, RESPECTIVELY, OF

SHORT-TERM DEBT AS LONG-TERM. SETTLEMENT OF THESE

OBLIGATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF

WORKING CAPITAL IN 2009, AS THE COMPANY HAS BOTH THE

CHEVRON LONG-TERM

INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)

AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND NONSTOCK GRANTS. FROM APRIL 2004 THROUGH JANUARY 2014, NO MORE THAN 160

MILLION SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP, AND NO MORE THAN 64 MILLION OF THOSE SHARES MAY BE IN

A FORM OTHER THAN A STOCK OPTION, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT OR AWARD REQUIRING FULL PAYMENT FOR

SHARES BY THE AWARD RECIPIENT.

TEXACO STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (TEXACO SIP)

ON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF TEXACO IN OCTOBER

2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRON OPTIONS. THESE

OPTIONS, WHICH HAVE 10-YEAR CONTRACTUAL LIVES EXTENDING INTO 2011, RETAINED A PROVISION FOR BEING

RESTORED. THIS PROVISION ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISES A STOCK OPTION TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS

EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WHO HAS SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING

OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE

RESTORED OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE

IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED OPTION IS GRANTED. BEGINNING IN

2007, RESTORED OPTIONS WERE GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP. NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE

FORMER TEXACO PLANS.

UNOCAL SHARE-BASED PLANS (UNOCAL PLANS)

WHEN CHEVRON ACQUIRED UNOCAL IN AUGUST 2005, OUTSTANDING

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS UNOCAL PLANS WERE EXCHANGED FOR

FULLY VESTED CHEVRON OPTIONS AND APPRECIATION RIGHTS. THESE AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME PROVISIONS AS

THE ORIGINAL UNOCAL PLANS. IF NOT EXERCISED, THESE AWARDS WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN EARLY 2009 AND EARLY

2015.

THE FAIR MARKET VALUES OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED IN 2008, 2007

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION - CONTINUED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THERE WAS $179 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED BEFORE-TAX COMPENSATION COST

RELATED TO NONVESTED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS GRANTED OR RESTORED UNDER THE PLANS.

THAT COST IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.9 YEARS.

AT JANUARY 1, 2008, THE NUMBER OF LTIP PERFORMANCE UNITS OUTSTANDING WAS EQUIVALENT TO

2,225,015 SHARES. DURING 2008, 888,300 UNITS WERE GRANTED, 652,897 UNITS VESTED WITH CASH PROCEEDS

DISTRIBUTED TO RECIPIENTS AND 59,863 UNITS WERE FORFEITED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, UNITS OUTSTANDING

WERE 2,400,555, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS $201. IN

ADDITION, OUTSTANDING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS

LTIP AND FORMER TEXACO AND UNOCAL PROGRAMS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 1.4 MILLION EQUIVALENT SHARES AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. A LIABILITY OF $35 WAS RECORDED FOR THESE AWARDS.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN ADDITION TO THE PLANS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON GRANTED ALL

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTIONS OR EQUIVALENTS IN 1998. THE OPTIONS VESTED IN FEBRUARY 2000 AND

EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2008. A TOTAL OF 9,641,600 OPTIONS WERE AWARDED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$38.16 PER SHARE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS ESTIMATED AT $9.54 USING

THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL FOR THE PRECEDING 10 YEARS. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MODEL, BASED ON A

10-YEAR AVERAGE, WERE: A RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 7 PERCENT, A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 4.2 PERCENT, AN

EXPECTED LIFE OF SEVEN YEARS AND A VOLATILITY OF 24.7 PERCENT.

AT JANUARY 1, 2008, THE NUMBER OF BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING WAS 652,715.

THROUGH THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROGRAM IN FEBRUARY 2008, 396,875 SHARES WERE EXERCISED AND 255,840

SHARES WERE FORFEITED. THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2008, 2007 AND

2006 WAS $18, $30, AND $10, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 22

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY PREFUNDS

DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS AS REQUIRED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS OR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE PREFUNDING

PROVIDES ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL QUALIFIED PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

TYPICALLY FUND U.S. NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER

LAWS AND REGULATIONS BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS ECONOMIC AND

INVESTMENT RETURNS MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT (OPEB) PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL

BENEFITS, AS WELL AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS

ARE UNFUNDED, AND THE COMPANY AND RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE

RETIREES IN THE COMPANYS MAIN U.S. MEDICAL PLAN IS SECONDARY TO MEDICARE (INCLUDING PART D), AND

THE INCREASE TO THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 4

PERCENT PER YEAR. CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF

FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

, WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR

UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF EACH OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY, WITH

THE OFFSET TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS FOR 2008 AND 2007 IS ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

COMPANYS U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB

PLANS ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

APPROXIMATELY 10, 13 AND 10 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE

AMORTIZATION PERIODS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE

REMAINING SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE

BENEFITS UNDER THE PLANS. THESE LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED TO

THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE HIGHER OF THE

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF

PLAN ASSETS. THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION IS

DETERMINED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS. DURING 2009, THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $298, $103 AND

$28 WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES AN ADDITIONAL $201

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR

RECOGNIZING PRIOR SERVICE COSTS (CREDITS) RECORDED IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, WAS APPROXIMATELY NINE AND 13 YEARS FOR U.S. AND

THE 2006 U.S. DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS REMEASUREMENT ON JULY 1, 2006, DUE TO PLAN

COMBINATIONS AND CHANGES, PRIMARILY SEVERAL UNOCAL PLANS INTO RELATED CHEVRON PLANS.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS IS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN

ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM

EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND THE INCORPORATION OF

SPECIFIC ASSET-CLASS RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS

ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN

ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED

LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE

STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002 FOR

U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 68 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION

PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8 PERCENT.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR

U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION

EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE THREE

MONTHS PRECEDING THE YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE, AS

OPPOSED TO THE

MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S.

ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH

TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF

DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL

BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER

PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN

CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE

REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON HIGH-QUALITY,

FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE COMPANY SELECTED A 6.3 PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR

THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THIS

RATE WAS BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED

ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE CITIGROUP

PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END 2008. THE

DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF 2007 AND 2006 WERE 6.3

PERCENT AND 5.8 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF

ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL PLAN, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES

START WITH 7 PERCENT IN 2009 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 5

PERCENT FOR 2017 AND BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND

RATES STARTED WITH 8 PERCENT IN 2008 AND GRADUALLY

DECLINED TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2014 AND BEYOND. IN BOTH

MEASUREMENTS, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS WAS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES CAN HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR RETIREE

HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE IMPACT IS MITIGATED BY THE 4

PERCENT CAP ON THE COMPANYS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR

THE PRIMARY U.S. PLAN. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE

IN THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES WOULD HAVE

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - CONTINUED

THE PENSION PLANS INVEST PRIMARILY IN ASSET

CATEGORIES WITH SUFFICIENT SIZE, LIQUIDITY AND COST

EFFICIENCY TO PERMIT INVESTMENTS OF REASONABLE SIZE.

THE PENSION PLANS INVEST IN ASSET CATEGORIES THAT

PROVIDE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS AND ARE EASILY

MEASURED. TO ASSESS THE PLANS INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE,

LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN

ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE CHEVRON

BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE FOLLOWING

PERCENTAGE ASSET-ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES 4070,

FIXED INCOME/CASH 2060, REAL ESTATE 015 AND OTHER

05. THE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ALSO

HAVE ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM ASSET ALLOCATION

RANGES THAT VARY BY EACH PLAN. ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION,

WITHIN APPROVED RANGES, IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF

CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND

CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET CATEGORY RISK.

EQUITIES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNT OF $22 AND $36 AT DECEMBER

31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE OTHER ASSET

CATEGORY INCLUDES MINIMAL INVESTMENTS IN

PRIVATE-EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

IN 2008, THE

COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $577 AND $262 TO ITS U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2009, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $550

AND $250 TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS,

RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT

UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC

FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET

INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PAYING OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $209 IN

2009, AS COMPARED WITH $188 PAID IN 2008.

THE FOLLOWING BENEFIT PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE

ESTIMATED FUTURE SERVICE, ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES OF CHEVRON AND CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP).

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE

COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE FUNDED

EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE RELEASE OF COMMON

STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLAN (LESOP), WHICH FOLLOWS. TOTAL COMPANY MATCHING

CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE ESIP WERE

$231, $206 AND $169 IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF

SHARES RELEASED FROM THE LESOP TOTALING $40, $33 AND $6

IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING

AMOUNTS, TOTALING $191, $173 AND $163 IN 2008, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENT OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRON ESIP

IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). IN 1989,

CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LESOP AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF

THE ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES PARTIAL PREFUNDING OF

THE COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

AS PERMITTED BY AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLANS

, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO CONTINUE ITS

PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON AICPA STATEMENT OF

POSITION 76-3,

ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

, AND SUBSEQUENT

CONSENSUS OF THE EITF OF THE FASB. THE DEBT OF THE

LESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS

COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFIT PLAN TRUST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

AND THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO

LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS DIVIDENDS RECEIVED

AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE. INTEREST

ACCRUED ON LESOP DEBT IS RECORDED AS INTEREST EXPENSE.

DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A

REDUCTION OF RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL LESOP SHARES ARE

CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE

COMPUTATIONS.

A NET CREDIT TO EXPENSE OF $1 WAS RECORDED FOR

THE LESOP EACH YEAR IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006. THE NET

CREDIT FOR THE RESPECTIVE YEARS WAS COMPOSED OF

CREDITS TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $15, $17 AND $18

AND CHARGES TO INTEREST EXPENSE FOR LESOP DEBT OF

$14, $16 AND $17.

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES, $35,

$8 AND $59 WERE USED IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. THE AMOUNT IN

2006 INCLUDED $28

OF LESOP DEBT SERVICE THAT WAS SCHEDULED FOR

PAYMENT ON THE FIRST BUSINESS DAY OF JANUARY 2007 AND

WAS PAID IN LATE DECEMBER 2006. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE

REQUIRED IN 2008, 2007 OR 2006 AS DIVIDENDS RECEIVED

BY THE LESOP WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT

SERVICE.

BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY

CHEVRON, TEXACO ESTABLISHED A BENEFIT PLAN TRUST FOR

FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS. AT

YEAR-END 2008, THE TRUST CONTAINED 14.2 MILLION SHARES

OF CHEVRON TREASURY STOCK. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE

SHARES OR USE THE DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY

BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT

PAY SUCH BENEFITS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO

PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS. THE

TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS

INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUSTS BENEFICIARIES. THE SHARES

HELD IN THE TRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR

EARNINGS-PER-SHARE PURPOSES UNTIL DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD

BY THE TRUST IN PAYMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, UNOCAL

ESTABLISHED VARIOUS GRANTOR TRUSTS TO FUND OBLIGATIONS

UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS, INCLUDING THE

DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT

PLANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, TRUST ASSETS OF

$60 AND $69, RESPECTIVELY, WERE INVESTED PRIMARILY IN

INTEREST-EARNING ACCOUNTS.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2008, THE

COMPANY ESTABLISHED THE CHEVRON INCENTIVE PLAN (CIP), A

SINGLE ANNUAL CASH BONUS PLAN FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES

THAT LINKS AWARDS TO CORPORATE, UNIT AND INDIVIDUAL

PERFORMANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS PLAN REPLACED OTHER

CASH BONUS PROGRAMS, WHICH PRIMARILY INCLUDED THE

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN (MIP) AND THE CHEVRON SUCCESS

SHARING PROGRAM. IN 2008, CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR CASH

BONUSES WERE $757. CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR MIP WERE $184

AND $180 IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. CHARGES FOR

OTHER CASH BONUS PROGRAMS WERE $431 AND $329 IN 2007

AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. CHEVRON ALSO HAS A LONG-TERM

INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) FOR OFFICERS AND OTHER REGULAR

SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY.

AWARDS UNDER LTIP CONSIST OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX

EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE LIABILITIES

GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED

WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL

YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL

PERIOD FOR WHICH

INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED. REFER TO NOTE 16

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-45 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS

FOR WHICH TAX RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE

COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR

ALL TAX JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN

IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT SETTLEMENT

OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY.

GUARANTEES

THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED A GUARANTEE OF

APPROXIMATELY $600 ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PAYMENTS

UNDER A TERMINAL USE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY A

COMPANY AFFILIATE. THE TERMINAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

OPERATIONAL BY 2012. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM

OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE AMOUNT WILL

REDUCE OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE

AFFILIATE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS CROSS-INDEMNITY

AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO

PERMIT RECOVERY OF ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE

GUARANTEE. CHEVRON CARRIES NO LIABILITY FOR ITS

OBLIGATION UNDER THIS GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN

INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION

WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS

IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

PERFORM IF THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL

LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300. THROUGH

THE END OF 2008, THE COMPANY PAID $48 UNDER THESE

INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE

ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES

RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO

TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE

FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE ENVIRONMENTAL

CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE

INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER

2001. CLAIMS MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN

FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND NO LATER

THAN FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM

LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, SHELL DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE COMPANY PURPORTING

TO PRESERVE UNMATURED CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN EQUILON INDEMNITIES. THE

LETTER ITSELF PROVIDES NO ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE CLAIM AMOUNT, AND

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THE LETTER PROVIDES A BASIS TO ESTIMATE

THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF A RANGE OF LOSS OR POTENTIAL RANGE OF LOSS

WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUILON OR THE MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. THE

COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO

PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

DESCRIBED ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE ARE TO BE NET OF

AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND

OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON

OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY

APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY

ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO

CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED

WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. UNDER THE

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS

LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE

INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE ACQUIRER SHARES IN

CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A

MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF $200, WHICH HAD NOT BEEN

REACHED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

SECURITIZATION

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE

PROGRAM USED TO SECURITIZE DOWNSTREAM-RELATED TRADE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AT YEAR-END 2007, THE BALANCE OF

SECURITIZED RECEIVABLES WAS $675 MILLION. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NO OTHER

SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY

PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND

STORAGE CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS, UTILITIES, AND

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE

APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE

VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE: 2009  $6,405; 2010 

$3,964; 2011  $3,578; 2012  $1,473; 2013  $1,329;

2014 AND AFTER  $4,333. A PORTION OF THESE

PARTNERS. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE

APPROXIMATELY $5,100 IN 2008 $3,700 IN 2007 AND $3,000

IN 2006.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF

$469 RELATED TO MINORITY INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARY

COMPANIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS

CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY

TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON

THE

ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM

SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER

PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS

SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL

SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS,

REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND

DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE

NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE

UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION,

THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE

RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN

ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL

FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE

RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH

EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE

POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL

PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

CHEVRONS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2008, WAS $1,818. INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE WERE

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OF 248 SITES FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE

REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR

ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION

RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2008 WAS $120.

THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS

PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA

OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON TO

ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS

AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2008 ENVIRONMENTAL

RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,698, $968 RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS

(I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), AND

PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $730 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($117),

UPSTREAM ($390), CHEMICALS ($154) AND OTHER

BUSINESSES ($69). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES

TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER

CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING.

SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL

OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION

AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID

AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND

TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL

ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE

CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE

REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2008 HAD A RECORDED

LIABILITY THAT WAS MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR

PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES,

INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.

ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER

WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR

PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK

HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING

INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A

POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES. FOR

THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM

POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY

$200, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE

OWED TO CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150. THE TIMING

OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS

RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND

SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS; U.S.

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES;

GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS. THE

AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE

AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE

TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE,

ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR

RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR

STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS

AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY

(FAS 143) AND FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 47,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 143

(FIN 47). FAS 143 APPLIES TO THE FAIR

VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO THAT IS RECORDED WHEN

THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE

LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THESE ASSETS REQUIRE RECOGNITION

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF A

LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING ASSET FOR AN ARO, (2) THE

SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION

OF THE ASSET, AND (3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO

LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND DISCOUNT RATES. FIN 47

CLARIFIES THAT THE PHRASE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION, AS USED IN FAS 143, REFERS TO A LEGAL

OBLIGATION TO PERFORM ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY FOR

WHICH THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT ARE

CONDITIONAL ON A FUTURE EVENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. THE OBLIGATION TO

PERFORM THE ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL

EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR

METHOD OF SETTLEMENT. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING

AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF A CONDITIONAL ARO

SHOULD BE FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE

LIABILITY WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION EXISTS. FAS 143

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN SOME CASES, SUFFICIENT INFORMATION

MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR

VALUE OF AN ARO. FIN 47 ALSO CLARIFIES WHEN AN ENTITY

WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ARO.

FAS 143 AND FIN 47 PRIMARILY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

ACCOUNTING FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING

ASSETS. NO SIGNIFICANT AROS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED

ASSETS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED, AS INDETERMINATE

SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT

ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE

COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND

CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A

COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY

THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS, THE WORLD PETROLEUM

CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM

GEOLOGISTS. THE SYSTEM CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE

HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS

AT THE TIME OF REPORTING  THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND

THREE NONCOMMERCIAL. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL

CLASSIFICATION ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES

OF UNPROVED: PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE NONCOMMERCIAL

CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT

RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT

GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS

FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING CONDITIONS. NET PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE

ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN

EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED

OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THE

QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING

WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED

NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF RESERVES ARE

SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY

ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND

ENGINEERS. AS PART OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS

RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS

A RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS

CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE RESERVES MANAGER, WHO IS

A MEMBER OF A CORPORATE DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS

DIRECTLY TO THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES. ALL OF THE RAC MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE

IN SEC GUIDELINES FOR PROVED RESERVES CLASSIFICATION.

THE RAC COORDINATES ITS ACTIVITIES THROUGH TWO

OPERATING COMPANY-LEVEL RESERVES MANAGERS. THESE TWO

RESERVES MANAGERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE RAC SO AS TO

PRESERVE THE CORPORATE-LEVEL INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY

RESPONSIBILITIES: PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OF THE

BUSINESS UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVE CHANGES; CONFIRM

THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES

ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND APPROPRIATE

STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN

THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH PROVIDES

STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR

CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON RESERVES.

FS-67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN

MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM BUSINESS

UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES

RECOMMENDED BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR CHANGES

ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND

PLANNING COMMITTEE AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHOSE

MEMBERS INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANYS ANNUAL RESERVE

ACTIVITY IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

IF MAJOR CHANGES TO RESERVES WERE TO OCCUR BETWEEN THE

ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED

WITH THE BOARD.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING

THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE THE LARGEST

PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN

EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED-RESERVE RECORDS AND

DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH THE

CORPORATE

RESERVES MANUAL.

MODERNIZATION OF OIL AND GAS REPORTING

IN DECEMBER

2008, THE SEC ISSUED ITS FINAL RULE, MODERNIZATION OF

OIL AND GAS REPORTING (RELEASE NOS. 33-8995; 34-59192;

FR-78). THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FINAL

RULE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY IN ITS FORM

10-K FILING FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE

FINAL RULE CHANGES A NUMBER OF OIL AND GAS RESERVE

ESTIMATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SEC

REGULATIONS S-K AND S-X.

AMONG THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES

IN THE FINAL RULE ARE REQUIREMENTS TO USE A PRICE BASED

ON A 12-MONTH AVERAGE FOR RESERVE ESTIMATION AND

DISCLOSURE INSTEAD OF A SINGLE END-OF-YEAR PRICE;

EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

ACTIVITIES TO INCLUDE NONTRADITIONAL SOURCES SUCH AS

BITUMEN EXTRACTED FROM OIL SANDS; PERMITTING THE USE OF

NEW RELIABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO ESTABLISH REASONABLE

CERTAINTY OF PROVED RESERVES; ALLOWING OPTIONAL

DISCLOSURE OF PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES; MODIFYING

THE DEFINITION OF GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR DISCLOSURE OF

RESERVE ESTIMATES AND PRODUCTION; AMENDING DISCLOSURES

OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES TO INCLUDE SEPARATE

DISCLOSURES OF SYNTHETIC OIL AND GAS; EXPANDING PROVED,

UNDEVELOPED RESERVE DISCLOSURES (PUDS), INCLUDING

DISCUSSION OF PUDS FIVE YEARS OLD OR MORE; AND

DISCLOSURE OF THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE CHIEF TECHNICAL

PERSON WHO OVERSEES THE COMPANYS OVERALL RESERVES

ESTIMATION PROCESS.

RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS WERE 7.9 BILLION BARRELS.

(REFER TO THE TERM RESERVES ON PAGE E-147 FOR THE

DEFINITION OF OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.) APPROXIMATELY

25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RESERVES WERE IN THE UNITED

STATES. FOR THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUITY

AFFILIATES, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES WERE 3.3 BILLION

BARRELS, 82 PERCENT OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN TCO.

ASIDE FROM THE

TENGIZ FIELD IN THE TCO AFFILIATE, NO SINGLE PROPERTY

ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. ABOUT 20 OTHER

INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF

ASSETS

EACH CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT AND 5 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANYS OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES, WHICH

IN THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL PROVED RESERVES. THESE

PROPERTIES WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED, LOCATED IN

THE UNITED STATES, SOUTH AMERICA, WEST AFRICA, THE

MIDDLE EAST AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

IN THE UNITED

STATES, TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2008

WERE 2.0 BILLION BARRELS. OF THIS AMOUNT, 43 PERCENT,

22 PERCENT AND 35 PERCENT WERE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA,

THE GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER U.S. AREAS, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CALIFORNIA, LIQUIDS RESERVES REPRESENTED 94

PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH MOST CLASSIFIED AS HEAVY

OIL. BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE NEED

TO EMPLOY ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, THE PRODUCING

OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE IN NATURE. MOST OF THE

COMPANYS HEAVY-OIL FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOY A

CONTINUOUS STEAMFLOODING PROCESS.

IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION, LIQUIDS REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 66 PERCENT OF TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT

RESERVES. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE

AND, AS A RESULT, ARE ALSO CAPITAL INTENSIVE. COSTS

INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN WELLS, PRODUCTION PLATFORMS AND

OTHER FACILITIES, SUCH AS

GATHERING LINES AND STORAGE FACILITIES.

IN OTHER U.S. AREAS, THE RESERVES WERE SPLIT ABOUT

EQUALLY BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS. FOR PRODUCTION

OF CRUDE OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED RECOVERY

METHODS, INCLUDING

WATER-FLOOD AND

CO

2

INJECTION.

THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLES, FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER

31, 2008, IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE

TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS ABILITY

TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE

COMPANYS CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT

PERMITTING, PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS,

DECLINES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS,

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE UPWARD REVISION IN THAILAND REFLECTED

ADDITIONAL DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY DURING

THE YEAR. THESE UPWARD REVISIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY REDUCTIONS IN RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH DECREASED RESERVES BY 43

MILLION BARRELS AND BY 32 MILLION BARRELS,

RESPECTIVELY. MOST OF THE UPWARD REVISION FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES WAS RELATED TO A 60

MILLION-BARREL INCREASE IN TCO AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

IN 2007, NET REVISIONS DECREASED RESERVES BY 146

MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

AND INCREASED RESERVES BY 103 MILLION BARRELS FOR

EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE

LARGEST DOWNWARD NET REVISIONS WERE 89 MILLION BARRELS

IN AFRICA AND 66 MILLION BARRELS IN INDONESIA. THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES AND CHANGES THERETO FOR THE YEARS 2006, 2007

AND 2008 ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLES ON PAGES FS-69 AND

FS-71.

RESPECTIVELY.

NET RESERVE CHANGES (EXCLUDING PRODUCTION) IN 2008 CONSIST OF 770 MILLION BARRELS OF

DEVELOPED RESERVES AND (180) MILLION BARRELS OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

180 MILLION BARRELS OF DEVELOPED RESERVES AND 97 MILLION BARRELS OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

5

DURING 2008, THE PERCENTAGES OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

TRANSFERRED TO DEVELOPED RESERVES WERE 18 PERCENT AND 2 PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

AFFILIATED COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES, CHEVRON HAS A 20 PERCENT

NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST IN THE ATHABASCA OIL-SANDS PROJECT IN CANADA. AS OF YEAR-END 2008, SEC

REGULATIONS DEFINED OIL-SANDS RESERVES AS MINING-RELATED AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS

RESERVES. NET PROVED OIL-SANDS RESERVES WERE 436 MILLION AND 443 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007

AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE OIL-SANDS QUANTITIES WERE NOT CLASSIFIED AS PROVED RESERVES AT THE END

OF 2008 BECAUSE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SEC INDUSTRY GUIDE 7,

DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY BY ISSUERS

ENGAGED OR TO BE ENGAGED IN SIGNIFICANT MINING OPERATIONS,

A MINERAL DEPOSIT MUST BE ECONOMICALLY

PRODUCIBLE AT THE TIME OF THE RESERVE DETERMINATION IN ORDER TO BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. DUE TO THE

DECLINE IN CRUDE-OIL PRICES AT THE END OF 2008, THE OPERATING COSTS OF THE ATHABASCA PROJECT

EXCEEDED THE REVENUES FROM CRUDE-OIL SALES AT THAT TIME. THE INABILITY TO CLASSIFY THE OIL-SANDS

VOLUMES AS PROVED AT THE END OF 2008 DID NOT AFFECT THE DAILY OPERATIONS OF THE ATHABASCA PROJECT

NOR THE ACTIVITIES UNDER WAY TO EXPAND THOSE OPERATIONS. DURING 2008, BITUMEN PRODUCTION FOR THE

PROJECT AVERAGED 126,000 BARRELS PER DAY (27,000 NET). THE EXPANSION PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO

INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO 255,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN LATE 2010. THE OIL-SANDS PROVED RESERVES FOR

2007 AND 2006 ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FOR

CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON PAGE FS-73.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF LIQUIDS

PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2006 THROUGH 2008 ARE

DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2006, NET REVISIONS

INCREASED RESERVES BY 39 MILLION AND 84 MILLION BARRELS

FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY

AFFILIATES, RESPECTIVELY. INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR THE NET INCREASE OF 39 MILLION

BARRELS. THE LARGEST UPWARD NET REVISIONS WERE 61

MIL-

LION BARRELS IN INDONESIA AND 27 MILLION BARRELS IN

THAILAND. IN INDONESIA, THE INCREASE WAS THE RESULT OF INFILL

DRILLING AND IMPROVED STEAMFLOOD AND WATERFLOOD

PERFORMANCE.

IN AFRICA, THE DECREASE WAS MAINLY BASED

ON FIELD PERFORMANCE DATA FOR FIELDS IN NIGERIA AND

THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES IN ANGOLA AND

REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO. IN INDONESIA, THE DECLINE ALSO

REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF HIGHER

FS-69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

YEAR-END PRICES.

HIGHER PRICES ALSO RESULTED IN DOWNWARD REVISIONS IN

KARACHAGANAK AND AZERBAIJAN. FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES, MOST OF THE UPWARD REVISION WAS RELATED TO A 92

MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR TCOS TENGIZ FIELD AND AN

11 MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR PETROBOSCAN IN

VENEZUELA, BOTH AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE. AT TCO, THE UPWARD REVISION WAS TEMPERED

BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES.

IN 2008, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 536

MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

AND INCREASED RESERVES BY 267 MILLION BARRELS FOR

EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

INTERNATIONAL AREAS ADDED 552 MILLION BARRELS. THE

LARGEST INCREASE WAS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, WHICH

ADDED 384 MILLION BARRELS. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE

WAS IN THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE AS A RESULT OF A

CONCESSION EXTENSION. UPWARD REVISIONS WERE ALSO

RECORDED IN KAZAKHSTAN AND AZERBAIJAN AND WERE MAINLY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFECT OF LOWER YEAR-END PRICES ON

THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY CONTRACTS. IN

INDONESIA, RESERVES INCREASED 191 MILLION BARRELS DUE

MAINLY TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE

RESERVE CALCULATIONS FOR PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS,

AS WELL AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND

IMPROVED WATERFLOOD AND STEAMFLOOD PERFORMANCE. FOR

AFFILIATE COMPANIES, THE 249 MILLION-BARREL INCREASE

FOR TCO WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF LOWER YEAR-END PRICES

ON THE ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND FACILITY OPTIMIZATION

AT THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV FIELDS.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN

2006, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES

WORLDWIDE BY 83 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES. RESERVES IN THE UNITED

STATES INCREASED 52 MILLION BARRELS, WITH

CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING 49 MILLION BARRELS OF THE TOTAL

INCREASE DUE TO STEAMFLOOD EXPANSION AND REVISED

MODELING ACTIVITIES. INTERNATIONALLY, IMPROVED RECOVERY

INCREASED RESERVES BY 31 MILLION BARRELS, WITH NO

SINGLE COUNTRY ACCOUNTING FOR AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN

10 MILLION BARRELS.

IN 2007, IMPROVED RECOVERY

INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 20 MILLION BARRELS

WORLDWIDE. NO ADDITION WAS INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

IN

2008, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED WORLDWIDE LIQUIDS

VOLUMES BY 37 MILLION BARRELS. INTERNATIONAL

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR 22 MILLION BARRELS

AND THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR 5 MILLION BARRELS.

THE LARGEST ADDITION

WAS RELATED TO GAS REINJECTION IN

KAZAKHSTAN. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 10

MILLION BARRELS DUE TO IMPROVED SECONDARY RECOVERY AT

BOSCAN.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2006, EXTENSIONS AND

DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 107

MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. RESERVES IN

NIGERIA INCREASED BY 27 MILLION BARRELS DUE IN PART TO

THE INITIAL BOOKING OF RESERVES FOR THE APARO FIELD.

ADDITIONAL DRILLING ACTIVITIES CONTRIBUTED 19 MILLION

BARRELS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 14 MILLION BARRELS IN

ARGENTINA. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE GULF OF MEXICO

ADDED 25 MILLION BARRELS, MAINLY THE RESULT OF THE

INITIAL BOOKING OF THE GREAT WHITE FIELD IN THE

DEEPWATER PERDIDO FOLD BELT AREA.

IN 2007, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED

LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 60 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE. THE

LARGEST ADDITIONS WERE 25 MILLION BARRELS IN THE U.S.

GULF OF MEXICO, MAINLY FOR THE DEEPWATER TAHITI AND MAD

DOG FIELDS.

IN 2008, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

INCREASED CONSOLIDATED COMPANY RESERVES 33 MILLION

BARRELS WORLDWIDE. THE UNITED STATES INCREASED RESERVES

17 MILLION BARRELS, PRIMARILY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 16 MILLION

BARRELS WITH NO ONE COUNTRY RESULTING IN ADDITIONS

GREATER THAN 5 MILLION BARRELS.

PURCHASES

IN 2006, ACQUISITIONS INCREASED LIQUIDS

VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 21 MILLION BARRELS FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND 119 MILLION

BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, THE AMOUNT WAS MAINLY THE RESULT OF NEW

AGREEMENTS IN NIGERIA, WHICH ADDED 13 MILLION BARRELS

OF RESERVES. THE OTHER-EQUITY-AFFILIATES QUANTITY

REFLECTS THE RESULT OF THE CONVERSION OF BOSCAN AND

LL-652 OPERATIONS TO JOINT STOCK COMPANIES IN

VENEZUELA.

IN 2007, ACQUISITIONS OF 316 MILLION BARRELS FOR

EQUITY AFFILIATES RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW

HAMACA EQUITY AFFILIATE IN VENEZUELA.

SALES

IN 2006, SALES DECREASED RESERVES BY 15

MILLION BARRELS DUE TO THE CONVERSION OF THE LL-652

RISKED SERVICE AGREEMENT TO A JOINT STOCK COMPANY

IN VENEZUELA.

IN 2007, AFFILIATED COMPANY SALES OF 432 MILLION

BARRELS RELATED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF A HAMACA EQUITY

AFFILIATE IN VENEZUELA.

DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2006, REVISIONS ACCOUNTED

FOR A NET INCREASE OF 481 BILLION CUBIC FEET (BCF) FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND 26 BCF FOR AFFILIATES. FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET INCREASES OF 511 BCF

INTERNATIONALLY WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 30 BCF

DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE UNITED STATES. DRILLING AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ADDED 337 BCF OF RESERVES IN

THAILAND, WHILE KAZAKHSTAN ADDED 200 BCF, LARGELY DUE

TO DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO INCREASED

185 BCF, ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE

AND A

NEW CONTRACT FOR SALES OF NATURAL GAS. THESE

ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS

OF 224 BCF IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 130 BCF IN AUSTRALIA DUE TO

DRILLING RESULTS AND RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE. U.S.

OTHER HAD A DOWNWARD REVISION OF 102 BCF DUE TO

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

UPWARD REVISIONS OF 72 BCF IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND

CALIFORNIA RELATED TO RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND

DEVELOPMENT DRILLING. TCO HAD AN UPWARD REVISION OF 26

BCF ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND

UPDATED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

IN 2007, REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY A NET 395 BCF AND INCREASED

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

ATED COMPANIES BY A NET 73 BCF. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, NET INCREASES WERE 209 BCF IN THE UNITED

STATES AND 186 BCF INTERNATIONALLY. IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE FOR MANY FIELDS IN THE UNITED STATES

CONTRIBUTED 130 BCF IN THE OTHER REGION, 40 BCF IN

CALIFORNIA AND 39 BCF IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. DRILLING

ACTIVITIES ADDED 360 BCF IN THAILAND AND IMPROVED

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE ADDED 188 BCF IN TRINIDAD AND

TOBAGO. THESE ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF 185 BCF IN AUSTRALIA DUE TO

DRILLING RESULTS AND 136 BCF IN NIGERIA DUE TO FIELD

PERFORMANCE. NEGATIVE REVISIONS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF

HIGHER PRICES WERE RECORDED IN AZERBAIJAN AND

KAZAKHSTAN. TCO HAD AN UPWARD REVISION OF 75 BCF

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THIS UPWARD REVISION WAS NET OF

A NEGATIVE IMPACT DUE TO HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES.

IN 2008, REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES BY A NET 1,166 BCF AND INCREASED RESERVES FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES BY 1,130 BCF. IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC

REGION, POSITIVE REVISIONS TOTALED 961 BCF FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. ALMOST HALF OF THE INCREASE WAS

ATTRIBUTED TO THE KARACHAGANAK FIELD IN KAZAKHSTAN, DUE

MAINLY TO THE EFFECTS OF LOW YEAR-END PRICES ON THE

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT AND THE RESULTS OF

DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND IMPROVED RECOVERY. OTHER LARGE

UPWARD REVISIONS WERE RECORDED FOR THE PATTANI FIELD IN

THAILAND DUE TO A SUCCESSFUL DRILLING CAMPAIGN. FOR THE

TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, AN INCREASE OF 498 BCF

REFLECTED THE IMPACTS OF LOWER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE

ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND FACILITY OPTIMIZATION.

RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT

ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE 632 BCF INCREASE IN

OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2006, EXTENSIONS AND

DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF 799 BCF FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, REFLECTING A 531 BCF INCREASE

BCF. BANGLADESH ADDED 451 BCF, THE RESULT OF

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND FIELD EXTENSIONS, AND THAILAND

ADDED 59 BCF, THE RESULT OF DRILLING ACTIVITIES. U.S.

OTHER CONTRIBUTED 157 BCF, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF

WHICH WAS RELATED TO SOUTH TEXAS AND THE PICEANCE BASIN, AND THE GULF OF

MEXICO ADDED 111 BCF, PARTLY DUE TO THE INITIAL BOOKING

OF RESERVES AT THE GREAT WHITE FIELD IN THE DEEPWATER

PERDIDO FOLD BELT AREA.

IN 2007, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR

AN INCREASE OF 518 BCF WORLDWIDE. THE LARGEST ADDITION

GAS RESERVES WERE 35 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

ABOUT EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE COMPANYS U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AFFILIATED COMPANIES ADDED

54 BCF OF RESERVES, THE RESULT OF CONVERSION OF AN

OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT TO A JOINT STOCK COMPANY

IN VENEZUELA.

IN 2007, PURCHASES OF NATURAL GAS RESERVES WERE

141 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, WHICH INCLUDE THE

ACQUISITION OF AN ADDITIONAL INTEREST IN THE BIBIYANA

FIELD IN BANGLADESH. AFFILIATED COMPANY PURCHASES OF

211 BCF RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW HAMACA

EQUITY AFFILIATE IN VENEZUELA AND AN INITIAL BOOKING

RELATED TO THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT.

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES,

RESPECTIVELY. THE AFFILIATED COMPANY SALES RELATED TO

FUTURE

NET

CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED

OIL

AND

GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET

CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING PROVED OIL AND

GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 69. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH INFLOWS

FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END

PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF

ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE

LIMITED TO THOSE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED

FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE

YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END

COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF YEAR-END

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME

TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END

STATUTORY TAX RATES. THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE

DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED

FUTURE PRETAX NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF

RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE

CALCULATED USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS.

DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN

FUTURE EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN RESERVES

WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE IMPRECISE

AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES,

WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED

FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE ARBITRARY VALUATION PRESCRIBED

UNDER FAS 69 REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND

AMOUNT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE

CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND

SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF THE

COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL AND

GAS RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED
