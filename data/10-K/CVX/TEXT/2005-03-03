SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRONTEXACO

CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION,

1

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND

MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE

IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS,

COAL MINING, POWER AND ENERGY SERVICES. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 180

OTHER COUNTRIES. PETROLEUM OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR,

DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; REFINING

CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND

TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY

PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY AFFILIATES,

OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND THE

MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, OF FUEL

AND LUBRICATING OIL ADDITIVES.

IN THIS REPORT, EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL

GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

E&P OR UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

RM&T OR DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES. A

LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES E-4 AND E-5 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD MORE THAN 56,000

EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 9,300 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES).

APPROXIMATELY 25,000, OR 45 PERCENT, OF THE COMPANYS

EMPLOYEES WERE EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, AND INDIVIDUAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

CONTROL OVER SOME OF THEM. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES, REGULATING WHERE AND

HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR

PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME CASES, LIMITING THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY.

PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

PETROCHEMICALS ARE DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THESE

COMMODITIES. THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM

EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE WORLDS SWING

PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL, AND THEIR PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE A MAJOR

FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY. DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND

ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE

CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH

WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO OTHER ENERGY SOURCES

ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. VARIATIONS IN THE COMPONENTS OF

REFINED PRODUCTS SALES DUE TO SEASONALITY ARE NOT PRIMARY

DRIVERS OF CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS OVERALL ANNUAL EARNINGS.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS.

CHEVRONTEXACO COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM

COMPANIES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LEASES AND OTHER PROPERTIES, AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR

REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CHEVRONTEXACO ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY

INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT

REFINING AND MARKETING ENTITIES IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF

VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

REFER TO PAGES FS-2 THROUGH FS-21 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR A DISCUSSION

ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK.

INCORPORATED

IN DELAWARE IN 1926 AS STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE NAME CHEVRON CORPORATION IN 1984 AND

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION IN 2001. AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE

TERM CHEVRONTEXACO AND SUCH TERMS AS THE

COMPANY, THE CORPORATION, OUR,

WE, AND US MAY REFER TO CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION, ONE OR MORE OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, OR TO

ALL OF THEM TAKEN AS A WHOLE, BUT UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE, IT

DOES NOT INCLUDE AFFILIATES OF

CHEVRONTEXACO  I.E., THOSE COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR BY

THE EQUITY METHOD (GENERALLY OWNED 50 PERCENT OR LESS) OR

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD. ALL OF THESE TERMS

ARE USED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED AS A PRECISE

DESCRIPTION OF ANY OF THE SEPARATE COMPANIES, EACH OF WHICH

MANAGES ITS OWN AFFAIRS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK FACTORS

CHEVRONTEXACO IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH

A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRONTEXACO IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING

COMMODITY PRICES.

CHEVRONTEXACO IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A

HISTORY OF PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT

AFFECTS THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS CRUDE OIL

PRICES. EXCEPT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF RUNNING AN INTEGRATED

PETROLEUM BUSINESS, CHEVRONTEXACO DOES NOT SEEK TO HEDGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO PRICE CHANGES. A SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT DECLINE IN

CRUDE OIL PRICES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURE PLANS.

THE SCOPE OF CHEVRONTEXACOS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF

THE COMPANY DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF

CHEVRONTEXACO IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS IT PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE

PRODUCTION, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING

AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND

PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS IN PROMISING AREAS, DRILLING SUCCESS,

ABILITY TO BRING LONG LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO

COMPLETION ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE, AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE

OPERATION OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY

NATURAL OR HUMAN FACTORS.

CHEVRONTEXACO OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND

SOMETIMES INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

AND FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, EARTHQUAKES,

FLOODS, CIVIL UNREST, FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS, OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONTEXACOS BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO

LIABILITY RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRONTEXACO OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONTEXACOS

BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

HOST GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE

COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES,

AND/OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED

RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL

CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF

EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED

RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE

COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND RESULTS, AND ARE CAREFULLY

CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT

AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, APPROXIMATELY 27 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PROVED

RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS

SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING

COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDING INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA. APPROXIMATELY

25 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES,

INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004.

CHEVRONTEXACO STRATEGIC DIRECTION

CHEVRONTEXACOS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINED

FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM ITS OPERATIONS THAT WILL ENABLE IT TO

OUTPERFORM ITS COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY SET A GOAL TO GENERATE

THE HIGHEST TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN (BASED ON A COMBINATION OF

STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION AND REINVESTED DIVIDENDS) AMONG A

DESIGNATED PEER GROUP FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD 2000-2004. BP,

EXXONMOBIL AND ROYAL DUTCH SHELL  AMONG THE

WORLDS LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

COMPANIES  COMPRISED THE COMPANYS DESIGNATED

COMPETITOR PEER GROUP FOR THIS PURPOSE. FOR THE FIVE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO TIED ONE OTHER

COMPANY IN THE PEER GROUP FOR THE HIGHEST TOTAL STOCKHOLDER

RETURN.

AS A FOUNDATION FOR ATTAINING THIS GOAL, THE COMPANY HAD

ESTABLISHED FOUR KEY PRIORITIES, WHICH CONTINUE INTO 2005.



OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

THROUGH SAFE, RELIABLE,

EFFICIENT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND OPERATIONS.



COST REDUCTION

BY LOWERING UNIT COSTS THROUGH

INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY.



CAPITAL STEWARDSHIP

BY INVESTING IN THE BEST

PROJECT OPPORTUNITIES AND EXECUTING THEM SUCCESSFULLY (SAFER,

FASTER, AND AT LOWER COST).



PROFITABLE GROWTH

THROUGH LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN BOTH EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS.

SUPPORTING THESE FOUR PRIORITIES IS A FOCUS ON.



ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY.

HAVING THE RIGHT

PEOPLE, PROCESSES AND CULTURE TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN

INDUSTRY-LEADING PERFORMANCE IN THE FOUR PRIMARY AREAS DESCRIBED

ABOVE.

THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM STRATEGIES FOR ITS LARGEST

BUSINESSES BUILD ON THIS FRAMEWORK AND FOCUS ON BALANCING

FINANCIAL RETURNS AND GROWTH. THE STRATEGIES FOR UPSTREAM

(EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION) ARE TO GROW PROFITABILITY IN CORE

AREAS, BUILD NEW LEGACY POSITIONS, AND COMMERCIALIZE THE

COMPANYS NATURAL GAS EQUITY RESOURCE BASE BY TARGETING

NORTH AMERICAN AND ASIAN MARKETS. THE PRIMARY STRATEGY FOR

DOWNSTREAM (REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION) IS TO

CONTINUE TO IMPROVE RETURNS BY FOCUSING ON AREAS OF MARKET AND

SUPPLY STRENGTH.

(B)

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY ARE WIDELY

DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY. THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS IN NORTH

AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA, MIDDLE EAST, CENTRAL AND

FAR EAST ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA. BESIDES THE LARGE UPSTREAM AND

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES, THE COMPANYS OTHER COMPARATIVELY

SMALLER BUSINESS SEGMENT IS CHEMICALS, WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY THE

COMPANYS 50 PERCENT-OWNED AFFILIATE 

CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM)  AND

THE WHOLLY OWNED CHEVRON ORONITE COMPANY (CHEVRON ORONITE).

CPCHEM HAS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO,

SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND

BELGIUM. CHEVRON ORONITE IS A FUEL AND LUBRICATING-OIL ADDITIVES

BUSINESS THAT OWNS AND OPERATES FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES,

FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE AND JAPAN AND HAS EQUITY

INTERESTS IN FACILITIES IN INDIA AND MEXICO.

CHEVRONTEXACO ALSO OWNS AN APPROXIMATE 25 PERCENT EQUITY

INTEREST IN THE COMMON STOCK OF DYNEGY INC. (DYNEGY), AN ENERGY

PROVIDER ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION, GATHERING AND PROCESSING

OF NATURAL GAS, AND THE FRACTIONATION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION

AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS. THE COMPANY HOLDS AN

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK. REFER TO PAGE

FS-11 AND NOTE 8 ON PAGE FS-36 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO CONDUCTED ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 25 OTHER

COUNTRIES. WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2004,

INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS AND PRODUCTION UNDER

AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT, DECLINED APPROXIMATELY

5 PERCENT FROM 2003. THE DECLINE WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF

LOWER PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO NORMAL FIELD

DECLINES, PROPERTY SALES AND CURTAILMENTS AS A RESULT OF DAMAGES

TO PRODUCING OPERATIONS FROM HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN

SEPTEMBER 2004. INTERNATIONAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS DOWN

MARGINALLY BETWEEN YEARS. REFER TO THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-6 FOR A DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE 2002-2004 CHANGES IN

PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS.

FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS, THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION, INCLUDING THE VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM

OIL SANDS AND PRODUCTION UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT,

HAS FOLLOWED A DOWNWARD TREND. PRODUCTION IN 2004 WAS

85 PERCENT OF 1998 LEVELS, EQUIVALENT TO AN AVERAGE ANNUAL

DECLINE RATE OF ABOUT 3 PERCENT. FOR 2005, THE COMPANY

AGAIN EXPECTS WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION TO BE LOWER.

INCREASES INTERNATIONALLY IN 2005 ARE NOT EXPECTED TO FULLY

OFFSET LOWER RATES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THE COMPANY

PROJECTS WILL RESULT LARGELY FROM NORMAL FIELD DECLINES AND THE

ABSENCE OF PRODUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTY SALES. THE ACTUAL

LEVEL OF WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION IN 2005 REMAINS UNCERTAIN FOR

REASONS INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY OPEC,

AND DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY WEATHER, LOCAL CIVIL UNREST AND OTHER

FACTORS. PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN THE 2006-2008 PERIOD MAY PERMIT

THE WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION LEVEL TO INCREASE FROM

THAT EXPECTED IN 2005. REFER TO THE REVIEW OF ONGOING

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN KEY AREAS

BEGINNING ON PAGE 11 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS

MAJOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

THE UNITED STATES UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO, CALIFORNIA, LOUISIANA, TEXAS, NEW MEXICO AND THE

ROCKY MOUNTAINS. AVERAGE DAILY NET PRODUCTION DURING 2004 WAS

APPROXIMATELY 505,000 BARRELS OF LIQUIDS AND

1.9 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS, OR

817,000 BARRELS PER DAY ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS. THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED PLANS IN 2003 TO SELL INTERESTS IN

NONSTRATEGIC PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, AND

DURING 2004 SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LARGER ASSET PACKAGES WERE

SOLD. THE EFFECT OF THESE SALES ON 2004 NET OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION WAS ABOUT 30,000 BARRELS PER DAY. THE REMAINING

PROPERTIES EARMARKED FOR SALE ARE EXPECTED TO BE DISPOSED OF

DURING 2005 AND REPRESENT LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF THE

U.S. OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AT THE END OF 2004. REFER TO

TABLE V BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-63 FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE RESERVES AND DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS FOR THE MAJOR

THE 57 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED GENESIS AVERAGED DAILY

NET PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 13,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL

AND 18 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS IN 2004. PETRONIUS

PRODUCTION WAS SHUT-IN FOR REPAIRS FOLLOWING HURRICANE DAMAGE IN

SEPTEMBER 2004, AND IS EXPECTED TO RESUME PRODUCING IN MARCH

2005. TYPHOON, WHICH IS 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED, HAD

AVERAGE DAILY NET PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY

11,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND

14 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS IN 2004, INCLUDING

PRODUCTION FROM THE BORIS FIELD THAT UTILIZES THE TYPHOON

PRODUCTION FACILITY.

DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES ON THE COMPANY-OPERATED PERSEUS AND TAHITI

PROJECTS, WHICH ARE NOT YET ON PRODUCTION. THE COMPANYS

OWNERSHIP INTERESTS ARE 50 PERCENT AND 58 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY. AT PERSEUS, PLATFORM RIG DAMAGE DUE TO THE

SEPTEMBER 2004 HURRICANE DELAYED THE ESTIMATED COMPLETION OF THE

FIRST PRODUCING WELL UNTIL APRIL 2005. A SECOND PRODUCTION WELL

IS SCHEDULED TO FOLLOW IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2006. AVERAGE NET

PRODUCTION IN 2005 FROM THE FIRST PERSEUS WELL THROUGH THE

PETRONIUS FACILITIES IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN 4,000 NET

BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY AFTER START-UP. THE INITIAL

BOOKING OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES OCCURRED IN 2003 AND A

RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN RESERVES TO PROVED DEVELOPED WILL

OCCUR IN EARLY 2005, PRIOR TO THE START OF PRODUCTION FROM THE

FIRST WELL. THE PERSEUS PROJECT HAS AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE

OF BETWEEN SIX AND NINE YEARS. AT TAHITI, ENGINEERING AND

EQUIPMENT PROCUREMENT WAS IN PROCESS DURING 2004. A SUCCESSFUL

WELL TEST OF THE ORIGINAL DISCOVERY WELL WAS ALSO CONDUCTED IN

2004. INITIAL BOOKING OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES OCCURRED IN

2003, AND TRANSFER OF CERTAIN RESERVES INTO THE PROVED DEVELOPED

CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED IN 2008, WHEN FIRST PRODUCTION IS

SCHEDULED TO BEGIN. TAHITI IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A PRODUCTION LIFE

OF 25 YEARS.

IN GULF OF MEXICO EXPLORATION, THE COMPANY PARTICIPATED IN 11

DEEPWATER EXPLORATORY WELLS DURING 2004 AND ANNOUNCED TWO

DISCOVERIES  THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED

JACK PROSPECT AND THE 17 PERCENT-OWNED AND NONOPERATED

TOBAGO PROSPECT. FURTHER EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL ALSO

CONTINUED ON THE 2003 DISCOVERY AT THE 30 PERCENT-OWNED AND

NONOPERATED TUBULAR BELLS PROSPECT WITH ADDITIONAL FOLLOW-UP

DRILLING PLANNED FOR THE 2005-TO-2006 TIMEFRAME. COMMERCIAL

APPRAISAL WORK ALSO CONTINUES AT THE NONOPERATED

33 PERCENT-OWNED GREAT WHITE FIELD, INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL

WELL THAT IS PLANNED IN 2005, AND AT THE NONOPERATED

13 PERCENT-OWNED SAINT MALO DISCOVERY. PROVED RESERVES HAVE

NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THESE PROJECTS. APPRAISAL DRILLING ALSO

OCCURRED IN 2004 AT THE 63 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED BLIND

FAITH. INITIAL PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED BY EARLY 2008. NO PROVED

RESERVES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THIS PROJECT. THE

75 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED TONGA PROSPECT WAS DRILLED IN

2003 AND THE DATA FROM THIS WELL IS UNDER EVALUATION.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAD FINALIZED A

20-YEAR AGREEMENT FOR REGASIFICATION CAPACITY AT THE PROPOSED

SABINE PASS LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) TERMINAL. IN NOVEMBER

2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAD PLANS TO SUBMIT FEDERAL AND

STATE PERMIT APPLICATIONS FOR A REGASIFICATION TERMINAL TO

IMPORT LNG LOCATED AT ITS PASCAGOULA REFINERY.

WAS THE FIRST TO PRODUCE IN THE DEEPWATER. CABINDA GULF OIL

COMPANY LIMITED (CABGOC), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

CHEVRONTEXACO, IS OPERATOR OF TWO CONCESSIONS, BLOCK 0 AND

BLOCK 14, OFF THE WEST COAST OF ANGOLA, NORTH OF THE CONGO

RIVER. BLOCK 0, IN WHICH CABGOC HAS A 39 PERCENT

INTEREST, IS A 2,155-SQUARE-MILE CONCESSION ADJACENT TO THE

CABINDA COASTLINE. BLOCK 14, IN WHICH CABGOC HAS A

31 PERCENT INTEREST, IS A 1,580-SQUARE-MILE DEEPWATER

CONCESSION LOCATED WEST OF BLOCK 0.

IN BLOCK 0, THE COMPANY OPERATES IN TWO AREAS  A

AND B  COMPOSED OF 19 FIELDS PRODUCING

116,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF NET LIQUIDS IN 2004.

AREA A, COMPRISING 13 PRODUCING FIELDS, AVERAGED NET DAILY

PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 78,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND

1,000 BARRELS OF LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS (LPG) IN

PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS AREA B AND AREA C, HAS SIX

PRODUCING FIELDS AND AVERAGED DAILY NET PRODUCTION OF

37,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL IN 2004. IN 2004, THE COMPANY

FINALIZED A 20-YEAR EXTENSION OF ITS BLOCK 0 CONCESSION,

WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN 2030. THE SANHA CONDENSATE GAS UTILIZATION

AND BOMBOCO CRUDE OIL PROJECT, LOCATED IN AREA B, BEGAN

OPERATIONS WITH THE INSTALLATION OF FACILITIES AND THE START OF

PRODUCTION IN LATE 2004. INITIAL RECOGNITION OF PROVED RESERVES

WAS MADE AT THE END OF 2002. INITIAL RECLASSIFICATION OF

RESERVES FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED OCCURRED IN

2004 AND WILL CONTINUE IN 2005 AND 2006.

IN BLOCK 14, NET PRODUCTION IN 2004 FROM THE KUITO FIELD,

ANGOLAS FIRST DEEPWATER PRODUCING AREA, AVERAGED

APPROXIMATELY 18,000 NET BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER DAY. THE

DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR THE BENGUELA, BELIZE, LOBITO AND TOMBOCO

FIELDS IN BLOCK 14 WERE APPROVED IN 2003. PHASE 1 OF

THE $2.2 BILLION PROJECT INVOLVES THE INSTALLATION OF AN

INTEGRATED DRILLING AND PRODUCTION PLATFORM AND THE DEVELOPMENT

OF THE BENGUELA AND BELIZE FIELDS, PROJECTED FOR FIRST OIL IN

EARLY 2006. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR THESE FIELDS WERE

BOOKED IN 1998. PHASE 2 INVOLVES THE INSTALLATION OF SUBSEA

SYSTEMS, PIPELINES AND WELLS FOR LOBITO AND TOMBOCO. PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR THESE FIELDS WERE BOOKED IN 2000.

PHASE 2 IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, WITH FIRST OIL PLANNED FOR

LATE 2006. AFTER BOTH PHASES ARE COMPLETED, MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY

PRODUCTION IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN 200,000 BARRELS OF

CRUDE OIL IN 2008. SOME PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WILL BE

RECOGNIZED NEAR TO THE TIME OF FIRST OIL. THE CONCESSION FOR

THESE FIELDS WILL EXPIRE IN 2027.

THE LANDANA AND TOMBUA FIELDS WERE DISCOVERED IN 1997 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY, AND APPRAISAL DRILLING WAS DONE FROM 1998 THROUGH

2002. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR TOMBUA AND LANDANA WERE

PROGRAM FOR BLOCK 3 IS PLANNED FOR 2005.

F)     AFFILIATE OPERATIONS

KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY HOLDS A 50 PERCENT INTEREST

IN TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO), WHICH IS DEVELOPING THE TENGIZ AND

KOROLEV CRUDE OIL FIELDS LOCATED IN WESTERN KAZAKHSTAN, UNDER A

40-YEAR CONCESSION THAT EXPIRES IN 2033. NET OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION AVERAGED 178,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN 2004.

TCO IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION COMPOSED OF

TWO INTEGRATED PROJECTS REFERRED TO AS THE SOUR GAS

INJECTION (SGI)/SECOND GENERATION PROJECT (SGP). AT A TOTAL

COST IN EXCESS OF $4 BILLION, THE EXPANSION IS DESIGNED TO

INCREASE TCOS CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION CAPACITY FROM

298,000 BARRELS PER DAY TO BETWEEN 430,000 AND

500,000 BARRELS PER DAY BY LATE 2006, DEPENDING ON THE

FINAL EFFECTS OF THE SGI.

SGP INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LARGE PROCESSING TRAIN FOR

TREATING CRUDE OIL AND THE ASSOCIATED SOUR GAS. THE SGP DESIGN

IS BASED ON THE SAME CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYED IN THE

EXISTING PROCESSING TRAINS. IN ADDITION TO NEW PROCESSING

CAPACITY, SGP INVOLVES DRILLING AND/OR COMPLETING 55 PRODUCTION

WELLS IN THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV RESERVOIRS TO GENERATE THE

VOLUMES REQUIRED FOR THE NEW PROCESSING TRAIN. PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH SGP WERE RECOGNIZED IN

2001. SOME OF THESE RESERVES WERE RECLASSIFIED TO PROVED

DEVELOPED IN 2004 BASED UPON COMPLETION OF CERTAIN PROJECT

MILESTONES. OVER THE NEXT DECADE, ONGOING FIELD DEVELOPMENT IS

EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE MATURATION OF THE CURRENT PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO PROVED DEVELOPED.

SGI INVOLVES TAKING A PORTION OF THE RICH, SOUR GAS SEPARATED

FROM THE CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AT THE SGP PROCESSING TRAIN AND

RE-INJECTING IT INTO THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV RESERVOIRS.

CHEVRONTEXACO EXPECTS THAT SGI WILL HAVE TWO KEY EFFECTS. FIRST,

SGI WILL REDUCE THE SOUR GAS PROCESSING CAPACITY OTHERWISE

REQUIRED AT SGP, THEREBY INCREASING LIQUID PRODUCTION CAPACITY

AND LOWERING THE QUANTITIES OF SULFUR AND GAS THAT WOULD

OTHERWISE BE GENERATED. SECOND, OVER TIME IT IS EXPECTED THAT

SGI WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND RECOVERABLE VOLUMES

DUE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF HIGHER RESERVOIR PRESSURE FROM THE GAS

RE-INJECTION. BETWEEN 2006 AND 2008, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES

RECOGNIZING ADDITIONAL PROVED RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SGI

EXPANSION. THE PRIMARY SGI RISKS INCLUDE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT

COMPRESSOR PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH INJECTING HIGH-PRESSURE

SOUR GAS AND SUBSURFACE RESPONSES TO INJECTION.

ESSENTIALLY ALL OF TCOS PRODUCTION IS EXPORTED THROUGH THE

CPC PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM TENGIZ IN KAZAKHSTAN TO TANKER

LOADING FACILITIES AT NOVOROSSIYSK ON THE RUSSIAN COAST OF THE

BLACK SEA. CPC, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE EXPANDED IN STAGES

THROUGH THE END OF 2008, IS ANTICIPATED TO FULLY ACCOMMODATE TCO

EXPANSION VOLUMES BY THE END OF 2007. TCO IS CURRENTLY PURSUING

ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION ROUTES TO ACCOMMODATE EXPANSION VOLUMES

PRIOR TO THE END OF 2007 AS NECESSARY.

VENEZUELA.

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST

IN THE HAMACA HEAVY OIL PRODUCTION AND UPGRADING PROJECT LOCATED

CAPACITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2005 TO PROCESS

190,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL (8.5° API)

AND UPGRADE INTO 180,000 BARRELS OF LIGHTER, HIGHER-VALUE

HIGHER PRODUCTION AT P&MS SURFACE MINE LOCATED NEAR

GALLUP, NEW MEXICO.

AT YEAR-END 2004, P&M CONTROLLED APPROXIMATELY

167 MILLION TONS OF DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED COAL

RESERVES, INCLUDING RESERVES OF ENVIRONMENTALLY DESIRABLE

CHEVRONTEXACOS GLOBAL POWER GENERATION (GPG) HAS MORE

THAN 20 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING AND OPERATING

COMMERCIAL POWER PROJECTS. WITH 13 POWER ASSETS LOCATED IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ASIA, GPG MANAGES THE PRODUCTION OF MORE THAN

FACILITIES ARE OWNED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES. THE COMPANY

OPERATES EFFICIENT GAS-FIRED COGENERATION FACILITIES, SOME OF

WHICH PRODUCE STEAM FOR USE IN UPSTREAM OPERATIONS TO FACILITATE

PRODUCTION OF HEAVY OIL.

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

THE 50-50 SASOL CHEVRON GLOBAL JOINT VENTURE WAS ESTABLISHED IN

OCTOBER 2000 TO DEVELOP A WORLDWIDE GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

(GTL) BUSINESS. IN NIGERIA, CONSTRUCTION FOR THE PLANNED

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS FACILITY AT ESCRAVOS IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN

2005, PENDING FINALIZATION OF FISCAL TERMS. PROJECTS TO BUILD

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES IN THE AREAS

DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS

PROCESSES, ULTIMATE SUCCESS IS NOT CERTAIN. ALTHOUGH NOT ALL

INITIATIVES MAY PROVE TO BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, THE

COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA IS NOT

SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL,

HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND

COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE

COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS.

CHEVRONTEXACO EXPECTS MORE ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED REGULATIONS IN

THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS OPERATIONS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF

COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS

OPERATIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING ITS

BUSINESS.

IN 2004, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE $145 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY

5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES. THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO RETROFIT

EXISTING FACILITIES, AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW

FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE PETROLEUM

SEGMENT AND RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR-AND-WATER QUALITY PROJECTS AND

ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS

PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING FACILITIES. FOR 2005, THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY

$240 MILLION. THE FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS OF FULFILLING

THIS COMMITMENT ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND THEIR IMPACT ON

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

AS SHOWN IN THE SPECIAL ITEMS TABLE, NET SPECIAL GAINS OF $1.2 BILLION, ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH

THE DISPOSITION OF NON-STRATEGIC UPSTREAM ASSETS, BENEFITED INCOME IN 2004. IN 2002, $2.3 BILLION

OF THE $3.3 BILLION OF NET CHARGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN ITS DYNEGY INC. AFFILIATE. REFER TO PAGE FS-11 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY.

THE SPECIAL

ITEMS RECORDED IN 2002 THROUGH 2004 ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ANY FUTURE TRENDS OF EVENTS OR THEIR

IMPACT ON FUTURE EARNINGS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF SPECIAL ITEM-RELATED EVENTS, THE COMPANY MAY

NOT ALWAYS BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE THEIR OCCURRENCE OR ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON INCOME IN ANY PERIOD.

APART FROM THE EFFECTS OF SPECIAL-ITEM GAINS AND CHARGES, THE COMPANYS EARNINGS DEPEND LARGELY ON

THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM  EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  AND DOWNSTREAM  REFINING,

MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION  BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS CRUDE OIL PRICES. OVERALL EARNINGS TRENDS ARE TYPICALLY LESS

AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS COMMODITY CHEMICALS SEGMENT AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND

INVESTMENTS.

THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE

AND COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY, IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

INVEST IN PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RETURNS AND TO MANAGE OPERATING EXPENSES

EFFECTIVELY. CREATING AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS IN PROMISING AREAS, DRILLING SUCCESS,

THE ABILITY TO BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON BUDGET AND

SCHEDULE, AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT KEY TO

PROVIDING SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE AND TO ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO ITS

ASSET BASE TO HELP SUSTAIN THE COMPANYS GROWTH. IN ADDITION TO THE ASSET-DISPOSITION AND

RESTRUCTURING PLANS ANNOUNCED IN 2003, WHICH GENERATED $3.7 BILLION OF SALES PROCEEDS IN 2004,

OTHER SUCH PLANS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES. REFER

TO THE OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS SECTION ON PAGE FS-4 FOR A DISCUSSION THAT INCLUDES REFERENCES TO

THE COMPANYS ASSET DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES.

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES IN EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION EARNINGS ALIGN MOST CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY PRICE

LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL

FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGES AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL

PRICES, AND REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST

OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. MOREOVER, ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IN THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS AND ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING ITS

FACILITIES AND BUSINESS. LONGER-TERM TRENDS IN EARNINGS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE ALSO A FUNCTION OF

OTHER FACTORS BESIDES PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL

GAS PRODUCTION LEVELS AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES.

THE LEVEL OF OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFICIENT

PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL.

EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION BUT ALSO PRICES CHARGED BY THE

INDUSTRYS PRODUCT- AND SERVICE-PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE

INDUSTRYS OWN SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OPERATING EXPENSES CAN

ALSO BE AFFECTED BY UNINSURED DAMAGES TO PRODUCTION FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL

UNREST.

INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL REACHED RECORD HIGHS DURING 2004. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRICE FOR

WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE OIL, ONE OF THE BENCHMARK CRUDES, REACHED $55 PER BARREL IN

OCTOBER 2004. WTI PRICES FOR THE FULL YEAR AVERAGED $41 PER BARREL, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

$10 PER BARREL FROM 2003. THE WTI SPOT PRICE PER BARREL AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2005 WAS

APPROXIMATELY $51. THESE RELATIVELY HIGH INDUSTRY PRICES REFLECTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASED

DEMAND FROM HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES, THE HEIGHTENED

LEVEL OF GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD, CRUDE OIL SUPPLY CONCERNS IN THE

MIDDLE EAST AND OTHER KEY PRODUCING REGIONS, AND PRODUCTION SHUT IN FOR REPAIRS FOLLOWING HURRICANE

IVAN IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN SEPTEMBER 2004.

DURING MOST OF 2004, THE DIFFERENTIAL IN PRICES

BETWEEN HIGH QUALITY, LIGHT-SWEET CRUDE OILS, SUCH AS THE U.S. BENCHMARK

WTI, AND THE HEAVIER CRUDES WAS UNUSUALLY WIDE. THE UPWARD TREND IN PRICES IN 2004 FOR LIGHTER

CRUDE OILS TRACKED THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR LIGHT PRODUCTS, AS ALL REFINERIES COULD PROCESS THESE

HIGHER QUALITY CRUDES. HOWEVER, THE DEMAND AND PRICE FOR THE HEAVIER CRUDES WERE DAMPENED DUE TO

THE LIMITED NUMBER OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PROCESS THIS LOWER QUALITY FEEDSTOCK. THE

COMPANY PRODUCES HEAVY CRUDE OIL (INCLUDING VOLUMES UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT) IN

CALIFORNIA, INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE (BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT) AND

VENEZUELA.

NATURAL GAS PRICES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, WERE ALSO HIGHER IN 2004 THAN IN 2003.

BENCHMARK PRICES IN 2004 FOR HENRY HUB U.S. NATURAL GAS PEAKED IN OCTOBER 2004 ABOVE $8.50 PER

THOUSAND CUBIC FEET (MCF). FOR THE FULL YEAR, PRICES AVERAGED NEARLY $6.00 PER MCF, COMPARED WITH

$5.50 IN 2003. AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2005, THE HENRY HUB SPOT PRICE WAS ABOUT $6.10 PER MCF.

AS COMPARED WITH THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE

RESULTANT TREND IN THE HENRY HUB BENCHMARK PRICES, CERTAIN OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH THE

COMPANY OPERATES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT SUPPLY, DEMAND AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES,

TYPICALLY RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE SALES PRICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION OF

NATURAL GAS. (REFER TO THE TABLE ON PAGE FS-10 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS PRICES FOR THE

UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.) ADDITIONALLY, EXCESS SUPPLY CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN

CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD CANNOT EASILY SERVE TO MITIGATE THE RELATIVELY HIGH-PRICE CONDITIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER DEVELOPED MARKETS BECAUSE OF LACK OF

INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSPORTING NATURAL GAS.

TO HELP ADDRESS THIS REGIONAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS, CHEVRONTEXACO

AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY ARE PLANNING INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN LONG-TERM PROJECTS IN

AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT

BY TANKER AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO REGASIFY THE PRODUCT IN MARKETS WHERE DEMAND IS STRONG AND

SUPPLIES ARE NOT AS PLENTIFUL. DUE TO THE

FS-3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SIGNIFICANCE

OF THE OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THESE LONG-TERM PROJECTS, THE NATURAL GAS SALES PRICES IN THE AREAS OF

EXCESS SUPPLY (BEFORE THE NATURAL GAS IS TRANSFERRED TO A COMPANY-OWNED OR THIRD-PARTY PROCESSING

FACILITY) ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN WELL BELOW SALES PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS THAT IS PRODUCED MUCH

NEARER TO AREAS OF HIGH DEMAND AND THAT CAN BE TRANSPORTED IN EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE

NETWORKS (AS IN THE UNITED STATES).

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES IN 2004 WAS A 5

PERCENT DECLINE IN THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, INCLUDING

VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS AND PRODUCTION UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT. THE DECREASE

WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF LOWER PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED

STATES DUE TO NORMAL FIELD DECLINES, PROPERTY SALES AND PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS RESULTING FROM

DAMAGES TO PRODUCING OPERATIONS CAUSED BY HURRICANE IVAN. INTERNATIONAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

WAS DOWN MARGINALLY BETWEEN YEARS. REFER ALSO TO PAGES FS-7 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND DETAIL OF

PRODUCTION VOLUMES WORLDWIDE.

THE LEVEL OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN FUTURE PERIODS IS UNCERTAIN, IN PART BECAUSE OF OPEC

PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL CIVIL UNREST AND CHANGING GEOPOLITICS THAT COULD

CAUSE PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN 2004, INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS AND UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE

AGREEMENT, WAS IN THE OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE

PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION LEVEL

DURING 2004 WAS NOT CONSTRAINED IN THESE AREAS BY OPEC QUOTAS, FUTURE PRODUCTION COULD BE AFFECTED

BY OPEC-IMPOSED LIMITATIONS. FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF

ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG BETWEEN INITIAL

EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. REFER TO PAGES FS-4 THROUGH FS-6 FOR DISCUSSION OF THE

COMPANYS MAJOR UPSTREAM PROJECTS.

IN CERTAIN ONSHORE AREAS OF NIGERIA, APPROXIMATELY 45,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF THE COMPANYS NET

PRODUCTION CAPACITY HAS BEEN SHUT IN SINCE MARCH 2003 BECAUSE OF CIVIL UNREST AND DAMAGE TO

PRODUCTION FACILITIES. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A PHASED PLAN TO RESTORE THESE OPERATIONS AND HAS

BEGUN PRODUCTION-RESUMPTION EFFORTS IN CERTAIN AREAS.

AS A RESULT OF HURRICANE IVAN IN SEPTEMBER

2004, PRODUCTION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WAS ABOUT 60,000 BARRELS PER DAY LOWER THAN IT OTHERWISE

WOULD HAVE BEEN. DAMAGES TO PRODUCING FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO RESTRICT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2005 BY APPROXIMATELY 35,000 BARRELS PER DAY. MOST OF THE REMAINING SHUT-IN

PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE RESTORED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005.

DOWNSTREAM

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION EARNINGS ARE CLOSELY TIED TO REGIONAL DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON INDUSTRY REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS. THE

COMPANYS CORE MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE U.S. GULF COAST, LATIN

AMERICA, ASIA AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.

SPECIFIC FACTORS INFLUENCING THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY IN THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES AND EXPENSES OF THE REFINERY NETWORK, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ANY DOWNTIME DUE TO

PLANNED AND UNPLANNED MAINTENANCE, REFINERY UPGRADE

PROJECTS AND OPERATING INCIDENTS. THE LEVEL

OF OPERATING EXPENSES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF CHARTER EXPENSES FOR THE COMPANYS

SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRYS DEMAND FOR CRUDE-OIL TANKERS. FACTORS

BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION, ESPECIALLY ENERGY COSTS TO

OPERATE THE REFINERY NETWORK.

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IMPROVED IN 2004 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF

INCREASED DEMAND AND HIGHER MARGINS FOR THE INDUSTRYS REFINED PRODUCTS IN MOST OF THE AREAS IN

WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES HAVE OPERATIONS. IN 2004, REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS IN

NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA WERE AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL IN RECENT YEARS. INDUSTRY MARGINS MAY BE

VOLATILE IN THE FUTURE, DEPENDING PRIMARILY ON PRICE MOVEMENTS FOR CRUDE OIL FEEDSTOCKS, THE DEMAND

FOR REFINED PRODUCTS, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY MAINTENANCE AND MISHAPS, AND OTHER FACTORS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS IN THE PETROCHEMICALS SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO GLOBAL CHEMICAL DEMAND,

INVENTORY LEVELS AND PLANT CAPACITIES. ADDITIONALLY, FEEDSTOCK AND FUEL COSTS, WHICH TEND TO FOLLOW

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE MOVEMENTS, INFLUENCE EARNINGS IN THIS SEGMENT.

EARNINGS IMPROVED

IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 PRIMARILY FROM THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT-OWNED CHEVRON

PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM) AFFILIATE, WHICH RECORDED HIGHER MARGINS AND SALES VOLUMES

FOR COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND HIGHER EQUITY AFFILIATE INCOME.

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

KEY OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER EVENTS DURING 2004 AND EARLY 2005 INCLUDED.

UPSTREAM

NORTH AMERICA

DURING 2004, THE COMPANY CLOSED ON THE SALE OF MORE THAN

300 PRODUCING PROPERTIES AND

OTHER ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, GENERATING PROCEEDS OF $2.5 BILLION. THESE SALES, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR

LESS THAN 10 PERCENT OF THE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND RESERVES IN NORTH AMERICA, WERE PART OF

PLANS ANNOUNCED IN 2003 TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT DID NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE TO

THE COMPANY AND TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING EFFICIENCY OF THE

COMPANYS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION PORTFOLIO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2004 OF NEARLY $3.9 BILLION WAS ABOUT $700 MILLION HIGHER THAN

IN 2003. NEARLY $400 MILLION OF THE INCREASE REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS

IN THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS FROM SPECIAL

ITEMS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. THE REMAINING $300 MILLION IMPROVEMENT WAS COMPOSED OF ABOUT A $1

BILLION BENEFIT FROM HIGHER CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES THAT WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY THE

EFFECTS OF LOWER PRODUCTION.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2003 WAS ABOUT $3.2 BILLION, UP APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION

FROM 2002. THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER PRICES BETWEEN PERIODS WAS ABOUT $1.7 BILLION AND WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF LOWER PRODUCTION.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE LIQUIDS REALIZATION IN 2004 WAS $34.12 PER BARREL, COMPARED WITH $26.66 IN

2003 AND $21.34 IN 2002. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS $5.51 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN

2004, COMPARED WITH $5.01 AND $2.89 IN 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

AVERAGED 817,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN 2004, DOWN 12 PERCENT FROM 2003 AND 19 PERCENT FROM 2002. THE

LOWER PRODUCTION IN 2004 INCLUDED THE EFFECTS OF ABOUT 30,000 BARRELS PER DAY ASSOCIATED WITH

PROPERTY SALES AND 21,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF PRODUCTION SHUT IN AS A RESULT OF DAMAGES TO

FACILITIES FROM HURRICANE IVAN IN THE THIRD QUARTER. ADJUSTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF PROPERTY SALES

AND STORMS IN ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2004 DECLINED ABOUT 7 PERCENT

FROM 2003 AND 14 PERCENT FROM 2002, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF NORMAL FIELD DECLINES THAT DO NOT

TYPICALLY REVERSE.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FOR 2004 AVERAGED 505,000

BARRELS PER DAY, A DECLINE OF 10 PERCENT FROM 2003 AND 16 PERCENT FROM 2002. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS

OF PROPERTY SALES AND STORMS, NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION IN 2004 DECLINED 5 PERCENT AND 11 PERCENT FROM

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 1.9 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN

2004, 16 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2003 AND 22 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2002. ADJUSTING FOR THE EFFECTS OF

PROPERTY SALES AND STORMS, 2004 NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION DECLINED 10 PERCENT IN 2003 AND 17

PERCENT IN 2002.

REFER TO THE SELECTED OPERATING DATA TABLE ON PAGE FS-10 FOR THE THREE-YEAR

COMPARATIVE PRODUCTION VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES.

SEGMENT INCOME IN 2004 INCLUDED SPECIAL GAINS OF $366 MILLION FROM PROPERTY SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY SPECIAL CHARGES OF $55 MILLION RESULTING FROM AN ADVERSE LITIGATION MATTER. NET SPECIAL CHARGES

OF $64 MILLION IN 2003 WERE COMPOSED OF CHARGES OF $103 MILLION FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, ASSOCIATED

MAINLY WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS IN ANTICIPATION OF SALE; CHARGES OF $38 MILLION FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION, MAINLY FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS; AND GAINS OF $77 MILLION

FROM PROPERTY SALES. SPECIAL CHARGES IN 2002 TOTALED $214 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $183 MILLION FOR

THE IMPAIRMENT OF A NUMBER OF FIELDS CAUSED BY THE WRITE-DOWN OF PROVED RESERVES AND $31 MILLION

FOR COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $5.6 BILLION IN 2004 INCREASED ABOUT $2.4 BILLION FROM 2003.

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION OF THE INCREASE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS. APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION OF THE INCREASE WAS THE RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF SPECIAL

ITEMS IN EACH PERIOD, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. ANOTHER $400 MILLION RESULTED FROM LOWER

INCOME-TAX EXPENSE BETWEEN PERIODS, INCLUDING A BENEFIT OF ABOUT $200 MILLION IN 2004 AS

A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS. OTHERWISE, THE BENEFIT OF ABOUT $200 MILLION IN LOWER

FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $3.2 BILLION IN 2003 WAS NEARLY $400 MILLION HIGHER THAN IN

2002. HIGHER CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF ABOUT $900 MILLION,

WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $400 MILLION FROM THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CHANGES AND ABOUT

$100 MILLION OF HIGHER INCOME TAX-EXPENSE.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF 1.7 MILLION BARRELS PER

DAY IN 2004  INCLUDING OTHER PRODUCED VOLUMES OF 140,000 NET BARRELS PER DAY FROM OIL SANDS AND

ASSOCIATED WITH COST-RECOVERY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN PRODUCTION-SHARING AGREEMENTS, 2004 NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION INCREASED NEARLY 3 PERCENT FROM 2003 AND 1 PERCENT FROM 2002  PRIMARILY

FROM HIGHER OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN CHAD, KAZAKHSTAN AND VENEZUELA.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION,

INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS AND UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT, DECLINED ABOUT 1 PERCENT FROM THE

THE EARNINGS IMPROVEMENT IN 2004 FROM BOTH 2003 AND 2002 WAS ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH HIGHER MARGINS

FOR REFINED PRODUCTS. MARGINS IN 2004 WERE THE HIGHEST IN RECENT YEARS. MARGINS IN 2002 WERE VERY

DEPRESSED, AND AT ONE POINT HOVERED NEAR THEIR 12-YEAR LOWS.

SALES VOLUMES FOR REFINED PRODUCTS OF APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2004 INCREASED

ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM 2003. THE INCREASE BETWEEN PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER SALES OF

GASOLINE, DIESEL FUEL AND FUEL OIL. BRANDED GASOLINE SALES VOLUMES OF 567,000 BARRELS PER DAY

INCREASED

2 PERCENT

FROM 2003. THE SALES IMPROVEMENT PARTIALLY REFLECTED THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE TEXACO BRAND IN THE SOUTHEAST.

IN 2003, SALES VOLUMES FOR REFINED PRODUCTS DECLINED ABOUT 10

PERCENT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. INDUSTRY DEMAND IN 2003 WAS WEAKER FOR BRANDED GASOLINE, DIESEL AND

JET FUELS AND SALES WERE LOWER UNDER CERTAIN SUPPLY CONTRACTS.

REFER TO THE SELECTED OPERATING

DATA TABLE ON PAGE FS-10 FOR THE THREE-YEAR COMPARATIVE REFINED-PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES IN THE

UNITED STATES.

IN 2003, NET SPECIAL CHARGES OF $123 MILLION INCLUDED $160 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL DOWNSTREAM RESTRUCTURING AND

REORGANIZATION. THESE CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON ASSET SALES. IN 2002, SPECIAL

CHARGES OF $215 MILLION INCLUDED AMOUNTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE EL

BUSINESSES, NON-U.S. MARINE OPERATIONS, NON-U.S. SUPPLY AND TRADING ACTIVITIES, AND

EQUITY EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES, PRIMARILY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

EARNINGS OF NEARLY $2 BILLION IN 2004 IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 2003 AND 2002, MAINLY THE RESULT

OF HIGHER AVERAGE MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS FOR BOTH COMPANY AND AFFILIATE OPERATIONS AND

HIGHER EARNINGS FROM INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING OPERATIONS. MARGINS IN

FS-8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2004 WERE THE HIGHEST IN RECENT YEARS. EARNINGS IN 2004 ALSO INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF $40 MILLION

RELATED TO CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS.

TOTAL INTERNATIONAL REFINED PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES WERE 2.4 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2004, MORE

THAN 4 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2.3 MILLION IN 2003 AND ABOUT 10 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2.2 MILLION IN

2002. WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DAMPENED INDUSTRY DEMAND IN 2002. REFER TO THE SELECTED OPERATING

DATA TABLE ON PAGE FS-10 FOR THE THREE-YEAR COMPARATIVE REFINED-PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES IN THE

INTERNATIONAL AREAS.

SPECIAL CHARGES OF $189 MILLION IN 2003 INCLUDED THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE BATANGAS REFINERY IN THE

PHILIPPINES IN ADVANCE OF ITS CONVERSION TO A PRODUCT TERMINAL FACILITY, EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL DOWNSTREAM RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION, THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS IN ANTICIPATION OF

ALL OTHER CONSISTS OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN DYNEGY, COAL MINING OPERATIONS, POWER GENERATION

BUSINESSES, WORLDWIDE CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT FINANCING ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES, AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

THE IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN 2003 AND 2004 WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY, INCLUDING GAINS FROM THE REDEMPTION OF CERTAIN DYNEGY SECURITIES, HIGHER INTEREST INCOME,

LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE, AND FAVORABLE CORPORATE-LEVEL TAX ADJUSTMENTS. THE NET CHANGE BETWEEN 2002

AND 2003 WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECT OF NET SPECIAL CHARGES. THE 2003

PERIOD ALSO INCLUDED LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER CORPORATE CHARGES COMPARED WITH 2002.

NET SPECIAL GAINS IN 2003 INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF $365 MILLION FROM THE EXCHANGE OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK FOR CASH AND OTHER DYNEGY SECURITIES. THIS BENEFIT WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES FOR ASSET WRITE-DOWNS OF $84 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN THE GASIFICATION

BUSINESS, WHICH WAS LATER SOLD; $40 MILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT BY

DYNEGY; AND EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS OF $16 MILLION.

SPECIAL CHARGES IN 2002 INCLUDED $2.3 BILLION

RELATED TO DYNEGY, COMPOSED OF $1.6 BILLION FOR THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND $680 MILLION FOR THE COMPANYS

SHARE OF DYNEGYS OWN SPECIAL ITEMS FOR ASSET WRITE-DOWNS AND REVALUATIONS, AND A LOSS ON AN ASSET

CATEGORIES. REFER TO THE PRECEDING SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS IN THIS SECTION FOR INFORMATION RELATING TO

SPECIAL GAINS AND CHARGES.

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES

WERE $151 BILLION IN 2004, COMPARED WITH $120 BILLION IN 2003

AND $98 BILLION IN 2002. REVENUES INCREASED IN 2004 AND 2003 PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES

INCREASED IN 2004 AND 2003, AS EARNINGS IMPROVED FOR A NUMBER

OF AFFILIATES, INCLUDING DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC AREA, TENGIZCHEVROIL, CPCHEM,

DYNEGY AND THE CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM.

OTHER INCOME

IN 2004 INCLUDED NET GAINS OF $1.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY FROM UPSTREAM PROPERTY SALES,

COMPARED WITH GAINS OF $286 MILLION AND $94 MILLION IN 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. INTEREST INCOME

INCREASED TO $199 MILLION IN 2004, COMPARED WITH ABOUT $120 MILLION IN 2003 AND 2002, AS A RESULT

OF HIGHER BALANCES OF CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES. FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES WERE $60 MILLION,

$199 MILLION AND $5 MILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS

WERE $94 BILLION IN 2004, AN INCREASE OF 32 PERCENT FROM 2003, DUE

MAINLY TO HIGHER PRICES AND INCREASED PURCHASES OF CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS. CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT

PURCHASES INCREASED ABOUT 25 PERCENT IN 2003, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES FOR

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCTS.

OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

OF $14 BILLION INCREASED FROM $13 BILLION

IN 2003. THE INCREASES IN 2004 INCLUDED COSTS FOR CHARTERING OF CRUDE OIL TANKERS AND OTHER

TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES. DURING 2003, OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

INCREASED NEARLY $1 BILLION, PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER FREIGHT RATES FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING

OPERATIONS AND HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-BENEFIT

EXPENSES.

EXPLORATION EXPENSES

WERE $697 MILLION IN 2004, $570 MILLION IN 2003 AND $591 MILLION IN 2002. IN

2004, AMOUNTS WERE HIGHER FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY FOR SEISMIC COSTS AND EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH EVALUATING THE FEASIBILITY OF DIFFERENT PROJECT ALTERNATIVES.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES

DID NOT CHANGE MATERIALLY BETWEEN YEARS AFTER

CONSIDERATION OF THE EFFECTS OF SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES.

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE

WAS $406 MILLION IN 2004, COMPARED WITH $474 MILLION IN 2003 AND $565

MILLION IN 2002. THE LOWER AMOUNT IN 2004 REFLECTED LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES. THE DECLINE

BETWEEN 2003 AND 2002 REFLECTED LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER

VARIABLE-RATE DEBT AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS.

TAXES OTHER THAN ON INCOME

WERE $19.8 BILLION, $17.9 BILLION AND $16.7 BILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN 2004 AND 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE WEAKENING U.S. DOLLAR ON

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DUTIES IN THE COMPANYS EUROPEAN DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

CORRESPONDED TO EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 37 PERCENT IN 2004, 43 PERCENT IN 2003

AND 45 PERCENT IN 2002 AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF NET SPECIAL ITEMS. REFER ALSO TO

NOTE 17 ON PAGE FS-42 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES

WERE $576 MILLION IN 2002. NO MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES WERE REPORTED IN 2004

OR 2003, REFLECTING THE COMPLETION OF MERGER INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN 2002.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY INC.

AT YEAR-END 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO OWNED AN APPROXIMATE 25 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COMMON STOCK

OF DYNEGY  AN ENERGY PROVIDER ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION, GATHERING AND PROCESSING OF NATURAL

GAS, AND THE FRACTIONATION, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS. THE

COMPANY ALSO HELD AN INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK WAS APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT WAS ABOUT $365

MILLION BELOW THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE INTEREST IN DYNEGYS UNDERLYING NET ASSETS. THIS

DIFFERENCE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF WRITE-DOWNS OF THE INVESTMENT IN 2002 FOR DECLINES IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY. THE DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC DYNEGY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE

DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE DYNEGY SHARES. THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF DYNEGYS REPORTED EARNINGS IS

ADJUSTED QUARTERLY WHEN APPROPRIATE TO RECOGNIZE A PORTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE

ALLOCATED VALUES AND DYNEGYS HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES. THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

IN DYNEGYS COMMON STOCK AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION.

INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY NOTES AND PREFERRED STOCK

AT THE BEGINNING OF 2004, THE COMPANY HELD $223

MILLION FACE VALUE OF DYNEGY JUNIOR UNSECURED SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2016 AND $400 MILLION FACE

VALUE OF DYNEGY SERIES C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WITH A STATED MATURITY OF 2033.

THE JUNIOR NOTES WERE REDEEMED AT FACE VALUE DURING 2004, AND GAINS OF $54 MILLION WERE RECORDED FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACE AMOUNTS AND THE CARRYING VALUES AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION. THE FACE

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS $400

MILLION. THE STOCK IS RECORDED AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $370 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004. FUTURE TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK WILL

BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, IF ANY FUTURE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DEEMED

TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, A CHARGE AGAINST INCOME IN THE PERIOD WOULD BE RECORDED. DIVIDENDS

RECEIVED FROM THE PREFERRED STOCK ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME EACH PERIOD.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

TOTAL BALANCES WERE $10.7 BILLION AND $5.3 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2004 WAS

$14.7 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $12.3 BILLION IN 2003 AND $9.9 BILLION IN 2002. THESE AMOUNTS WERE NET

OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS OF $1.6 BILLION, $1.4 BILLION AND $246 MILLION IN 2004,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2004 INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAINLY REFLECTED HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES. CASH PROVIDED BY

INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES OF $3.7 BILLION IN 2004, $1.1 BILLION IN

2003 AND $2.3 BILLION IN 2002.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ASSET SALES DURING 2004

WAS SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANYS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY PROGRAM, PAY $3.2 BILLION OF

DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, REDUCE TOTAL DEBT BY $1.3 BILLION, REPURCHASE $2.1 BILLION OF COMMON

STOCK, AND INCREASE THE BALANCE OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BY $5.5

BILLION.

DIVIDENDS

PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION IN 2004 AND $3 BILLION IN 2003 AND 2002 WERE MADE

FOR DIVIDENDS. IN

SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND BY 10 PERCENT TO 40 CENTS

PER SHARE, ON A POST-STOCK SPLIT BASIS.

DEBT, CAPITAL LEASE AND MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS

TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE BALANCES WERE

$11.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, DOWN FROM $12.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2003. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD

MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS OF $172 MILLION, DOWN FROM $268 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALED $5.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, DOWN FROM $6.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. OF THESE AMOUNTS, $4.7 BILLION AND $4.3 BILLION

WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END 2004,

SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2005, AS

THE COMPANY HAD THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REFINANCE ITS

COMMERCIAL PAPER, MAINTAINING LEVELS IT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE.

AT YEAR-END 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD

$4.7 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR BANKS, WHICH PERMITTED THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER

BORROWINGS AND ALSO CAN BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO

CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS,

MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE

UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT INTEREST RATES BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE

OF BASE LENDING RATES PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG

CREDIT RATING. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD THREE EXISTING EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATIONS ON FILE WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) THAT TOGETHER WOULD PERMIT ADDITIONAL REGISTERED DEBT

OFFERINGS UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $3.8 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES.

IN 2004, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM

DEBT AT MATURITY INCLUDED $500 MILLION OF 6.625 PERCENT CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION BONDS, AN

AGGREGATE $265 MILLION OF VARIOUS PHILIPPINE DEBT AND $240 MILLION OF CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION

8.11 PERCENT NOTES.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2004, $300 MILLION OF 6 PERCENT TEXACO CAPITAL INC., DUE JUNE 2005, WERE ALSO

RETIRED.

TEXACO CAPITAL LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, ISSUED DEFERRED PREFERRED SHARES, SERIES C

(SERIES C), IN DECEMBER 1995. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE COMPANY REDEEMED THE SERIES C AND ACCUMULATED

DIVIDENDS AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION.

IN JANUARY 2005, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $98

MILLION TO PERMIT THE ESOP TO MAKE A $144 MILLION DEBT SERVICE PAYMENT, WHICH INCLUDED A PRINCIPAL

PAYMENT OF $113 MILLION.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO ENTERED INTO $1 BILLION OF INTEREST RATE FIXED-TO-FLOATING

SWAP TRANSACTIONS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAP AGREEMENTS, OF WHICH $250 MILLION AND $750

MILLION TERMINATE IN SEPTEMBER 2007 AND FEBRUARY 2008, RESPECTIVELY, THE NET CASH SETTLEMENT WILL

BE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS.

CHEVRONTEXACOS SENIOR DEBT IS RATED AA BY STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND AA2 BY MOODYS

INVESTOR SERVICE, EXCEPT FOR SENIOR DEBT OF TEXACO CAPITAL INC., WHICH IS RATED AA3.

CHEVRONTEXACOS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND PRIME 1 BY MOODYS,

AND THE COMPANYS CANADIAN COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED R-1 (MIDDLE) BY DOMINION BOND RATING SERVICE.

ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY, INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE

CAPITAL-SPENDING PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. FURTHER REDUCTIONS

FROM DEBT BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENTS

CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT OF DEBT AS AN APPROPRIATE COMPONENT OF THE COMPANYS OVERALL CAPITAL

STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH

REQUIREMENTS, AND DURING PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY CHEMICALS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO

INCREASE BORROWINGS OR MODIFY CAPITAL-SPENDING PLANS OR BOTH TO CONTINUE PAYING THE COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE COMPANYS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

TENGIZCHEVROIL FUNDING

AS PART OF THE FUNDING OF THE EXPANSION OF TENGIZCHEVROILS (TCO) PRODUCTION

FACILITIES, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2004 CHEVRONTEXACO PURCHASED FROM TCO $2.2 BILLION OF 6.124

PERCENT SERIES B NOTES (SERIES B), DUE 2014. INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY, AND

PRINCIPAL IS TO BE REPAID SEMI-ANNUALLY IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2008.

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PURCHASE OF

THE SERIES B, CHEVRONTEXACO RECEIVED FROM TCO APPROXIMATELY

$1.8 BILLION, REPRESENTING A REPAYMENT OF SUBORDINATED LOANS FROM THE COMPANY, INTEREST

AND

DIVIDENDS. THE $2.2 BILLION INVESTMENT IN THE SERIES B NOTES, WHICH THE COMPANY INTENDS TO HOLD

UNTIL MATURITY, AND THE $1.8 BILLION DISTRIBUTION WERE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

TO INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM ON MARCH 31, 2004.

ACQUISITIONS OF UP TO $5 BILLION MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, AS PERMITTED

BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, AND SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER

FACTORS. THE PROGRAM IS FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO THREE YEARS AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. THE

COMPANY PURCHASED 42,324,000 SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR $2.1 BILLION THROUGH DECEMBER 2004.

PURCHASES THROUGH FEBRUARY 2005 INCREASED THE TOTAL SHARES ACQUIRED TO 47,969,000 FOR $2.4 BILLION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2004 WERE $8.3 BILLION,

INCLUDING $1.56 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE

CASH OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. IN 2003 AND 2002, EXPENDITURES WERE $7.4 BILLION AND $9.3 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF $1.1 BILLION AND $1.4

BILLION IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS. OF THE TOTAL 2004 REPORTED EXPENDITURES, $6.3 BILLION, OR 76

PERCENT, WAS FOR UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES, COMPARED WITH 77 PERCENT IN 2003 AND 68 PERCENT IN 2002.

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR 71 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM TOTAL IN 2004 AND 2003

AND 70 PERCENT IN 2002, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES.

EXPENDITURES IN 2004 INCREASED 13 PERCENT COMPARED WITH 2003, PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY HIGHER UPSTREAM EXPENDITURES. DOWNSTREAM SPENDING INCREASED 21 PERCENT FROM 2003.

EXPENDITURES WERE HIGHER IN 2002 THAN IN 2003, DUE IN PART TO LARGE LEASE ACQUISITIONS IN THE NORTH

SEA AND THE GULF OF MEXICO, SPENDING FOR THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS PROJECT IN WESTERN CANADA, AND

ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY.

INCLUDING ITS SHARE OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES 2005 CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES AT $10 BILLION, WHICH IS ABOUT 20 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2004. ABOUT $7.4 BILLION, OR 74

PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, IS TARGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $4.9 BILLION OF

THAT AMOUNT TARGETED FOR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE UPSTREAM SPENDING IS TARGETED FOR THE MOST

PROMISING EXPLORATORY PROSPECTS IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO AND WEST AFRICA AND MAJOR

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN ANGOLA, NIGERIA, KAZAKHSTAN AND THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO. INCLUDED IN

THE UPSTREAM EXPENDITURES IS ABOUT $400 MILLION TO DEVELOP THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS

RESOURCE BASE.

INVESTMENTS IN CHEMICALS BUSINESSES IN 2005 ARE BUDGETED AT $200 MILLION. ESTIMATES FOR ENERGY

TECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES, AND POWER-RELATED BUSINESSES TOTAL APPROXIMATELY

$500 MILLION.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS

IN 2004, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALED $1.6

BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION TO THE U.S. PLANS). IN 2005, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS

TO BE APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN

PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE

REQUIRED IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS. REFER

ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION OF PENSION ACCOUNTING IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-18.

FINANCIAL RATIOS

CURRENT RATIO

 CURRENT ASSETS DIVIDED BY CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE CURRENT RATIO IS ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY THE FACT THAT CHEVRONTEXACOS INVENTORIES ARE VALUED ON A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO)

BASIS. AT YEAR-END 2004, THE BOOK VALUE OF INVENTORY WAS LOWER THAN REPLACEMENT COSTS, BASED ON

AVERAGE ACQUISITION COSTS DURING THE YEAR, BY APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION.

INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO

 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE AND

AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED INTEREST, DIVIDED BY BEFORE-TAX INTEREST COSTS. THE COMPANYS INTEREST

COVERAGE RATIO WAS HIGHER IN 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BEFORE-TAX INCOME AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT

BALANCES.

DEBT RATIO

 TOTAL DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEBT PLUS EQUITY. THE DECREASE BETWEEN

THE COMPARABLE PERIODS WAS DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS AND HIGHER RETAINED EARNINGS.

FS-14.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED GUARANTEES EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF $963 MILLION FOR

NOTES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND $130 MILLION FOR

THIRD PARTIES AS DESCRIBED BY MAJOR CATEGORY BELOW. THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS BEING CARRIED AS

LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

OF THE $963 MILLION IN GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO AFFILIATES, $774 MILLION

RELATE TO BORROWINGS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THESE GUARANTEES WERE

UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE LOWER INTEREST RATES AND GENERALLY COVER THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD OF THE

CAPITAL PROJECTS. APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE BY 2009, WITH THE

REMAINING GUARANTEES EXPIRING BY THE END OF 2015. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THE GUARANTEE SHOULD AN AFFILIATE BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS,

GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE PROVISIONS, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD

AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE GUARANTEES. THE $189 MILLION BALANCE OF THE $963 MILLION REPRESENTS

OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH PRICING OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS COGENERATION

AFFILIATES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IF THE AFFILIATE DOES NOT PERFORM UNDER THE AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO

RECOURSE PROVISIONS TO THIRD PARTIES, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE PRICING

GUARANTEES.

GUARANTEES OF $130 MILLION HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING GUARANTEES OF

APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION OF CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO HOST GOVERNMENTS IN THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. THE REMAINING GUARANTEES OF $90 MILLION WERE PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY AS

CONDITIONS OF SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY TO THE GUARANTEED PARTIES AND IN CONNECTION WITH COMPANY MARKETING PROGRAMS. NO AMOUNTS

OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES. ABOUT 70 PERCENT

OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE IN 2009, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPIRING AFTER 2009. THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN OR CONTRACT TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. APPROXIMATELY $70

MILLION OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE RECOURSE PROVISIONS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO RECOVER ANY

PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES FROM SECURITIES HELD OVER THE GUARANTEED PARTIES

ASSETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO ALSO HAD OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES FOR APPROXIMATELY $215 MILLION

OF EQUILON DEBT AND LEASES. FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 2002 DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN EQUILON, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED AN INDEMNIFICATION FROM SHELL

FS-13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OIL COMPANY (SHELL) FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED A

LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES. APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE

WITHIN THE 2005 THROUGH 2009 PERIOD, WITH THE GUARANTEES OF THE REMAINING AMOUNTS EXPIRING BY 2019.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE INDEMNITIES COVER CERTAIN CONTINGENT LIABILITIES,

INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNOCAL PATENT LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

PERFORM SHOULD THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. SHOULD THAT OCCUR, THE COMPANY

COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300 MILLION. THROUGH THE END OF 2004, THE COMPANY

PAID APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION UNDER THESE CONTINGENCIES AND HAD AGREED TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $10

MILLION ADDITIONAL UNDER AN AWARD OF ARBITRATION, SUBJECT TO MINOR ADJUSTMENTS YET TO BE RESOLVED.

THE COMPANY MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES RELATED

TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIODS OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS RELATING TO EQUILON INDEMNITIES MUST BE ASSERTED EITHER AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY

2007, OR NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2009, AND CLAIMS RELATING TO MOTIVA MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN

FEBRUARY 2012. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED ANY LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER

THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE

INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS

RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA

PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

SECURITIZATION

IN OTHER

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES

(SPES). AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, REPRESENTING ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED. CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL

ESTIMATED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THESE SECURITIZATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$50 MILLION. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT OF ACCELERATING CHEVRONTEXACOS COLLECTION OF THE

SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT OF THE SPES EXPERIENCING MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF

RECEIVABLES, CHEVRONTEXACO BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATIONS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY

PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE

APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE 2005  $1.6 BILLION;

2006  $1.7 BILLION; 2007  $1.6 BILLION; 2008  $1.5 BILLION; 2009  $1.5 BILLION; 2010 AND AFTER

 $2.3 BILLION. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION IN 2004, $1.4

BILLION IN 2003 AND $1.2 BILLION IN 2002. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENT CALLS FOR

THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 55,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY

AFFILIATE REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCING OF A

REFINERY OWNED BY THE AFFILIATE AND EXPIRES IN 2009. THE FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS UNDER THIS

CONTRACT ARE: 2005  $1.2 BILLION; 2006  $1.2 BILLION; 2007  $1.3 BILLION; 2008  $1.3 BILLION;

AND 2009  $1.3 BILLION. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2004 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A 20-YEAR AGREEMENT TO

ACQUIRE REGASIFICATION CAPACITY AT THE SABINE PASS LNG TERMINAL. PAYMENTS OF $1.2 BILLION OVER THE

20-YEAR PERIOD ARE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN 2010.

MINORITY INTERESTS

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRONTEXACO IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY

OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCK PRICES. THE

COMPANY USES FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE VOLATILITY

ON A SMALL PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR

THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS; FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR COMPANY REFINERIES; CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS INVENTORIES; AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS TO SELL NATURAL GAS

AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

FS-14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEVRONTEXACO ALSO USES FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES, AND THE

RESULTS OF THIS ACTIVITY WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, NET INCOME OR CASH

FLOWS IN 2004.

THE COMPANYS POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND REPORTED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN INTERNAL RISK CONTROL

GROUP TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE

AND THE INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM EXCHANGE. IN ADDITION, CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCT

SWAP CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED

IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY

QUOTES.

EACH HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS AND CRUDE OIL WOULD INCREASE THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE NATURAL GAS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BY APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION AND REDUCE THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE CRUDE OIL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BY ABOUT $15 MILLION. THE SAME HYPOTHETICAL DECREASES

IN THE PRICES OF THESE COMMODITIES WOULD RESULT IN THE SAME OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON THE FAIR VALUES OF

THE CONTRACTS.

THE HYPOTHETICAL EFFECT ON THESE CONTRACTS WAS ESTIMATED BY CALCULATING THE CASH VALUE OF THE

CONTRACTS AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL AND CONTRACT DELIVERY PRICES MULTIPLIED BY THE

CONTRACT AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180

DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND

ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE

COMMITMENTS FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT CHANGE TO YEAR-END

EXCHANGE RATES WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO

MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE

BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY

REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS

RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

DURING 2004, FOUR NEW SWAPS

WERE INITIATED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT. AT YEAR-END 2004, THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE MATURITY OF RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS. THERE WERE

NO RECEIVE FLOATING SWAPS OUTSTANDING AT YEAR END.

A HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE OF 10 BASIS POINTS IN MARKET-FIXED INTEREST RATES WOULD REDUCE THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE RECEIVE FIXED SWAPS BY APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION.

FOR THE FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THERE WAS NOT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN

MARKET RISK FROM THAT PRESENTED IN 2003.

THE HYPOTHETICAL VARIANCES USED IN THIS SECTION WERE SELECTED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND DO

NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATION OF MARKET CHANGES. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE MARKET

CHANGES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THOSE

SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRONTEXACO ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY AND OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS.

INTERNATIONALLY, THERE ARE LONG-TERM PURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH THE COMPANYS REFINING AFFILIATE IN THAILAND. REFER TO PAGE FS-14 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOREGOING

AGREEMENTS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

NEGOTIATED WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO MORE THAN 70 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS,

THE MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE

OF MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGE OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER.

RESOLUTION OF THESE ACTIONS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN

THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE,

BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE MTBE IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THERE ARE NO DETECTABLE LEVELS OF MTBE IN THAT

GASOLINE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE,

BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, OIL FIELDS,

SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR SOLD. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE DISPLAYS THE ANNUAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS BEFORE-TAX ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

RESERVES, INCLUDING THOSE FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS. IN

2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED REMEDIATION COSTS PRIMARILY AT REFINED PRODUCTS MARKETING SITES AND VARIOUS OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED FACILITIES IN THE UNITED

STATES.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2004 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

FS-15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OF 210 SITES AT

WHICH IT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE

FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT

YEAR-END 2004 WAS $107 MILLION. THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR

JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER

REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRONTEXACO TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS

AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2004 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $940 MILLION, $712 MILLION RELATED TO MORE THAN

2,000 SITES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS

(I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), AND PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $228

MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN THE INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($111 MILLION), UPSTREAM

($69 MILLION) AND CHEMICALS ($48 MILLION). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR

DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR

GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING.

SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION

AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND

TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE RECORDED,

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY

DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN

TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD OR

WILL HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR

INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION OF ITS

WORLDWIDE OIL AND GAS AND COAL PROPERTIES AT THE END OF THEIR PRODUCTIVE LIVES, WHICH

INCLUDED

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, WERE RECOGNIZED ON A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION BASIS AS ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED FAS

143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR

VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL

OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. THE LIABILITY BALANCE FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2004 WAS $2.9

BILLION. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 25 ON PAGE FS-53 RELATED TO FAS 143.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS FACILITIES, NO

PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS REACH THE END

OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS BEEN MADE, AS

THE INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENTS ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

REFER TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ON PAGE FS-18 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS

AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED. THE U.S. FEDERAL

INCOME TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1996 FOR CHEVRONTEXACO (FORMERLY CHEVRON), 1997

FOR CHEVRONTEXACO GLOBAL ENERGY INC. (FORMERLY CALTEX), AND 1991 FOR TEXACO. CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE

TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1991 FOR CHEVRON AND THROUGH 1987 FOR TEXACO. SETTLEMENT

OF OPEN TAX YEARS, AS WELL AS TAX ISSUES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS

BUSINESSES, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR

INCOME AND FRANCHISE TAXES FOR ALL YEARS UNDER EXAMINATION OR SUBJECT TO FUTURE EXAMINATION.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

CHEVRONTEXACO AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE OPERATIONS IN APPROXIMATELY 180 COUNTRIES.

AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE UNITED

STATES, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY, DENMARK, FRANCE, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL

ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA, REPUBLIC OF CONGO, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, CHAD, SOUTH AFRICA,

INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, CHINA, THAILAND, VENEZUELA, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA,

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, AND SOUTH KOREA. THE COMPANYS CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC) AFFILIATE

OPERATES IN RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS TENGIZCHEVROIL AFFILIATE OPERATES IN KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANYS CPCHEM AFFILIATE MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF PETROCHEMICALS ON A

WORLDWIDE BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA,

SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND BELGIUM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL

ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. AS HAS

OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF

THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES ON

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR BOTH.

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN

OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED

RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF

CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY

PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINA-TION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER

WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONTEXACOS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE

AT ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE

FOUR ZONES. CHEVRONTEXACO CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT

APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. AT THE SAME TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO

CHEVRONTEXACO IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $50 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT

WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF

EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS. THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE

RESULTS OF FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITY OR DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. IF THE COMPANY DECIDES NOT TO

CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT, THE COSTS OF THESE WELLS ARE EXPENSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD

$671 MILLION OF SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AN

INCREASE OF $122 MILLION FROM 2003 AND AN INCREASE OF $193 MILLION FROM 2002. THE BALANCE AT

YEAR-END 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTS DRILLING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND NIGERIA.

THE SEC HAS

ISSUED SEVERAL COMMENT LETTERS TO COMPANIES IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING

FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS, PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE SUSPENDED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FOR

MORE THAN ONE YEAR.

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICY IN THIS REGARD IS TO CAPITALIZE THE COST OF EXPLORATORY WELLS

PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT FIND PROVED

RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE

CAPITALIZED FOR WELLS THAT FIND COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE RESERVES THAT CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, PENDING ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) DECISIONS ON ADDITIONAL MAJOR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, (2) THE RESULTS OF ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT ARE UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY

PLANNED, AND (3) SECURING FINAL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR DEVELOPMENT. OTHERWISE, WELL COSTS ARE

EXPENSED IF A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER PROVED RESERVES WERE FOUND CANNOT BE MADE WITHIN ONE YEAR

FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF DRILLING. ALL OTHER EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS ARE EXPENSED.

THIS TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED AT THE SEPTEMBER 2004 MEETING OF THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) AS

ISSUE 04-9, ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED WELL COSTS (EITF 04-9). THE DISCUSSION CENTERED ON WHETHER

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD PERMIT THE CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF THE COSTS FOR AN EXPLORATORY

WELL BEYOND ONE YEAR IN THE ABSENCE OF PLANS FOR ANOTHER EXPLORATORY WELL. THE OUTCOME OF THE

SEPTEMBER 2004 EITF MEETING WAS AGREEMENT

BETWEEN THE EITF AND THE FASB THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES

OUTLINED WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS IN FASB STATEMENT NO. 19,

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING COMPANIES

(FAS 19), AND AN AMENDMENT

OF FAS 19 WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FORMALLY ADOPT THIS VIEW. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE FASB ISSUED A

PROPOSED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) TO AMEND FAS 19. REFER TO NOTE 21 ON PAGE FS-45 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS FSP, THE SECS COMMENT LETTERS AND THE

COMPANYS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH

WELL WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS TO

WHETHER THE WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. THE EFFECT ON EXPLORATION

EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS FOR THE $671 MILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END 2004 IS UNCERTAIN,

GIVEN THE REFERENCED DELIBERATIONS BY THE SEC AND FASB, AS IS THE EFFECT ON THE NORMAL

PROJECT-EVALUATION AND FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITIES FOR ALL OF THE WELLS THAT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED.

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS

IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2005, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED COMMENT LETTERS TO CHEVRONTEXACO AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE OIL AND GAS

INDUSTRY REQUESTING DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS.

UNDER A BUY/SELL CONTRACT, A COMPANY AGREES TO BUY A SPECIFIC QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY

TO BE DELIVERED AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY AGREEING TO SELL A SPECIFIED QUANTITY

AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION TO THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. PHYSICAL DELIVERY

OCCURS FOR EACH SIDE OF THE TRANSACTION, AND THE RISK AND REWARD OF OWNERSHIP ARE EVIDENCED BY

TITLE TRANSFER, ASSUMPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK, TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULING, CREDIT RISK, AND RISK

OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. BOTH PARTIES SETTLE EACH SIDE OF THE BUY/SELL THROUGH

SEPARATE INVOICING.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY HAS BUY/SELL CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, ASSOCIATED WITH CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS. FOR CRUDE OIL, THESE

CONTRACTS ARE USED TO FACILITATE THE COMPANYS CRUDE OIL MARKETING ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDES THE

PURCHASE AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION, FULFILLMENT OF THE COMPANYS SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AS TO

PHYSICAL DELIVERY LOCATION AND CRUDE OIL SPECIFICATIONS, AND PURCHASE OF CRUDE OIL TO SUPPLY THE

COMPANYS REFINING SYSTEM. FOR REFINED PRODUCTS, BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS ARE USED TO HELP FULFILL

THE COMPANYS SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME THE SAME AS

ANY OTHER MONETARY TRANSACTION FOR WHICH TITLE PASSES, AND THE RISK AND REWARD OF OWNERSHIP ARE

ASSUMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES. AT ISSUE WITH THE SEC IS WHETHER THE INDUSTRYS ACCOUNTING FOR

BUY/SELL CONTRACTS INSTEAD SHOULD BE SHOWN NET ON THE INCOME STATEMENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 29,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONMONETARY

TRANSACTIONS

(APB 29).

THE TOPIC IS UNDER DELIBERATION BY THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) OF THE FASB AS ISSUE NO.

04-13,

ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY.

THE EITF FIRST DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE IN NOVEMBER 2004. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS BEING PERFORMED BY THE FASB

STAFF, AND THE TOPIC WILL BE DISCUSSED AGAIN AT A FUTURE EITF MEETING. WHILE THIS ISSUE IS UNDER

DELIBERATION, THE SEC STAFF DIRECTED CHEVRONTEXACO AND OTHER COMPANIES IN ITS JANUARY AND FEBRUARY

2005 COMMENT LETTERS TO DISCLOSE ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT THE AMOUNTS ASSO-

FS-17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CIATED WITH

BUY/SELL CONTRACTS AND TO DISCUSS IN A FOOTNOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE BASIS FOR THE

UNDERLYING ACCOUNTING.

WITH REGARD TO THE LATTER, THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR BUY/SELL

CONTRACTS IS BASED ON THE VIEW THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE MONETARY IN NATURE. MONETARY TRANSACTIONS

ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF APB 29. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ACCOUNTING IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE

INDICATORS OF GROSS REPORTING OF PURCHASES AND SALES IN PARAGRAPH 3 OF EITF ISSUE NO. 99-19,

REPORTING REVENUE GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT.

ADDITIONALLY, FASB INTERPRETATION

NO. 39,

OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS

(FIN 39), PROHIBITS A RECEIVABLE FROM

BEING NETTED AGAINST A PAYABLE WHEN THE RECEIVABLE IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNLESS A RIGHT OF

OFFSET EXISTS THAT IS ENFORCEABLE BY LAW. THE COMPANY ALSO VIEWS NETTING THE SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF

BUY/SELL CONTRACTS IN THE INCOME STATEMENT TO BE INCONSISTENT

WITH THE GROSS PRESENTATION THAT FIN 39 REQUIRES FOR THE RESULTING RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE ON THE

BALANCE SHEET.

THE COMPANYS BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS ARE ALSO SIMILAR TO THE BARREL BACK EXAMPLE

USED IN OTHER ACCOUNTING LITERATURE, INCLUDING EITF ISSUE NO. 03-11,

REPORTING REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 133 AND NOT HELD FOR

TRADING PURPOSES AS DEFINED IN ISSUE NO. 02-3

(WHICH INDICATES A COMPANYS DECISION TO SHOW

BUY/SELL-TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS GROSS ON THE INCOME STATEMENT AS BEING A MATTER OF JUDGMENT OF THE

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES) AND DERIVATIVES IMPLEMENTATION GROUP

(DIG) ISSUE NO. K1,

MISCELLANEOUS: DETERMINING WHETHER SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A

UNIT".

THE COMPANY FURTHER NOTES THAT THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS AS SEPARATE PURCHASES AND

SALES IS IN CONTRAST TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER TYPES OF CONTRACTS TYPICALLY DESCRIBED BY THE

INDUSTRY AS EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED NON-MONETARY IN NATURE AND APPROPRIATELY SHOWN

NET ON THE INCOME STATEMENT. UNDER AN EXCHANGE CONTRACT, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE COMPANY AGREES TO

EXCHANGE REFINED PRODUCTS IN ONE LOCATION FOR ANOTHER COMPANYS SAME QUANTITY OF REFINED PRODUCTS

IN ANOTHER LOCATION. UPON TRANSFER, THE ONLY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE INVOICED ARE FOR TRANSPORTATION

AND QUALITY DIFFERENTIALS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNLIKE BUY/SELL CONTRACTS, THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH

PARTY TO PERFORM UNDER THE CONTRACT ARE NOT INDEPENDENT AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP ARE

NOT SEPARATELY TRANSFERRED.

AS SHOWN ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004, INCLUDED $18,650 MILLION, $14,246 MILLION AND $7,963

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS. THESE REVENUE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUY/SELL

CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 12 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES IN 2004 AND 2003 AND

8 PERCENT IN 2002. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE BUY/SELL REVENUE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED IN

PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN EACH PERIOD.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRONTEXACO RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM, AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO, CUSTOMERS, TRADING

PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES, HOST GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS,

AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT

AND MAY TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE,

ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER,

MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE

EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY

OWNED FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION

MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT NON-CHEVRONTEXACO SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS

HAVE BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO

FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED

ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT

STANDARDS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE,

CHEVRONTEXACO ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2004 AT APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION

FOR ITS CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE $285 MILLION OF ENVIRONMENTAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND APPROXIMATELY $810 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION,

CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR

DIVESTED SITES AND THE ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR 2005, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $710 MILLION. THESE

CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND

THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR

EXISTING FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE TO.

PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY

WITH EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY

PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH

FS-18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFORMATION OVER DIFFERENT

REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING TO

THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND

JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO

CHANGE;

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH NOT

ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES

THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER

EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES THAT REQUIRE ... GEOLOGICAL AND

ENGINEERING DATA (THAT) DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY (RESERVES) TO BE RECOVERABLE IN

FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES

AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-63 FOR THE CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2004, AND TO TABLE VII, CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

FROM PROVED RESERVES, ON PAGE FS-68 FOR ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE VALUES FOR EACH YEAR-END

20022004, WHICH WERE BASED ON YEAR-END PRICES AT THE TIME. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE

IMPORTANT TO THE TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES ON PAGE FS-20 INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD

REVISIONS OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES. THIS

COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN THE

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO ESTIMATES, UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES

AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE FS-30. THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN

THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY

ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN EXPENSE IS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE EXPECTED LONG-

TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS

IN DETERMINING OPEB EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES USED IN THE CALCULATION OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-46, INCLUDES INFORMATION FOR

THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004, ON THE COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE AND THE

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE FUNDED STATUS FOR THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS AT THE END

OF 2004 AND 2003.

TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A

RIGOROUS PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF

EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS

FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE REGULARLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND

THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE

STUDIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON UNITED STATES PENSION PLAN ASSETS,

WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8

PERCENT SINCE 2002.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS AS

OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY

MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO

THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR PLANS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF THE

MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN

OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT

INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY CALCULATED THE U.S. PENSION OBLIGATION USING A 5.8

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED AT THE END OF 2003 AND 2002 WERE 6 PERCENT AND 6.8

PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT

RATE WOULD REDUCE PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2004 WAS $564

MILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

ASSUMPTION, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

U.S. PENSION PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY-WIDE PENSION OBLIGATION,

WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2004 BY APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION. A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE FOR

2004 BY APPROXIMATELY $115 MILLION. THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES

MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLDS FINANCIAL

MARKETS.

IN 2004, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALED $1.6 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION

TO THE U.S. PLANS). IN 2005, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION.

ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED IF

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PENSION EXPENSE IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DEPENDING UPON

THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE DIFFERENT PLANS, EITHER A LONG-TERM PREPAID ASSET OR A LONG-TERM

LIABILITY IS RECORDED. ANY UNFUNDED ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN EXCESS OF RECORDED

LIABILITIES IS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-46 FOR THE PENSION-RELATED BALANCE SHEET EFFECTS AT THE END OF 2004

AND 2003.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2004 WAS $197 MILLION AND WAS ALSO RECORDED AS

OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS OPEB OBLIGATIONS WAS 5.8 PERCENT  THE SAME DISCOUNT RATE USED FOR U.S. PENSION OBLIGATIONS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005, THE COMPANY

AMENDED ITS MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COMPANY

CONTRIBUTION. FOR CURRENT RETIREES, THE INCREASE IN COMPANY CONTRIBUTION IS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT

EACH YEAR. FOR FUTURE RETIREES, THE 4 PERCENT CAP WILL BE EFFECTIVE AT RETIREMENT. BEFORE

RETIREMENT, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES START WITH 10.6 PERCENT IN 2004 AND GRADUALLY

DROP TO 4.8 PERCENT FOR 2010 AND BEYOND. ONCE THE EMPLOYEE ELECTS TO RETIRE, THE TREND RATES ARE

CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB

EXPENSE IN 2004, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. OPEB

PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE DECREASED

OPEB EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY ASSESSES ITS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. SUCH

INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND, FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVE

QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED

FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER

ITS FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL

MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED

PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

THE AMOUNT AND INCOME STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION OF MAJOR IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004, ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMMENTARY ON THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION, AS WELL AS IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED

IN THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF

THE

COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE

CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS,

WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO

BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS WELL

AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS

CARRYING VALUE AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER

A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF

THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO

RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY

IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS

IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD AND THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY

ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES THAT NO

WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD OR

CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET

REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY

PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE

ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED

OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A

DECISION WAS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS, THAT IS, THE ASSET IS HELD FOR SALE AND THE ESTIMATED

PROCEEDS LESS COSTS TO SELL WERE LESS THAN THE ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR

CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY

FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON

CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION;

THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION; AND

IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES IF MANAGEMENT

DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECORDS THESE LOSSES

AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME. REFER TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN

NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE FS-32 FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE

THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED

IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT MUST

BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATIONS ACT OF 2004 (THE

ACT) WAS PASSED INTO LAW. THE ACT PROVIDES DEDUCTION FROM INCOME FOR QUALIFIED DOMESTIC REFINING

AND UPSTREAM PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL BE PHASED IN FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010. FOR THAT

SPECIFIC CATEGORY OF INCOME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NET EFFECT OF THIS PROVISION OF THE ACT TO

RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE FEDERAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2005 AND 2006 TO APPROXIMATELY 34

PERCENT, BASED ON CURRENT EARNINGS LEVELS. IN THE LONG TERM, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE NEW

DEDUCTION WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE OF THE FEDERAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO ABOUT 32 PERCENT FOR THAT

CATEGORY OF INCOME, BASED ON CURRENT EARNINGS LEVELS.

UNDER THE GUIDANCE IN FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 109-1,

APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, TO THE TAX DEDUCTION ON QUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PROVIDED BY

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004,

THE TAX DEDUCTION ON QUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES

PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 WILL BE TREATED AS A SPECIAL DEDUCTION, AS

DESCRIBED IN FAS 109. AS SUCH, THE SPECIAL DEDUCTION HAS NO EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THE ENACTMENT DATE. RATHER, THE IMPACT OF THIS DEDUCTION WILL BE REPORTED

IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DEDUCTION IS CLAIMED ON THE COMPANYS TAX RETURN.

THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES AT A SPECIAL REDUCED TAX RATE THAT CAN BE AS LOW AS 5.25 PERCENT. IN EARLY 2005, THE COMPANY

WAS IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE GUIDANCE THAT THE IRS ISSUED ON JANUARY 13, 2005, REGARDING

THIS PROVISION AND ALSO CONSIDERING OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A

MAJOR CHANGE IN ITS PLANS FOR REPATRIATING EARNINGS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF THE ACT.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES

(FIN 46)

IN

JANUARY 2003, FIN 46 WAS ISSUED, AND ESTABLISHED STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES A VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED BY ITS PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

FIN 46 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURES

ABOUT VIES THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE BUT IN

WHICH IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST. IN DECEMBER 2003,

THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46-R,

WHICH NOT ONLY INCLUDES AMENDMENTS TO FIN 46, BUT ALSO REQUIRES APPLICATION OF THE INTERPRETATION

TO ALL AFFECTED ENTITIES NO LATER THAN MARCH 31, 2004, FOR CALENDAR YEAR-REPORTING COMPANIES. PRIOR

TO THIS REQUIREMENT, COMPANIES WERE REQUIRED TO APPLY THE INTERPRETATION TO SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITIES BY DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE FULL ADOPTION OF THE INTERPRETATION AS OF MARCH 31, 2004,

INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT RELATING TO SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 106-2, ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003,

(FSP FAS 106-2)

IN DECEMBER 2003,

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE ACT) BECAME LAW.

THE ACT INTRODUCED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE, AS WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO

SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTH CARE PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY

EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE

PART D. IN MAY 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 106-2. ONE U.S. SUBSIDIARY WAS DEEMED AT LEAST

ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT AND ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY. THE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND THE ASSOCIATED ANNUAL EXPENSE WAS

DE MINIMIS.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 151, INVENTORY COSTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43, CHAPTER 4,

(FAS 151)

IN

NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 151 WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THE

STANDARD AMENDS THE GUIDANCE IN ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 43, CHAPTER 4, INVENTORY

PRICING, TO CLARIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR ABNORMAL AMOUNTS OF IDLE FACILITY EXPENSE, FREIGHT,

HANDLING COSTS AND SPOILAGE. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALLOCATION OF FIXED

PRODUCTION OVERHEADS TO THE COSTS OF CONVERSION BE BASED ON THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF THE PRODUCTION

FACILITIES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 123R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R)

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS

123R, WHICH REQUIRES THAT COMPENSATION COST RELATING TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ACCOUNTS FOR THOSE PAYMENTS UNDER THE

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES,

AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS. THE COMPANY IS PREPARING

TO IMPLEMENT THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005. ALTHOUGH THE TRANSITION METHOD TO BE USED TO

ADOPT THE STANDARD HAS NOT BEEN SELECTED, THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MINIMAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY. REFER TO NOTE 1,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-30, FOR THE COMPANYS CALCULATION OF THE PRO FORMA IMPACT ON NET INCOME OF FAS

123, WHICH WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THAT UNDER FAS 123R.

FASB

STATEMENT NO. 153, EXCHANGES OF NONMONETARY ASSETS 

AN AMENDMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 29

(FAS 153)

IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 153, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY FOR ASSET-EXCHANGE

TRANSACTIONS BEGINNING JULY 1, 2005. UNDER APB NO. 29, ASSETS RECEIVED IN CERTAIN TYPES OF

NONMONETARY EXCHANGES WERE PERMITTED TO BE RECORDED AT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS THAT WERE

EXCHANGED (I.E., RECORDED ON A CARRYOVER BASIS). AS AMENDED BY FAS 153, ASSETS RECEIVED IN SOME

CIRCUMSTANCES WILL HAVE TO BE RECORDED INSTEAD AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. IN THE PAST, CHEVRONTEXACO HAS

NOT ENGAGED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF NONMONETARY ASSET EXCHANGES FOR SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF

THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A) (2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR

AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO

OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL

MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL

 INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS

OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED

STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I)

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 25 ON PAGE FS-53 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003.

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

CHEVRONTEXACO MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND

MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED

PETROLEUM, CHEMICALS AND COAL MINING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CHEVRONTEXACO HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN

THE POWER GENERATION BUSINESS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE COMPANIES CONDUCT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN MORE

THAN 180 COUNTRIES. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR,

DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND ALSO MARKETING NATURAL GAS. REFINING,

MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM;

AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR

EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY

PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND DISCLOSURE

OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES SUBJECT THE

COMPANY TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT

IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS

ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OWNED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH

THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURES AND

CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO

AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO

50 PERCENT OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY

DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY

CURRENTLY IN INCOME. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR THESE GAINS AND LOSSES.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND THE

AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A

DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF

THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND

INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN

THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT

CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF

OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE

ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANYS

ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE

AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY WHEN APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED

TO MANAGE THE PRICE RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY,

GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT

TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN

CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES, GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. INTEREST RATE SWAPS  HEDGING A PORTION

OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT  ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE

SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE IN

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES. SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET, WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST, USING A

LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET. MATERIALS,

SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED

PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED

PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ARE ALSO CAPITALIZED FOR WELLS THAT FIND COMMERCIALLY

PRODUCIBLE RESERVES THAT CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED, PENDING

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED

ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) DECISIONS ON ADDITIONAL MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, (2) THE

RESULTS OF ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT ARE UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED, AND (3) SECURING

FINAL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR DEVELOPMENT. OTHERWISE, WELL COSTS ARE EXPENSED IF A DETERMINATION

AS TO WHETHER PROVED RESERVES WERE FOUND CANNOT BE MADE WITHIN ONE YEAR FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF

DRILLING. ALL OTHER EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE 21 ON PAGE FS-45 FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, ARE

ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR

A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN

INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION

OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. GLOBALLY IN THE REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND CHEMICAL

AREAS, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE GENERALLY DONE ON A REFINERY, PLANT, MARKETING AREA OR MARKETING

ASSETS BY COUNTRY BASIS. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION

AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE

EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE

LOWER VALUE.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT

NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143),

IN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A

LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS

A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 25 ON PAGE FS-53 RELATING TO ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS,

WHICH INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FAS 143. PREVIOUSLY, FOR CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND COAL PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A PROVISION WAS MADE THROUGH DEPRECIATION EXPENSE

FOR ANTICIPATED ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION COSTS AT THE END OF THE PROPERTYS USEFUL LIFE.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING

PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY

INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR CAPITALIZED

COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL

FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF

CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR COAL ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD AS THE PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE DECLINING-BALANCE

METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED

LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES, AND FROM SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE, REPAIRS AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS OR TO

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR

CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR

CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND

CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE

REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR OIL, GAS AND COAL PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A LIABILITY

FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS MADE, FOLLOWING FAS 143. REFER TO PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT IN THIS NOTE FOR A DISCUSSION OF FAS 143.

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY

FOR ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER PARTIES

ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE

COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE COMPANYS OWN

INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR REIMBURSEMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL, PETROLEUM AND

CHEMICALS PRODUCTS AND ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, NET OF

ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FROM

PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRONTEXACO HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON

THE BASIS OF THE COMPANYS NET WORKING INTEREST (ENTITLEMENT METHOD). REFER TO NOTE 16 ON PAGE

FS-41 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

NET INCOME FOR EACH PERIOD PRESENTED INCLUDES AMOUNTS CATEGORIZED BY THE COMPANY AS SPECIAL

ITEMS, TO ASSIST IN THE EXPLANATION OF THE TREND OF RESULTS.

LISTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE ARE CATEGORIES OF THESE ITEMS AND THEIR NET INCREASE (DECREASE) TO

NET INCOME, AFTER RELATED TAX EFFECTS.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED SPECIAL GAINS OF $1,217 FROM THE SALE OF NONSTRATEGIC CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS ASSETS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, AND A SPECIAL CHARGE OF $55 FOR A

LITIGATION MATTER.

IN 2003, IMPAIRMENTS OF $103 AND $30, RESPECTIVELY, WERE RECORDED FOR VARIOUS U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL OIL AND GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES, REFLECTING LOWER EXPECTED RECOVERY OF PROVED

RESERVES OR A WRITE-DOWN TO MARKET VALUE FOR ASSETS IN ANTICIPATION OF SALE. IMPAIRMENTS OF $123 ON

DOWNSTREAM ASSETS WERE FOR

THE CONVERSION OF A REFINERY TO A PRODUCTS TERMINAL AND A WRITE-DOWN TO

MARKET VALUE FOR ASSETS IN ANTICIPATION OF SALE. ALSO IN 2003, CHEVRONTEXACO EXCHANGED ITS DYNEGY

SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK FOR CASH, NOTES AND SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK. THE $365 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ITEMS AND THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE WAS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED WRITE-DOWNS OF $1,626 OF ITS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON AND

PREFERRED STOCK AND $136 OF ITS INVESTMENT IN ITS PUBLICLY TRADED CALTEX AUSTRALIA AFFILIATE TO

THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE REQUIRED BECAUSE THE DECLINES IN THE

FAIR VALUES OF THE INVESTMENTS BELOW THEIR CARRYING VALUES WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY.

REFER TO NOTE 14 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-39 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY AND CALTEX AUSTRALIA.

ALSO IN 2002, IMPAIRMENTS OF $183 WERE RECORDED FOR VARIOUS U.S. EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

PROPERTIES AND $100 FOR INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRONTEXACO IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO PRICE

VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCK.

THE COMPANY USES FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THIS EXPOSURE ON A SMALL

PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING: FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE

OR SALE OF CRUDE OIL; FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR COMPANY REFINERIES; CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS

INVENTORIES; AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS TO SELL NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS. THE COMPANY

ALSO USES FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A POLICY OF REQUIRING THAT AN INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION

AGREEMENT GOVERN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK.

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO

BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION WITH

THE SAME COUNTERPARTY AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY,

THE NET MARKED-TO-MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES

WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND A REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RISK. IT IS THE COMPANYS

POLICY TO USE OTHER NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES  NET, AND DEFERRED

CREDITS AND OTHER NONCURRENT OBLIGATIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED AS EITHER SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES OR PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND

PRODUCTS, WHEREAS TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE

REPORTED UNDER OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS OF 180

DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND

ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE

COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED AS OTHER

INCOME. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED UNDER OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO

MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE

BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY

REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS

RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE

SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

DURING 2004, FOUR NEW SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT WERE INITIATED.

AT YEAR-END 2004, THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS OUTSTANDING RELATED TO FIXED-RATE DEBT, AND THEIR

WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED DIRECTLY IN INCOME AS

PART OF INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED UNDER OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED EITHER FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR, IF NOT AVAILABLE, THE

PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SETTLED AT YEAR-END.

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $5,815 AND $7,229 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $6,444 AND $7,709 AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF $1,665 AND $665 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES OF $36 AND $65 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND U.S. DOLLAR MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN DOMESTIC AND OFFSHORE

PORTFOLIOS. EURODOLLAR BONDS, FLOATING-RATE NOTES, TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE THE

PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS HELD. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD FAIR VALUES OF $8,789 AND

$3,803 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE BALANCES, $7,338 AND $2,803 AT THE

RESPECTIVE YEAR-ENDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES UNDER 90 DAYS.

THE REMAINDER, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES, HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY 2.3

YEARS.

FOR THE FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THERE WAS NOT A MATERIAL CHANGE IN

MARKET RISK FROM THAT PRESENTED IN 2003.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RIS

K

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE

PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED

INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

RISK. SIMILAR STANDARDS OF DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE

DISPERSED AMONG THE COMPANYS

BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE

COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF

A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE THE PRINCIPAL SECURITY OBTAINED TO

SUPPORT LINES OF CREDIT.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY NOTES AND PREFERRED STOCK

AT THE BEGINNING OF 2004, THE COMPANY HELD

INVESTMENTS IN $223 FACE VALUE OF DYNEGY JUNIOR UNSECURED SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2016 AND $400 FACE

VALUE OF DYNEGY SERIES C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WITH A

STATED MATURITY DATE OF 2033.

THE

JUNIOR NOTES WERE REDEEMED AT FACE VALUE DURING 2004, AND GAINS OF $54 WERE RECORDED FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FACE AMOUNTS AND THE CARRYING VALUES AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION. THE FACE

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS $400.

THE STOCK IS RECORDED AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $370 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

FUTURE TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK WILL BE REPORTED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, IF ANY FUTURE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY, A CHARGE AGAINST INCOME IN THE PERIOD WOULD BE RECORDED. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON THE

PREFERRED STOCK ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME EACH PERIOD.

NOTE 9.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ALTHOUGH EACH SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRONTEXACO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN AFFAIRS, CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. FOR THIS PURPOSE,

THE INVESTMENTS ARE GROUPED AS FOLLOWS: UPSTREAM  EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION; DOWNSTREAM 

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION; CHEMICALS; AND ALL OTHER. THE FIRST THREE OF THESE

GROUPINGS REPRESENT THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND OPERATING SEGMENTS AS DEFINED IN FAS

131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION.

THE SEGMENTS ARE SEPARATELY MANAGED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES UNDER A STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES

SEGMENT MANAGERS WHO REPORT TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) (TERMS AS

DEFINED IN FAS 131). THE CODM IS THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, A COMMITTEE OF SENIOR OFFICERS

THAT INCLUDES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THAT IN TURN REPORTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION.

THE OPERATING SEGMENTS REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN FAS 131 TERMS THAT

ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES (A) FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE

OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM, WHICH MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE

ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS, AND TO ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL

INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT MANAGERS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO AND MAINTAIN REGULAR

CONTACT WITH THE COMPANYS CODM TO DISCUSS THE SEGMENTS OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. THE CODM APPROVES ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS AT THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT

LEVEL AND ALSO APPROVES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY FUNDING FOR MAJOR PROJECTS AND MAJOR CHANGES TO THE

ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS. HOWEVER, BUSINESS-UNIT MANAGERS WITHIN THE OPERATING

SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ALL

OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH DAILY OPERATIONS. COMPANY OFFICERS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE

COMMITTEE ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND PARTICIPATE IN OTHER COMMITTEES FOR

PURPOSES OTHER THAN ACTING AS THE CODM.

ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN DYNEGY, COAL MINING OPERATIONS, POWER

GENERATION BUSINESSES, WORLDWIDE CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT FINANCING ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE

ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY COUNTRY OF OPERATION IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ITS COUNTRY OF

DOMICILE. OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED AS INTERNATIONAL (OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES).

SEGMENT EARNINGS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ON AN AFTER-TAX

BASIS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF DEBT FINANCING INTEREST EXPENSE OR INVESTMENT INTEREST

INCOME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE COMPANY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS AND ASSETS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE

BILLED FOR THE DIRECT USE OF CORPORATE SERVICES. NONBILLABLE COSTS REMAIN AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL IN

ALL OTHER. MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES IN 2002 WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN ALL OTHER. AFTER-TAX SEGMENT

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE.

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO MORE THAN 70 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE

NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED

GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGE OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER. RESOLUTION OF THESE ACTIONS MAY

ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF

PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO

THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY

DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE MTBE

IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THERE ARE NO DETECTABLE LEVELS OF MTBE IN

THAT GASOLINE.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK WAS APPROXIMATELY $150. THIS AMOUNT WAS ABOUT $365 BELOW THE

THE RESULT OF WRITE-DOWNS OF THE INVESTMENT IN 2002 FOR DECLINES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON

SHARES BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THIS

DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC DYNEGY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF

THE DYNEGY SHARES. THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF DYNEGYS REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY

WHEN APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND DYNEGYS HISTORICAL

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS

IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2005, THE SEC ISSUED COMMENT LETTERS TO CHEVRONTEXACO AND OTHER

COMPANIES IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY REQUESTING DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS. UNDER A BUY/SELL CONTRACT, A COMPANY AGREES TO BUY A SPECIFIC

QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY TO BE DELIVERED AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY

AGREEING TO SELL A SPECIFIED QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION TO THE

SAME COUNTERPARTY. PHYSICAL DELIVERY OCCURS FOR EACH SIDE OF THE TRANSACTION, AND THE RISK AND

REWARD OF OWNERSHIP ARE EVIDENCED BY TITLE TRANSFER, ASSUMPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK,

TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULING, CREDIT RISK, AND RISK OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. BOTH

PARTIES SETTLE EACH SIDE OF THE BUY/SELL THROUGH SEPARATE INVOICING.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY HAS BUY/SELL CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS, ASSOCIATED WITH CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS. FOR CRUDE OIL, THESE CONTRACTS ARE USED

TO FACILITATE THE COMPANYS CRUDE OIL MARKETING ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDES THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF

CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION, FULFILLMENT OF THE COMPANYS SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AS TO PHYSICAL DELIVERY

LOCATION AND CRUDE OIL SPECIFICATIONS, AND PURCHASE OF CRUDE OIL TO SUPPLY THE COMPANYS REFINING

SYSTEM. FOR REFINED PRODUCTS,

BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS ARE USED TO HELP FULFILL THE COMPANYS

SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME THE

SAME AS ANY OTHER MONETARY TRANSACTION FOR WHICH TITLE PASSES, AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF

OWNERSHIP ARE ASSUMED BY THE COUNTERPARTIES. AT ISSUE WITH THE SEC IS WHETHER THE INDUSTRYS

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS INSTEAD SHOULD BE SHOWN NET ON THE INCOME STATEMENT AND ACCOUNTED

FOR UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 29,

ACCOUNTING FOR

NONMONETARY TRANSACTIONS

(APB 29).

THE TOPIC IS UNDER DELIBERATION BY THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) OF THE FASB AS ISSUE

NO. 04-13,

ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY.

THE EITF

FIRST DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE IN NOVEMBER 2004. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS BEING PERFORMED BY THE FASB

STAFF, AND THE TOPIC WILL BE DISCUSSED AGAIN AT A FUTURE EITF MEETING. WHILE THIS ISSUE IS UNDER

DELIBERATION, THE SEC STAFF DIRECTED CHEVRONTEXACO AND OTHER COMPANIES IN ITS JANUARY AND FEBRUARY

2005 COMMENT LETTERS TO DISCLOSE ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT THE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH

BUY/SELL CONTRACTS AND TO DISCUSS IN A FOOTNOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE BASIS FOR THE

UNDERLYING ACCOUNTING.

WITH REGARD TO THE LATTER, THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR BUY/SELL

CONTRACTS IS BASED ON THE VIEW THAT SUCH

FS-41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

4

NOTE 16.

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS  CONTINUED

TRANSACTIONS ARE MONETARY IN NATURE. MONETARY TRANSACTIONS ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF APB 29. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ACCOUNTING IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE INDICATORS OF GROSS REPORTING OF PURCHASES

AND SALES IN PARAGRAPH 3 OF EITF ISSUE NO. 99-19,

REPORTING REVENUE GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS

NET AS AN AGENT.

ADDITIONALLY, FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 39,

OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO

CERTAIN CONTRACTS

(FIN 39), PROHIBITS A RECEIVABLE FROM BEING NETTED AGAINST A PAYABLE WHEN THE

RECEIVABLE IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK UNLESS A RIGHT OF OFFSET EXISTS THAT IS ENFORCEABLE BY LAW.

THE COMPANY ALSO VIEWS NETTING THE SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF BUY/SELL CONTRACTS IN THE INCOME

STATEMENT TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE GROSS PRESENTATION THAT FIN 39 REQUIRES FOR THE RESULTING

RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

THE COMPANYS BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS ARE ALSO SIMILAR

TO THE BARREL BACK EXAMPLE USED IN OTHER ACCOUNTING LITERATURE, INCLUDING EITF ISSUE NO. 03-11,

REPORTING REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FASB STATEMENT

NO. 133 AND NOT HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES AS DEFINED IN ISSUE NO. 02-3

(WHICH INDICATES A

COMPANYS DECISION TO SHOW BUY/SELL-TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS GROSS ON THE INCOME STATEMENT AS BEING A

MATTER OF JUDGMENT OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES) AND

DERIVATIVES IMPLEMENTATION GROUP (DIG) ISSUE NO. K1,

MISCELLANEOUS: DETERMINING WHETHER SEPARATE

TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A UNIT.

THE COMPANY FURTHER NOTES THAT THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS AS SEPARATE PURCHASES AND

SALES IS IN CONTRAST TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER TYPES OF CONTRACTS TYPICALLY DESCRIBED BY THE

INDUSTRY AS EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED NON-MONETARY IN NATURE AND APPROPRIATELY SHOWN

NET ON THE INCOME STATEMENT. UNDER AN EXCHANGE CONTRACT, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE COMPANY AGREES TO

EXCHANGE REFINED PRODUCTS IN ONE LOCATION FOR ANOTHER COMPANYS SAME QUANTITY OF REFINED PRODUCTS

IN ANOTHER LOCATION. UPON TRANSFER, THE ONLY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE INVOICED ARE FOR TRANSPORTATION

AND QUALITY DIFFERENTIALS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNLIKE BUY/SELL CONTRACTS, THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH

PARTY TO PERFORM UNDER THE

CONTRACT ARE NOT INDEPENDENT AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP ARE NOT SEPARATELY

TRANSFERRED.

AS SHOWN ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004, INCLUDED $18,650, $14,246 AND $7,963,

RESPECTIVELY, FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE BUY/SELL REVENUE AMOUNTS ARE

INCLUDED IN PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN EACH

PERIOD.

EXIST IN MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WHEREAS SOME OF THESE TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS DO NOT HAVE AN

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY FOR SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE U.S. CONSOLIDATED TAX

RETURN TO RECORD INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS THOUGH THEY FILE SEPARATELY, WITH THE PARENT RECORDING THE

ADJUSTMENT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE EFFECTS OF CONSOLIDATION.

INCOME TAXES ARE NOT ACCRUED FOR UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS THAT HAVE

BEEN OR ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES FOR WHICH NO

DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE REMITTANCES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$10,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS EARNINGS REINVESTED

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS ONGOING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE

AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT MIGHT BE PAYABLE ON THE EVENTUAL REMITTANCE OF SUCH EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT

ANTICIPATE INCURRING ADDITIONAL TAXES ON REMITTANCES OF EARNINGS THAT ARE NOT INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 WAS

PASSED INTO LAW. THE ACT PROVIDES A DEDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM QUALIFIED DOMESTIC REFINING AND

UPSTREAM PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL BE PHASED IN FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010. FOR THAT SPECIFIC

CATEGORY OF INCOME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NET EFFECT OF THIS PROVISION OF THE ACT TO RESULT IN A

DECREASE IN THE FEDERAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2005 AND 2006 TO APPROXIMATELY 34 PERCENT, BASED ON

CURRENT EARNINGS LEVELS. IN THE LONG TERM, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE NEW DEDUCTION WILL RESULT

IN A DECREASE OF THE FEDERAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO ABOUT 32 PERCENT FOR THAT CATEGORY OF INCOME,

BASED ON CURRENT EARNINGS

LEVELS.

UNDER THE GUIDANCE IN FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 109-1,

APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO.

109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, TO THE TAX DEDUCTION ON QUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES

PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004,

THE TAX DEDUCTION ON QUALIFIED PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 WILL BE TREATED AS A SPECIAL

DEDUCTION, AS DESCRIBED IN FAS 109. AS SUCH, THE SPECIAL DEDUCTION HAS NO EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THE ENACTMENT DATE. RATHER, THE IMPACT OF THIS DEDUCTION WILL BE

REPORTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DEDUCTION IS CLAIMED ON THE COMPANYS TAX RETURN.

THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES AT A SPECIAL REDUCED TAX RATE THAT CAN BE AS LOW AS 5.25 PERCENT. IN EARLY 2005, THE COMPANY

WAS IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE GUIDANCE THAT THE IRS ISSUED ON JANUARY 13, 2005, REGARDING

THIS PROVISION AND ALSO CONSIDERING OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A

MAJOR CHANGE IN ITS PLANS FOR REPATRIATING EARNINGS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF THE ACT.

SEE NOTE 8 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-35 FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANYS DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD $4,735 OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH BANKS

WORLDWIDE, WHICH PERMIT THE COMPANY TO REFINANCE SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE

FACILITIES SUPPORT THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. INTEREST ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE

TERMS OF SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS MAY BE BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR BANK PRIME RATE.

NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE CREDIT AGREEMENTS DURING 2004 OR AT YEAR-END.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED $4,735 AND $4,285, RESPECTIVELY, OF

SHORT-TERM DEBT AS LONG-TERM. SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF

WORKING CAPITAL IN 2005, AS THE COMPANY HAS BOTH THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE THIS DEBT

ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46)

FIN 46 WAS

ISSUED IN JANUARY 2003 AND ESTABLISHED STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES A

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED BY ITS PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FIN 46 ALSO

REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT VIES THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE BUT IN WHICH IT HAS

A SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46-R, WHICH NOT ONLY

INCLUDED AMENDMENTS TO FIN 46, BUT ALSO REQUIRED APPLICATION OF THE INTERPRETATION TO ALL AFFECTED

ENTITIES NO LATER THAN MARCH 31, 2004, FOR CALENDAR YEAR- REPORTING COMPANIES. PRIOR TO THIS

REQUIREMENT, COMPANIES WERE REQUIRED TO APPLY THE INTERPRETATION TO SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES BY

DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE FULL ADOPTION OF THE INTERPRETATION AS OF MARCH 31, 2004, INCLUDING THE

REQUIREMENT RELATING TO SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES, DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 106-2, ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(FSP FAS 106-2).

IN DECEMBER 2003,

ACT

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  CONTINUED

INTRODUCED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE, AS WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF

RETIREE HEALTH CARE PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO

MEDICARE PART D. IN MAY 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FSP FAS 106-2. ONE U.S. SUBSIDIARY WAS DEEMED AT

LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT AND ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY. THE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND THE ASSOCIATED ANNUAL EXPENSE WAS

DE MINIMIS.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 151, INVENTORY COSTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43, CHAPTER 4

(FAS 151)

IN

NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 151 WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THE

STANDARD AMENDS THE GUIDANCE IN ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 43, CHAPTER 4,

INVENTORY

PRICING,

TO CLARIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR ABNORMAL AMOUNTS OF IDLE FACILITY EXPENSE, FREIGHT,

HANDLING COSTS AND SPOILAGE. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALLOCATION OF FIXED

PRODUCTION OVERHEADS TO THE COSTS OF CONVERSION BE BASED ON THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF THE PRODUCTION

FACILITIES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 123R, SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(FAS 123R)

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS

123R, WHICH REQUIRES THAT COMPENSATION COSTS RELATING TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ACCOUNTS FOR THOSE PAYMENTS UNDER THE

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES,

AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS. THE COMPANY IS PREPARING

TO IMPLEMENT THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005. ALTHOUGH THE TRANSITION METHOD TO BE USED TO

ADOPT THE STANDARD HAS NOT BEEN SELECTED, THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MINIMAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY. REFER TO NOTE 1,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-30, FOR THE COMPANYS CALCULATION OF THE PRO FORMA IMPACT ON NET INCOME OF FAS

123, WHICH WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THAT UNDER FAS 123R.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 153, EXCHANGES OF NONMONETARY ASSETS,  AN AMENDMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 29,

(FAS 153)

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 153, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY FOR

ASSET-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS BEGINNING JULY 1, 2005. UNDER APB 29, ASSETS RECEIVED IN CERTAIN TYPES

OF NONMONETARY EXCHANGES WERE PERMITTED TO BE RECORDED AT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS THAT

WERE EXCHANGED (I.E., RECORDED ON A CARRYOVER BASIS). AS AMENDED BY FAS 153, ASSETS RECEIVED IN

SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL HAVE TO BE RECORDED INSTEAD AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. IN THE PAST,

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS NOT ENGAGED IN A LARGE NUMBER OF NONMON-ETARY ASSET EXCHANGES FOR SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNTS.

NOTE 21.

ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS

REFER TO NOTE 1 ON PAGE FS-30 IN THE SECTION PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR THE COST OF EXPLORATORY WELLS. THE COMPANYS SUSPENDED WELLS

ARE REVIEWED IN THIS CONTEXT ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS.

THE SEC ISSUED COMMENT LETTERS DURING 2004 AND IN FEBRUARY 2005 TO A NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN

THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS, PARTICULARLY

FOR THOSE SUSPENDED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FOR MORE

THAN ONE YEAR. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE FASB

ISSUED A PROPOSED FSP TO AMEND FAS 19,

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

COMPANIES.

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE DRAFT FSP, EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WOULD CONTINUE TO BE

CAPITALIZED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF DRILLING WHEN (A) THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF

RESERVES TO JUSTIFY COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND (B) THE ENTERPRISE IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. IF EITHER

CONDITION IS NOT MET OR IF AN ENTERPRISE OBTAINS INFORMATION THAT RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT

THE ECONOMIC OR OPERATIONAL VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT, THE EXPLORATORY WELL WOULD BE ASSUMED TO BE

IMPAIRED, AND ITS COSTS, NET OF ANY SALVAGE VALUE, WOULD BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. THE FSP PROVIDED A

NUMBER OF INDICATORS NEEDING TO BE PRESENT TO DEMONSTRATE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE IN

ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT.

THE COMPANY WILL MONITOR THE CONTINUING DELIBERATIONS OF THE FASB ON THIS MATTER AND THE

POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS, IF ANY, TO THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICY AND THE AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED FOR

SUSPENDED-WELL COSTS. THE DISCLOSURES AND DISCUSSION BELOW ADDRESS THOSE SUGGESTED IN THE DRAFT FSP

AND IN THE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SEC IN ITS FEBRUARY 2005 COMMENT LETTER TO COMPANIES

IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY.

OF THE $290, APPROXIMATELY $50 RELATED TO THE WELL COSTS SUSPENDED ONE YEAR OR LESS SINCE

DRILLING WAS COMPLETED, AND $240 RELATED TO COSTS SUSPENDED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR SINCE THE

COMPLETION OF DRILLING. OF THE $240 FOR 11 PROJECTS SUSPENDED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR SINCE THE

COMPLETION OF DRILLING, ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE PROJECTS

ECONOMIC VIABILITY INCLUDED: (A) $75  DISCUSSIONS OF JOINT DEVELOPMENT WITH AN OPERATOR IN AN

ADJACENT FIELD AND SELECTION OF SUBSURFACE AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS, WITH FRONT-END-ENGINEERING AND

DESIGN (FEED) EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN 2005 (ONE PROJECT); (B) $63  NEGOTIATIONS WITH CONTRACTORS FOR

FEED AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS FOR NATURAL GAS (TWO PROJECTS); (C) $42  AWARD OF

CONTRACTS FOR FEED AND FINALIZATION OF FISCAL ISSUES WITH THE HOST COUNTRY (ONE PROJECT); (D) $20

- FINALIZATION OF COMMERCIAL TERMS WITH PARTNERS WITH AWARD OF DETAILED ENGINEERING AND DESIGN

CONTRACTS EXPECTED BY THE END OF 2005 (ONE PROJECT); AND (E) $40  MISCELLANEOUS ACTIVITIES FOR

PROJECTS WITH SMALLER AMOUNTS SUSPENDED. PROGRESS IS BEING MADE ON ALL PROJECTS IN THIS CATEGORY;

AND THE DECISION ON THE RECOGNITION OF PROVED RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES IN SOME CASES MAY NOT OCCUR

FOR SEVERAL YEARS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY, SCALE AND NEGOTIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE PROJECTS.

INCLUDED IN THE $449 IN THE TABLE ON THE PRECEDING PAGE FOR YEAR-END 2004 WELL COSTS WERE $42

FOR FOUR PROJECTS AND $50 FOR ONE PROJECT THAT RELATED TO COSTS SUSPENDED IN 2000 AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY, WHEN DRILLING IN THE ASSOCIATED PROJECT AREAS WAS COMPLETED. CERTAIN WELLS IN THE

PROJECT AREAS MAY HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED PRIOR TO THESE YEARS OF LAST DRILLING. OTHER WELL COSTS IN

THE $449 TOTAL WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS FOR WHICH DRILLING WAS COMPLETED SINCE 2000.

IF AN FSP IS IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR TO THE DRAFT ISSUED IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

BELIEVE IT WOULD RESULT IN

THE IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SUSPENDED-WELL

COSTS. HOWEVER, THE SEC STAFF HAS INDICATED THAT IT GENERALLY WOULD NOT VIEW CONDUCTING

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING DESIGN STUDIES AS REASONABLE SUPPORT FOR THE SUSPENDING OF COSTS

BEYOND ONE YEAR AFTER DRILLING IS COMPLETE. IF SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL FSP,

THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPENSE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FOR WELLS THAT HAD FOUND SUFFICIENT

HYDROCARBONS TO JUSTIFY THEIR COMPLETION AS PRODUCING WELLS AND FOR PROJECTS THE COMPANY CONTINUED

TO CONSIDER ECONOMICALLY AND OPERATIONALLY VIABLE. IF A FINAL RULE REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO EXPENSE

THE ENTIRE $240 BEFORE-TAX CARRYING VALUE FOR THE 11 PROJECTS REFERENCED ABOVE THAT WERE SUSPENDED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THE COMPLETION OF DRILLING, THE AFTER-TAX

CHARGE TO EARNINGS WOULD BE $150.

NOTE 22.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY FUNDS

ONLY THOSE DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS FOR WHICH FUNDING IS REQUIRED UNDER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN THE

UNITED STATES, THIS INCLUDES ALL QUALIFIED TAX-EXEMPT PLANS SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY DOES NOT FUND DOMESTIC

NONQUALIFIED TAX-EXEMPT PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAWS AND

REGULATIONS BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT

RETURNS MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS,

AS WELL AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS ARE

UNFUNDED, AND THE COMPANY AND THE RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. IN JUNE 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

CHANGES TO ITS PRIMARY U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN, WHICH INCLUDE A LIMIT ON FUTURE INCREASES

IN THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION, AN INCREASE IN SERVICE POINTS (COMBINATION OF AGE AND YEARS OF COMPANY

SERVICE) REQUIRED TO RECEIVE FULL COVERAGE, AND THE PLANS PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR RETIREES

BECOMING SECONDARY TO MEDICARE PART D. LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY AND ANNUAL

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE BASED ON ACTUAL PLAN EXPERIENCE.

THE COMPANY USES A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31 TO VALUE ITS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

* DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WERE REVIEWED AND UPDATED AS

NEEDED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOR THE MAIN U.S. PENSION PLAN.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A RIGOROUS PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATES OF

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ACTUAL

HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND ADVICE FROM

EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS WHILE INCORPORATING SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS

ARE REGULARLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002

FOR U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8

PERCENT.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF

PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS OPPOSED TO THE

MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE

THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET

VOLATILITY AND YET STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR PLANS OUTSIDE THE U.S.,

MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS MAIN U.S.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION. FOR CURRENT

RETIREES, THE INCREASE IN COMPANY CONTRIBUTION IS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT EACH YEAR. FOR FUTURE

RETIREES, THE 4 PERCENT CAP WILL BE EFFECTIVE AT RETIREMENT. BEFORE RETIREMENT, THE ASSUMED HEALTH

CARE COST TREND RATES START WITH 10.6 PERCENT IN 2004 AND GRADUALLY DROP TO 4.8 PERCENT FOR 2010

AND BEYOND. ONCE THE EMPLOYEE ELECTS TO RETIRE, THE TREND RATES ARE CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT.

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE ASSUMED

HEATH CARE COST TREND RATES START WITH 8.4 PERCENT IN 2003 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 4.5 PERCENT FOR

2007 AND BEYOND.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR

RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS. A CHANGE OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT IN THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND

RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

THE PENSION PLANS INVEST PRIMARILY IN ASSET CATEGORIES WITH SUFFICIENT SIZE, LIQUIDITY AND

COST EFFICIENCY TO PERMIT INVESTMENTS OF REASONABLE SIZE. THE PENSION PLANS INVEST IN ASSET

CATEGORIES THAT PROVIDE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS AND ARE EASILY MEASURED. TO ASSESS THE PLANS

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY BENCHMARKS

HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE CHEVRONTEXACO BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING

APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES 40-70 PERCENT, FIXED INCOME 20-65 PERCENT, REAL ESTATE

0-15 PERCENT. THE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM AND

MINIMUM ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES THAT VARY BY EACH PLAN. ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION WITHIN APPROVED

RANGES IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET CATEGORY RISK.

EQUITIES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNT OF $8 AND $6 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE OTHER ASSET CATEGORY INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN

PRIVATE EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

IN 2004, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $1,332 AND $311 TO ITS

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2005, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO

BE APPROXIMATELY $250 AND $150 TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL

CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PAYING OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $220 IN 2005,

AS COMPARED WITH $199 IN 2004.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF

CHEVRONTEXACO AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRONTEXACO EMPLOYEE SAVINGS

INVESTMENT PLAN

(ESIP). IN 2002, THE EMPLOYEES THRIFT PLAN OF TEXACO INC., EMPLOYEES SAVINGS PLAN OF CHEVRONTEXACO

GLOBAL ENERGY INC. (FORMERLY CALTEX CORPORATION), STOCK PLAN OF CHEVRONTEXACO GLOBAL ENERGY, INC.,

AND EMPLOYEES THRIFT PLAN OF FUEL AND MARINE MARKETING LLC WERE MERGED INTO THE CHEVRONTEXACO ESIP.

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE

FUNDED EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE

RELEASE OF COMMON STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (LESOP), WHICH IS

DISCUSSED BELOW. TOTAL COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE ESIP WERE

$139, $136 AND $136 IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF

SHARES RELEASED FROM THE LESOP TOTALING $(138), $(23) AND $(73) IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING AMOUNTS, TOTALING $1, $113 AND $63 IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENT OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRONTEXACO EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP), IS

AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). IN 1989, CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLAN (LESOP) AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES PARTIAL PREFUNDING OF

THE COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

AS PERMITTED BY AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF

POSITION 93-6,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS,

THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED

TO CONTINUE ITS PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON AICPA 76-3,

ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS,

AND SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS OF THE EITF OF THE FASB. THE DEBT OF THE

LESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED COMPENSATION

AND BENEFIT PLAN TRUST IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE. INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE LESOP DEBT IS

RECORDED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF

RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL LESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR

EARNINGS-PER-SHARE COMPUTATIONS.

TOTAL (CREDITS) EXPENSES RECORDED FOR THE LESOP WERE $(29), $24 AND $98 IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $23, $28 AND $32 OF INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO LESOP DEBT AND A (CREDIT)

CHARGE TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $(52), $(4) AND $66.

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES,

$52, $61 AND $49 WERE USED IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. INCLUDED IN

THE 2004 AMOUNT WAS A REPAYMENT OF DEBT ENTERED INTO IN 1999 TO PAY INTEREST ON THE ESOP DEBT.

INTEREST EXPENSE ON THIS DEBT WAS RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED AS LESOP INTEREST EXPENSE IN 1999. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE NO CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2004 AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF $26 AND $102 IN 2003

BENEFIT PLAN TRUST

TEXACO ESTABLISHED A BENEFIT PLAN TRUST FOR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF

ITS BENEFIT PLANS. AT YEAR-END 2004, THE TRUST CONTAINED 14.2 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRONTEXACO TREASURY STOCK. THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE SHARES

OR USE THE DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT

PAY SUCH BENEFITS. THE TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUSTS

BENEFICIARIES. THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE

PURPOSES UNTIL DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD BY THE TRUST IN PAYMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLANS

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS TWO INCENTIVE PLANS, THE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN

(MIP) AND THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), FOR OFFICERS AND OTHER REGULAR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. THE PLANS WERE

EXPANDED IN 2002 TO INCLUDE FORMER EMPLOYEES OF TEXACO AND CALTEX. THE MIP IS AN ANNUAL CASH

INCENTIVE PLAN THAT LINKS AWARDS TO PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CASH AWARDS MAY BE

DEFERRED BY THE RECIPIENTS BY CONVERSION TO STOCK UNITS OR OTHER INVESTMENT FUND ALTERNATIVES.

AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED

STOCK, STOCK UNITS AND NONSTOCK GRANTS. TEXACO ALSO HAD A CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND A STOCK

INCENTIVE PLAN (SIP) THAT INCLUDED STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER INCENTIVE AWARDS FOR

EXECUTIVES, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES. AWARDS UNDER THE CALTEX LTIP WERE IN THE FORM OF

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. AGGREGATE CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THESE MANAGEMENT

INCENTIVE PLANS, EXCLUDING EXPENSE RELATED TO LTIP AND SIP STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

AWARDS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 23 THAT FOLLOWS, WERE $214, $148 AND $48 IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT FOR 2004 WAS $14 RELATED TO STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

OTHER INCENTIVE PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, OTHER THAN THOSE

COVERED BY MIP AND LTIP, WITH AN ANNUAL CASH BONUS IF THE COMPANY ACHIEVES CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND

SAFETY GOALS. CHARGES FOR THE PROGRAM WERE $339, $151 AND $158 IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 23.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANY APPLIES APB OPINION NO. 25 AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN ACCOUNTING FOR ITS

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE (CREDIT) RECOGNIZED IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE PROGRAMS AND THE STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS DISCUSSED ABOVE WAS $16, $2 AND

$(2) IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

REFER TO NOTE 1 ON PAGE FS-30 FOR THE PRO FORMA EFFECTS ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

HAD THE COMPANY APPLIED THE FAIR-VALUE-RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF FAS NO. 123.

IN THE DISCUSSION BELOW, THE REFERENCES TO SHARE PRICE AND NUMBER OF SHARES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED

FOR THE TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT IN SEPTEMBER 2004, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 ON PAGE FS-33.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN 1998, CHEVRON GRANTED TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OPTIONS THAT

VARIED FROM 200 TO 600 SHARES OF STOCK OR EQUIVALENTS, DEPENDENT ON THE EMPLOYEES SALARY OR JOB

GRADE. THESE OPTIONS VESTED AFTER TWO YEARS IN FEBRUARY 2000 AND EXPIRE IN FEBRUARY 2008. OPTIONS

FOR 9,641,600 SHARES WERE AWARDED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $38.15625 PER SHARE. OUTSTANDING OPTION

SHARES WERE 4,018,350 AT THE END OF 2002. IN 2003, EXERCISES OF 23,260 AND FORFEITURES OF 122,100

REDUCED THE OUTSTANDING OPTION SHARES TO 3,872,990 AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN 2004, EXERCISES OF

1,720,946 AND FORFEITURES OF 42,540 REDUCED THE OUTSTANDING OPTION SHARES TO 2,109,504 AT THE END

OF THE YEAR. THE COMPANY RECORDED EXPENSE (CREDIT) OF $2, $2 AND $(2) FOR THESE OPTIONS IN 2004,

2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION SHARE ON THE DATE OF GRANT UNDER FAS NO. 123 WAS ESTIMATED AT

$9.54 USING THE AVERAGE RESULTS OF BLACK-SCHOLES MODELS FOR THE PRECEDING 10 YEARS. THE 10-YEAR

AVERAGES OF EACH ASSUMPTION USED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODELS WERE: A RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 7.0

PERCENT, A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 4.2 PERCENT, AN EXPECTED LIFE OF SEVEN YEARS AND A VOLATILITY OF 24.7

PERCENT.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP EXTEND FOR 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF

GRANT. EFFECTIVE WITH OPTIONS GRANTED IN JUNE 2002, ONE-THIRD OF THE OPTIONS VEST ON EACH OF THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT. PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE, OPTIONS GRANTED BY

CHEVRON VESTED ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, WHEREAS OPTIONS GRANTED BY TEXACO UNDER ITS SIP

VESTED OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD AT A RATE OF 50 PERCENT EACH YEAR. FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD AFTER APRIL

2004, NO MORE THAN 160 MILLION SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE PLAN, AND NO MORE THAN 64 MILLION OF

THOSE SHARES MAY BE IN A FORM OTHER THAN A STOCK OPTION, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT OR AWARD

REQUIRING FULL PAYMENT FOR SHARES BY THE AWARD RECIPIENT. THIS PROVISION REPLACED A FORMULA THAT

RESTRICTED ANNUAL AWARDS TO NO MORE THAN ONE PERCENT OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH

YEAR. NOT COUNTED AGAINST THE 160 MILLION-SHARE MAXIMUM ARE SHARES ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THE

EXERCISE OPTIONS THAT WERE GRANTED BEFORE THE CHANGE IN FORMULA IN 2004.

ON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IN OCTOBER 2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP

WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRONTEXACO OPTIONS AT THE MERGER EXCHANGE RATE OF 0.77. THESE OPTIONS RETAINED

A PROVISION FOR RESTORED OPTIONS.

THIS FEATURE ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISES A STOCK OPTION BY EXCHANGING PREVIOUSLY

ACQUIRED COMMON STOCK OR WHO HAS SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE

NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE RESTORED OPTIONS ARE FULLY

EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE IS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF

THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED OPTION IS GRANTED. RESTRICTED SHARES

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES ANNUALLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL

YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED. THE U.S.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1996 FOR CHEVRONTEXACO (FORMERLY CHEVRON

CORPORATION), 1997 FOR CHEVRONTEXACO GLOBAL ENERGY INC. (FORMERLY CALTEX) AND 1991 FOR TEXACO INC.

CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1991 FOR CHEVRON AND 1987 FOR

TEXACO. SETTLEMENT OF OPEN TAX YEARS, AS WELL AS TAX ISSUES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY, AND IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN

MADE FOR INCOME AND FRANCHISE TAXES FOR ALL YEARS UNDER EXAMINATION OR SUBJECT TO FUTURE

EXAMINATION.

GUARANTEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED, EITHER DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY, GUARANTEES OF $963 FOR NOTES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES

AND $130 FOR THIRD PARTIES, AS DESCRIBED BY MAJOR CATEGORY BELOW. THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS BEING

CARRIED AS LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

OF THE $963 GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO AFFILIATES, $774 RELATE TO BORROWINGS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS OR GENERAL CORPORATE

PURPOSES. THESE GUARANTEES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE LOWER INTEREST RATES AND GENERALLY COVER THE

CONSTRUCTION PERIOD OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED

WILL EXPIRE BY 2009, WITH THE REMAINING GUARANTEES EXPIRING BY THE END OF 2015. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THE GUARANTEE SHOULD AN AFFILIATE BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE

PROVISIONS, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE GUARANTEES. THE $189 BALANCE OF THE $963

REPRESENTS OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH PRICING OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANYS COGENERATION AFFILIATES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY MAY BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IF THE AFFILIATES DO NOT PERFORM UNDER THE

AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS FOR RECOURSE TO THIRD PARTIES, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS

COLLATERAL FOR THESE PRICING GUARANTEES.

GUARANTEES OF $130 HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $40 OF

CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO HOST GOVERNMENTS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS. THE REMAINING GUARANTEES OF $90 WERE PROVIDED

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  CONTINUED

PRINCIPALLY AS CONDITIONS OF SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, TO PROVIDE A

SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY TO THE GUARANTEED PARTIES AND IN CONNECTION WITH COMPANY MARKETING PROGRAMS. NO

AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES. ABOUT 70

PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE BY 2009.

THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN OR CONTRACT TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. APPROXIMATELY $70

OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE RECOURSE PROVISIONS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO RECOVER ANY PAYMENTS MADE

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES FROM SECURITIES HELD OVER THE GUARANTEED PARTIES ASSETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, CHEVRONTEXACO ALSO HAD OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES FOR APPROXIMATELY $215 OF

EQUILON DEBT AND LEASES. FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 2002 DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN EQUILON, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED AN INDEMNIFICATION FROM SHELL OIL COMPANY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE

GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES. APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT

OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE BY 2009, WITH THE GUARANTEES OF THE REMAINING AMOUNTS

EXPIRING BY 2019.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL OIL COMPANY (SHELL) AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002

SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE INDEMNITIES COVER CERTAIN CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNOCAL PATENT LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PERFORM SHOULD THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. SHOULD THAT OCCUR,

THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300. THROUGH THE END OF 2004, THE

COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $28 UNDER THESE CONTINGENCIES AND HAD AGREED TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $10

ADDITIONAL UNDER AN AWARD OF ARBITRATION, SUBJECT TO MINOR ADJUSTMENTS YET TO BE RESOLVED. THE

COMPANY MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIODS OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS RELATING TO EQUILON INDEMNITIES MUST BE ASSERTED EITHER AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY

2007, OR NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2009, AND CLAIMS RELATING TO MOTIVA MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN

FEBRUARY 2012. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED ANY LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER

THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE

INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS

RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA

PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

SECURITIZATION

THE COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN ITS

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE

OF QUALIFYING SPES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, APPROXIMATELY

$1,200, REPRESENTING ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES

BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED. CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THESE

SECURITIZATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS APPROXIMATELY $50. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT OF

ACCELERATING CHEVRONTEXACOS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SPES

EXPERIENCE MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES, CHEVRONTEXACO BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD

HAVE NO LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATIONS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS,

AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE

AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, UTILITIES,

AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE

AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE

VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE 2005 

$1,600; 2006  $1,700; 2007  $1,600; 2008  $1,500; 2009  $1,500; 2010 AND AFTER  $2,300. TOTAL

PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $1,600 IN 2004, $1,400 IN 2003 AND $1,200 IN 2002.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY

55,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY AFFILIATE REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS

PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCING OF A REFINERY OWNED BY THE AFFILIATE AND

EXPIRES IN 2009. THE FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT

ARE: 2005  $1,200; 2006  $1,200; 2007  $1,300; 2008  $1,300; AND 2009  $1,300. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2004 THE COMPANY ENTERED

INTO A 20-YEAR AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE REGASIFICATION CAPACITY AT THE SABINE PASS LNG TERMINAL.

PAYMENTS OF $1,200 OVER THE 20-YEAR PERIOD ARE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN 2010.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $172 RELATED TO MINORITY INTERESTS

IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.

TEXACO CAPITAL LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARY, ISSUED DEFERRED PREFERRED SHARES,

SERIES C, IN DECEMBER 1995. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE COMPANY REDEEMED CURRENT OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO

MINORITY INTERESTS OF APPROXIMATELY $140.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY

THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING BUT NOT

LIMITED TO FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, OIL FIELDS,

SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED.

THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF

POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE

REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES,

AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE,

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  CONTINUED

THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS

OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD OR WILL HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL

COMPANIES.

CHEVRONTEXACOS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS $1,047. THE COMPANY

MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH IN THE

UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL

REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2004 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS MATERIAL

TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

INCLUDED IN THE YEAR-END 2004 BALANCE WAS $107 RELATED TO SITES FOR WHICH CHEVRONTEXACO HAD

BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2004 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $940, $712 RELATED TO MORE

THAN 2,000 SITES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER

PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS) AND PIPELINES. THE REMAINING

$228 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN THE INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($111), UPSTREAM ($69) AND

CHEMICALS ($48). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION

OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL

EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF

PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND

MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

CHEVRONTEXACO AND ITS AFFILIATES CONDUCT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN APPROXIMATELY

180 COUNTRIES. AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS INCLUDE

THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY, DENMARK, FRANCE, THE PARTITIONED

NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA, REPUBLIC OF CONGO, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, CHAD, SOUTH

AFRICA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, CHINA, THAILAND, VENEZUELA, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL,

COLOMBIA, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, AND SOUTH KOREA. THE COMPANYS CPC AFFILIATE OPERATES IN RUSSIA

AND KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS TCO AFFILIATE OPERATES IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS CPCHEM AFFILIATE

MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF PETROCHEMICALS ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR,

MEXICO AND BELGIUM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE

AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN

WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN

BY HOST GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC

OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED

BUSINESSES OR ASSETS OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR

BOTH.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN

OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED

RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF

CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR

PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE

ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO

EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONTEXACOS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE

NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN

THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET

SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES. CHEVRONTEXACO CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET

BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200. AT THE SAME TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT

COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRONTEXACO IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $50. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE

EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES WERE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRONTEXACO RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS, TRADING

PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES, HOST GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS,

AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT

AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 25.

FAS 143  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143), EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD APPLIES TO

THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION THAT IS RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A

LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE LIABILITY

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THESE ASSETS REQUIRE

RECOGNITION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING ASSET FOR

AN ARO, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION OF THE ASSET, AND (3) THE

PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND DISCOUNT RATES. FAS 143 PRIMARILY AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS ACCOUNTING FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING ASSETS AND DIFFERS IN SEVERAL RESPECTS

FROM PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING UNDER FAS 19,

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

COMPANIES.

FAS 143  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  CONTINUED

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $200 FOR THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF FAS 143, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT ALSO INCREASED THE FOLLOWING BALANCE SHEET

CATEGORIES: PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, $2,568; ACCRUED LIABILITIES, $115; AND DEFERRED

CREDITS AND OTHER NONCURRENT OBLIGATIONS, $2,674. NONCURRENT DEFERRED INCOME TAXES DECREASED BY

$21.

UPON ADOPTION, NO SIGNIFICANT ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED

ASSETS GENERALLY WERE RECOGNIZED, AS INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS

PREVENTED ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS

OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT NET CHARGE,

THE EFFECT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON NET INCOME IN 2003 WAS NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

WHAT THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FAS 19 ACCOUNTING. INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND

AMORTIZATION WERE $52 RELATED TO THE DEPRECIATION OF THE ARO ASSET AND $132 RELATED TO THE

ACCRETION OF THE ARO LIABILITY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES WHAT THE COMPANYS NET INCOME BEFORE EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, NET

THAT WAS PART OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION. UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS

143, THE PROVISION FOR ABANDONMENT WAS REVERSED AND ARO LIABILITY WAS RECORDED. THE AMOUNT OF THE

ABANDONMENT RESERVE AT THE END OF 2002 WAS $2,263. THE 2002 PRO-FORMA ARO LIABILITY AT JANUARY 1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS,

THE WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS. THE SYSTEM

CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES, THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND THREE

NONCOMMERCIAL. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL CLASSIFICATION ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES OF

UNPROVED, PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE NONCOMMERCIAL CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT

RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC STANDARDS AND

DEMONSTRATE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF BEING PRODUCED.

PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT

GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE

YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS. NET PROVED RESERVES

EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY

OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

ARE THE QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS.

PROVED RESERVES DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES THAT MAY EVENTUALLY RESULT

FROM EXTENSIONS OF CURRENTLY PROVED AREAS OR FROM APPLYING THE SECONDARY OR TERTIARY RECOVERY

PROCESSES NOT YET TESTED AND DETERMINED TO BE ECONOMIC.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE

LIMITED NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF UNDERGROUND RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS

COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND RESERVOIR ENGINEERS. AS PART OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS

RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS

CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE RESERVES MANAGER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF A CORPORATE DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS

DIRECTLY TO THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL OF THE RAC MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF SEC GUIDELINES FOR PROVED

RESERVES CLASSIFICATION. THE RAC COORDINATES ITS ACTIVITIES THROUGH TWO OPERATING COMPANY-LEVEL

RESERVES MANAGERS. THESE TWO RESERVES MANAGERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE RAC SO AS TO PRESERVE THE

CORPORATE-LEVEL INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OF THE

BUSINESS UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVE CHANGES; CONFIRM THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND

APPROPRIATE STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL

, WHICH

PROVIDES STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON

RESERVES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM

BUSINESS UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR

CHANGES ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND PLANNING COMMITTEE, WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANYS ANNUAL RESERVE

ACTIVITY IS ALSO PRESENTED TO AND DISCUSSED WITH

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OTHER MAJOR RESERVES-RELATED ISSUES ARE DISCUSSED WITH THE BOARD AS NECESSARY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE

THE LARGEST PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED RESERVE

RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL.

RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS WERE 8.2 BILLION BARRELS. (REFER TO PAGE E-12 FOR THE DEFINITION OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.) NEARLY 30 PERCENT WERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABOUT 10 PERCENT IN

INDONESIA. FOR THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUITY AFFILIATES, OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES WERE 3.1

BILLION BARRELS, NEARLY 85 PERCENT OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP

IN TCO. FEWER THAN 20 OTHER INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS EACH

CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT AND 4 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IN

THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PROVED RESERVES TOTAL. THESE OTHER PROPERTIES WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY

DISPERSED, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, WEST AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND

THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

IN THE UNITED STATES, TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2004 WERE 2.4 BILLION BARRELS.

OF THIS AMOUNT, 45 PERCENT, 20 PERCENT AND 35 PERCENT WERE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, THE GULF OF

MEXICO AND OTHER U.S. AREAS, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CALIFORNIA, LIQUIDS RESERVES REPRESENTED 95 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH MOST CLASSIFIED AS

HEAVY OIL. BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE NEED TO EMPLOY ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS,

THE PRODUCING OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE IN NATURE. MOST OF THE COMPANYS HEAVY-OIL FIELDS

IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOY A CONTINUOUS STEAMFLOODING PROCESS.

IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION, LIQUIDS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF TOTAL

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE AND, AS A RESULT, ARE ALSO

CAPITAL INTENSIVE. COSTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN WELLS, PRODUCTION PLATFORMS AND OTHER FACILITIES,

SUCH AS GATHERING LINES AND STORAGE FACILITIES.

IN OTHER U.S. AREAS, THE RESERVES WERE SPLIT ABOUT EQUALLY BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS.

FOR PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, INCLUDING WATER-FLOOD AND CO

2

INJECTION.

CHEVRONTEXACO OPERATES THE BOSCAN FIELD IN VENEZUELA UNDER A SERVICE AGREEMENT, BUT HAS

NOT RECORDED RESERVE QUANTITIES FOR THIS OPERATION.

THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLES, FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004, IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF

FUTURE TRENDS. THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

MATTERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE COMPANYS CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT PERMITTING, PARTNER

APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, DECLINES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS, GEOPOLITICAL

UNCERTAINTIES AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED UNDERGROUND OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND CHANGES

THERETO FOR THE YEARS 2002, 2003 AND 2004 ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES.

NET RESERVE CHANGES (EXCLUDING PRODUCTION) IN 2004 CONSIST OF 5 MILLION BARRELS OF

DEVELOPED RESERVES AND (209) MILLION BARRELS OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

315 MILLION BARRELS OF DEVELOPED RESERVES AND (111) MILLION BARRELS OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

DURING 2004, THE PERCENTAGES OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

TRANSFERRED TO DEVELOPED RESERVES WERE 13 PERCENT AND 15 PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

AFFILIATED COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES, CHEVRONTEXACO HAS SIGNIFICANT

INTERESTS IN PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATHABASCA PROJECT. FOR

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, CHEVRONTEXACO VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN

INTEGRAL PART OF TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SEC REGULATIONS DEFINE THESE RESERVES AS

MINING-RELATED AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES. NET PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES

WERE 167 MILLION BARRELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. PRODUCTION BEGAN IN LATE 2002.

THE OIL SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH

FLOWS FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES, WHICH IS FOUND ON PAGE FS-67.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF PROVED-RESERVES CHANGES FOR 2002 THROUGH 2004 IN

THE ABOVE TABLE ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2002, NET REVISIONS REDUCED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 49 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INTERNATIONAL AREAS ACCOUNTED FOR A NET

INCREASE OF 67 MILLION BARRELS. THE LARGEST UPWARD NET REVISION INTERNATIONALLY WAS 161 MILLION

BARRELS FOR A CONTRACT EXTENSION IN ANGOLA. THE LARGEST NEGATIVE NET REVISION WAS 155 MILLION

BARRELS IN INDONESIA, MAINLY FOR THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF

RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH COST-OIL RECOVERY UNDER A PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE TOTAL DOWNWARD NET

REVISION WAS 116 MILLION BARRELS ACROSS MANY FIELDS IN EACH OF THE GEOGRAPHIC

SECTIONS. THE 199-MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR THE TCO AFFILIATE WAS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE PROJECT APPROVAL TO EXPAND GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES.

IN 2003, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 57 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES. WHEREAS NET U.S. RESERVE CHANGES WERE MINIMAL, INTERNATIONAL VOLUMES

INCREASED 66 MILLION BARRELS. THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS IN KAZAKHSTAN IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC

AREA BASED ON AN UPDATED GEOLOGIC MODEL FOR ONE FIELD. THE 200-MILLION-BARREL

INCREASE FOR TCO WAS BASED ON AN UPDATED MODEL OF RESERVOIR AND WELL PERFORMANCE.

FS-64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION  CONTINUED

IN 2004, NET REVISIONS DECREASED RESERVES 218 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

AND INCREASED RESERVES FOR AFFILIATES BY 204 MILLION BARRELS. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE

DECREASE WAS COMPOSED OF 161 MILLION BARRELS FOR INTERNATIONAL AREAS AND 57 MILLION BARRELS FOR THE

UNITED STATES. THE LARGEST DOWNWARD REVISION INTERNATIONALLY WAS 70 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA. ONE

FIELD IN ANGOLA ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE NET DECLINE AS CHANGES WERE MADE TO OIL-IN-PLACE

ESTIMATES BASED ON RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE DATA. ONE FIELD IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC AREA ESSENTIALLY

ACCOUNTED FOR THE 43-MILLION-BARREL DOWNWARD REVISION FOR THAT REGION. THE REVISION WAS ASSOCIATED

WITH REDUCED WELL PERFORMANCE. PART OF THE 36-MILLION-BARREL NET DOWNWARD REVISION FOR INDONESIA

WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES FOR

COST-OIL RECOVERY UNDER A PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 68-MILLION-BARREL

NET DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AREA WAS ACROSS SEVERAL FIELDS AND BASED MAINLY ON

RESERVOIR ANALYSES AND

ASSESSMENTS

OF WELL PERFORMANCE. FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, THE 206-MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR TCO

WAS BASED ON AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE FOR THE TENGIZ FIELD. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THIS NET INCREASE WAS A DOWNWARD EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE VARIABLE

ROYALTY-RATE CALCULATION. DOWNWARD REVISIONS ALSO OCCURRED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS BECAUSE OF THE

EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON VARIOUS PRODUCTION-SHARING TERMS AND VARIABLE ROYALTY

CALCULATIONS.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN 2002, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 239

MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. THE LARGEST INCREASE OF 99 MILLION BARRELS OCCURRED IN

THE UNITED STATES, PRIMARILY IN THE CALIFORNIA REGION DUE TO PATTERN MODIFICATIONS, INJECTOR

CONVERSIONS AND INFILL DRILLING ON A LARGE HEAVY OIL FIELD UNDER THERMAL RECOVERY.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2002, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES

WORLDWIDE BY 442 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS 301 MILLION

BARRELS IN AFRICA, PRINCIPALLY 172 MILLION BARRELS REFLECTING THE PROJECT SANCTION OF A RECENT

DISCOVERY IN NIGERIA AND 96 MILLION BARRELS ASSOCIATED WITH APPROVAL OF SEVERAL DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS IN ANGOLA.

SALES

IN 2004, SALES OF LIQUIDS VOLUMES REDUCED RESERVES OF CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY 179

MILLION BARRELS. SALES TOTALED 130 MILLION BARRELS IN THE UNITED STATES AND 33 MILLION BARRELS IN

THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGION. SALES IN THE OTHER REGION OF THE UNITED STATES TOTALED 103

MILLIONS BARRELS, WITH TWO FIELDS ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE VOLUME. THE 27

MILLION BARRELS SOLD IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REFLECT THE SALE OF A NUMBER OF SHELF PROPERTIES. THE

OTHER INTERNATIONAL SALES INCLUDE THE DISPOSAL OF WESTERN CANADA PROPERTIES AND SEVERAL FIELDS

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. ALL THE SALES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PROGRAM TO DISPOSE OF

ASSETS DEEMED NONSTRATEGIC TO THE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCING PROPERTIES.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF PROVED-RESERVES CHANGES FOR 2002 THROUGH 2004 IN THE

TABLE ON PAGE FS-65 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2002, RESERVES WERE REVISED UPWARD BY A NET

161 BILLION CUBIC FEET (BCF) FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, AS INCREASES OF 759 BCF INTERNATIONALLY

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF 598 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONALLY,

THE MAJORITY OF THE 277 BCF NET UPWARD REVISION IN AFRICA WAS ASSOCIATED PRIMARILY WITH A

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF SEVERAL FIELDS AND A MULTIFIELD GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. AN INCREASE OF

375 BCF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF SECURING A CONTRACT TO SUPPLY LNG TO

CHINA MARKETS FROM COMPANY PRODUCING OPERATIONS IN AUSTRALIA. IN THE UNITED STATES, ABOUT

ONE-FOURTH OF THE 598 BCF NET DOWNWARD REVISION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO FIELDS IN THE MIDCONTINENT

REGION BASED ON AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE AND CHANGES TO OPERATING CONDITIONS

OF THE WELLS. MOST OF THE REMAINING NEGATIVE REVISION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REVIEWS OF PERFORMANCE IN

MANY FIELDS. FOR THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, THE 293 BCF INCREASE RELATED MAINLY TO PROJECT

APPROVAL TO EXPAND GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES.

IN 2003, REVISIONS ACCOUNTED FOR A NET INCREASE OF 1,627 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, AS NET INCREASES OF 2,233 BCF INTERNATIONALLY WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY NET DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF 606 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONALLY, THE NET 879 BCF

INCREASE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION RELATED PRIMARILY TO AUSTRALIA AND KAZAKHSTAN. IN AUSTRALIA,

THE INCREASE WAS ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH A CHANGE TO THE PROBABILISTIC METHOD OF AGGREGATING THE

RESERVES FOR MULTIPLE FIELDS PRODUCED THROUGH COMMON OFFSHORE INFRASTRUCTURE INTO A SINGLE LNG

PLANT. THE INCREASE IN KAZAKHSTAN RELATED TO AN UPDATED GEOLOGIC MODEL FOR ONE FIELD AND HIGHER

GAS SALES TO A THIRD-PARTY PROCESSING PLANT. THE NET 976 BCF INCREASE IN THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL

AREA WAS MAINLY THE RESULT OF OPERATING CONTRACT EXTENSIONS FOR TWO FIELDS IN SOUTH AMERICA. IN

THE UNITED STATES, ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE NET 606 BCF NEGATIVE REVISION RELATED TO TWO COAL BED

METHANE FIELDS IN THE MIDCONTINENT REGION, BASED ON PERFORMANCE DATA FOR PRODUCING WELLS. DOWNWARD

REVISIONS FOR THE BALANCE OF THE WRITE-DOWN WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL FIELDS, BASED ON

ASSESSMENTS OF WELL PERFORMANCE AND OTHER DATA.

IN 2004, REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY A NET 248 BCF, COMPOSED OF INCREASES OF 928 BCF INTERNATIONALLY AND

DECREASES OF 680 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONALLY, ABOUT HALF OF THE 346 BCF INCREASE IN

AFRICA RELATED TO PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA, FOR WHICH CHANGES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH WELL PERFORMANCE

REVIEWS, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND LEASE FUEL CALCULATIONS. THE 236 BCF ADDITION IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC

REGION WAS RELATED PRIMARILY TO RESERVOIR ANALYSIS FOR A SINGLE FIELD. MOST OF THE 325 BCF IN

THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREA IS RELATED TO A NEW GAS SALES CONTRACT IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. IN

THE UNITED STATES, THE NET 391 BCF DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WAS RELATED TO

WELL-PERFORMANCE REVIEWS AND TECHNICAL ANALYSES IN SEVERAL FIELDS. MOST OF THE NET 316 BCF

NEGATIVE REVISION IN THE OTHER U.S. AREA RELATED TO TWO COAL BED METHANE FIELDS IN THE

MIDCONTINENT REGION AND THEIR ASSOCIATED WELLS PERFORMANCE. THE 963 BCF INCREASE FOR TCO WAS

CONNECTED WITH UPDATED ANALYSES OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND PROCESSING PLANT YIELDS.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2002, CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES BY 892 BCF,

INCLUDING 395 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES AND 227 BCF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, 229 BCF WAS ADDED IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND 161 BCF IN THE OTHER REGION, PRIMARILY DUE TO

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE VI  STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING PROVED

OIL AND GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 69. ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO YEAR-END

QUANTITIES OF ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE LIMITED TO THOSE PROVIDED BY

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND

PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE YEAR-END

ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF YEAR-END

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. ESTIMATED FUTURE

INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END STATUTORY TAX RATES. THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PRETAX NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE CALCULATED USING

10 PERCENT

MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN FUTURE

EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. ESTIMATES OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES

ARE IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND

POSSIBLE RESERVES, WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE

ARBITRARY VALUATION PRESCRIBED UNDER FAS 69 REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND

SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL

AND GAS RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED MEASURE NET CASH FLOWS REFERS TO THE
