summary description of chevrontexaco
chevrontexaco
corporation,1
a delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
and affiliates and provides administrative, financial and
management support to u.s. and foreign subsidiaries that engage
in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations,
coal mining, power and energy services. the company conducts
business activities in the united states and approximately 180
other countries. petroleum operations consist of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; refining
crude oil into finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil,
natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum; and
transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by
pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car. chemicals
operations include the manufacture and marketing, by affiliates,
of commodity petrochemicals for industrial uses, and the
manufacture and marketing, by a consolidated subsidiary, of fuel
and lubricating oil additives.
in this report, exploration and production of crude oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas may be referred to as
e&p or upstream activities.
refining, marketing and transportation may be referred to as
rm&t or downstream activities. a
list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pages e-4 and e-5 of this annual report on form10-k. as of
december31, 2004, chevrontexaco had more than 56,000
employees (including about 9,300 service station employees).
approximately 25,000, or 45percent, of the companys
employees were employed in u.s.operations.
overview of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
control over some of them. governmental policies, particularly
in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating where and
how companies conduct their operations and formulate their
products and, in some cases, limiting their profits directly.
prices for crude oil and natural gas, petroleum products and
petrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these
commodities. the members of the organization of petroleum
exporting countries (opec) are typically the worlds swing
producers of crude oil, and their production levels are a major
factor in determining worldwide supply. demand for crude oil and
its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the
conditions of local, national and worldwide economies, although
weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources
also play a significant part. variations in the components of
refined products sales due to seasonality are not primary
drivers of changes in the companys overall annual earnings.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers.
chevrontexaco competes with fully integrated major petroleum
companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties, and for the equipment and labor
required to develop and operate those properties. in its
downstream business, chevrontexaco also competes with fully
integrated major petroleum companies and other independent
refining and marketing entities in the sale or purchase of
various goods or services in many national and international
markets.
operating environment
refer to pagesfs-2 through fs-21 of this annual report on
form10-k in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations for a discussion
on the companys current business environment and outlook.
1incorporated
in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the
company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and
chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. as used in this report, the
term chevrontexaco and such terms as the
company, the corporation, our,
we, and us may refer to chevrontexaco
corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to
all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise, it
does not include affiliates of
chevrontexaco i.e., those companies accounted for by
the equity method (generally owned 50percent or less) or
investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms
are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.
table of contents
risk factors
chevrontexaco is a major fully integrated petroleum company with
a diversified business portfolio, strong balance sheet, and a
history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. nevertheless,
some inherent risks could materially impact the companys
financial results of operations or financial condition.
chevrontexaco is exposed to the effects of changing
commodity prices.
chevrontexaco is primarily in a commodities business with a
history of price volatility. the single largest variable that
affects the companys results of operations is crude oil
prices. except in the ordinary course of running an integrated
petroleum business, chevrontexaco does not seek to hedge its
exposure to price changes. a significant, persistent decline in
crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on its
results of operations and its capital and exploratory
expenditure plans.
the scope of chevrontexacos business will decline if
the company does not successfully develop resources.
the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if
chevrontexaco is not successful in replacing the crude oil and
natural gas it produces with good prospects for future
production, the companys business will decline. creating
and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many
factors, including obtaining rights to explore, develop and
produce hydrocarbons in promising areas, drilling success,
ability to bring long lead-time, capital intensive projects to
completion on budget and schedule, and efficient and profitable
operation of mature properties.
the companys operations could be disrupted by
natural or human factors.
chevrontexaco operates in both urban areas and remote and
sometimes inhospitable regions. the companys operations
and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes, including hurricanes, earthquakes,
floods, civil unrest, fires and explosions, any of which could
result in suspension of operations, or harm to people or the
natural environment.
chevrontexacos business subjects the company to
liability risks.
the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
companys business. chevrontexaco operations also produce
byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. any of these
activities could result in liability, either as a result of an
accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
on the effects of the companys operations on human health
or the environment.
political instability could harm chevrontexacos
business.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
host governments to increase public ownership of the
companys partially or wholly owned businesses,
and/or to impose additional taxes or royalties.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed
restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others, political
conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of
employees and the companys continued presence in those
countries. internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other
governments may affect the companys operations. those
developments have, at times, significantly affected the
companys related operations and results, and are carefully
considered by management when evaluating the level of current
and future activity in such countries. at december31,
2004, approximately 27percent of the companys proved
reserves were located in kazakhstan. the company also has
significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting
countries (opec)-member countries
table of contents
including indonesia, nigeria and venezuela. approximately
25percent of the companys net proved reserves,
including affiliates, were located in opec countries at
december31, 2004.
chevrontexaco strategic direction
chevrontexacos primary objective is to achieve sustained
financial returns from its operations that will enable it to
outperform its competitors. the company set a goal to generate
the highest total stockholder return (based on a combination of
stock price appreciation and reinvested dividends) among a
designated peer group for the five-year period 2000-2004. bp,
exxonmobil and royal dutch shell among the
worlds largest publicly traded integrated petroleum
companies comprised the companys designated
competitor peer group for this purpose. for the five years
ending december31, 2004, chevrontexaco tied one other
company in the peer group for the highest total stockholder
return.
as a foundation for attaining this goal, the company had
established four key priorities, which continue into 2005:
operational excellence through safe, reliable,
efficient and environmentally sound operations.
cost reduction by lowering unit costs through
innovation and technology.
capital stewardship by investing in the best
project opportunities and executing them successfully (safer,
faster, and at lower cost).
profitable growth through leadership in developing
new business opportunities in both existing and new markets.
supporting these four priorities is a focus on:
organizational capability: having the right
people, processes and culture to achieve and sustain
industry-leading performance in the four primary areas described
above.
the companys long-term strategies for its largest
businesses build on this framework and focus on balancing
financial returns and growth. the strategies for upstream
(exploration and production) are to grow profitability in core
areas, build new legacy positions, and commercialize the
companys natural gas equity resource base by targeting
north american and asian markets. the primary strategy for
downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) is to
continue to improve returns by focusing on areas of market and
supply strength.
(b)
description of business and properties
the upstream and downstream activities of the company are widely
dispersed geographically. the company has operations in north
america, south america, europe, africa, middle east, central and
far east asia, and australia. besides the large upstream and
downstream businesses, the companys other comparatively
smaller business segment is chemicals, which is conducted by the
companys 50percent-owned affiliate
chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) and
the wholly owned chevron oronite company (chevron oronite).
cpchem has operations in the united states, puerto rico,
singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and
belgium. chevron oronite is a fuel and lubricating-oil additives
business that owns and operates facilities in the united states,
france, the netherlands, singapore and japan and has equity
interests in facilities in india and mexico.
chevrontexaco also owns an approximate 25percent equity
interest in the common stock of dynegy inc. (dynegy), an energy
provider engaged in power generation, gathering and processing
of natural gas, and the fractionation, storage, transportation
and marketing of natural gas liquids. the company holds an
additional investment in dynegy preferred stock. refer to page
fs-11 and note8 on page fs-36 for further information
relating to the companys investment in dynegy.
tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues,
earnings, income taxes for the three years ending
december31, 2004, and assets as of the end of each
year for the united states and the companys
major international geographic areas may be found in
note9 to the consolidated financial statements beginning
on page fs-36 of this annual report on form10-k. in

in 2004, chevrontexaco conducted its exploration and production
operations in the united states and approximately 25 other
countries. worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2004,
including volumes produced from oil sands and production under
an operating service agreement, declined approximately
5percent from 2003. the decline was largely the result of
lower production in the united states due to normal field
declines, property sales and curtailments as a result of damages
to producing operations from hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in
september 2004. international oil-equivalent production was down
marginally between years. refer to the results of
operations section beginning on page fs-6 for a detailed
discussion of the factors explaining the 2002-2004 changes in
production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas.
for the past six years, the companys worldwide
oil-equivalent production, including the volumes produced from
oil sands and production under an operating service agreement,
has followed a downward trend. production in 2004 was
85percent of 1998 levels, equivalent to an average annual
decline rate of about 3percent. for 2005, the company
again expects worldwide oil-equivalent production to be lower.
increases internationally in 2005 are not expected to fully
offset lower rates in the united states, which the company
projects will result largely from normal field declines and the
absence of production associated with property sales. the actual
level of worldwide production in 2005 remains uncertain for
reasons including the potential for constraints imposed by opec,
and disruptions caused by weather, local civil unrest and other
factors. production capacity in the 2006-2008 period may permit
the worldwide oil-equivalent production level to increase from
that expected in 2005. refer to the review of ongoing
exploration and production activities in key areas
beginning on page11 for a discussion of the companys
major oil and gas development projects.

area, as of december31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. also, refer
to table v for a discussion of major changes to proved reserves
by geographic area for 2004. during 2004, the company provided
oil and gas reserves estimates for 2003 to the department of
energy, energy information agency. such estimates are consistent
with and do not differ more than 5percent from the
information furnished to the sec in this annual report on
form10-k. during 2005, the company will file estimates of
oil and gas reserves with the department of energy, energy
information agency, consistent with the reserve data reported in
tablev.
contract obligations
the company sells crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
from its producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. most contracts generally commit the company to
sell quantities based on production from specified properties,
but certain gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and
determinable quantities.
in the united states, the company is contractually committed to
deliver to third parties and affiliates approximately
180billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2007 from
united states reserves. the company believes it can satisfy
these contracts from quantities available from production of the
companys proved developed u.s.reserves. these
contracts include variable-pricing terms.
table of contents
outside the united states, the company is contractually
committed to deliver to third parties approximately
700billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2007 from
australian, canadian, colombian and philippine reserves. the
sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
delivery and that in some cases consider inflation or other
factors.
the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from
quantities available from production of the companys
proved developed australian, colombian and philippine reserves.
the company plans to meet its canadian contractual delivery
commitments through third-party purchases.

consolidated operations
a)
united states
the united states upstream activities are concentrated in the
gulf of mexico, california, louisiana, texas, new mexico and the
rocky mountains. average daily net production during 2004 was
approximately 505,000barrels of liquids and
1.9billion cubic feet of natural gas, or
817,000barrels per day on an oil-equivalent basis. the
company announced plans in 2003 to sell interests in
nonstrategic producing properties in the united states, and
during 2004 substantially all of the larger asset packages were
sold. the effect of these sales on 2004net oil-equivalent
production was about 30,000barrels per day. the remaining
properties earmarked for sale are expected to be disposed of
during 2005 and represent less than 1percent of the
u.s.oil-equivalent production at the end of 2004. refer to
tablev beginning on pagefs-63 for a discussion of
the reserves and different characteristics for the major
u.s.producing areas.
california:the company has significant production
in the sanjoaquin valley. in 2004, average daily net
production was 217,000barrels of crude oil,
108million cubic feet of natural gas and
4,000barrels of natural gas liquids, or
239,000barrels of daily net production on an
oil-equivalent basis. approximately 84percent of the crude
oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with api
gravity lower than 22degrees).
gulf of mexico:combining the companys
interest in the shelf and deepwater areas and on-shore
louisiana, average daily net production rates during 2004 were
138,000barrels of crude oil, 815million cubic feet
of natural gas and 16,000barrels of natural gas liquids,
or approximately 290,000 oil-equivalent barrels daily.
in deepwater, the company has an interest in three significant
producing fields: genesis, petronius and typhoon. petronius,
50percent-owned and operated, maintained a daily net
production of 14,000barrels of crude oil and
25million cubic feet of natural gas in 2004.
table of contents
the 57percent-owned and operated genesis averaged daily
net production of approximately 13,000barrels of crude oil
and 18million cubic feet of natural gas in 2004. petronius
production was shut-in for repairs following hurricane damage in
september 2004, and is expected to resume producing in march
2005. typhoon, which is 50percent-owned and operated, had
average daily net production of approximately
11,000barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
14million cubic feet of natural gas in 2004, including
production from the boris field that utilizes the typhoon
production facility.
development continues on the company-operated perseus and tahiti
projects, which are not yet on production. the companys
ownership interests are 50percent and 58percent,
respectively. at perseus, platform rig damage due to the
september 2004 hurricane delayed the estimated completion of the
first producing well until april 2005. a second production well
is scheduled to follow in the first quarter 2006. average net
production in 2005 from the first perseus well through the
petronius facilities is estimated at more than 4,000net
barrels of oil-equivalent per day after start-up. the initial
booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in 2003 and a
reclassification of certain reserves to proved developed will
occur in early 2005, prior to the start of production from the
first well. the perseus project has an estimated production life
of between six and nine years. at tahiti, engineering and
equipment procurement was in process during 2004. a successful
well test of the original discovery well was also conducted in
2004. initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in
2003, and transfer of certain reserves into the proved developed
category is anticipated in 2008, when first production is
scheduled to begin. tahiti is expected to have a production life
of 25years.
in gulf of mexico exploration, the company participated in 11
deepwater exploratory wells during 2004 and announced two
discoveries the 50percent-owned and operated
jack prospect and the 17percent-owned and nonoperated
tobago prospect. further evaluation of commercial potential also
continued on the 2003 discovery at the 30percent-owned and
nonoperated tubular bells prospect with additional follow-up
drilling planned for the 2005-to-2006 timeframe. commercial
appraisal work also continues at the nonoperated
33percent-owned great white field, including an additional
well that is planned in 2005, and at the nonoperated
13percent-owned saint malo discovery. proved reserves have
not been recognized for these projects. appraisal drilling also
occurred in 2004 at the 63percent-owned and operated blind
faith. initial production is expected by early 2008. no proved
reserves have been recognized for this project. the
75percent-owned and operated tonga prospect was drilled in
2003 and the data from this well is under evaluation.
in december 2004, the company announced it had finalized a
20-year agreement for regasification capacity at the proposed
sabine pass liquefied natural gas (lng) terminal. in november
2004, the company announced it had plans to submit federal and
state permit applications for a regasification terminal to
import lng located at its pascagoula refinery.
other u.s.areas: outside of california and the gulf
of mexico, the company manages operations in the midcontinent
united states extending from the rockies to southern texas. in
2004, average daily net production was 130,000barrels of
crude oil and natural gas liquids and 950million cubic
feet of natural gas.

angola:chevrontexaco is the largest producer of
crude oil and liquefied petroleum gases in angola. the company
was the first to produce in the deepwater. cabinda gulf oil
company limited (cabgoc), a wholly owned subsidiary of
chevrontexaco, is operator of two concessions, block 0 and
block14, off the west coast of angola, north of the congo
river. block0, in which cabgoc has a 39percent
interest, is a 2,155-square-mile concession adjacent to the
cabinda coastline. block14, in which cabgoc has a
31percent interest, is a 1,580-square-mile deepwater
concession located west of block0.
in block0, the company operates in two areas a
and b composed of 19 fields producing
116,000barrels per day of net liquids in 2004.
areaa, comprising 13 producing fields, averaged net daily
production of approximately 78,000barrels of crude oil and
1,000barrels of liquefied petroleum gas (lpg)in
2004. areab, which is now the combination of areas
previously known as areab and areac, has six
producing fields and averaged daily net production of
37,000barrels of crude oil in 2004. in 2004, the company
finalized a 20-year extension of its block0 concession,
which will expire in 2030. the sanha condensate gas utilization
and bomboco crude oil project, located in area b, began
operations with the installation of facilities and the start of
production in late 2004. initial recognition of proved reserves
was made at the end of 2002. initial reclassification of
reserves from proved undeveloped to proved developed occurred in
2004 and will continue in 2005 and 2006.
in block14, net production in 2004 from the kuito field,
angolas first deepwater producing area, averaged
approximately 18,000net barrels of crude oil per day. the
development plans for the benguela, belize, lobito and tomboco
fields in block14 were approved in 2003. phase1 of
the $2.2billion project involves the installation of an
integrated drilling and production platform and the development
of the benguela and belize fields, projected for first oil in
early 2006. proved undeveloped reserves for these fields were
booked in 1998. phase2 involves the installation of subsea
systems, pipelines and wells for lobito and tomboco. proved
undeveloped reserves for these fields were booked in 2000.
phase2 is under construction, with first oil planned for
late 2006. after both phases are completed, maximum total daily
production is estimated at more than 200,000barrels of
crude oil in 2008. some proved developed reserves will be
recognized near to the time of first oil. the concession for
these fields will expire in 2027.
the landana and tombua fields were discovered in 1997 and 2001,
respectively, and appraisal drilling was done from 1998 through
2002. proved undeveloped reserves for tombua and landana were
booked in 2001 and 2002, respectively. feasibility studies were
completed in 2004 for the tombua-landana development, which is
targeted as the next major capital project for block14 and
is currently in front-end engineering. estimated capital
expenditures for the development exceed $2billion. proved
developed reserves will start to be recognized near the time of
first production.
chevrontexaco has two other concessions in angola. block2,
20percent-owned and operated, and blockfst, in which
the company has a 16percent nonoperated interest, had a
combined net production of nearly 6,000barrels of crude
oil per day in 2004.
the angola lng project is an integrated gas utilization project.
chevrontexaco and sonangol, the state oil company of angola, are
co-leading the project in which the company has a
36percent interest. front-end engineering and design work
is expected to start in the first half of 2005.
chad-cameroon: chevrontexaco is a non-operating partner
in a project to develop oil fields in southern chad and
transport crude oil by pipeline to the coast of cameroon for
export. net daily production in 2004 was 37,000barrels of
crude oil. all three of the original fields are now on
production. proved undeveloped reserves were booked in 2000 and
began to be reclassified to proved developed reserves in 2002.
the production life of the field is estimated at 30years.

equatorial guinea: chevrontexaco is a 45percent
partner and operator of the lblock offshore the republic
of equatorial guinea. the first exploration well, ballena-1, was
completed in 2003. in the fourth quarter 2004, chevrontexaco
initiated partial farm-out activities and, if completed, plans
to drill two stratigraphic prospects in blockl.
libya: in early 2005, the company was awarded
block177 in libyas first exploration license round
under the exploration and production sharing agreementiv.
the company was also made operator of block177 with
100percent equity.
nigeria:chevrontexacos principal subsidiary
in nigeria, chevron nigeria limited (cnl), operates and holds a
40percent interest in 11 concessions, predominantly in the
onshore and near-offshore regions of the niger delta. cnl
operates under a joint-venture arrangement with the nigerian
national petroleum corporation (nnpc), which owns the remaining
60percent interest. chevrontexacos subsidiaries
chevron oil company nigeria limited (cocnl) and texaco overseas
nigeria petroleum company unlimited (topcon) each hold a
20percent interest in six additional concessions. topcon
operates these concessions under a joint venture agreement with
nnpc, which owns the remaining 60percent interest.
effective november 2004, all the rights, duties, obligations,
assets and liabilities of topcon and cocnl were merged into
cnl.
in 2004, daily net production from the 38 operated fields
averaged 117,000barrels of crude oil, 2,000barrels
of lpg and 59million cubic feet of natural gas. certain
onshore operations in the western niger delta were suspended in
march 2003 as a result of community disturbance.
net onshore production capacity of about 45,000barrels of
oil per day has been shut-in since march 2003. the company has
adopted a phased plan to restore these operations and has taken
initial steps to determine the extent of damage and secure the
properties. the company has begun initial production-resumption
efforts in certain areas. the abiteye field, closest to the
escravos terminal, was returned to production in 2004.
restoration activities in the remaining fields will continue
through 2006.
in may 2004, chevrontexaco received a 100percent
contractor interest under a production-sharing contract
arrangement in opl (oil prospecting license)-247. this agreement
further increased the companys leading acreage position in
the nigerian deepwater trend.
the company also continued activities in the deepwater agbami
development. significant progress was made toward achieving
final governmental approvals and executing key agreements.
during 2004, the company drilled four development wells. in
early 2005, the agbami development had achieved the following
major milestones: conversion of opl-216 and opl-217 to oml (oil
mining lease)-127 and oml-128, approval of the field development
plan, award of the floating production, storage, and offloading
unit (fpso) contract, concurrence on the unit agreement and
project funding approval by partners. proved undeveloped
reserves were recognized for this project in 2002. prior to the
anticipated production start-up, in 2008, proved undeveloped
reserves would be reclassified to proved developed reserves. the
expected field life is approximately 20years.
chevrontexacos share of contractors interest under
the agbami production-sharing contract arrangements are
80percent in oml-127 and approximately 46percent in
oml-128.
in august 2003, the aparo discovery on opl-213 was extended with
a delineation well on opl-249. the aparo/ bonga sw fields
straddle opl-212, opl-213 and opl-249. chevrontexaco signed an
agreement with the operator of opl-212 in 2004 to conduct
technical studies in pursuit of a unitized joint development of
the aparo/ bongasw discovery. the timing of recognition of
proved undeveloped reserves will depend on the completion of
these studies and subsequent
table of contents
unitization. also on block opl-249, which contains the 2003
nsiko discovery, two additional appraisal wells were drilled in
2004. both wells confirmed the presence of producible crude oil
over the entire structure.
opl-222 activities continued in 2004 with the appraisal program
for the greater usan area and successful drilling of the fifth
and sixth wells. proved undeveloped reserves were recorded in
2004 for the usan field with development planned to enter the
basic engineering phase in 2005. initial production is estimated
to occur in 2009 before which time certain proved undeveloped
reserves would be reclassified to proved developed reserves. the
company holds a 30percent interest in this project.
at the escravos gas project (egp), onshore and offshore
engineering, procurement and construction bids were received in
2003. bids were reissued in 2004 following a review of the
project design and scope. start-up is expected in 2008 and
includes adding a second gas plant with 395million cubic
feet of capacity, which would increase capacity to
680million cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase
lpg and condensate exports to 43,000barrels per day.
chevrontexaco holds a 40percent interest in this project.
the company is also pursuing a planned gas-to-liquids facility
at escravos. lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction
bids for the planned gas-to-liquids facility at escravos were
opened in may 2004. construction is expected to begin during
2005, pending finalization of fiscal terms. the project is the
first to use the technology and operational expertise of the
sasol chevron global 50-50 joint venture. project start-up is
expected in 2008. proved undeveloped reserves associated with
egp were recognized in 2002. these reserves will be reclassified
to proved developed reserves as various stages of egp and
related projects are completed.
in november 2004, the company and its partners in the brass lng
project located in nigerias central niger delta, awarded
the contract for front-end engineering and design of its
two-train liquefied natural gas facility. the project is
expected to start up in 2010. no proved reserves have been
recognized for this project.
in early 2005, the company announced plans to conduct a
feasibility study on a potential lng project at olokola in
southwest nigeria. future decisions to move forward with olokola
lng will depend on the results of the feasibility study.
nigeria- so tom and prncipe joint
development zone (jdz): the company was awarded
jdzblock1 in 2004. in early 2005, the company signed
a production sharing contract with the joint development
authority, under which chevrontexaco will be the operator with a
51percent interest.
republic of congo: chevrontexaco has a 30percent
interest in nkossa, nsoko and moho-bilondo exploitation permits
and a 29percent interest in the marinevii kitina and
sounda exploitation permits, all of which are offshore republic
of congo and adjacent to the companys concessions in
angola. net production from the companys concessions in
the republic of congo averaged 12,000barrels of crude oil
per day in 2004. assessment of the moho and bilondo satellite
fields progressed during 2004, with the drilling of the
mobim1 well. work is in progress to determine the
development plan for the field.
southern africa: appraisal drilling is planned in 2005 to
assess the size and commerciality of the successful lianzi-1
well drilled in the 14k/a-imi unit, located between the republic
of congo and angola, in which the company is operator and holds
an approximate 31percent interest. timing is uncertain
regarding the recognition of proved reserves.

australia:chevrontexaco has a 17percent
interest in the north west shelf (nws) project offshore western
australia. daily net production from the project during 2004
averaged 17,000barrels of condensate, 305million
cubic feet of natural gas, 15,000barrels of crude oil and
4,000barrels of liquefied petroleum gas. approximately
70percent of the natural gas was sold, primarily under
long-term contracts, in the form of lng to major utilities in
japan and south korea. the remaining natural gas was sold to the
western australia domestic market. the train 4lng
expansion project completed during 2004 increased lng capacity
approximately 50percent and encompassed the installation
of a second 80-mile pipeline from the offshore natural gas
fields to onshore facilities. the first lng of train 4 was
produced in september 2004. a ninth lng carrier, operated by
chevron transport corporation ltd., was added to the
nws-controlled fleet. in december, the china guangdong lng sales
purchase agreement became unconditional and the equity agreement

operated and 50percent-owned erskine field had net daily
crude oil production of 8,000barrels and net natural gas
production of 41million cubic feet.
a crude oil and natural gas discovery was made in the fourth
quarter 2004 at the offshore 40percent-owned and operated
rosebank/ lochnagar well (213/27-1z) in the faroe-shetland
channel. further appraisal drilling is planned for 2005.
chevrontexaco holds a 19percent interest in clair, a
nonoperated development. platform and pipeline installation has
been successfully completed. one well has been pre-drilled, and
over 20 production and water injection wells are to be drilled

production began in february 2005 and is expected to reach an
average net daily production of 12,000barrels of crude oil
and 3million cubic feet of natural gas by 2006. initial
recognition of proved reserves was in 2001. some reserves were
reclassified from proved undeveloped to proved developed in late
2004. further reclassifications will occur through 2008 related
to planned development drilling. clair has an expected field
life of over 20years.
three producing assets, galley, orwell and statfjord fields,
were sold in the first half 2004. the impact of these sales on

f)affiliate operations
kazakhstan: the company holds a 50percent interest
in tengizchevroil (tco), which is developing the tengiz and
korolev crude oil fields located in western kazakhstan, under a
40-year concession that expires in 2033. net oil-equivalent
production averaged 178,000barrels per day in 2004.
tco is currently undertaking a significant expansion composed of
two integrated projects referred to as the sour gas
injection(sgi)/second generation project (sgp). at a total
cost in excess of $4billion, the expansion is designed to
increase tcos crude oil production capacity from
298,000barrels per day to between 430,000 and
500,000barrels per day by late 2006, depending on the
final effects of the sgi.
sgp involves the construction of a large processing train for
treating crude oil and the associated sour gas. the sgp design
is based on the same conventional technology employed in the
existing processing trains. in addition to new processing
capacity, sgp involves drilling and/or completing 55 production
wells in the tengiz and korolev reservoirs to generate the
volumes required for the new processing train. proved
undeveloped reserves associated with sgp were recognized in
2001. some of these reserves were reclassified to proved
developed in 2004 based upon completion of certain project
milestones. over the next decade, ongoing field development is
expected to result in the maturation of the current proved
undeveloped reserves to proved developed.
sgi involves taking a portion of the rich, sour gas separated
from the crude oil production at the sgp processing train and
re-injecting it into the tengiz and korolev reservoirs.
chevrontexaco expects that sgi will have two key effects. first,
sgi will reduce the sour gas processing capacity otherwise
required at sgp, thereby increasing liquid production capacity
and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that would
otherwise be generated. second, over time it is expected that
sgi will increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes
due to the maintenance of higher reservoir pressure from the gas
re-injection. between 2006 and 2008, the company anticipates
recognizing additional proved reserves associated with the sgi
expansion. the primary sgi risks include uncertainties about
compressor performance associated with injecting high-pressure
sour gas and subsurface responses to injection.
essentially all of tcos production is exported through the
cpc pipeline that runs from tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker
loading facilities at novorossiysk on the russian coast of the
black sea. cpc, which is expected to be expanded in stages
through the end of 2008, is anticipated to fully accommodate tco
expansion volumes by the end of 2007. tco is currently pursuing
alternate transportation routes to accommodate expansion volumes
prior to the end of 2007 as necessary.
venezuela: chevrontexaco has a 30percent interest
in the hamaca heavy oil production and upgrading project located

190,000barrels per day of heavy crude oil (8.5 api)
and upgrade into 180,000barrels of lighter, higher-value
crude oil (26 api). in 2004, net production averaged
24,000barrels of crude oil per day.

federal law requires that cargo transported between
u.s.ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
united states, owned and operated by u.s.entities and
manned by u.s.crews. at year-end 2004, the companys
u.s.flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting
refined products between the gulf coast and the east coast, and
from california refineries to terminals on the west coast and in
alaska and hawaii.
the international flag vessels were engaged primarily in
transporting crude oil from the middle east, indonesia, mexico
and west africa to ports in the united states, europe and asia.
refined products also were transported by tanker worldwide.
in addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural gas
(lng)tankers transporting cargoes for the north west shelf

assumed full operatorship of one of the tankers, the
northwest swan, on behalf of the projects
participants. additionally, the nws project has two lng tankers
under long-term time charter.
the federal oil pollution act of 1990 requires the scheduled
phase-out, by year-end 2010, of all single-hull tankers trading
to u.s.ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
u.s.exclusive economic zone. this has raised the demand
for double-hull tankers. by the end of 2004, chevrontexaco had a
total of 18company-operated double-hull tankers in
operation. the company is a member of many oil-spill-response
cooperatives in areas around the world in which it operates.

coal
the companys coal mining and marketing subsidiary, the
pittsburg& midway coal mining co. (p&m), owned and
operated two surface mines, mckinley, in new mexico, and
kemmerer, in wyoming, and one underground mine, north river, in
alabama, at year-end 2004. in addition, final reclamation
activities were under way at the york canyon and farco mines,
located in newmexico and texas, respectively. p&m also
owns an approximate 30percent interest in inter-american
coal holdingn.v., which has interests in coal mining
operations in venezuela as well as in trading and transportation
activities.
sales of coal from p&ms wholly owned mines and from
its affiliates were 14.6million tons, an increase of
9percent from 2003. the increase was primarily a result of
higher production at p&ms surface mine located near
gallup, newmexico.
at year-end 2004, p&m controlled approximately
167million tons of developed and undeveloped coal
reserves, including reserves of environmentally desirable
low-sulfur coal. the company is contractually committed to
deliver approximately 14million tons of coal per year
through the end of 2006 and believes it can satisfy these
contracts from existing coal reserves.
synthetic crude oil
in canada, chevrontexaco holds a 20percent nonoperating
interest in the athabasca oil sands project (aosp). bitumen is
extracted from oil sands and upgraded into synthetic crude oil
using hydroprocessing technology. the integrated operation at
aosp commenced in 2003 with ramp-up of production continuing in
2004. total 2004 bitumen production averaged
134,000barrels per day (about 27,000net barrels). at
full capacity in 2005, aosp is expected to reach total
production of 155,000barrels per day.
global power generation
chevrontexacos global power generation (gpg)has more
than 20years experience in developing and operating
commercial power projects. with 13 power assets located in the
united states and asia, gpg manages the production of more than
3,300 megawatts of electricity in its facilities. all of the
facilities are owned through joint ventures. the company
operates efficient gas-fired cogeneration facilities, some of
which produce steam for use in upstream operations to facilitate
production of heavy oil.
gas-to-liquids
the 50-50 sasol chevron global joint venture was established in
october 2000 to develop a worldwide gas-to-liquids
(gtl)business. in nigeria, construction for the planned
gas-to-liquids facility at escravos is expected to begin in
2005, pending finalization of fiscal terms. projects to build
gtl plants are being considered for qatar and australia.
research and technology
the companys energy technology company delivers integrated
technologies and services to the upstream, downstream and
gas-based businesses. these activities include deepwater
exploration and production systems, reservoir management and
optimization, heavy oil recovery and upgrading, shallow-water
production operations, gas-to-liquids processing, improved

energy is produced or consumed. the range of business spans
early-stage investing of venture capital in emerging
technologies to developing joint venture companies in new energy
systems, such as hydrogen infrastructure, advanced battery
systems, nano-materials and renewable energy applications.
chevrontexacos research and development expenses were
$242million, $228million and $221million for
the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
table of contents
because some of the investments the company makes in the areas
described above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, ultimate success is not certain. although not all
initiatives may prove to be economically viable, the
companys overall investment in this area is not
significant to the companys consolidated financial
position.
environmental protection
virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are
subject to various federal, state and local environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to change and increase in both number and
complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the
company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.
chevrontexaco expects more environmental-related regulations in
the countries where it has operations. most of the costs of
complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its
operations are embedded in the normal costs of conducting its
business.
in 2004, the companys u.s.capitalized environmental
expenditures were $145million, representing approximately
5percent of the companys total consolidated
u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures. these
environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
existing facilities, as well as those associated with new
facilities. the expenditures are predominantly in the petroleum
segment and relate mostly to air-and-water quality projects and
activities at the companys refineries, oil and gas
producing facilities, and marketing facilities. for 2005, the
company estimates u.s.capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities will be approximately
$240million. the future annual capital costs of fulfilling
this commitment are uncertain and will be governed by several
factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements.

chevrontexaco and on the companys 2004 environmental
expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
reserves are contained in managements discussion and

business environment and outlook
as shown in the special items table, net special gains of $1.2billion, associated mainly with
the disposition of non-strategic upstream assets, benefited income in 2004. in 2002, $2.3billion
of the $3.3billion of net charges related to the companys investment in its dynegy inc. affiliate. refer to page fs-11 for a discussion of the companys investment in dynegy.
the special
items recorded in 2002 through 2004 are not indicative of any future trends of events or their
impact on future earnings. because of the nature of special item-related events, the company may
not always be able to anticipate their occurrence or associated effects on income in any period.
apart from the effects of special-item gains and charges, the companys earnings depend largely on
the profitability of its upstream  exploration and production  and downstream  refining,
marketing and transportation  business segments. the single largest variable that affects the
companys results of operations is crude oil prices. overall earnings trends are typically less
affected by results from the companys commodity chemicals segment and other activities and
investments.
the companys long-term competitive position, particularly given the capital-intensive
and commodity-based nature of the industry, is closely associated with the companys ability to
invest in projects that provide adequate financial returns and to manage operating expenses
effectively. creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including
obtaining rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas, drilling success,
the ability to bring long-lead-time capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and
schedule, and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.
the company also continuously evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not key to
providing sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its
asset base to help sustain the companys growth. in addition to the asset-disposition and
restructuring plans announced in 2003, which generated $3.7billion of sales proceeds in 2004,
other such plans may also occur in future periods and result in significant gains or losses. refer
to the operating developments section on page fs-4 for a discussion that includes references to
the companys asset disposition activities.
fs-2
table of contents
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:
upstream
year-to-year changes in exploration and production earnings align most closely with industry price
levels for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external
factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global
economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damages and disruptions, competing fuel
prices, and regional supply interruptions that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest
or political uncertainty. moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit the companys
production capacity in an affected region. the company monitors developments closely in the
countries in which it operates and holds investments and attempts to manage risks in operating its
facilities and business. longer-term trends in earnings for this segment are also a function of
other factors besides price fluctuations, including changes in the companys crude oil and natural
gas production levels and the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude
oil and natural gas reserves.
the level of operating expenses associated with the efficient
production of oil and gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the companys control.
external factors include not only the general level of inflation but also prices charged by the
industrys product- and service-providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the
industrys own supply and demand conditions for such products and services. operating expenses can
also be affected by uninsured damages to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil
unrest.
industry price levels for crude oil reached record highs during 2004. for example, the price for
west texas intermediate (wti)crude oil, one of the benchmark crudes, reached $55 per barrel in
october2004. wti prices for the full year averaged $41 per barrel, an increase of approximately
$10 per barrel from 2003. the wti spot price per barrel at the end of february2005 was
approximately $51. these relatively high industry prices reflected, among other things, increased
demand from higher economic growth, particularly in asia and the united states, the heightened
level of geopolitical uncertainty in many areas of the world, crude oil supply concerns in the
middle east and other key producing regions, and production shut in for repairs following hurricane
ivan in the gulf of mexico in september2004.
during most of 2004, the differential in prices
between high quality, light-sweet crude oils, such as the u.s. benchmark
wti, and the heavier crudes was unusually wide. the upward trend in prices in 2004 for lighter
crude oils tracked the increased demand for light products, as all refineries could process these
higher quality crudes. however, the demand and price for the heavier crudes were dampened due to
the limited number of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock. the
company produces heavy crude oil (including volumes under an operating service agreement) in
california, indonesia, the partitioned neutral zone (between saudi arabia and kuwait) and
venezuela.
natural gas prices, particularly in the united states, were also higher in 2004 than in 2003.
benchmark prices in 2004 for henry hub u.s. natural gas peaked in october2004 above $8.50 per
thousand cubic feet (mcf). for the full year, prices averaged nearly $6.00 per mcf, compared with
$5.50 in 2003. at the end of february2005, the henry hub spot price was about $6.10 per mcf.
as compared with the supply and demand factors for natural gas in the united states and the
resultant trend in the henry hub benchmark prices, certain other regions of the world in which the
company operates have significantly different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances,
typically resulting in significantly lower average sales prices for the companys production of
natural gas. (refer to the table on page fs-10 for the companys average natural gas prices for the
united states and international regions.) additionally, excess supply conditions that exist in
certain parts of the world cannot easily serve to mitigate the relatively high-price conditions in
the united states and other developed markets because of lack of
infrastructure and the difficulties in transporting natural gas.
to help address this regional imbalance between supply and demand for natural gas, chevrontexaco
and other companies in the industry are planning increased investments in long-term projects in
areas of excess supply to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport
by tanker and additional investment to regasify the product in markets where demand is strong and
supplies are not as plentiful. due to the
fs-3
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
significance
of the overall investment in these long-term projects, the natural gas sales prices in the areas of
excess supply (before the natural gas is transferred to a company-owned or third-party processing
facility) are expected to remain well below sales prices for natural gas that is produced much
nearer to areas of high demand and that can be transported in existing natural gas pipeline
networks (as in the united states).
partially offsetting the benefit of higher crude oil and natural gas prices in 2004 was a 5
percent decline in the companys worldwide oil-equivalent production from the prior year, including
volumes produced from oil sands and production under an operating service agreement. the decrease
was largely the result of lower production in the united
states due to normal field declines, property sales and production curtailments resulting from
damages to producing operations caused by hurricane ivan. international oil-equivalent production
was down marginally between years. refer also to pages fs-7 for additional discussion and detail of
production volumes worldwide.
the level of oil-equivalent production in future periods is uncertain, in part because of opec
production quotas and the potential for local civil unrest and changing geopolitics that could
cause production disruptions. approximately 25percent of the companys net oil-equivalent
production in 2004, including volumes produced from oil sands and under an operating service
agreement, was in the opec-member countries of indonesia, nigeria and venezuela and in the
partitioned neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. although the companys production level
during 2004 was not constrained in these areas by opec quotas, future production could be affected
by opec-imposed limitations. future production levels also are affected by the size and number of
economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial
exploration and the beginning of production. refer to pages fs-4 through fs-6 for discussion of the
companys major upstream projects.
in certain onshore areas of nigeria, approximately 45,000 barrels per day of the companys net
production capacity has been shut in since march2003 because of civil unrest and damage to
production facilities. the company has adopted a phased plan to restore these operations and has
begun production-resumption efforts in certain areas.
as a result of hurricane ivan in september
2004, production in the fourth quarter was about 60,000 barrels per day lower than it otherwise
would have been. damages to producing facilities are expected to restrict oil-equivalent production
in the first quarter 2005 by approximately 35,000 barrels per day. most of the remaining shut-in
production is expected to be restored in the second quarter of 2005.
downstream refining, marketing and transportation earnings are closely tied to regional demand for
refined products and the associated effects on industry refining and marketing margins. the
companys core marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, latin
america, asia and sub-saharan africa.
specific factors influencing the companys profitability in this segment include the operating
efficiencies and expenses of the refinery network, including the effects of any downtime due to
planned and unplanned maintenance, refinery upgrade
projects and operating incidents. the level
of operating expenses can also be affected by the volatility of charter expenses for the companys
shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude-oil tankers. factors
beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation, especially energy costs to
operate the refinery network.
downstream earnings improved in 2004 compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of
increased demand and higher margins for the industrys refined products in most of the areas in
which the company and its equity affiliates have operations. in 2004, refined-product margins in
north america and asia were at their highest level in recent years. industry margins may be
volatile in the future, depending primarily on price movements for crude oil feedstocks, the demand
for refined products, inventory levels, refinery maintenance and mishaps, and other factors.
chemicals earnings in the petrochemicals segment are closely tied to global chemical demand,
inventory levels and plant capacities. additionally, feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to follow
crude oil and natural gas price movements, influence earnings in this segment.
earnings improved
in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily from the results of the companys 50percent-owned chevron
phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) affiliate, which recorded higher margins and sales volumes
for commodity chemicals and higher equity affiliate income.
operating developments
key operating developments and other events during 2004 and early 2005 included:
upstream
north america during 2004, the company closed on the sale of more than
300 producing properties and
other assets in the united states and canada, generating proceeds of $2.5billion. these sales, which accounted for
less than 10percent of the oil-equivalent production and reserves in north america, were part of
plans announced in 2003 to dispose of assets that did not provide sufficient long-term value to
the company and to improve the overall competitive performance and operating efficiency of the
companys exploration and production portfolio.
in the gulf of mexico, the company awarded two
major engineering contracts for the development of subsea systems and a floating production
facility to advance the development of the operated and 58percent-owned tahiti prospect, a major

results of operations
major operating areas the following section presents the results of operations for the companys
business segments, as well as for the departments and companies managed at the corporate level.
(refer to note 9 beginning on page fs-36 for a discussion of the companys reportable segments,
as defined in fas 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.) to
aid in the understanding of changes in segment income between periods, the discussion, when
applicable, is in two parts  first, on underlying trends and second, on special-item gains and
charges that tended to obscure these trends. in the following discussions, the term earnings is
defined as net income or segment income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles. this section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion of the companys

income from continuing operations in 2004 of nearly $3.9billion was about $700million higher than
in 2003. nearly $400million of the increase represented the difference in the effect on earnings
in the respective periods from special
items, which are discussed below. the remaining $300million improvement was composed of about a $1
billion benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices that was largely offset by the
effects of lower production.
income from continuing operations in 2003 was about $3.2billion, up approximately $1.5billion
from 2002. the benefit of higher prices between periods was about $1.7billion and was partially
offset by the effect of lower production.
the companys average liquids realization in 2004 was $34.12 per barrel, compared with $26.66 in
2003 and $21.34 in 2002. the average natural gas realization was $5.51 per thousand cubic feet in
2004, compared with $5.01 and $2.89 in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
net oil-equivalent production
averaged 817,000 barrels per day in 2004, down 12percent from 2003 and 19percent from 2002. the
lower production in 2004 included the effects of about 30,000 barrels per day associated with
property sales and 21,000 barrels per day of production shut in as a result of damages to
facilities from hurricane ivan in the third quarter. adjusting for the effects of property sales
and storms in all periods presented, oil-equivalent production in 2004 declined about 7percent
from 2003 and 14percent from 2002, mainly as a result of normal field declines that do not
typically reverse.
the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2004 averaged 505,000
barrels per day, a decline of 10percent from 2003 and 16percent from 2002. excluding the effects
of property sales and storms, net liquids production in 2004 declined 5percent and 11percent from
2003 and 2002, respectively.
net natural gas production averaged 1.9billion cubic feet per day in
2004, 16percent lower than 2003 and 22percent lower than 2002. adjusting for the effects of
property sales and storms, 2004 net natural gas production declined 10percent in 2003 and 17
percent in 2002.
refer to the selected operating data table on page fs-10 for the three-year
comparative production volumes in the united states.
segment income in 2004 included special gains of $366million from property sales, partially offset
by special charges of $55million resulting from an adverse litigation matter. net special charges
of $64million in 2003 were composed of charges of $103million for asset impairments, associated
mainly with the write-down of assets in anticipation of sale; charges of $38million for
restructuring and reorganization, mainly for employee severance costs; and gains of $77million
from property sales. special charges in 2002 totaled $214million, which included $183million for
the impairment of a number of fields caused by the write-down of proved reserves and $31million
for costs of environmental remediation.

income from continuing operations of $5.6billion in 2004 increased about $2.4billion from 2003.
approximately $1.1billion of the increase was associated with higher prices for crude oil and
natural gas. approximately $750million of the increase was the result of the effects of special
items in each period, which are discussed below. another $400million resulted from lower
income-tax expense between periods, including a benefit of about $200million in 2004 as
a result of changes in income tax laws. otherwise, the benefit of about $200million in lower
foreign currency losses was largely offset by higher transportation costs.
income from continuing operations of $3.2billion in 2003 was nearly $400million higher than in
2002. higher crude oil and natural gas prices accounted for an increase of about $900million,
which was partially offset by $400million from the effect of foreign currency changes and about
$100million of higher income tax-expense.
net oil-equivalent production of 1.7million barrels per
day in 2004  including other produced volumes of 140,000 net barrels per day from oil sands and
production under an operating service agreement  declined about 1percent from 2003 and 2percent
from 2002. excluding the lower production associated with property sales and reduced volumes
associated with cost-recovery provisions of certain production-sharing agreements, 2004 net
oil-equivalent production increased nearly 3percent from 2003 and 1percent from 2002  primarily
from higher oil-equivalent production in chad, kazakhstan and venezuela.
the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production,
including volumes produced from oil sands and under an operating service agreement, declined about 1percent from the
production level in 2003 and about 3percent from 2002. excluding the effects of property
sales and lower cost-recovery volumes under certain production-sharing agreements, 2004 net

production
increased about 1percent from 2003 and decreased about 1percent from 2002.
the net natural gas component of oil-equivalent production was up 1percent from 2003 and 6percent
from 2002. during 2004, production increases in angola, kazakhstan, denmark and australia were
partially offset by declines associated with asset sales. in 2003, areas with production increases
included australia, kazakhstan, the philippines and the united kingdom.
refer to the selected operating data table on page fs-10 for the three-year comparative of
international production volumes.
special-item gains in 2004 included $585million from the sale of producing properties in western
canada and $266million from the sale of other nonstrategic assets, including the companys
operations in the democratic republic of the congo and a canadian natural-gas processing business.
in 2003, net special gains of $98million included benefits of $150million related to income
taxes and property sales, partially offset by asset impairments in advance of sale and charges for
employee termination costs. in 2002, special charges of $137million included $100million for
asset impairments resulting from the write-down of proved reserves for fields in africa and
canada.

the earnings improvement in 2004 from both 2003 and 2002 was associated mainly with higher margins
for refined products. margins in 2004 were the highest in recent years. margins in 2002 were very
depressed, and at one point hovered near their 12-year lows.
sales volumes for refined products of approximately 1.5million barrels per day in 2004 increased
about 5percent from 2003. the increase between periods was primarily from higher sales of
gasoline, diesel fuel and fuel oil. branded gasoline sales volumes of 567,000 barrels per day
increased
2percent
from 2003. the sales improvement partially reflected the reintroduction of the texaco brand in the southeast.
in 2003, sales volumes for refined products declined about 10
percent from the prior year. industry demand in 2003 was weaker for branded gasoline, diesel and
jet fuels and sales were lower under certain supply contracts.
refer to the selected operating
data table on page fs-10 for the three-year comparative refined-product sales volumes in the
united states.
in 2003, net special charges of $123million included $160million for environmental
remediation and employee severance costs associated with the global downstream restructuring and
reorganization. these charges were partially offset by gains on asset sales. in 2002, special
charges of $215million included amounts for environmental remediation, the write-down of the el
paso refinery in advance of sale and a litigation matter.

the international downstream segment includes the companys consolidated refining and marketing
businesses, non-u.s. marine operations, non-u.s. supply and trading activities, and
equity earnings of affiliates, primarily in the asia-pacific region.
earnings of nearly $2billion in 2004 improved significantly from 2003 and 2002, mainly the result
of higher average margins for refined products for both company and affiliate operations and
higher earnings from international shipping operations. margins in

2004 were the highest in recent years. earnings in 2004 also included a benefit of $40million
related to changes in income tax laws.
total international refined products sales volumes were 2.4million barrels per day in 2004, more
than 4percent higher than 2.3million in 2003 and about 10percent higher than 2.2million in
2002. weak economic conditions dampened industry demand in 2002. refer to the selected operating
data table on page fs-10 for the three-year comparative refined-product sales volumes in the
international areas.
special charges of $189 million in 2003 included the write-down of the batangas refinery in the
philippines in advance of its conversion to a product terminal facility, employee severance costs
associated with the global downstream restructuring and reorganization, the impairment of certain assets in anticipation of
their sale, and the companys share of losses from an asset sale and asset impairment by an equity
affiliate. the special charge in 2002 was for a write-down of the companys investment in its
publicly traded caltex australia limited affiliate to its estimated fair value.

the chemicals segment includes the companys oronite division and the companys 50percent
share of its equity investment in chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem). in 2004, results
for the companys oronite subsidiary improved on higher sales volumes. earnings in 2004 for cpchem
increased as the result of increased chemical commodity margins and sales volumes and higher equity
affiliate income. protracted weak demand for commodity chemicals and industry oversupply

all other consists of the companys interest in dynegy, coal mining operations, power generation
businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative
functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.
the improvement between 2003 and 2004 was primarily associated with the companys investment in
dynegy, including gains from the redemption of certain dynegy securities, higher interest income,
lower interest expense, and favorable corporate-level tax adjustments. the net change between 2002
and 2003 was largely attributable to the differences in the effect of net special charges. the 2003
period also included lower interest expense and other corporate charges compared with 2002.
net special gains in 2003 included a benefit of $365million from the exchange of the companys
investment in dynegy preferred stock for cash and other dynegy securities. this benefit was
partially offset by charges for asset write-downs of $84million, primarily in the gasification
business, which was later sold; $40million for the companys share of an asset impairment by
dynegy; and employee severance costs of $16million.
special charges in 2002 included $2.3billion
related to dynegy, composed of $1.6billion for the write-down of the companys investment in
dynegy common and preferred stock to its estimated fair value and $680million for the companys
share of dynegys own special items for asset write-downs and revaluations, and a loss on an asset
sale. refer also to page fs-11 for information relating to the companys investment in dynegy.

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
explanations follow for variations between years for the amounts in the table above  after
consideration of the effects of special gains and charges  as well as for other income statement
categories. refer to the preceding segment discussions in this section for information relating to
special gains and charges.
sales and other operating revenues were $151billion in 2004, compared with $120billion in 2003
and $98billion in 2002. revenues increased in 2004 and 2003 primarily from higher prices for crude
oil, natural gas and refined products worldwide.
income (loss)from equity affiliates increased in 2004 and 2003, as earnings improved for a number
of affiliates, including downstream affiliates in the asia-pacific area, tengizchevroil, cpchem,
dynegy and the caspian pipeline consortium.
other income in 2004 included net gains of $1.6billion, primarily from upstream property sales,
compared with gains of $286million and $94million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. interest income
increased to $199million in 2004, compared with about $120million in 2003 and 2002, as a result
of higher balances of cash and marketable securities. foreign currency losses were $60million,
$199million and $5million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
purchased crude oil and products were $94billion in 2004, an increase of 32percent from 2003, due
mainly to higher prices and increased purchases of crude oil and products. crude oil and product
purchases increased about 25percent in 2003, primarily due to significantly higher prices for
crude oil, natural gas and refined products.
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of $14billion increased from $13billion
in 2003. the increases in 2004 included costs for chartering of crude oil tankers and other
transportation expenses. during 2003, operating, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased nearly $1billion, primarily from higher freight rates for international shipping
operations and higher costs associated with employee pension plans and other employee-benefit
expenses.
exploration expenses were $697million in 2004, $570million in 2003 and $591million in 2002. in
2004, amounts were higher for international operations, primarily for seismic costs and expenses
associated with evaluating the feasibility of different project alternatives.
depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses did not change materially between years after
consideration of the effects of special-item charges.
interest and debt expense was $406million in 2004, compared with $474million in 2003 and $565
million in 2002. the lower amount in 2004 reflected lower average debt balances. the decline
between 2003 and 2002 reflected lower average interest rates on commercial paper and other
variable-rate debt and lower average debt levels.
taxes other than on income were $19.8billion, $17.9billion and $16.7billion in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. the increase in 2004 and 2003 primarily reflected the weakening u.s. dollar on
foreign currency-denominated duties in the companys european downstream operations.
income tax expense corresponded to effective tax rates of 37percent in 2004, 43percent in 2003
and 45percent in 2002 after taking into account the effect of net special items. refer also to
note 17 on page fs-42 to the consolidated financial statements.
merger-related expenses were $576million in 2002. no merger-related expenses were reported in 2004
or 2003, reflecting the completion of merger integration activities in 2002.

information related to investment in dynegy inc.
at year-end 2004, chevrontexaco owned an approximate 25percent equity interest in the common stock
of dynegy  an energy provider engaged in power generation, gathering and processing of natural
gas, and the fractionation, storage, transportation and marketing of natural gas liquids. the
company also held an investment in dynegy preferred stock.
investment in dynegy common stock at december31, 2004, the carrying value of the companys
investment in dynegy common stock was approximately $150million. this amount was about $365
million below the companys proportionate interest in dynegys underlying net assets. this
difference is primarily the result of write-downs of the investment in 2002 for declines in the
market value of the common shares below the companys carrying value that were deemed to be other
than temporary. the difference has been assigned to the extent practicable to specific dynegy
assets and liabilities, based upon the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the
decline in value of the dynegy shares. the companys equity share of dynegys reported earnings is
adjusted quarterly when appropriate to recognize a portion of the difference between these
allocated values and dynegys historical book values. the market value of the companys investment
in dynegys common stock at december31, 2004, was approximately $450million.
investments in dynegy notes and preferred stock at the beginning of 2004, the company held $223
million face value of dynegy junior unsecured subordinated notes due 2016 and $400million face
value of dynegy seriesc convertible preferred stock with a stated maturity of 2033.
the junior notes were redeemed at face value during 2004, and gains of $54million were recorded for the
difference between the face amounts and the carrying values at the time of redemption. the face
value of the companys investment in the seriesc preferred stock at december31, 2004, was $400
million. the stock is recorded at its fair value, which was estimated to be $370million at
december31, 2004. future temporary changes in the estimated fair value of the preferred stock will
be reported in other comprehensive income. however, if any future decline in fair value is deemed
to be other than temporary, a charge against income in the period would be recorded. dividends
received from the preferred stock are recognized in income each period.
liquidity and capital resources
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total balances were $10.7billion and $5.3billion
at december31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was
$14.7billion, compared with $12.3billion in 2003 and $9.9billion in 2002. these amounts were net
of contributions to employee pension plans of $1.6billion, $1.4billion and $246million in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. the 2004 increase in cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected higher earnings in the worldwide upstream and downstream businesses. cash provided by
investing activities included proceeds from asset sales of $3.7billion in 2004, $1.1billion in
2003 and $2.3billion in 2002.
cash provided by operating activities and asset sales during 2004
was sufficient to fund the companys capital and exploratory program, pay $3.2billion of
dividends to stockholders, reduce total debt by $1.3billion, repurchase $2.1billion of common
stock, and increase the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $5.5
billion.
dividends payments of approximately $3.2billion in 2004 and $3billion in 2003 and 2002 were made
for dividends. in
september2004, the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 10percent to 40 cents
per share, on a post-stock split basis.
debt, capital lease and minority interest obligations total debt and capital lease balances were
$11.3billion at december31, 2004, down from $12.6billion at year-end 2003. the company also had
minority interest obligations of $172million, down from $268million at december31, 2003.
the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of
commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $5.6billion at december31,
2004, down from $6.0billion at december31, 2003. of these amounts, $4.7billion and $4.3billion
were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. at year-end 2004,
settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2005, as
the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. the companys practice has been to continually refinance its
commercial paper, maintaining levels it believes appropriate.
at year-end 2004, chevrontexaco had
$4.7billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, which permitted the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper
borrowings and also can be used for general corporate purposes. the companys practice has been to
continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms,
maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be
unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average
of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong
credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2004. in
addition, the company had three existing effective shelf registrations on file with the
securities and exchange commission (sec)that together would permit additional registered debt
offerings up to an aggregate of $3.8billion of debt securities.
in 2004, repayments of long-term
debt at maturity included $500million of 6.625percent chevrontexaco corporation bonds, an
aggregate $265million of various philippine debt and $240million of chevrontexaco corporation
8.11percent notes.

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
in the third quarter 2004, $300million of 6percent texaco capital inc., due june2005, were also
retired.
texaco capital llc, a wholly owned finance subsidiary, issued deferred preferred shares, seriesc
(seriesc), in december1995. in february2005, the company redeemed the seriesc and accumulated
dividends at a cost of approximately $140million.
in january2005, the company contributed $98
million to permit the esop to make a $144million debt service payment, which included a principal
payment of $113million.
in the second quarter 2004, chevrontexaco entered into $1billion of interest rate fixed-to-floating
swap transactions. under the terms of the swap agreements, of which $250million and $750
million terminate in september2007 and february2008, respectively, the net cash settlement will
be based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts.
chevrontexacos senior debt is rated aa by standard and poors corporation and aa2 by moodys
investor service, except for senior debt of texaco capital inc., which is rated aa3.
chevrontexacos u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poors and prime 1 by moodys,
and the companys canadian commercial paper is rated r-1 (middle)by dominion bond rating service.
all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. further reductions
from debt balances at december31, 2004, are dependent upon many factors, including managements
continuous assessment of debt as an appropriate component of the companys overall capital
structure. the company believes it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash
requirements, and during periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for
refined products and commodity chemicals, the company believes that it has the flexibility to
increase borrowings or modify capital-spending plans or both to continue paying the common stock
dividend and maintain the companys high-quality debt ratings.
tengizchevroil funding as part of the funding of the expansion of tengizchevroils (tco)production
facilities, in the fourth quarter 2004 chevrontexaco purchased from tco $2.2billion of 6.124
percent seriesb notes (seriesb), due 2014. interest on the notes is payable semiannually, and
principal is to be repaid semi-annually in equal installments beginning in february2008.
immediately following the purchase of
the seriesb, chevrontexaco received from tco approximately
$1.8billion, representing a repayment of subordinated loans from the company, interest
and
dividends. the $2.2billion investment in the seriesb notes, which the company intends to hold
until maturity, and the $1.8billion distribution were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
to investments and advances.
common stock repurchase program the company announced a stock repurchase program on march31, 2004.
acquisitions of up to $5billion may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, as permitted
by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other
factors. the program is for a period of up to three years and may be discontinued at any time. the
company purchased 42,324,000 shares in the open market for $2.1billion through december2004.
purchases through february2005 increased the total shares acquired to 47,969,000 for $2.4billion.
capital and exploratory expenditures total reported expenditures for 2004 were $8.3billion,
including $1.56billion for the companys share of affiliates expenditures, which did not require
cash outlays by the company. in 2003 and 2002, expenditures were $7.4billion and $9.3billion,
respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $1.1billion and $1.4
billion in the corresponding periods. of the total 2004 reported expenditures, $6.3billion, or 76
percent, was for upstream activities, compared with 77percent in 2003 and 68percent in 2002.
international upstream accounted for 71percent of the worldwide upstream total in 2004 and 2003
and 70percent in 2002, reflecting the companys continuing focus on international exploration and
production activities.
expenditures in 2004 increased 13percent compared with 2003, primarily
driven by higher upstream expenditures. downstream spending increased 21percent from 2003.
expenditures were higher in 2002 than in 2003, due in part to large lease acquisitions in the north
sea and the gulf of mexico, spending for the athabasca oil sands project in western canada, and
additional common stock investments in dynegy.
including its share of spending by affiliates, the company estimates 2005 capital and exploratory
expenditures at $10billion, which is about 20percent higher than 2004. about $7.4billion, or 74
percent of the total, is targeted for exploration and production activities, with $4.9billion of
that amount targeted for outside the united states. the upstream spending is targeted for the most
promising exploratory prospects in the deepwater gulf of mexico and west africa and major
development projects in angola, nigeria, kazakhstan and the deepwater gulf of mexico. included in
the upstream expenditures is about $400million to develop the companys international natural gas
resource base.
worldwide downstream spending in 2005 is estimated at $1.9billion, with about $1.5

and $400million for supply and transportation projects, including pipelines to support expanded
upstream production.
investments in chemicals businesses in 2005 are budgeted at $200million. estimates for energy
technology, information technology and facilities, and power-related businesses total approximately
$500million.
pension obligations in 2004, the companys pension plan contributions totaled $1.6
billion (approximately $1.3billion to the u.s. plans). in 2005, the company expects contributions
to be approximately $400million. actual amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in
pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may be
required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. refer
also to the discussion of pension accounting in critical accounting estimates and assumptions
beginning on page fs-18.
financial ratios
current ratio  current assets divided by current liabilities. the current ratio is adversely
affected by the fact that chevrontexacos inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out (lifo)
basis. at year-end 2004, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on
average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $3.0billion.
interest coverage ratio  income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and
amortization of capitalized interest, divided by before-tax interest costs. the companys interest
coverage ratio was higher in 2004, primarily due to higher before-tax income and lower average debt
balances.
debt ratio  total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity. the decrease between
the comparable periods was due to lower average debt levels and higher retained earnings.

at december31, 2004, the company and its subsidiaries provided guarantees either directly or indirectly, of $963million for
notes and other contractual obligations of affiliated companies and $130million for
third parties as described by major category below. there are no amounts being carried as
liabilities for the companys obligations
under these guarantees.
of the $963million in guarantees provided to affiliates, $774million
relate to borrowings for capital projects or general corporate purposes. these guarantees were
undertaken to achieve lower interest rates and generally cover the construction period of the
capital projects. approximately 90percent of the amounts guaranteed will expire by 2009, with the
remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. under the terms of the guarantees, the company
would be required to fulfill the guarantee should an affiliate be in default of its loan terms,
generally for the full amounts disclosed. there are no recourse provisions, and no assets are held
as collateral for these guarantees. the $189million balance of the $963million represents
obligations in connection with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of its cogeneration
affiliates. under the terms of these guarantees, the company may be required to make payments
under certain conditions if the affiliate does not perform under the agreements. there are no
recourse provisions to third parties, and no assets are held as collateral for these pricing
guarantees.
guarantees of $130million have been provided to third parties, including guarantees of
approximately $40million of construction loans to host governments in the companys international
upstream operations. the remaining guarantees of $90million were provided principally as
conditions of sale of the companys interest in certain operations, to provide a source of
liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with company marketing programs. no amounts
of the companys obligations under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities. about 70percent
of the total amounts guaranteed will expire in 2009, with the remainder expiring after 2009. the
company would be required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in
default of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. approximately $70
million of the guarantees have recourse provisions, which enable the company to recover any
payments made under the terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties
assets.
at december31, 2004, chevrontexaco also had outstanding guarantees for approximately $215million
of equilon debt and leases. following the february2002 disposition of its interest in equilon, the
company received an indemnification from shell

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
oil company (shell) for any claims arising from the guarantees. the company has not recorded a
liability for these guarantees. approximately 45percent of the amounts guaranteed will expire
within the 2005 through 2009 period, with the guarantees of the remaining amounts expiring by 2019.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and
motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the indemnities cover certain contingent liabilities,
including those associated with the unocal patent litigation. the company would be required to
perform should the indemnified liabilities become actual losses. should that occur, the company
could be required to make future payments up to $300million. through the end of 2004, the company
paid approximately $28million under these contingencies and had agreed to pay approximately $10
million additional under an award of arbitration, subject to minor adjustments yet to be resolved.
the company may receive additional requests for indemnification payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities related
to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the periods of texacos ownership interests in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims relating to equilon indemnities must be asserted either as early as february
2007, or no later than february2009, and claims relating to motiva must be asserted no later than
february2012. under the terms of the indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of
potential future payments. the company has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims under
these indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the
indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts
recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or motiva
prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
securitization in other
off-balance-sheet arrangements, the company securitizes certain retail and trade accounts
receivable in its downstream business through the use of qualifying special purpose entities
(spes). at december31, 2004, approximately $1.2billion, representing about 10percent of
chevrontexacos total current accounts receivable balance, were securitized. chevrontexacos total
estimated financial exposure under these securitizations at december31, 2004, was approximately
$50million. these arrangements have the effect of accelerating chevrontexacos collection of the
securitized amounts. in the event of the spes experiencing major defaults in the collection of
receivables, chevrontexaco believes that it would have no loss exposure connected with third-party
investments in these securitizations.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements, and
take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements, and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements.
the agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum
products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. the aggregate
approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are 2005  $1.6billion;
2006  $1.7billion; 2007  $1.6billion; 2008  $1.5billion; 2009  $1.5billion; 2010 and after
$2.3billion. total payments under the agreements were approximately $1.6billion in 2004, $1.4
billion in 2003 and $1.2billion in 2002. the most significant take-or-pay agreement calls for
the company to purchase approximately 55,000 barrels per day of refined products from an equity
affiliate refiner in thailand. this purchase agreement is in conjunction with the financing of a
refinery owned by the affiliate and expires in 2009. the future estimated commitments under this
contract are: 2005  $1.2billion; 2006  $1.2billion; 2007  $1.3billion; 2008  $1.3billion;
and 2009  $1.3billion. additionally, in 2004 the company entered into a 20-year agreement to
acquire regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal. payments of $1.2billion over the
20-year period are expected to commence in 2010.
minority interests the company has commitments of
approximately $172million related to minority interests in subsidiary companies.

financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instruments chevrontexaco is exposed to market risks related to the volatility
of crude oil, refined products, electricity, natural gas and refinery feedstock prices. the
company uses financial derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility
on a small portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for
the purchase or sale of crude oil and refined products; feedstock purchases for company refineries; crude oil and refined products inventories; and fixed-price contracts to sell natural gas
and natural gas liquids.
fs-14
table of contents
chevrontexaco also uses financial derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes, and the
results of this activity were not material to the companys financial position, net income or cash
flows in 2004.
the companys positions are monitored and reported on a daily basis by an internal risk control
group to ensure compliance with the companys risk management policy that has been approved by the
audit committee of the companys board of directors.
the financial derivative instruments used in the companys risk management and trading activities
consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange
and the international petroleum exchange. in addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product
swap contracts and options contracts are entered into principally with major financial
institutions and other oil and gas companies in the over-the-counter markets.
virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are
recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected
in income. fair values are derived principally from market quotes and other independent third-party
quotes.
each hypothetical 10percent increase in the price of natural gas and crude oil would increase the
fair value of the natural gas derivative contracts by approximately $40million and reduce the fair
value of the crude oil derivative contracts by about $15million. the same hypothetical decreases
in the prices of these commodities would result in the same opposite effects on the fair values of
the contracts.
the hypothetical effect on these contracts was estimated by calculating the cash value of the
contracts as the difference between the hypothetical and contract delivery prices multiplied by the
contract amounts.
foreign currency the company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180
days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
the aggregate effect on foreign exchange contracts of a hypothetical 10percent change to year-end
exchange rates would be approximately $50million.
interest rates the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps
relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
during 2004, four new swaps
were initiated to hedge a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt. at year-end 2004, the weighted
average maturity of receive fixed interest rate swaps was approximately three years. there were
no receive floating swaps outstanding at year end.
a hypothetical increase of 10 basis points in market-fixed interest rates would reduce the fair
value of the receive fixed swaps by approximately $4million.
for the financial and derivative instruments discussed above, there was not a material change in
market risk from that presented in 2003.
the hypothetical variances used in this section were selected for illustrative purposes only and do
not represent the companys estimation of market changes. the actual impact of future market
changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those
set forth under the heading risk factors in part i, item1 of this annual report.
transactions with related parties
chevrontexaco enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. these arrangements include long-term supply and offtake agreements.
internationally, there are long-term purchase agreements in place with the companys refining affiliate in thailand. refer to page fs-14 for further discussion. management believes the foregoing
agreements and others have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been
negotiated with an unrelated party.
litigation and other contingencies
mtbe the company and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive.
the company is a party to more than 70 lawsuits and claims,
the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use
of mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepage of mtbe into groundwater.
resolution of these actions may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged
effects on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional
lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in
the future.
the companys ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable,
but could be material to net income in any one period. the company does not use mtbe in the
manufacture of gasoline in the united states and there are no detectable levels of mtbe in that
gasoline.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe,
by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, oil fields,
service stations, terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. the
following table displays the annual changes to the companys before-tax environmental remediation
reserves, including those for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws. in
2004, the company recorded additional provisions for estimated remediation costs primarily at refined products marketing sites and various operating, closed or divested facilities in the united
states.

the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2004 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
fs-15
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
as of december31, 2004, chevrontexaco was involved with the remediation activities of 210 sites at
which it had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise by the u.s. environmental
protection agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the
federal superfund law or analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at
year-end 2004 was $107million. the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for
joint and several liability for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other
regulatory agencies to require chevrontexaco to assume other potentially responsible parties costs
at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the
companys consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2004 environmental reserves balance of $940million, $712million related to more than
2,000 sites for the companys u.s. downstream operations,
including refineries and other plants, marketing locations
(i.e., service stations and terminals), and pipelines. the remaining $228
million was associated with various sites in the international downstream ($111million), upstream
($69million) and chemicals ($48million). liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or
divested, were primarily associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or
groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following:
site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation
and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and
treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded,
for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown
timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties. although the amount of future costs may be material to the
companys results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, the company does not
expect these costs will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had or
will have any significant impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or
international petroleum or chemical companies.
prior to january1, 2003, additional reserves for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of its
worldwide oil and gas and coal properties at the end of their productive lives, which
included
costs related to environmental issues, were recognized on a unit-of-production basis as accumulated
depreciation, depletion and amortization. effective january1, 2003, the company implemented fas
143, accounting for asset retirement obligations. under fas143, the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when there is a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably
estimated. the liability balance for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2004 was $2.9
billion. refer also to note25 on page fs-53 related to fas 143.
for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no
provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end
of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as
the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevents estimation of the fair value
of the asset retirement obligation.
refer to environmental matters on page fs-18 for additional information related to environmental
matters.
income taxes the company estimates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these
liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years
after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been estimated. the u.s. federal
income tax liabilities have been settled through 1996 for chevrontexaco (formerly chevron), 1997
for chevrontexaco global energy inc. (formerly caltex), and 1991 for texaco. california franchise
tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for chevron and through 1987 for texaco. settlement
of open tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries where the company conducts its
businesses, is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or
liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for
income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
global operations chevrontexaco and its affiliates have operations in approximately 180 countries.
areas in which the company and its affiliates have significant operations include the united
states, canada, australia, the united kingdom, norway, denmark, france, the partitioned neutral
zone between kuwait and saudi arabia, republic of congo, angola, nigeria, chad, south africa,
indonesia, the philippines, singapore, china, thailand, venezuela, argentina, brazil, colombia,
trinidad and tobago, and south korea. the companys caspian pipeline consortium (cpc)affiliate
operates in russia and kazakhstan. the companys tengizchevroil affiliate operates in kazakhstan.
the companys cpchem affiliate manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a
worldwide basis, with manufacturing facilities in the united states, puerto rico, singapore, china,
south korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and belgium.
the companys operations, particularly
exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political
environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. as has
occurred in the past, actions could be taken by host governments to increase public ownership of
the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties on
the companys operations or both.
fs-16
table of contents
in certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in
others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other governments may affect the companys
operations. those developments have at times significantly affected the companys related
operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of
current and future activity in such countries.
equity redetermination for crude oil and natural gas producing operations, ownership agreements may
provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas
reserves. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be
material to earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermina-tion process has been under
way since 1996 for chevrontexacos interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve
at elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by
the u.s. department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the
four zones. chevrontexaco currently estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200million. at the same time, a possible maximum net amount that could be owed to
chevrontexaco is estimated at about $50million. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount
within this range of estimates are uncertain.
suspended wells the company suspends the costs of
exploratory wells pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the related crude
oil and natural gas fields. the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the
results of future drilling activity or development decisions or both. if the company decides not to
continue development, the costs of these wells are expensed. at december31, 2004, the company had
$671million of suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an
increase of $122million from 2003 and an increase of $193million from 2002. the balance at
year-end 2004 primarily reflects drilling activities in the united states and nigeria.
the sec has
issued several comment letters to companies in the oil and gas industry related to the accounting
for suspended exploratory wells, particularly for those suspended under certain circumstances for
more than one year.
the companys accounting policy in this regard is to capitalize the cost of exploratory wells
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that find proved
reserves remain capitalized. costs also are
capitalized for wells that find commercially producible reserves that cannot be classified as
proved, pending one or more of the following: (1)decisions on additional major capital
expenditures, (2)the results of additional exploratory wells that are under way or firmly
planned, and (3)securing final regulatory approvals for development. otherwise, well costs are
expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year
following completion of drilling. all other exploratory well costs are expensed.
this topic was discussed at the september2004 meeting of the emerging issues task force (eitf)as
issue 04-9, accounting for suspended well costs (eitf 04-9). the discussion centered on whether
certain circumstances would permit the continued capitalization of the costs for an exploratory
well beyond one year in the absence of plans for another exploratory well. the outcome of the
september2004 eitf meeting was agreement
between the eitf and the fasb that the circumstances
outlined were inconsistent with the provisions in fasb statement no.19,
financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies (fas 19), and an amendment
of fas 19 would be required to formally adopt this view. in february2005, the fasb issued a
proposed fasb staff position (fsp)to amend fas 19. refer to note 21 on page fs-45 to the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this fsp, the secs comment letters and the
companys costs associated with suspended exploratory wells.
the future trend of the companys exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated with
well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as to
whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. the effect on exploration
expenses in future periods for the $671million of suspended wells at year-end 2004 is uncertain,
given the referenced deliberations by the sec and fasb, as is the effect on the normal
project-evaluation and future drilling activities for all of the wells that have been suspended.
accounting for buy/sell contracts in january and february 2005, the securities and exchange
commission (sec)issued comment letters to chevrontexaco and other companies in the oil and gas
industry requesting disclosure of information related to the accounting for buy/sell contracts.
under a buy/sell contract, a company agrees to buy a specific quantity and quality of a commodity
to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity
and quality of a commodity at a different location to the same counterparty. physical delivery
occurs for each side of the transaction, and the risk and reward of ownership are evidenced by
title transfer, assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling, credit risk, and risk
of nonperformance by the counterparty. both parties settle each side of the buy/sell through
separate invoicing.
the company routinely has buy/sell contracts, primarily in the united states
downstream business, associated with crude oil and refined products. for crude oil, these
contracts are used to facilitate the companys crude oil marketing activity, which includes the
purchase and sale of crude oil production, fulfillment of the companys supply arrangements as to
physical delivery location and crude oil specifications, and purchase of crude oil to supply the
companys refining system. for refined products, buy/sell arrangements are used to help fulfill
the companys supply agreements to customer locations and specifications.
the company accounts for buy/sell transactions in the consolidated statement of income the same as
any other monetary transaction for which title passes, and the risk and reward of ownership are
assumed by the counterparties. at issue with the sec is whether the industrys accounting for
buy/sell contracts instead should be shown net on the income statement and accounted for under the
provisions of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.29, accounting for nonmonetary
transactions (apb 29).
the topic is under deliberation by the emerging issues task force (eitf)of the fasb as issue no.
04-13, accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty. the eitf first discussed this issue in november2004. additional research is being performed by the fasb
staff, and the topic will be discussed again at a future eitf meeting. while this issue is under
deliberation, the sec staff directed chevrontexaco and other companies in its january and february
2005 comment letters to disclose on the face of the income statement the amounts asso-
fs-17
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
ciated with
buy/sell contracts and to discuss in a footnote to the financial statements the basis for the
underlying accounting.
with regard to the latter, the companys accounting treatment for buy/sell
contracts is based on the view that such transactions are monetary in nature. monetary transactions
are outside the scope of apb 29. the company believes its accounting is also supported by the
indicators of gross reporting of purchases and sales in paragraph 3 of eitf issue no.99-19,
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent. additionally, fasb interpretation
no.39, offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts (fin 39), prohibits a receivable from
being netted against a payable when the receivable is subject to credit risk unless a right of
offset exists that is enforceable by law. the company also views netting the separate components of
buy/sell contracts in the income statement to be inconsistent
with the gross presentation that fin 39 requires for the resulting receivable and payable on the
balance sheet.
the companys buy/sell transactions are also similar to the barrel back example
used in other accounting literature, including eitf issue no.03-11, reporting realized gains and
losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no.133 and not held for
trading purposes as defined in issue no.02-3 (which indicates a companys decision to show
buy/sell-types of transactions gross on the income statement as being a matter of judgment of the
relevant facts and circumstances of the companys activities) and derivatives implementation group
(dig)issue no.k1, miscellaneous: determining whether separate transactions should be viewed as a
unit".
the company further notes that the accounting for buy/sell contracts as separate purchases and
sales is in contrast to the accounting for other types of contracts typically described by the
industry as exchange contracts, which are considered non-monetary in nature and appropriately shown
net on the income statement. under an exchange contract, for example, one company agrees to
exchange refined products in one location for another companys same quantity of refined products
in another location. upon transfer, the only amounts that may be invoiced are for transportation
and quality differentials. among other things, unlike buy/sell contracts, the obligations of each
party to perform under the contract are not independent and the risks and rewards of ownership are
not separately transferred.
as shown on the companys consolidated statement of income, sales and other operating revenues
for the three years ending december31, 2004, included $18,650million, $14,246million and $7,963
million, respectively, for buy/sell contracts. these revenue amounts associated with buy/sell
contracts represented 12percent of total sales and other operating revenues in 2004 and 2003 and
8percent in 2002. the costs associated with these buy/sell revenue amounts are included in
purchased crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income in each period.
other contingencies chevrontexaco receives claims from, and submits claims to, customers, trading
partners, u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers,
and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant
and may take lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close,
abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together,
may result in gains or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. an obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevrontexaco sites where company products
have been handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards. using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute,
chevrontexaco estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2004 at approximately $1.1billion
for its consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were $285million of environmental
capital expenditures and approximately $810million of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or
divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sites.
for 2005, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $710million. these
capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and
the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with existing and new environmental laws and regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by
prior releases of hazardous materials. although these costs may be significant to the results of
operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the
companys liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting
principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such
fs-18
table of contents
information over different
reporting periods. all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates or assumptions is according to
the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to
change;
2.
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or
operating performance is material.
besides those meeting these critical criteria, the company makes many other accounting estimates
and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. although not
associated with highly uncertain matters, these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting rules
that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be more likely than not. another
example is the estimation of oil and gas reserves under sec rules that require ... geological and
engineering data (that)demonstrate with reasonable certainty (reserves)to be recoverable in
future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices
and costs as of the date the estimate is made. refer to table v, reserve quantity information,
beginning on page fs-63 for the changes in these estimates for the three years ending december31,
2004, and to table vii, changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
from proved reserves, on page fs-68 for estimates of proved-reserve values for each year-end
20022004, which were based on year-end prices at the time. note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
exploration and production activities. the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are
important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical accounting policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment
and investments in affiliates on page fs-20 includes reference to conditions under which downward
revisions of proved reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and gas properties. this
commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this discussion and in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates, uncertainties, contingencies
and new accounting standards. significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements on page fs-30. the development and selection of accounting
estimates and assumptions, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in
this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of
directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company
are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension plan expense is based
on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are the expected long-
term rate of
return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. for other
postretirement employee benefit (opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care and life
insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical assumptions
in determining opeb expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations and the assumed
health care cost-trend rates used in the calculation of benefit obligations.
note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-46, includes information for
the three years ending december31, 2004, on the components of pension and opeb expense and the
underlying assumptions as well as on the funded status for the companys pension plans at the end
of 2004 and 2003.
to estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company employs a
rigorous process that incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of
expected future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class
factors. asset allocations are regularly updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and
the determination of the companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these
studies. for example, the expected long-term rate of return on united states pension plan assets,
which account for about 70percent of the companys pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8
percent since 2002.
the year-end market-related value of u.s. pension plan assets used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to
the end of the year. for plans outside the united states, market value of assets as of the
measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine pension and postretirement benefit plan
obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt
instruments. at december31, 2004, the company calculated the u.s. pension obligation using a 5.8
percent discount rate. the discount rates used at the end of 2003 and 2002 were 6percent and 6.8
percent, respectively.
an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount
rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2004 was $564
million. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return
assumption, a 1percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the companys primary
u.s. pension plan, which accounted for about 60percent of the company-wide pension obligation,
would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2004 by approximately $45million. a 1percent
increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced total benefit plan expense for
2004 by approximately $115million. the actual rates of return on plan assets and discount rates
may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial
markets.
in 2004, the companys pension plan contributions totaled $1.6billion (approximately $1.3billion
to the u.s. plans). in 2005, the company expects contributions to be approximately $400million.
actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may be required if
investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
pension expense is recorded on the consolidated statement of income in operating expenses or
selling, general and administrative expenses and applies to all business segments. depending upon
the funding status of the different plans, either a long-term prepaid asset or a long-term
liability is recorded. any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation in excess of recorded
liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income. see note 22 to the consolidated financial
statements beginning on page fs-46 for the pension-related balance sheet effects at the end of 2004
and 2003.
for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2004 was $197million and was also recorded as
operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses in all business segments. at
december31, 2004, the discount rate applied to the companys opeb obligations was 5.8percentthe same discount rate used for u.s. pension obligations. effective january1, 2005, the company
amended its main u.s. postretirement medical plan to limit future increases in the company
contribution. for current retirees, the increase in company contribution is capped at 4percent
each year. for future retirees, the 4percent cap will be effective at retirement. before
retirement, the assumed health care cost trend rates start with 10.6percent in 2004 and gradually
drop to 4.8percent for 2010 and beyond. once the employee elects to retire, the trend rates are
capped at 4percent.
as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb
expense in 2004, a 1percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary u.s. opeb
plan, which accounted for about 90percent of the companywide opeb obligation, would have decreased
opeb expense by approximately $20million.
impairment of property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its
property, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such
indicators include changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and, for
crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved reserve
quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected
from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over
its fair value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply and demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions.
the amount and income statement classification of major impairments of pp&e for the three years
ending december31, 2004, are included in the commentary on the business segments elsewhere in this
discussion, as well as in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page fs-32.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used
in the impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of
the
companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. that is, favorable
changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to
become impaired.
investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well
as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the
fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value. when such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an
impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investments
carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time. in making the determination as to whether
a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to
retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
in the investments market value. differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is
impaired in any period and the amount of the impairment and are not subject to sensitivity
analysis.
from time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines that no
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or
concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision was made to sell such assets, that is, the asset is held for sale and the estimated
proceeds less costs to sell were less than the associated carrying values.
contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. for example, the costs from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation;
the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and
improvements in technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if management
determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally records these losses
as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated
statement of income. refer to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this discussion and in
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements on page fs-32 for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation and environmental remediation and tax matters for the
three years ended december31, 2004.
fs-20
table of contents
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used
in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must
be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.
american jobs creation act of 2004 in october2004, the american jobs creations act of 2004 (the
act) was passed into law. the act provides deduction from income for qualified domestic refining
and upstream production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. for that
specific category of income, the company expects the net effect of this provision of the act to
result in a decrease in the federal effective tax rate for 2005 and 2006 to approximately 34
percent, based on current earnings levels. in the long term, the company expects that the new
deduction will result in a decrease of the federal effective tax rate to about 32percent for that
category of income, based on current earnings levels.
under the guidance in fasb staff position no.fas 109-1, application of fasb statement no.109,
accounting for income taxes, to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by
the american jobs creation act of 2004, the tax deduction on qualified production activities
provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 will be treated as a special deduction, as
described in fas 109. as such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities existing at the enactment date. rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported
in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the companys tax return.
the act also provides for a limited opportunity to repatriate earnings from outside the united
states at a special reduced tax rate that can be as low as 5.25percent. in early 2005, the company
was in the process of reviewing the guidance that the irs issued on january13, 2005, regarding
this provision and also considering other relevant information. the company does not anticipate a
major change in its plans for repatriating earnings from international operations under the
provisions of the act.
new accounting standards
fasb
interpretation no.46, consolidation of variable interest
entities (fin46) in
january2003, fin46 was issued, and established standards for determining under what circumstances a variable interest
entity (vie)should be consolidated by its primary beneficiary.
fin46 also requires disclosures
about vies that the company is not required to consolidate but in
which it has a significant variable interest. in december2003,
the fasb issued fin46-r,
which not only includes amendments to fin46, but also requires application of the interpretation
to all affected entities no later than march31, 2004, for calendar year-reporting companies. prior
to this requirement, companies were required to apply the interpretation to special-purpose
entities by december31, 2003. the full adoption of the interpretation as of march31, 2004,
including the requirement relating to special-purpose entities, did not have a material impact on
the companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
fasb staff position no.fas 106-2, accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare
prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003, (fsp fas 106-2) in december2003,
the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (the act) became law.
the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare, as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially
equivalent to medicare
partd. in may2004, the fasb issued fsp fas 106-2. one u.s. subsidiary was deemed at least
actuarially equivalent and eligible for the federal subsidy. the effect on the companys
postretirement benefit obligation and the associated annual expense was de minimis.
fasb statement no.151, inventory costs, an amendment of arb no.43, chapter4, (fas 151) in
november2004, the fasb issued fas 151 which is effective for the company on january1, 2006. the
standard amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin (arb)no.43, chapter4, inventory
pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage. in addition, the standard requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.
fasb statement no.123r, share-based payment (fas 123r) in december2004, the fasb issued fas
123r, which requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payments be recognized in the
companys financial statements. the company currently accounts for those payments under the
recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.25,
accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations. the company is preparing
to implement this standard effective july1, 2005. although the transition method to be used to
adopt the standard has not been selected, the impact of adoption is expected to have a minimal
impact on the companys results of operations, financial position and liquidity. refer to note 1,
beginning on page fs-30, for the companys calculation of the pro forma impact on net income of fas
123, which would be similar to that under fas 123r.
fasb
statement no.153, exchanges of nonmonetary assets
an amendment of apb opinion no.29 (fas153) in
december2004, the fasb issued fas 153, which is effective for the company for asset-exchange
transactions beginning july1, 2005. under apb no.29, assets received in certain types of
nonmonetary exchanges were permitted to be recorded at the carrying value of the assets that were
exchanged (i.e., recorded on a carryover basis). as amended by fas 153, assets received in some
circumstances will have to be recorded instead at their fair values. in the past, chevrontexaco has
not engaged in a large number of nonmonetary asset exchanges for significant amounts.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevrontexaco corporation:
we have completed an integrated audit of chevrontexaco corporations 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2004 and audits
of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
public company accounting oversight board (united states). our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of chevrontexaco corporation and its subsidiaries at
december31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of

oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. an audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
internal control over financial reporting
also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in the accompanying managements report on
internal control over financial reporting, that the company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of december31, 2004 based on criteria established in internal control
integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway
commission (coso), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
furthermore, in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of december31, 2004, based on criteria established in internal
control  integrated framework issued by the coso. the companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united
states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. an audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
as discussed in note 25 on page fs-53 to the financial statements, the company changed its method
of accounting for asset retirement obligations as of january1, 2003.

summary of significant accounting policies
general chevrontexaco manages its investments in and provides administrative, financial and
management support to u.s. and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates that engage in fully integrated
petroleum, chemicals and coal mining operations. in addition, chevrontexaco holds investments in
the power generation business. collectively, these companies conduct business activities in more
than 180 countries. exploration and production (upstream)operations consist of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural gas. refining,
marketing and transportation (downstream)operations relate to refining crude oil into finished
petroleum products; marketing crude oil, natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum;
and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor
equipment and rail car. chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity
petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.
the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with principles
generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial
statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure
of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual
results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.
the nature of the companys operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. the company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent owned and variable interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to
50percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity
currently in income. deferred income taxes are provided for these gains and losses.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the
investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be other
than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the
amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and
intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
the investments market value. the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not
changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. subsequent recoveries in the carrying value of
other investments are reported in other comprehensive income.
differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys
analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. the companys share of the
affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly when appropriate to reflect the difference
between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values.
derivatives the majority of the companys activity in commodity derivative instruments is intended
to manage the price risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. for the companys trading activity, gains and losses from the derivative
instruments are reported in current income. for derivative instruments relating to foreign currency
exposures, gains and losses are reported in current income. interest rate swaps  hedging a portion
of the companys fixed-rate debt  are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate
swaps relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
consolidated balance sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents.
the balance of the short-term investments is reported as marketable securities. short-term
investments are marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in other
comprehensive income.
inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost, using a
last-in, first-out (lifo)method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials,
supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost.
properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. costs are also capitalized for wells that find commercially
producible reserves that cannot be classified as proved, pending
fs-30
table of contents
4 note 1. summary of significant accounting policies  continued
one or more of the following: (1)decisions on additional major capital expenditures, (2)the
results of additional exploratory wells that are under way or firmly planned, and (3)securing
final regulatory approvals for development. otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination
as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following completion of
drilling. all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 21 on page fs-45 for
additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are
assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the united states, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession
or field basis, as appropriate. globally in the refining, marketing, transportation and chemical
areas, impairment reviews are generally done on a refinery, plant, marketing area or marketing
assets by country basis. impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation, depletion
and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the
carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value.
effective january1, 2003, the company implemented financial accounting standards board statement
no.143, accounting for asset retirement obligations (fas 143), in which the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is
a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. refer also to note 25 on page fs-53 relating to asset retirement obligations,
which includes additional information on the companys adoption of fas 143. previously, for crude
oil, natural gas and coal producing properties, a provision was made through depreciation expense
for anticipated abandonment and restoration costs at the end of the propertys useful life.
depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing
properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method by
individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced. depletion expenses for capitalized
costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual
field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation provisions for impairment of
capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses for coal assets are determined using the unit-of-production
method as the proved reserves are produced. the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment
are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the declining-balance
method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the straight-line method
generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized
leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses, and from sales as other income.
expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as
incurred. major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and
canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future
remediation commitment will be required. for oil, gas and coal producing properties, a liability
for an asset retirement obligation is made, following fas 143. refer to properties, plant and
equipment in this note for a discussion of fas 143.
for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability
for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other
potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties
are not able to pay their respective shares.
the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of future
costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the companys own
internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or reimbursements
are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all
gains and losses from currency translations are currently included in income. the cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in the currency translation adjustment in
stockholders equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas production from

respectively.
the fair value is estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model for stock
options. stock appreciation rights are estimated based on the method outlined in
sfas 123 for these instruments.
per-share amounts in all periods reflect a two-for-one stock split effected as a
100percent stock dividend in september2004.
the amounts in 2003 include a benefit of $0.08 for the companys share of a
capital stock transaction of its dynegy inc. affiliate, which under the applicable
accounting rules was recorded directly to the companys retained earnings and not
included in net income for the period.

special items and other financial information
net income for each period presented includes amounts categorized by the company as special
items, to assist in the explanation of the trend of results.
listed in the following table are categories of these items and their net increase (decrease)to
net income, after related tax effects.
in 2004, the company recorded special gains of $1,217 from the sale of nonstrategic crude oil and
natural gas assets, primarily in the united states and canada, and a special charge of $55 for a
litigation matter.
in 2003, impairments of $103 and $30, respectively, were recorded for various u.s. and
international oil and gas producing properties, reflecting lower expected recovery of proved
reserves or a write-down to market value for assets in anticipation of sale. impairments of $123 on
downstream assets were for
the conversion of a refinery to a products terminal and a write-down to
market value for assets in anticipation of sale. also in 2003, chevrontexaco exchanged its dynegy
seriesb preferred stock for cash, notes and seriesc preferred stock. the $365 difference between
the fair value of these items and the companys carrying value was included in net income.
in 2002, the company recorded write-downs of $1,626 of its investment in dynegy common and
preferred stock and $136 of its investment in its publicly traded caltex australia affiliate to
their respective estimated fair values. the write-downs were required because the declines in the
fair values of the investments below their carrying values were deemed to be other than temporary.
refer to note 14 beginning on page fs-39 additional information on the companys investment in
dynegy and caltex australia.
also in 2002, impairments of $183 were recorded for various u.s. exploration and production
properties and $100 for international projects.

note 8.
financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instruments chevrontexaco is exposed to market risks related to price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, electricity, natural gas and refinery feedstock.
the company uses financial derivative commodity instruments to manage this exposure on a small
portion of its activity, including: firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase
or sale of crude oil; feedstock purchases for company refineries; crude oil and refined products
inventories; and fixed-price contracts to sell natural gas and natural gas liquids. the company
also uses financial derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.
the company maintains a policy of requiring that an international swaps and derivatives association
agreement govern derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk.
depending on the nature of the derivative transaction, bilateral collateral arrangements may also
be required. when the company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with
the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty,
the net marked-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures
with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of the companys credit risk. it is the companys
policy to use other netting agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts
significant transactions.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, long-term receivables  net, and deferred
credits and other noncurrent obligations. gains and losses on the companys risk management
activities are reported as either sales and other operating revenues or purchased crude oil and
products, whereas trading gains and losses are reported as other income. these activities are
reported under operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
foreign currency the company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180
days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable or accounts payable, with gains and losses reported as other
income. these activities are reported under operating activities in the consolidated statement
of cash flows.
interest rates the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps
related to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the balance
sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
during 2004, four new swaps relating to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt were initiated.
at year-end 2004, the interest rate swaps outstanding related to fixed-rate debt, and their
weighted average maturity was approximately three years.
fair values of the interest rate swaps are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts
and notes receivable or accounts payable, with gains and losses reported directly in income as
part of interest and debt expense. these activities are reported under operating activities in
the consolidated statement of cash flows.
fair value fair values are derived either from quoted market prices or, if not available, the
present value of the expected cash flows. the fair values reflect the cash that would have been
received or paid if the instruments were settled at year-end.
long-term debt of $5,815 and $7,229 had estimated fair values of $6,444 and $7,709 at december31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.
for interest rate swaps, the notional principal amounts of $1,665 and $665 had estimated fair
values of $36 and $65 at december31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
the company holds cash equivalents and u.s. dollar marketable securities in domestic and offshore
portfolios. eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes, time deposits and commercial paper are the
primary instruments held. cash equivalents and marketable securities had fair values of $8,789 and
$3,803 at december31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. of these balances, $7,338 and $2,803 at the
respective year-ends were classified as cash equivalents that had average maturities under 90days.
the remainder, classified as marketable securities, had average maturities of approximately 2.3
years.
for the financial and derivative instruments discussed above, there was not a material change in
market risk from that presented in 2003.
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the companys short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. this diversified
investment policy limits the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit
risk. similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the companys
counterparties in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the companys
fs-35

notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

broad customer base worldwide. as a consequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. the
company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. when the financial strength of
a customer is not considered sufficient, letters of credit are the principal security obtained to
support lines of credit.
investment in dynegy notes and preferred stock at the beginning of 2004, the company held
investments in $223 face value of dynegy junior unsecured subordinated notes due 2016 and $400 face
value of dynegy seriesc convertible preferred stock with a
stated maturity date of 2033.
the
junior notes were redeemed at face value during 2004, and gains of $54 were recorded for the
difference between the face amounts and the carrying values at the time of redemption. the face
value of the companys investment in the seriesc preferred stock at december31, 2004, was $400.
the stock is recorded at its fair value, which was estimated to be $370 at december31, 2004.
future temporary changes in the estimated fair value of the preferred stock will be reported in
other comprehensive income. however, if any future decline in fair value is deemed to be other
than temporary, a charge against income in the period would be recorded. dividends payable on the
preferred stock are recognized in income each period.
note 9.
operating segments and geographic data
although each subsidiary of chevrontexaco is responsible for its own affairs, chevrontexaco
corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. for this purpose,
the investments are grouped as follows: upstream  exploration and production; downstream
refining, marketing and transportation; chemicals; and all other. the first three of these
groupings represent the companys reportable segments and operating segments as defined in fas
131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
the segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
segment managers who report to the companys chief operating decision maker (codm) (terms as
defined in fas 131). the codm is the companys executive committee, a committee of senior officers
that includes the chief executive officer and that in turn reports to the board of directors of
chevrontexaco corporation.
the operating segments represent components of the company as described in fas 131 terms that
engage in activities (a)from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b)whose
operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm, which makes decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segments, and to assess their performance; and (c)for which discrete financial
information is available.
segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the companys codm to discuss the segments operating activities and financial
performance. the codm approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level and also approves capital and exploratory funding for major projects and major changes to the
annual capital and exploratory budgets. however, business-unit managers within the operating
segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and all
other matters connected with daily operations. company officers who are members of the executive
committee also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other committees for
purposes other than acting as the codm.
all other activities include the companys interest in dynegy, coal mining operations, power
generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate
administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.
the companys primary country of operation is the united states of america, its country of
domicile. other components of the companys operations are reported as international (outside the
united states).
segment earnings the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. however, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in
all other. merger-related expenses in 2002 were also included in all other. after-tax segment

segment sales and other operating revenues operating segment sales and other operating revenues,
including internal transfers, for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following
table. products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that
approximate market prices.
revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the
production of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural
gas. revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum
products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, kerosene, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other
products derived from crude oil. this segment also generates revenues from the transportation and
trading of crude oil and refined products. revenues for the chemicals segment are derived
primarily from the manufacture and sale of additives for lubricants and fuel. all other
activities include revenues from coal mining operations, power generation businesses, insurance
operations, real estate activities and technology companies.
other than the united states, the only country where chevrontexaco generates significant
revenues is the united kingdom, where revenues amounted to $13,985, $12,121 and $10,816 in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

litigation
the company and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive.
the company is a party to more than 70 lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve
numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of mtbe in certain oxygenated
gasolines and the alleged seepage of mtbe into groundwater. resolution of these actions may
ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of
prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and claims related to
the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future.
the companys ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently
determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. the company does not use mtbe
in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states and there are no detectable levels of mtbe in
that gasoline.

lease commitments
certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included
as part of properties, plant and equipment, at cost. such leasing arrangements involve tanker
charters, crude oil production and processing equipment, service stations, and other facilities.
other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. the payments on such
leases are recorded as expense. details of the capitalized leased assets are as follows:

restructuring and reorganization costs
in connection with various reorganizations and restructurings across several businesses and
corporate departments, the company recorded before-tax charges of $258 ($146 after tax) during 2003
for estimated termination benefits for approximately 4,500 employees. nearly half of the liability
related to the global downstream segment. substantially all of the employee reductions are expected
to occur by the end of 2005.
at the beginning of 2004, a $100 liability remained for employee severance charges recorded in
2002 and 2001 associated with the merger between chevron corporation and texaco inc. the balance
related primarily to deferred payment options elected by certain employees who were terminated
before the end of 2003. approximately $80 of the liability was paid during 2004 and the remainder
in january2005.
activity for the companys liability related to reorganizations and restructurings in 2004 is
summarized in the following table:

substantially all of the balance at december31, 2004, related to employee severance costs
that were part of a presumed ongoing benefit arrangement under applicable accounting rules in fas
146, accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, paragraph 8, footnote 7.
therefore, the company accounts for severance costs in accordance with fas 88, employers
accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined pension plans and for termination benefits.
at december31, 2004, the amount was categorized as a current accrued liability on the
consolidated balance sheet and the associated charges during the period were categorized as
operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated
statement of income.
note 13.
assets held for sale and discontinued operations
at december31, 2004, and december31, 2003, the company classified $162 and $1,100, respectively,
of net properties, plant and equipment as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet.
assets in this category at the end of 2004 related to a group of service stations. these assets are
expected to be disposed of in 2005.

is payable semiannually and principal is to be repaid semiannually in equal installments beginning
in february2008. immediately following the purchase of the seriesb notes, chevrontexaco received
from tco approximately $1,800 representing a repayment of subordinated loans from the company,
interest and dividends. the $2,200 investment in the seriesb notes, which the company intends to

maturity, and the $1,800 distribution were recorded to investments and advances.
lg-caltex oil corporation chevrontexaco owns 50percent of lg-caltex, a joint venture formed in
1967 between the lg group and caltex to engage in importing, refining and marketing of petroleum
products and petrochemicals in south korea.
star petroleum refining company ltd. chevrontexaco has a 64percent equity ownership interest in
star petroleum refining company limited (sprc), which owns the star refinery at map ta phut,
thailand. the petroleum authority of thailand owns the remaining 36percent of sprc.
caltex australia ltd. chevrontexaco has a 50percent equity ownership interest in caltex australia
limited (cal). the remaining 50percent of cal is publicly owned. during 2002, the company wrote
down its investment in cal by $136 to its estimated fair value at september30, 2002. at december
31, 2004, the fair value of chevrontexacos share of cal common stock was $1,130. the aggregate
carrying value of the companys investment in cal was approximately $80 lower than the amount of
underlying equity in cal net assets.
chevron phillips chemical company llc chevrontexaco owns 50percent of cpchem, formed in 2000 when
chevron merged most of its petrochemicals businesses with those of phillips petroleum company. at
december31, 2004, the companys carrying value of its investment in cpchem was approximately $130
lower than the amount of underlying equity in cpchems net assets.
dynegy inc. chevrontexaco owns an approximate 25percent equity interest in the common stock of
dynegy, an energy provider engaged in power generation, the gathering and processing
of natural gas, and the fractionation, storage, transportation and marketing of natural gas liquids. the
company also holds investments in dynegy preferred stock.
investment in dynegy common stock at december31, 2004, the carrying value of the companys
investment in dynegy common stock was approximately $150. this amount was about $365 below the
companys proportionate interest in dynegys underlying net assets. this difference is primarily
the result of write-downs of the investment in 2002 for declines in the market value of the common
shares below the companys carrying value that were deemed to be other than temporary. this
difference has been assigned to the extent practicable to specific dynegy assets and liabilities,
based upon the companys analysis of the various factors contributing to the decline in value of
the dynegy shares. the companys equity share of dynegys reported earnings is adjusted quarterly
when appropriate to reflect the difference between these allocated values and dynegys historical
book values. the market value of the companys investment in dynegys common stock at december31,
2004, was approximately $450.
investments in dynegy notes and preferred stock refer to note 8 on page fs-35 for a discussion
of these investments.

note 16.
accounting for buy/sell contracts
in january and february2005, the sec issued comment letters to chevrontexaco and other
companies in the oil and gas industry requesting disclosure of information related to the
accounting for buy/sell contracts. under a buy/sell contract, a company agrees to buy a specific
quantity and quality of a commodity to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously
agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of a commodity at a different location to the
same counterparty. physical delivery occurs for each side of the transaction, and the risk and
reward of ownership are evidenced by title transfer, assumption of environmental risk,
transportation scheduling, credit risk, and risk of nonperformance by the counterparty. both
parties settle each side of the buy/sell through separate invoicing.
the company routinely has buy/sell contracts, primarily in the united states downstream
business, associated with crude oil and refined products. for crude oil, these contracts are used
to facilitate the companys crude oil marketing activity, which includes the purchase and sale of
crude oil production, fulfillment of the companys supply arrangements as to physical delivery
location and crude oil specifications, and purchase of crude oil to supply the companys refining
system. for refined products,
buy/sell arrangements are used to help fulfill the companys
supply agreements to customer locations and specifications.
the company accounts for buy/sell transactions in the consolidated statement of income the
same as any other monetary transaction for which title passes, and the risks and rewards of
ownership are assumed by the counterparties. at issue with the sec is whether the industrys
accounting for buy/sell contracts instead should be shown net on the income statement and accounted
for under the provisions of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.29, accounting for
nonmonetary transactions (apb 29).
the topic is under deliberation by the emerging issues task force (eitf)of the fasb as issue
no.04-13, accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty. the eitf
first discussed this issue in november2004. additional research is being performed by the fasb
staff, and the topic will be discussed again at a future eitf meeting. while this issue is under
deliberation, the sec staff directed chevrontexaco and other companies in its january and february
2005 comment letters to disclose on the face of the income statement the amounts associated with
buy/sell contracts and to discuss in a footnote to the financial statements the basis for the
underlying accounting.
with regard to the latter, the companys accounting treatment for buy/sell
contracts is based on the view that such
fs-41
table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
4 note 16. accounting for buy/sell contracts  continued
transactions are monetary in nature. monetary transactions are outside the scope of apb 29. the
company believes its accounting is also supported by the indicators of gross reporting of purchases
and sales in paragraph 3 of eitf issue no.99-19, reporting revenue gross as a principal versus
net as an agent. additionally, fasb interpretation no.39, offsetting of amounts related to
certain contracts (fin 39), prohibits a receivable from being netted against a payable when the
receivable is subject to credit risk unless a right of offset exists that is enforceable by law.
the company also views netting the separate components of buy/sell contracts in the income
statement to be inconsistent with the gross presentation that fin 39 requires for the resulting
receivable and payable on the balance sheet.
the companys buy/sell transactions are also similar
to the barrel back example used in other accounting literature, including eitf issue no.03-11,
reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement
no.133 and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no.02-3 (which indicates a
companys decision to show buy/sell-types of transactions gross on the income statement as being a
matter of judgment of the relevant facts and circumstances of the companys activities) and
derivatives implementation group (dig)issue no.k1, miscellaneous: determining whether separate
transactions should be viewed as a unit.
the company further notes that the accounting for buy/sell contracts as separate purchases and
sales is in contrast to the accounting for other types of contracts typically described by the
industry as exchange contracts, which are considered non-monetary in nature and appropriately shown
net on the income statement. under an exchange contract, for example, one company agrees to
exchange refined products in one location for another companys same quantity of refined products
in another location. upon transfer, the only amounts that may be invoiced are for transportation
and quality differentials. among other things, unlike buy/sell contracts, the obligations of each
party to perform under the
contract are not independent and the risks and rewards of ownership are not separately
transferred.
as shown on the companys consolidated statement of income, sales and other operating
revenues for the three years ending december31, 2004, included $18,650, $14,246 and $7,963,
respectively, for buy/sell contracts. the costs associated with these buy/sell revenue amounts are
included in purchased crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income in each
period.

the valuation allowance relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards
and temporary differences for which no benefit is expected to be realized. tax loss carryforwards
exist in many foreign jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an
expiration date, others expire at various times from 2005 through 2011. foreign tax credit
carryforwards of $93 will expire in 2014.

it is the companys policy for subsidiaries that are included in the u.s. consolidated tax
return to record income tax expense as though they file separately, with the parent recording the
adjustment to income tax expense for the effects of consolidation.
income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have
been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no
deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately
$10,000 at december31, 2004. a significant majority of this amount represents earnings reinvested
as part of the companys ongoing international business. it is not practicable to estimate the
amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. the company does
not
anticipate incurring additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.
american jobs creation act of 2004 in october2004, the american jobs creation act of 2004 was
passed into law. the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic refining and
upstream production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. for that specific
category of income, the company expects the net effect of this provision of the act to result in a
decrease in the federal effective tax rate for 2005 and 2006 to approximately 34percent, based on
current earnings levels. in the long term, the company expects that the new deduction will result
in a decrease of the federal effective tax rate to about 32percent for that category of income,
based on current earnings
levels.
under the guidance in fasb staff position no.fas 109-1, application of fasb statement no.
109, accounting for income taxes, to the tax deduction on qualified production activities
provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004, the tax deduction on qualified production
activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 will be treated as a special
deduction, as described in fas 109. as such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. rather, the impact of this deduction will be
reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the companys tax return.
the act also provides for a limited opportunity to repatriate earnings from outside the united
states at a special reduced tax rate that can be as low as 5.25percent. in early 2005, the company
was in the process of reviewing the guidance that the irs issued on january13, 2005, regarding
this provision and also considering other relevant information. the company does not anticipate a
major change in its plans for repatriating earnings from international operations under the
provisions of the act.

weighted-average interest rates at december31, 2004 and 2003, were 1.98percent and 1.01

redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that
are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders
during the year following the balance sheet date.
the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt.
see note 8 beginning on page fs-35 for information concerning the companys debt-related derivative
activities.
at december31, 2004, the company had $4,735 of committed credit facilities with banks
worldwide, which permit the company to refinance short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the
facilities support the companys commercial paper borrowings. interest on borrowings under the
terms of specific agreements may be based on the london interbank offered rate or bank prime rate.
no amounts were outstanding under these credit agreements during 2004 or at year-end.
at december31, 2004 and 2003, the company classified $4,735 and $4,285, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital in 2005, as the company has both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt
on a long-term basis.

new accounting standards
fasb interpretation no.46, consolidation of variable interest entities (fin 46) fin 46 was
issued in january2003 and established standards for determining under what circumstances a
variable interest entity (vie)should be consolidated by its primary beneficiary. fin 46 also
requires disclosures about vies that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has
a significant variable interest. in december2003, the fasb issued fin 46-r, which not only
included amendments to fin 46, but also required application of the interpretation to all affected
entities no later than march31, 2004, for calendar year- reporting companies. prior to this
requirement, companies were required to apply the interpretation to special-purpose entities by
december31, 2003. the full adoption of the interpretation as of march31, 2004, including the
requirement relating to special-purpose entities, did not have an impact on the companys results
of operations, financial position or liquidity.
fasb staff position no.fas 106-2, accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare
prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (fsp fas 106-2). in december2003,
the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (the act) became law. the
act

introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
medicare partd. in may2004, the fasb issued fsp fas 106-2. one u.s. subsidiary was deemed at
least actuarially equivalent and eligible for the federal subsidy. the effect on the companys
postretirement benefit obligation and the associated annual expense was de minimis.
fasb statement no.151, inventory costs, an amendment of arb no.43, chapter4 (fas 151) in
november2004, the fasb issued fas 151 which is effective for the company on january1, 2006. the
standard amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin (arb)no.43, chapter4, inventory
pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage. in addition, the standard requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.
fasb statement no.123r, share-based payment (fas 123r) in december2004, the fasb issued fas
123r, which requires that compensation costs relating to share-based payments be recognized in the
companys financial statements. the company currently accounts for those payments under the
recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.25,
accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations. the company is preparing
to implement this standard effective july1, 2005. although the transition method to be used to
adopt the standard has not been selected, the impact of adoption is expected to have a minimal
impact on the companys results of operations, financial position and liquidity. refer to note 1,
beginning on page fs-30, for the companys calculation of the pro forma impact on net income of fas
123, which would be similar to that under fas 123r.
fasb statement no.153, exchanges of nonmonetary assets,  an amendment of apb opinion no.29,
(fas 153) in december2004, the fasb issued fas 153, which is effective for the company for
asset-exchange transactions beginning july1, 2005. under apb 29, assets received in certain types
of nonmonetary exchanges were permitted to be recorded at the carrying value of the assets that
were exchanged (i.e., recorded on a carryover basis). as amended by fas 153, assets received in
some circumstances will have to be recorded instead at their fair values. in the past,
chevrontexaco has not engaged in a large number of nonmon-etary asset exchanges for significant
amounts.
note 21.
accounting for suspended exploratory wells
refer to note 1 on page fs-30 in the section properties, plant and equipment for a discussion of
the companys accounting policy for the cost of exploratory wells. the companys suspended wells
are reviewed in this context on a
quarterly basis.
the sec issued comment letters during 2004 and in february 2005 to a number of companies in
the oil and gas industry related to the accounting for suspended exploratory wells, particularly
for those suspended under certain circumstances for more
than one year. in february2005, the fasb
issued a proposed fsp to amend fas 19, financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing
companies. under the provisions of the draft fsp, exploratory well costs would continue to be
capitalized after the completion of drilling when (a)the well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (b)the enterprise is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. if either
condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains information that raises substantial doubt about
the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be
impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. the fsp provided a
number of indicators needing to be present to demonstrate sufficient progress was being made in
assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.
the company will monitor the continuing deliberations of the fasb on this matter and the
possible implications, if any, to the companys accounting policy and the amounts capitalized for
suspended-well costs. the disclosures and discussion below address those suggested in the draft fsp
and in the additional guidance issued by the sec in its february2005 comment letter to companies
in the oil and gas industry.

4 note 21. accounting for exploratory wells  continued
for the near future because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established and other
activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. the balance related
to wells in areas for which drilling was under way or firmly planned for the near future.
of the $290, approximately $50 related to the well costs suspended one year or less since
drilling was completed, and $240 related to costs suspended for more than one year since the
completion of drilling. of the $240 for 11 projects suspended for more than one year since the
completion of drilling, activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects
economic viability included: (a) $75  discussions of joint development with an operator in an
adjacent field and selection of subsurface and development plans, with front-end-engineering and
design (feed)expected to begin in 2005 (one project); (b) $63  negotiations with contractors for
feed and negotiations with potential customers for natural gas (two projects); (c) $42  award of
contracts for feed and finalization of fiscal issues with the host country (one project); (d) $20
- finalization of commercial terms with partners with award of detailed engineering and design
contracts expected by the end of 2005 (one project); and (e) $40  miscellaneous activities for
projects with smaller amounts suspended. progress is being made on all projects in this category;
and the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur
for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the projects.
included in the $449 in the table on the preceding page for year-end 2004 well costs were $42
for four projects and $50 for one project that related to costs suspended in 2000 and 1998,
respectively, when drilling in the associated project areas was completed. certain wells in the
project areas may have been suspended prior to these years of last drilling. other well costs in
the $449 total were associated with projects for which drilling was completed since 2000.
if an fsp is implemented similar to the draft issued in february2005, the company does not
believe it would result in
the immediate expensing of a significant amount of suspended-well
costs. however, the sec staff has indicated that it generally would not view conducting
environmental and engineering design studies as reasonable support for the suspending of costs
beyond one year after drilling is complete. if such restrictions are included in the final fsp,
the company may be required to expense a significant amount for wells that had found sufficient
hydrocarbons to justify their completion as producing wells and for projects the company continued
to consider economically and operationally viable. if a final rule required the company to expense
the entire $240 before-tax carrying value for the 11 projects referenced above that were suspended
as of december31, 2004, for more than one year after the completion of drilling, the after-tax
charge to earnings would be $150.
note 22.
employee benefit plans
the company has defined-benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically funds
only those defined-benefit plans for which funding is required under laws and regulations. in the
united states, this includes all qualified tax-exempt plans subject to the employee retirement
income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the company typically does not fund domestic
nonqualified tax-exempt pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and
regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment
returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives.
the company also sponsors other postretirement plans that provide medical and dental benefits,
as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans are
unfunded, and the company and the retirees share the costs. in june2004, the company announced
changes to its primary u.s. postretirement benefit plan, which include a limit on future increases
in the company contribution, an increase in service points (combination of age and years of company
service) required to receive full coverage, and the plans prescription drug coverage for retirees
becoming secondary to medicare partd. life insurance benefits are paid by the company and annual
contributions are based on actual plan experience.
the company uses a measurement date of december31 to value its pension and other
postretirement benefit plan obligations.

* discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets were reviewed and updated as
needed on a quarterly basis for the main u.s. pension plan.
expected return on plan assets the company employs a rigorous process to determine the estimates of
long-term rate of return on pension assets. these estimates are primarily driven by actual
historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance and advice from
external actuarial firms while incorporating specific asset class risk factors. asset allocations
are regularly updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the
companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.
there have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for u.s. plans, which account for about 70percent of the companys pension plan assets. at
december31, 2004, the estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.8
percent.
the year-end market-related value of u.s. pension plan assets used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market values in the preceding three months, as opposed to the
maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management considers the
three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market
volatility and yet still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for plans outside the u.s.,
market value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.
other benefit assumptions effective january1, 2005, the company amended its main u.s.
postretirement medical plan to limit future increases in the company contribution. for current
retirees, the increase in company contribution is capped at 4percent each year. for future
retirees, the 4percent cap will be effective at retirement. before retirement, the assumed health
care cost trend rates start with 10.6percent in 2004 and gradually drop to 4.8percent for 2010
and beyond. once the employee elects to retire, the trend rates are capped at 4percent.
for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december31, 2003, the assumed
heath care cost trend rates start with 8.4percent in 2003 and gradually decline to 4.5percent for
2007 and beyond.
assumed health care cost-trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. a change of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost-trend
rates would have the following effects:

the pension plans invest primarily in asset categories with sufficient size, liquidity and
cost efficiency to permit investments of reasonable size. the pension plans invest in asset
categories that provide diversification benefits and are easily measured. to assess the plans
investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks
have been established.
for the primary u.s. pension plan, the chevrontexaco board of directors has established the following
approved asset allocation ranges: equities 40-70percent, fixed income 20-65percent, real estate
0-15percent. the significant international pension plans also have established maximum and
minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by each plan. actual asset allocation within approved
ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset category risk.
equities include investments in the companys common stock in the amount of $8 and $6 at
december31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the other asset category includes investments in
private equity limited partnerships.
cash contributions and benefit payments in 2004, the company contributed $1,332 and $311 to its
u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. in 2005, the company expects contributions to
be approximately $250 and $150 to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $220 in 2005,
as compared with $199 in 2004.
the following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be
paid by the company in the next 10years:

employee savings investment plan eligible employees of
chevrontexaco and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the chevrontexaco employee savings
investment plan
(esip). in 2002, the employees thrift plan of texaco inc., employees savings plan of chevrontexaco
global energy inc. (formerly caltex corporation), stock plan of chevrontexaco global energy, inc.,
and employees thrift plan of fuel and marine marketing llc were merged into the chevrontexaco esip.
charges to expense for the esip represent the companys contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop), which is
discussed below. total company matching contributions to employee accounts within the esip were
$139, $136 and $136 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. this cost was reduced by the value of
shares released from the lesop totaling $(138), $(23) and $(73) in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. the remaining amounts, totaling $1, $113 and $63 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, represent open market purchases.
employee stock ownership plan within the chevrontexaco employee savings investment plan (esip), is
an employee stock ownership plan (esop). in 1989, chevron established a leveraged employee stock
ownership plan (lesop)as a constituent part of the esop. the lesop provides partial prefunding of
the companys future commitments to the esip.
as permitted by american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa)statement of
position 93-6, employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans, the company has elected
to continue its practices, which are based on aicpa 76-3, accounting practices for certain
employee stock ownership plans, and subsequent consensus of the eitf of the fasb. the debt of the
lesop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of
stockholders equity.
the company reports compensation expense equal to lesop debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the lesop for debt service. interest accrued on the lesop debt is
recorded as interest expense. dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. all lesop shares are considered outstanding for
earnings-per-share computations.
total (credits)expenses recorded for the lesop were $(29), $24 and $98 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, including $23, $28 and $32 of interest expense related to lesop debt and a (credit)
charge to compensation expense of $(52), $(4) and $66.
of the dividends paid on the lesop shares,
$52, $61 and $49 were used in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to service lesop debt. included in
the 2004 amount was a repayment of debt entered into in 1999 to pay interest on the esop debt.
interest expense on this debt was recognized and reported as lesop interest expense in 1999. in
addition, the company made no contributions in 2004 and contributions of $26 and $102 in 2003

benefit plan trust texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of
its benefit plans. at year-end 2004, the trust contained 14.2million shares of chevrontexaco treasury stock. the company
intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the trust will sell the shares
or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not
pay such benefits. the trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts
beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share
purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
management incentive plans chevrontexaco has two incentive plans, the management incentive plan
(mip)and the long-term incentive plan (ltip), for officers and other regular salaried employees of
the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. the plans were
expanded in 2002 to include former employees of texaco and caltex. the mip is an annual cash
incentive plan that links awards to performance results of the prior year. the cash awards may be
deferred by the recipients by conversion to stock units or other investment fund alternatives.
awards under the ltip may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted
stock, stock units and nonstock grants. texaco also had a cash incentive program and a stock
incentive plan (sip)that included stock options, restricted stock and other incentive awards for
executives, directors and key employees. awards under the caltex ltip were in the form of
performance units and stock appreciation rights. aggregate charges to expense for these management
incentive plans, excluding expense related to ltip and sip stock options and restricted stock
awards that are discussed in note 23 that follows, were $214, $148 and $48 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. included in this amount for 2004 was $14 related to stock appreciation rights.
other incentive plans the company has a program that provides eligible employees, other than those
covered by mip and ltip, with an annual cash bonus if the company achieves certain financial and
safety goals. charges for the program were $339, $151 and $158 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

the company applies apb opinion no.25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock-based compensation programs. stock-based compensation expense (credit)recognized in
connection with these programs and the stock appreciation rights discussed above was $16, $2 and
$(2) in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
refer to note 1 on page fs-30 for the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share
had the company applied the fair-value-recognition provisions of fas no.123.
in the discussion below, the references to share price and number of shares have been adjusted
for the two-for-one stock split in september2004, which is discussed in note 3 on page fs-33.
broad-based employee stock options in 1998, chevron granted to all eligible employees options that
varied from 200 to 600 shares of stock or equivalents, dependent on the employees salary or job
grade. these options vested after two years in february2000 and expire in february2008. options
for 9,641,600 shares were awarded at an exercise price of $38.15625 per share. outstanding option
shares were 4,018,350 at the end of 2002. in 2003, exercises of 23,260 and forfeitures of 122,100
reduced the outstanding option shares to 3,872,990 at the end of the year. in 2004, exercises of
1,720,946 and forfeitures of 42,540 reduced the outstanding option shares to 2,109,504 at the end
of the year. the company recorded expense (credit)of $2, $2 and $(2) for these options in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
the fair value of each option share on the date of grant under fas no.123 was estimated at
$9.54 using the average results of black-scholes models for the preceding 10years. the 10-year
averages of each assumption used by the black-scholes models were: a risk-free interest rate of 7.0
percent, a dividend yield of 4.2percent, an expected life of seven years and a volatility of 24.7
percent.
long-term incentive plan stock options granted under the ltip extend for 10years from the date of
grant. effective with options granted in june2002, one-third of the options vest on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. prior to this change, options granted by
chevron vested one year after the date of grant, whereas options granted by texaco under its sip
vested over a two-year period at a rate of 50percent each year. for a 10-year period after april
2004, no more than 160million shares may be issued under the plan, and no more than 64million of
those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award
requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. this provision replaced a formula that
restricted annual awards to no more than one percent of shares outstanding at the beginning of each
year. not counted against the 160million-share maximum are shares issued as a result of the
exercise options that were granted before the change in formula in 2004.
on the closing of the merger in october2001, outstanding options granted under the texaco sip
were converted to chevrontexaco options at the merger exchange rate of 0.77. these options retained
a provision for restored options.
this feature enables a participant who exercises a stock option by exchanging previously
acquired common stock or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations to receive
new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. the restored options are fully
exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price is the fair market value of
the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. restricted shares

granted under the former texaco plan contained a performance element that had to be satisfied in
order for all or a specified portion of the shares to vest. upon the merger, all restricted shares
became vested and converted to chevrontexaco shares at the merger exchange ratio of 0.77. apart
from the restored options, no further awards may be granted under the former texaco plans. no
amount for these plans was charged to compensation expense in 2004, 2003 or 2002.
the fair market value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant under fas
no.123 using the black-scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average

other contingencies and commitments
income taxes the company estimates its income tax expense and liabilities annually. these
liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several
years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been estimated. the u.s.
federal income tax liabilities have been settled through 1996 for chevrontexaco (formerly chevron
corporation), 1997 for chevrontexaco global energy inc. (formerly caltex) and 1991 for texaco inc.
california franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for chevron and 1987 for
texaco. settlement of open tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries where the company
conducts its businesses, is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of the company, and in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been
made for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future
examination.
guarantees at december31, 2004, the company and its subsidiaries provided, either directly or
indirectly, guarantees of $963 for notes and other contractual obligations of affiliated companies
and $130 for third parties, as described by major category below. there are no amounts being
carried as liabilities for the companys obligations under these guarantees.
of the $963 guarantees provided to affiliates, $774 relate to borrowings for capital projects or general corporate
purposes. these guarantees were undertaken to achieve lower interest rates and generally cover the
construction period of the capital projects. approximately 90percent of the amounts guaranteed
will expire by 2009, with the remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. under the terms of
the guarantees, the company would be required to fulfill the guarantee should an affiliate be in
default of its loan terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. there are no recourse
provisions, and no assets are held as collateral for these guarantees. the $189 balance of the $963
represents obligations in connection with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of the
companys cogeneration affiliates. under the terms of these guarantees, the company may be
required to make payments under certain conditions if the affiliates do not perform under the
agreements. there are no provisions for recourse to third parties, and no assets are held as
collateral for these pricing guarantees.
guarantees of $130 have been provided to third parties, including approximately $40 of
construction loans to host governments of certain of the companys international upstream
operations. the remaining guarantees of $90 were provided

notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
4 note 24. other contingencies and commitments  continued
principally as conditions of sale of the companys interest in certain operations, to provide a
source of liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with company marketing programs. no
amounts of the companys obligations under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities. about 70
percent of the total amounts guaranteed will expire by 2009.
the company would be required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in
default of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. approximately $70
of the guarantees have recourse provisions, which enable the company to recover any payments made
under the terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties assets.
at december31, 2004, chevrontexaco also had outstanding guarantees for approximately $215 of
equilon debt and leases. following the february2002 disposition of its interest in equilon, the
company received an indemnification from shell oil company for any claims arising from the
guarantees. the company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees. approximately 45percent
of the amounts guaranteed will expire by 2009, with the guarantees of the remaining amounts
expiring by 2019.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and
motiva to shell oil company (shell) and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002
sale of the companys interests in those investments. the indemnities cover certain contingent
liabilities, including those associated with the unocal patent litigation. the company would be
required to perform should the indemnified liabilities become actual losses. should that occur,
the company could be required to make future payments up to $300. through the end of 2004, the
company paid approximately $28 under these contingencies and had agreed to pay approximately $10
additional under an award of arbitration, subject to minor adjustments yet to be resolved. the
company may receive additional requests for indemnification payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the periods of texacos ownership interests in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims relating to equilon indemnities must be asserted either as early as february
2007, or no later than february2009, and claims relating to motiva must be asserted no later than
february2012. under the terms of the indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of
potential future payments. the company has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims under
these indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the
indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts
recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or motiva
prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
securitization the company securitizes certain retail and trade accounts receivable in its
downstream business through the use
of qualifying spes. at december31, 2004, approximately
$1,200, representing about 10percent of chevrontexacos total current accounts receivables
balance, were securitized. chevrontexacos total estimated financial exposure under these
securitizations at december31, 2004, was approximately $50. these arrangements have the effect of
accelerating chevrontexacos collection of the securitized amounts. in the event that the spes
experience major defaults in the collection of receivables, chevrontexaco believes that it would
have no loss exposure connected with third-party investments in these securitizations.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements, and
take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements,
and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the
agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities,
and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. the
aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these
various commitments are 2005
$1,600; 2006  $1,700; 2007  $1,600; 2008  $1,500; 2009  $1,500; 2010 and after  $2,300. total
payments under the agreements were approximately $1,600 in 2004, $1,400 in 2003 and $1,200 in 2002.
the most significant take-or-pay agreement calls for the company to purchase approximately
55,000 barrels per day of refined products from an equity affiliate refiner in thailand. this
purchase agreement is in conjunction with the financing of a refinery owned by the affiliate and
expires in 2009. the future estimated commitments under this contract
are: 2005  $1,200; 2006  $1,200; 2007  $1,300; 2008  $1,300; and 2009  $1,300. additionally, in 2004 the company entered
into a 20-year agreement to acquire regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng terminal.
payments of $1,200 over the 20-year period are expected to commence in 2010.
minority interests the company has commitments of approximately $172 related to minority interests
in subsidiary companies.
texaco capital llc, a wholly owned financial subsidiary, issued deferred preferred shares,
seriesc, in december1995. in february2005, the company redeemed current obligations related to
minority interests of approximately $140.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemical or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by
the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including but not
limited to federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, oil fields,
service stations, terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or divested.
these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of
possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be
required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties,
and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable,
fs-52

4 note 24. other contingencies and commitments  continued
the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in
which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on
its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does not believe its
obligations to make such expenditures have had or will have any significant impact on the
companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or chemical
companies.
chevrontexacos environmental reserve as of december31, 2004, was $1,047. the company
manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the
united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and local
regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2004 had a recorded liability that was material
to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
included in the year-end 2004 balance was $107 related to sites for which chevrontexaco had
been identified by the u.s. environmental protection agency or other regulatory agencies under the
provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws as a potentially responsible
party or otherwise involved in the remediation.
of the remaining year-end 2004 environmental reserves balance of $940, $712 related to more
than 2,000 sites for the companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other
plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and pipelines. the remaining
$228 was associated with various sites in the international downstream ($111), upstream ($69) and
chemicals ($48). liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.
global operations chevrontexaco and its affiliates conduct business activities in approximately
180 countries. areas in which the company and its affiliates have significant operations include
the united states, canada, australia, the united kingdom, norway, denmark, france, the partitioned
neutral zone between kuwait and saudi arabia, republic of congo, angola, nigeria, chad, south
africa, indonesia, the philippines, singapore, china, thailand, venezuela, argentina, brazil,
colombia, trinidad and tobago, and south korea. the companys cpc affiliate operates in russia
and kazakhstan. the companys tco affiliate operates in kazakhstan. the companys cpchem affiliate
manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a worldwide basis, with manufacturing
facilities in the united states, puerto rico, singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar,
mexico and belgium.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be
affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in
which it operates, including the united states. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken
by host governments to increase public
ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned
businesses or assets or to impose additional taxes or royalties on the companys operations or
both.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in
others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other governments may affect the companys
operations. those developments have at times significantly affected the companys related
operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of
current and future activity in such countries.
equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. these
activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrontexacos interests in four producing zones at the
naval petroleum reserve at elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in
these zones were owned by the u.s. department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net
settlement amount for the four zones. chevrontexaco currently estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200. at the same time, a possible maximum net amount that
could be owed to chevrontexaco is estimated at about $50. the timing of the settlement and the
exact amount within this range of estimates were uncertain.
other contingencies chevrontexaco receives claims from and submits claims to customers, trading
partners, u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers,
and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant
and take lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
note 25.
fas 143  asset retirement obligations
the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no.143, accounting for asset
retirement obligations (fas 143), effective january1, 2003. this accounting standard applies to
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation that is recorded when there is a
legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability
can be reasonably estimated. obligations associated with the retirement of these assets require
recognition in certain circumstances: (1)the present value of a liability and offsetting asset for
an aro, (2)the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3)the
periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates. fas 143 primarily affects the
companys accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing assets and differs in several respects
from previous accounting under fas 19, financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing
companies.

note 25. fas 143  asset retirement obligations  continued
in the first quarter 2003, the company recorded a net after-tax charge of $200 for the
cumulative effect of the adoption of fas 143, including the companys share of amounts attributable
to equity affiliates. the cumulative-effect adjustment also increased the following balance sheet
categories: properties, plant and equipment, $2,568; accrued liabilities, $115; and deferred
credits and other noncurrent obligations, $2,674. noncurrent deferred income taxes decreased by
$21.
upon adoption, no significant asset retirement obligations associated with any legal
obligations to retire refining, marketing and transportation (downstream)and chemical long-lived
assets generally were recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements
prevented estimation of the fair value of the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews
of its downstream and chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that
might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
other than the cumulative-effect net charge,
the effect of the new accounting standard on net income in 2003 was not materially different from
what the result would have been under fas 19 accounting. included in depreciation, depletion and
amortization were $52 related to the depreciation of the aro asset and $132 related to the
accretion of the aro liability.
the following table illustrates what the companys net income before extraordinary items, net
income and related per-share amounts would have been if the provisions of fas 143 had been applied
retroactively:

includes benefit of $5 that represents the reversal of fas 19 depreciation related
to abandonment offset partially by pro forma expenses for the depreciation and accretion of the aro
asset and liability, net of tax. there is a de minimis effect to net income per basic or diluted
share.
reported net income before extraordinary items was also $3.57 per basic and diluted
shares for 2003 and $0.53 per basic and diluted shares for 2002.
reported net income was $3.48 per basic and diluted shares for 2003 and $0.53 per
basic and diluted shares for 2002.
prior to the implementation of fas 143, the company had recorded a provision for abandonment
that was part of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. upon implementation of fas
143, the provision for abandonment was reversed and aro liability was recorded. the amount of the
abandonment reserve at the end of 2002 was $2,263. the 2002 pro-forma aro liability at january 1
and december31 was $2,792 and $2,797, respectively.

table of contents
table v  reserve quantity information
reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers,
the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists. the system
classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories, three deemed commercial and three
noncommercial. within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of
unproved, probable and possible. the noncommercial categories are also referred to as contingent
resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all sec standards and
demonstrate a high probability of being produced.
proved reserves are the estimated quantities that
geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future
years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. net proved reserves
exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty
obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. proved developed reserves
are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.
proved reserves do not include additional quantities that may eventually result
from extensions of currently proved areas or from applying the secondary or tertiary recovery
processes not yet tested and determined to be economic.
due to the inherent uncertainties and the
limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of underground reserves are subject to change as
additional information becomes available.
proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams
composed of earth scientists and reservoir engineers. as part of the internal control process
related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a reserves advisory committee (rac)that is
chaired by the corporate reserves manager, who is a member of a corporate department that reports
directly to the executive vice president responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and
production activities. all of the rac members are knowledgeable of sec guidelines for proved
reserves classification. the rac coordinates its activities through two operating company-level
reserves managers. these two reserves managers are not members of the rac so as to preserve the
corporate-level independence.
the rac has the following primary responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the
business units recommended reserve changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in
accordance with sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and
appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon
reserves.
during the year, the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream
business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. major
changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee, whose members include
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. the companys annual reserve
activity is also presented to and discussed with
the board of directors. other major reserves-related issues are discussed with the board as necessary throughout the year.
rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have
the largest proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an examination of the proved reserve
records and documentation of their alignment with the corporate reserves manual.
reserve quantities at december31, 2004, total oil-equivalent reserves for the companys
consolidated operations were 8.2billion barrels. (refer to page e-12 for the definition of
oil-equivalent reserves.) nearly 30percent were in the united states and about 10percent in
indonesia. for the companys interests in equity affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves were 3.1
billion barrels, nearly 85percent of which were associated with the companys 50percent ownership
in tco. fewer than 20 other individual properties in the companys portfolio of assets each
contained between 1percent and 4percent of the companys oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in
the aggregate accounted for about 35percent of the companys proved reserves total. these other properties were geographically
dispersed, located in the united states, south america, europe, west africa, the middle east and
the asia-pacific region.
in the united states, total oil-equivalent reserves at year-end 2004 were 2.4billion barrels.
of this amount, 45percent, 20percent and 35percent were located in california, the gulf of
mexico and other u.s. areas, respectively.
in california, liquids reserves represented 95percent of the total, with most classified as
heavy oil. because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods,
the producing operations are capital intensive in nature. most of the companys heavy-oil fields
in california employ a continuous steamflooding process.
in the gulf of mexico region, liquids represented approximately 60percent of total
oil-equivalent reserves. production operations are mostly offshore and, as a result, are also
capital intensive. costs include investments in wells, production platforms and other facilities,
such as gathering lines and storage facilities.
in other u.s. areas, the reserves were split about equally between liquids and natural gas.
for production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including water-flood and co2 injection.
chevrontexaco operates the boscan field in venezuela under a service agreement, but has
not recorded reserve quantities for this operation.
the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables, for the three years ending december31, 2004, is not necessarily indicative of
future trends. the companys ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things,
matters that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting, partner
approvals of development plans, declines in oil and gas prices, opec constraints, geopolitical
uncertainties and civil unrest.
the companys estimated net proved underground oil and natural gas reserves and changes
thereto for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 are shown in the following tables.

net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2004 consist of 5million barrels of
developed reserves and (209)million barrels of undeveloped reserves for consolidated companies and
315million barrels of developed reserves and (111)million barrels of undeveloped reserves for
affiliated companies.
during 2004, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at december31, 2003,
transferred to developed reserves were 13percent and 15percent for consolidated companies and
affiliated companies, respectively.
information on canadian oil sands net proved reserves not included above:
in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, chevrontexaco has significant
interests in proved oil sands reserves in canada associated with the athabasca project. for
internal management purposes, chevrontexaco views these reserves and their development as an
integral part of total upstream operations. however, sec regulations define these reserves as
mining-related and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves. net proved oil sands reserves
were 167million barrels as of december31, 2004. production began in late 2002.
the oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is found on page fs-67.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of proved-reserves changes for 2002 through 2004 in
the above table are discussed below:
revisions in 2002, net revisions reduced liquids volumes worldwide by 49million barrels for consolidated companies. international areas accounted for a net
increase of 67million barrels. the largest upward net revision internationally was 161million
barrels for a contract extension in angola. the largest negative net revision was 155million
barrels in indonesia, mainly for the effect of higher year-end prices on the calculation of
reserves associated with cost-oil recovery under a production-sharing contract. in the united
states, the total downward net
revision was 116million barrels across many fields in each of the geographic
sections. the 199-million-barrel increase for the tco affiliate was associated
with the project approval to expand gas processing facilities.
in 2003, net revisions increased reserves by 57million barrels for consolidated
companies. whereas net u.s. reserve changes were minimal, international volumes
increased 66million barrels. the largest increase was in kazakhstan in the asia-pacific
area based on an updated geologic model for one field. the 200-million-barrel
increase for tco was based on an updated model of reservoir and well performance.
fs-64
table of contents
table v  reserve quantity information  continued
in 2004, net revisions decreased reserves 218million barrels for consolidated companies
and increased reserves for affiliates by 204million barrels. for consolidated companies, the
decrease was composed of 161million barrels for international areas and 57million barrels for the
united states. the largest downward revision internationally was 70million barrels in africa. one
field in angola accounted for the majority of the net decline as changes were made to oil-in-place
estimates based on reservoir performance data. one field in the asia-pacific area essentially
accounted for the 43-million-barrel downward revision for that region. the revision was associated
with reduced well performance. part of the 36-million-barrel net downward revision for indonesia
was associated with the effect of higher year-end prices on the calculation of reserves for
cost-oil recovery under a production-sharing contract. in the united states, the 68-million-barrel
net downward revision in the gulf of mexico area was across several fields and based mainly on
reservoir analyses and
assessments
of well performance. for affiliated companies, the 206-million-barrel increase for tco
was based on an updated assessment of reservoir performance for the tengiz field. partially
offsetting this net increase was a downward effect of higher year-end prices on the variable
royalty-rate calculation. downward revisions also occurred in other geographic areas because of the
effect of higher year-end prices on various production-sharing terms and variable royalty
calculations.
improved recovery in 2002, improved recovery increased liquids volumes worldwide by 239
million barrels for consolidated companies. the largest increase of 99million barrels occurred in
the united states, primarily in the california region due to pattern modifications, injector
conversions and infill drilling on a large heavy oil field under thermal recovery.
extensions and discoveries in 2002, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes
worldwide by 442million barrels for consolidated companies. the largest increase was 301million
barrels in africa, principally 172million barrels reflecting the project sanction of a recent
discovery in nigeria and 96million barrels associated with approval of several development
projects in angola.

sales in 2004, sales of liquids volumes reduced reserves of consolidated companies by 179
million barrels. sales totaled 130million barrels in the united states and 33million barrels in
the other international region. sales in the other region of the united states totaled 103
millions barrels, with two fields accounting for approximately one-half of the volume. the 27
million barrels sold in the gulf of mexico reflect the sale of a number of shelf properties. the
other international sales include the disposal of western canada properties and several fields
in the united kingdom. all the sales were associated with the companys program to dispose of
assets deemed nonstrategic to the portfolio of producing properties.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of proved-reserves changes for 2002 through 2004 in the
table on page fs-65 are discussed below:
revisions in 2002, reserves were revised upward by a net
161billion cubic feet (bcf)for consolidated companies, as increases of 759 bcf internationally
were partially offset by net downward revisions of 598 bcf in the united states. internationally,
the majority of the 277 bcf net upward revision in africa was associated primarily with a
performance assessment of several fields and a multifield gas development project. an increase of
375 bcf in the asia-pacific region included the effect of securing a contract to supply lng to
china markets from company producing operations in australia. in the united states, about
one-fourth of the 598 bcf net downward revision was associated with two fields in the midcontinent
region based on an updated assessment of production performance and changes to operating conditions
of the wells. most of the remaining negative revision was associated with reviews of performance in
many fields. for the tco affiliate in kazakhstan, the 293 bcf increase related mainly to project
approval to expand gas processing facilities.
in 2003, revisions accounted for a net increase of 1,627 bcf for consolidated companies, as net increases of 2,233 bcf internationally were partially
offset by net downward revisions of 606 bcf in the united states. internationally, the net 879 bcf
increase in the asia-pacific region related primarily to australia and kazakhstan. in australia,
the increase was associated mainly with a change to the probabilistic method of aggregating the
reserves for multiple fields produced through common offshore infrastructure into a single lng
plant. the increase in kazakhstan related to an updated geologic model for one field and higher
gas sales to a third-party processing plant. the net 976 bcf increase in the other international
area was mainly the result of operating contract extensions for two fields in south america. in
the united states, about one-third of the net 606 bcf negative revision related to two coal bed
methane fields in the midcontinent region, based on performance data for producing wells. downward
revisions for the balance of the write-down were associated with several fields, based on
assessments of well performance and other data.
in 2004, revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by a net 248 bcf, composed of increases of 928 bcf internationally and
decreases of 680 bcf in the united states. internationally, about half of the 346 bcf increase in
africa related to properties in nigeria, for which changes were associated with well performance
reviews, development drilling and lease fuel calculations. the 236 bcf addition in the asia-pacific
region was related primarily to reservoir analysis for a single field. most of the 325 bcf in
the other international area is related to a new gas sales contract in trinidad and tobago. in
the united states, the net 391 bcf downward revision in the gulf of mexico was related to
well-performance reviews and technical analyses in several fields. most of the net 316 bcf
negative revision in the other u.s. area related to two coal bed methane fields in the
midcontinent region and their associated wells performance. the 963 bcf increase for tco was
connected with updated analyses of reservoir performance and processing plant yields.
extensions and discoveries in 2002, consolidated companies increased reserves by 892 bcf,
including 395 bcf in the united states and 227 bcf in the asia-pacific region. in the united
states, 229 bcf was added in the gulf of mexico and 161 bcf in the other region, primarily due to
drilling activities. the addition in asia-pacific resulted from a gas supply contract in australia
that enabled booking of a previous discovery.
in 2003, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of 526 bcf for consolidated
companies, reflecting a 388 bcf increase in the united states, with 270 bcf added in the gulf of
mexico and 118 bcf in the other region. the gulf of mexico increase includes discoveries in
several offshore louisiana fields, with a large number of fields in texas, louisiana and other
states accounting for the increase in other.
in 2004, extensions and discoveries accounted for an
increase of 214 bcf, reflecting an increase in the united states of 144 bcf, with 89 bcf added in
the other region and 54 bcf added in the gulf of mexico through drilling activities in a large
number of fields.
sales in 2004, sales for consolidated companies totaled 547 bcf. of this total, 436 bcf was in
the united states and 111 bcf in the other international region. in the united states, other
region sales accounted for 289 bcf, reflecting the disposal of a large number of smaller
properties, including a coal bed methane field. gulf of mexico sales of 147 bcf reflected the
sale of shelf properties, with four fields accounting for more than one-third of the total sales.
sales in the other international region reflected the disposition of the properties in western
canada and the united kingdom.

table of contents
table vi  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved
oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of fas 69. estimated future
cash inflows from production are computed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to year-end
quantities of estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are limited to those provided by
contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. future development and
production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end
estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end
economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations. estimated future
income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. these rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. discounted future net cash flows are calculated using
10percent
midperiod discount factors. discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future
expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.
the information provided does not represent managements estimate of the companys expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. estimates of proved reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. the
arbitrary valuation prescribed under fas 69 requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. the calculations are made as of december31 each year and
should not be relied upon as an indication of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil
and gas reserves. in the following table, standardized measure net cash flows refers to the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
