SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON

CORPORATION,

*

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL,

MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS, MINING OPERATIONS, POWER

GENERATION AND ENERGY SERVICES. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS; PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND

REGASIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS;

TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL EXPORT

PIPELINES; TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS;

AND A

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

PROJECT. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REFINING OF

CRUDE OIL INTO PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL

AND REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED

PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND

RAIL CAR; AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY

PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES AND FUEL AND

LUBRICANT ADDITIVES.

A LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES E-4

AND

E-5.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, CHEVRON HAD APPROXIMATELY

62,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 3,900 SERVICE STATION

EMPLOYEES). APPROXIMATELY 30,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT

3,600 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES), OR 48 PERCENT, WERE

EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, AND INDIVIDUAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

CONTROL OVER SOME OF THEM. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES, REGULATING HOW

COMPANIES ARE STRUCTURED AND WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT

THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME

CASES, LIMITING THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THESE COMMODITIES. HOWEVER,

SOME GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE PRICE CONTROLS ON REFINED PRODUCTS SUCH

AS GASOLINE OR DIESEL FUEL. THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE

WORLDS SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL AND THEIR PRODUCTION

LEVELS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY.

DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS

LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL

ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO

OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. SEASONALITY

IS NOT A PRIMARY DRIVER OF CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

QUARTERLY EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON

COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED, MAJOR GLOBAL PETROLEUM

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM

COMPANIES, FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LEASES AND OTHER PROPERTIES AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR

REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CHEVRON ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY

INTEGRATED, MAJOR PETROLEUM COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT

REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND CHEMICALS ENTITIES AND

NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES IN THE SALE OR ACQUISITION OF

VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS.

INCORPORATED

IN DELAWARE IN 1926 AS STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE NAME CHEVRON CORPORATION IN 1984 AND

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION IN 2001. IN 2005, CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION CHANGED ITS NAME TO CHEVRON CORPORATION. AS USED IN

THIS REPORT, THE TERM CHEVRON AND SUCH TERMS AS

THE COMPANY, THE CORPORATION,

OUR, WE AND US MAY REFER TO

CHEVRON CORPORATION, ONE OR MORE OF ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES, OR ALL OF THEM TAKEN AS A WHOLE, BUT UNLESS STATED

OTHERWISE IT DOES NOT INCLUDE AFFILIATES OF

CHEVRON  I.E., THOSE COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE

EQUITY METHOD (GENERALLY OWNED 50 PERCENT OR LESS) OR

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD. ALL OF THESE TERMS

ARE USED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED AS A PRECISE

DESCRIPTION OF ANY OF THE SEPARATE COMPANIES, EACH OF WHICH

MANAGES ITS OWN AFFAIRS.

CHEVRON

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

CHEVRONS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE

AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINED FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM ITS OPERATIONS THAT

WILL ENABLE IT TO OUTPERFORM ITS COMPETITORS. IN THE UPSTREAM,

THE COMPANYS STRATEGIES ARE TO GROW PROFITABLY IN CORE

AREAS, BUILD NEW LEGACY POSITIONS AND COMMERCIALIZE THE

COMPANYS EQUITY NATURAL GAS RESOURCE BASE WHILE GROWING A

HIGH-IMPACT GLOBAL GAS BUSINESS. IN THE DOWNSTREAM, THE

STRATEGIES ARE TO IMPROVE RETURNS AND GROW EARNINGS ACROSS THE

VALUE CHAIN. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY

ACROSS ALL ITS BUSINESSES TO DIFFERENTIATE PERFORMANCE, AND TO

INVEST IN PROFITABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY

SOLUTIONS.

(B)

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY, WITH

OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA

AND AUSTRALIA. TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES, EARNINGS AND INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND ASSETS AS OF THE END OF 2010 AND

2009  FOR THE UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANYS

INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS  ARE IN NOTE 11

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-41.

SIMILAR COMPARATIVE DATA FOR THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN

AND INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT ARE IN NOTES 12 AND 13 ON PAGES FS-43 THROUGH

FS-45.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2010 WERE $21.8 BILLION, INCLUDING

$1.4 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

EQUITY-AFFILIATE EXPENDITURES. IN 2009 AND 2008, EXPENDITURES

WERE $22.2 BILLION AND $22.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES

EXPENDITURES OF $1.6 BILLION IN 2009 AND $2.3 BILLION

IN 2008.

OF THE $21.8 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2010,

87 PERCENT, OR $18.9 BILLION, WAS RELATED TO UPSTREAM

ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT WAS EXPENDED FOR

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2009 AND 2008. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 82 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN 2010, MORE THAN 80 PERCENT IN 2009 AND ABOUT

70 PERCENT IN 2008, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS

CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES.

IN 2011, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE $26.0 BILLION, INCLUDING

$2.0 BILLION OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. APPROXIMATELY

85 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, OR $22.6 BILLION, IS BUDGETED

FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH

$17.2 BILLION OF THAT AMOUNT FOR PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. ACQUISITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANNOUNCED

PURCHASE OF ATLAS ENERGY, INC., ARE NOT INCLUDED.

REFER ALSO TO A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES ON

PAGE FS-13.

UPSTREAM

THE TABLE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE SUMMARIZES THE NET PRODUCTION OF

LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS FOR 2010 AND 2009 BY THE COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES. WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION, INCLUDING

VOLUMES FROM SYNTHETIC OIL IN 2010 AND OIL SANDS IN 2009, WAS

2.763 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, UP ABOUT 2 PERCENT FROM

2009. THE INCREASE WAS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

START-UP

AND

RAMP-UP

OF

SEVERAL MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS  THE EXPANSION AT

TENGIZ IN KAZAKHSTAN, THE TAHITI FIELD IN THE U.S. GULF OF

MEXICO, FRADE IN BRAZIL, AGBAMI IN NIGERIA, AND

TOMBUA-LANDANA

AND MAFUMEIRA NORTE IN ANGOLA. NORMAL FIELD DECLINES AND THE

IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES ON COST-RECOVERY VOLUMES AND OTHER

CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS DECREASED NET PRODUCTION FROM LAST

YEARS COMPARATIVE PERIOD. REFER TO THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-7

FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE

2008  2010 CHANGES IN PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, AND NATURAL GAS.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS AVERAGE WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN 2011 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 2.790 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY BASED ON THE AVERAGE WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE

CRUDE OIL PRICE OF $79 PER BARREL IN 2010. THIS ESTIMATE IS

SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL

QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION

VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY

PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN AGREEMENTS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR

RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS, DELAYS IN

PROJECT STARTUPS, FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN

VARIOUS MARKETS, WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY SHUT IN PRODUCTION,

CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING GEOPOLITICS, DELAYS IN COMPLETION OF

MAINTENANCE TURNAROUNDS,

GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED

DECLINES IN PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS

TO OPERATIONS. THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IS ALSO

AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG

BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION.

REFER TO THE REVIEW OF ONGOING EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES IN KEY AREAS, BEGINNING ON PAGE 9, FOR A

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DELIVERY

COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY SELLS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FROM ITS PRODUCING

OPERATIONS UNDER A VARIETY OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. MOST

CONTRACTS GENERALLY COMMIT THE COMPANY TO SELL QUANTITIES BASED

ON PRODUCTION FROM SPECIFIED PROPERTIES, BUT SOME NATURAL GAS

SALES CONTRACTS SPECIFY DELIVERY OF FIXED AND DETERMINABLE

QUANTITIES, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO

DELIVER TO THIRD PARTIES 253 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL

GAS THROUGH 2013. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE

CONTRACTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EQUITY PRODUCTION FROM THE

COMPANYS PROVED DEVELOPED U.S. RESERVES AND THIRD

PARTY PURCHASES. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF PRICING

TERMS, INCLUDING BOTH INDEX AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY

COMMITTED TO DELIVER A TOTAL OF 953 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS FROM 2011 THROUGH 2013 FROM AUSTRALIA, COLOMBIA,

DENMARK AND THE PHILIPPINES TO THIRD PARTIES. THE SALES

CONTRACTS CONTAIN VARIABLE PRICING FORMULAS THAT ARE GENERALLY

REFERENCED TO THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL

GAS OR OTHER PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE CONTRACTS FROM QUANTITIES

AVAILABLE FROM PRODUCTION OF THE COMPANYS PROVED DEVELOPED

RESERVES IN THESE COUNTRIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEVRON HAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN MOST OF THE

WORLDS MAJOR HYDROCARBON BASINS. THE COMPANYS

UPSTREAM STRATEGY IS TO GROW PROFITABLY IN CORE AREAS, BUILD NEW

LEGACY POSITIONS AND COMMERCIALIZE THE COMPANYS EQUITY

NATURAL GAS RESOURCE BASE WHILE GROWING A HIGH-IMPACT GLOBAL GAS

BUSINESS. THE MAP AT LEFT INDICATES CHEVRONS PRIMARY AREAS

OF EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION.

A)

UNITED

STATES

UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE CONCENTRATED IN

CALIFORNIA, THE GULF OF MEXICO, LOUISIANA, TEXAS,

NEW MEXICO, THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND ALASKA. AVERAGE NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES DURING 2010 WAS

708,000 BARRELS PER DAY.

IN CALIFORNIA, THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION IN THE

SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IN 2010, AVERAGE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION WAS 199,000 BARRELS PER DAY, COMPOSED OF

178,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, 96 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS AND 5,000 BARRELS OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

APPROXIMATELY 84 PERCENT OF THE CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION IS

CONSIDERED HEAVY OIL (TYPICALLY WITH API GRAVITY LOWER THAN 22

DEGREES).

AVERAGE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION DURING 2010 FOR THE COMPANYS COMBINED INTERESTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO SHELF AND DEEPWATER AREAS, AND THE ONSHORE FIELDS IN THE REGION WAS 260,000 BARRELS PER DAY. THE DAILY

OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION WAS COMPOSED OF 169,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, 445 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS AND 17,000 BARRELS OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

IN APRIL 2010, AN ACCIDENT OCCURRED AT THE BP-OPERATED MACONDO PROSPECT IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF LIFE, THE SINKING OF THE RIG AND A SIGNIFICANT OIL SPILL. CHEVRON WAS NOT A PARTICIPANT IN THE WELL. SUBSEQUENT TO THE EVENT, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR PLACED A MORATORIUM ON THE DRILLING OF WELLS USING SUBSEA BLOWOUT PREVENTERS (BOPS) OR SURFACE BOPS ON A FLOATING FACILITY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE PACIFIC

REGIONS. DURING THE MORATORIUM, CHEVRON PARTICIPATED IN A NUMBER

OF INDUSTRY EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE

INDUSTRY STANDARDS IN PREVENTION, INTERVENTION AND SPILL

RESPONSE. IN JULY 2010, CHEVRON AND SEVERAL OTHER MAJOR ENERGY

COMPANIES ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BUILD AND DEPLOY A RAPID RESPONSE

SYSTEM THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO CAPTURE AND CONTAIN OIL IN THE

UNLIKELY EVENT OF A POTENTIAL FUTURE WELL BLOWOUT IN THE

DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO. IN OCTOBER 2010, THE SECRETARY OF THE

INTERIOR LIFTED THE MORATORIUM ON DEEPWATER DRILLING ACTIVITY,

PROVIDED THAT OPERATORS CERTIFY COMPLIANCE WITH NEW RULES AND

REQUIREMENTS. THE DRILLING MORATORIUM AND THE ENSUING SLOWDOWN

IN ISSUING DRILLING PERMITS HAVE RESULTED IN DELAYS IN SHALLOW

WATER DRILLING ACTIVITY, DELAYED DRILLING OF EXPLORATORY

DEEPWATER WELLS AND IMPACTED DEVELOPMENT DRILLING ON BOTH

OPERATED AND NONOPERATED PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN

THE GULF OF MEXICO WAS REDUCED BY ABOUT 10,000 BARRELS PER

DAY FOR THE FULL YEAR.

CHEVRON WAS ENGAGED IN VARIOUS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO DURING 2010. FIRST

OIL AT THE PERDIDO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT WAS ACHIEVED IN FIRST

QUARTER 2010. THE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES A 37.5 PERCENT

NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST IN A PRODUCING HOST FACILITY IN

ALAMINOS CANYON DESIGNED TO SERVICE MULTIPLE NONOPERATED FIELDS,

INCLUDING CHEVRONS 33.3 PERCENT-OWNED GREAT WHITE,

60 PERCENT-OWNED SILVERTIP AND 57.5 PERCENT-OWNED

TOBAGO. THE DEVELOPMENT HAS AN EXPECTED PRODUCTION LIFE OF

APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS.

THE FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION WAS MADE FOR THE TAHITI 2

WATERFLOOD PROJECT IN THIRD QUARTER 2010. TAHITI 2 IS THE SECOND

DEVELOPMENT PHASE FOR THE 58 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED

TAHITI FIELD AND IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE RECOVERY AND MAINTAIN

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTION NEAR THE FACILITY CAPACITY OF 125,000 BARRELS OF

OIL PER DAY. THE PROJECT INCLUDES THREE WATER INJECTION WELLS,

TWO ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION WELLS AND THE FACILITIES REQUIRED TO

DELIVER WATER TO THE INJECTION WELLS. DRILLING BEGAN ON THE

FIRST WATER INJECTION WELL IN SEPTEMBER 2010. THE FIELD HAS AN

ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE OF 30 YEARS. AS OF THE END OF

2010, PROVED RESERVES HAD NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THIS SECOND

DEVELOPMENT PHASE OF THE TAHITI FIELD.

DURING 2010, WORK CONTINUED AT THE 60 PERCENT-OWNED AND

OPERATED BIG FOOT DISCOVERY. THE PROJECT COMPLETED FRONT-END

ENGINEERING AND DESIGN (FEED) IN JUNE 2010 AND A FINAL

INVESTMENT DECISION WAS MADE IN DECEMBER 2010. TOTAL MAXIMUM

PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REACH 79,000 BARRELS OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY. FIRST PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED IN 2014,

AND AT THE END OF 2010 PROVED RESERVES HAD NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED.

THE FIELD HAS AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE OF 20 YEARS.

THE TOPSIDES MODIFICATIONS TO THE HOST FACILITY OF THE

CAESAR/TONGA PROJECT WERE COMPLETED IN 2010. THE COMPANY HAS A

20.3 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST IN THE CAESAR AND

TONGA PARTNERSHIPS UNITIZED AREA. DEVELOPMENT PLANS INCLUDE A

TOTAL OF FOUR WELLS AND A SUBSEA TIEBACK TO A NEARBY THIRD-PARTY

PRODUCTION FACILITY. WORK ON THE SUBSEA SYSTEM, COMMISSIONING OF

THE TOPSIDES AND THE INITIAL WELL COMPLETION PROGRAM CARRIED

OVER INTO 2011. A RECENT MECHANICAL ISSUE INVOLVING THE

PRODUCTION RISER SYSTEM HAS DELAYED FIRST PRODUCTION. PROVED

RESERVES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THE PROJECT.

THE JACK AND ST. MALO FIELDS ARE LOCATED WITHIN 25 MILES OF

EACH OTHER AND ARE BEING JOINTLY DEVELOPED. CHEVRON HAS A

50 PERCENT WORKING INTEREST IN JACK AND A 51 PERCENT

WORKING INTEREST IN ST. MALO, FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF AN

ADDITIONAL 9.8 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN ST. MALO IN MARCH

2010. BOTH FIELDS ARE COMPANY OPERATED. THE FEED ACTIVITIES

INITIATED IN 2009 CONTINUED INTO 2010, AND A FINAL INVESTMENT

DECISION WAS ACHIEVED IN OCTOBER 2010. THE FACILITY IS PLANNED

TO HAVE AN INITIAL DESIGN CAPACITY OF 177,000 BARRELS OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY. TOTAL PROJECT COSTS FOR THE INITIAL

PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT ARE ESTIMATED AT $7.5 BILLION AND

START-UP

IS

EXPECTED IN 2014. THE PROJECT HAS AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE

OF 30 YEARS. AT THE END OF 2010, PROVED RESERVES HAD NOT

BEEN RECOGNIZED.

ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS CONTINUED IN 2010 FOR THE

APPRAISED RESOURCE POTENTIAL ON THE MAD DOG II DEVELOPMENT

PROJECT, IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A 15.6 PERCENT

NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST. THESE AREAS ARE OUTSIDE THE

DRILLING RADIUS OF THE EXISTING FLOATING PRODUCTION FACILITY. A

DECISION ON THE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT, FOLLOWED BY THE PROJECT

MOVING INTO THE FEED STAGE, IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE

SECOND-HALF 2011. AT THE END OF 2010, PROVED RESERVES HAD NOT

BEEN RECOGNIZED.

STUDIES TO SCREEN AND EVALUATE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES

IN THE TUBULAR BELLS UNITIZED AREA, IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A

30 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST, CONTINUED INTO

2010, AND A SUBSEA TIEBACK TO A PLANNED THIRD-PARTY HOST

FACILITY WAS SELECTED AS THE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT. FEED COMMENCED

IN FOURTH QUARTER 2010 WITH A FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION EXPECTED

IN SECOND QUARTER 2011. AT THE END OF 2010, PROVED RESERVES HAD

NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED.

DEEPWATER EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN 2010 INCLUDED PARTICIPATION

IN FIVE EXPLORATORY WELLS  TWO WILDCAT, TWO APPRAISAL

AND ONE DELINEATION. DRILLING OPERATIONS ON TWO EXPLORATORY

WELLS WERE INTERRUPTED AND STOPPED IN SECOND QUARTER 2010 AS A

RESULT OF THE DEEPWATER DRILLING MORATORIUM IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO, INCLUDING DRILLING OF THE FIRST APPRAISAL WELL AT THE

55 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED BUCKSKIN DISCOVERY. THE FIRST

APPRAISAL WELL AT KNOTTY HEAD WAS COMPLETED IN MARCH 2010 AND

INTERPRETATION OF WELL RESULTS CONTINUED INTO 2011. CHEVRON HAS

A 25 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST IN THE KNOTTY

HEAD DISCOVERY. AT THE END OF 2010, THE COMPANY HAD NOT

RECOGNIZED PROVED RESERVES FOR ANY OF THESE EXPLORATION PROJECTS.

DURING 2010, THE COMPANY ADDED 15 NEW LEASES TO ITS DEEPWATER

PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF BID AWARDS STEMMING FROM A GULF OF

MEXICO LEASE SALE EARLY IN THE YEAR.

BESIDES THE ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPLORATION PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, THE COMPANY ALSO HAS

CONTRACTED CAPACITY OF 1 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY AT THE

THIRD-PARTY SABINE PASS LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG)

REGASIFICATION TERMINAL IN LOUISIANA TO ENABLE THE IMPORT OF

NATURAL GAS FOR THE NORTH AMERICA MARKET. CHEVRON HAS ALSO

CONTRACTED 1.6 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY OF CAPACITY IN A

THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE SYSTEM CONNECTING THE SABINE PASS LNG

TERMINAL TO THE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE GRID. THE PIPELINE PROVIDES

ACCESS TO TWO MAJOR SALT DOME STORAGE FIELDS AND 10 MAJOR

INTERSTATE PIPELINE SYSTEMS, INCLUDING AN INTERCONNECT WITH

CHEVRONS SABINE PIPELINE, WHICH CONNECTS TO THE HENRY HUB.

THE HENRY HUB INTERCONNECTS TO NINE INTERSTATE AND FOUR

INTRASTATE PIPELINES AND IS THE PRICING POINT FOR NATURAL GAS

FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE.

OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA AND THE GULF OF MEXICO, THE COMPANY MANAGES

OPERATIONS ACROSS THE MID-CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND ALASKA.

DURING 2010, THE COMPANYS U.S. PRODUCTION OUTSIDE

CALIFORNIA AND THE GULF OF MEXICO AVERAGED 249,000 NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS PER DAY, COMPOSED OF 91,000 BARRELS

OF CRUDE OIL, 773 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS AND

29,000 BARRELS OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

RESEARCH

AND TECHNOLOGY

THE COMPANYS ENERGY TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS

CHEVRONS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES BY PROVIDING

TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES AND COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT IN EARTH

SCIENCES; RESERVOIR AND PRODUCTION ENGINEERING; DRILLING AND

COMPLETIONS; FACILITIES ENGINEERING; MANUFACTURING; PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY; CATALYSIS; TECHNICAL COMPUTING; AND HEALTH,

ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY DISCIPLINES. THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

ORGANIZATION INTEGRATES COMPUTING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA

MANAGEMENT, SECURITY AND NETWORK TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE A

STANDARDIZED DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENABLE CHEVRONS

GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS PROCESSES.

CHEVRON TECHNOLOGY VENTURES (CTV) MANAGES INVESTMENTS AND

PROJECTS IN EMERGING ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR INTEGRATION

INTO CHEVRONS CORE BUSINESSES. AS OF THE END OF 2010, CTV

CONTINUED TO EXPLORE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS NEXT-GENERATION

BIOFUELS AND ADVANCED SOLAR. IN 2010, THE COMPANY CONSTRUCTED

AND COMMISSIONED A ONE MEGAWATT CONCENTRATING PHOTOVOLTAIC (CPV)

SOLAR FACILITY ON THE TAILING SITE OF CHEVRONS MOLYBDENUM

MINE IN QUESTA, NEW MEXICO. THIS BENEFICIAL REUSE PROJECT

IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CPV INSTALLATIONS IN THE WORLD. ALSO IN

2010, THE COMPANY CONSTRUCTED AND COMMISSIONED A 0.74 MEGAWATT

NEXT GENERATION SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC INSTALLATION ON A FORMER

REFINERY SITE IN BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA. SEVEN SOLAR PANEL

TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING TESTED TO ESTABLISH THE VIABILITY OF

THESE SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES AT OTHER CHEVRON SITES.

CHEVRONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE

$526 MILLION, $603 MILLION AND $702 MILLION FOR

THE YEARS 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES IN THE AREAS DESCRIBED

ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS

PROCESSES, AND ULTIMATE TECHNICAL OR COMMERCIAL SUCCESSES ARE

NOT CERTAIN.

ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND

TO SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND

REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS OPERATIONS ARE, OR ARE EXPECTED TO

BECOME, EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS.

IN 2010, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE $639 MILLION, REPRESENTING ABOUT

12 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES. THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO RETROFIT

EXISTING FACILITIES AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW

FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR- AND

WATER-QUALITY PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS

REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING

FACILITIES. FOR 2011, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION. THE FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS

ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE INTENDED TO

ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND GLOBAL

CLIMATE CHANGE, CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. FOR INSTANCE, IN DECEMBER

2009, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ISSUED

A FINAL ENDANGERMENT FINDING FOR GREENHOUSE GASES, WHICH FOUND

THAT EMISSIONS OF SIX GREENHOUSE GASES THREATEN THE PUBLIC

HEALTH AND WELFARE. GREENHOUSE GASES FROM NEW MOTOR VEHICLES AND

ENGINES ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH POLLUTION. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN

2010, THE EPA FINALIZED TWO REGULATIONS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT

THAT ESTABLISH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS FOR NEW

LIGHT-DUTY VEHICLES AND CLARIFY PRECONSTRUCTION PERMITTING

REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW OR MODIFIED STATIONARY SOURCE FACILITIES

WITH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT EXCEED 75,000 TONS PER YEAR

OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT. IN NOVEMBER 2010, THE AGENCY

ISSUED UPDATED GUIDANCE ON DETERMINING THE BEST AVAILABLE

CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES (BACT) THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE

IMPLEMENTED BY CERTAIN NEW AND MODIFIED STATIONARY SOURCE

FACILITIES BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2011, BUT THERE REMAINS

SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE IMPACT OF APPLYING BACT

REQUIREMENTS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. FINALLY, IN TWO RECENT

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE EPA AGREED TO SCHEDULES FOR

UNDERTAKING ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS RULEMAKINGS APPLICABLE TO

UTILITIES AND REFINERIES. THE AGENCY IS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP

THESE NEW REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN

MAY 2012 (UTILITIES) AND NOVEMBER 2012 (REFINERIES), SO IT IS

NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THEIR IMPACT AT THIS TIME. THE

EPAS ENDANGERMENT FINDING, MOTOR VEHICLE GREENHOUSE GAS

STANDARDS, AND GREENHOUSE GAS PERMIT RULE HAVE ALL BEEN

CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURTS AND DECISIONS ARE PENDING.

THE EPA ALSO FINALIZED ITS REVISED RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD

(RFS2) REGULATIONS AS REQUIRED BY THE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND

SECURITY ACT OF 2007. THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE FUEL PROVIDERS TO

BLEND INCREASED VOLUMES OF RENEWABLE FUELS INTO GASOLINE AND

DIESEL EACH YEAR AND ESTABLISH SPECIFIC GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

AND FEEDSTOCK CRITERIA FOR SUBCATEGORIES OF RENEWABLE FUEL,

INCLUDING CELLULOSIC FUEL, ADVANCED BIOFUEL AND BIOMASS-BASED

DIESEL. THE SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF THIS REGULATION ARE DETERMINED

BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATING MARKETS FOR RENEWABLE

FUELS AND EPA REGULATORY DECISIONS ON POTENTIAL WAIVERS OF

VOLUME REQUIREMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, UNDER CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS

ACT, ENACTED IN 2006, THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD (CARB),

CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE LAW, HAS ADOPTED A NEW LOW-CARBON

FUEL STANDARD INTENDED TO REDUCE THE CARBON INTENSITY OF

TRANSPORTATION FUELS. THE STATE IS BEHIND SCHEDULE IN COMPLETING

CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARD. CONSEQUENTLY, INITIAL CARBON

INTENSITY REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY

2011, BUT CARB HAS DELAYED OTHER ASPECTS OF COMPLIANCE UNTIL IT

COMPLETES FURTHER UPDATES TO THE REGULATION LATER IN THE YEAR.

IN DECEMBER 2010, CARB ADOPTED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE CAP

AND TRADE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS OF THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS

ACT. THE FIRST COMPLIANCE PERIOD OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

BEGINS IN 2012 AND ENDS IN DECEMBER 2014. CARB HAS YET TO

DEVELOP DETAILED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THIS PORTION OF THE

ACT, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF HOW EMISSIONS ALLOWANCES

WILL BE ALLOCATED AND TRADED DURING THIS PERIOD. THE EFFECT OF

ANY SUCH REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS UNCERTAIN.

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS

PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A HISTORY OF GENERATING

SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND

TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS, SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD

MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL,

WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

GEOPOLITICAL RISK. CHEVRON ACCEPTS THE RISK OF CHANGING

COMMODITY PRICES AS PART OF ITS BUSINESS PLANNING PROCESS. AS

SUCH, AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY CARRIES SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CRUDE OIL PRICES.

DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF HISTORICALLY LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM EARNINGS AND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. THE IMPACT ON

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCT

SALES.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION OR THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING

AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE,

DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO

BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION

ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION

OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES BEYOND ITS CONTROL, INCLUDING

HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL

UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES,

EXPLOSIONS AND SYSTEM FAILURES, ANY OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN

SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE NATURAL

ENVIRONMENT.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS HAVE INHERENT RISKS AND HAZARDS THAT

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AND CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT.

CHEVRONS RESULTS DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND

MITIGATE THE RISKS AND HAZARDS INHERENT TO OPERATING IN THE

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO

MINIMIZE THESE OPERATIONAL RISKS BY CAREFULLY DESIGNING AND

BUILDING ITS FACILITIES AND CONDUCTING ITS OPERATIONS IN A SAFE

AND RELIABLE MANNER. HOWEVER, FAILURE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS

EFFECTIVELY COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED INCIDENTS, INCLUDING

RELEASES, EXPLOSIONS OR MECHANICAL FAILURES RESULTING IN

PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF LIFE, ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF

REVENUES, LEGAL LIABILITY

AND/OR

DISRUPTION TO OPERATIONS. CHEVRON HAS IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINS

A SYSTEM OF POLICIES, BEHAVIORS AND COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS TO

MANAGE SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, RELIABILITY AND EFFICIENCY

RISKS; TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND POLICIES;

AND TO RESPOND TO AND LEARN FROM UNEXPECTED INCIDENTS.

NONETHELESS, IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE CHEVRON IS NOT THE

OPERATOR, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL

OVER THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE AND

CONTROL SUCH RISKS.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS FROM LITIGATION

OR GOVERNMENT ACTION.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. OFTEN THESE

OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH JOINT VENTURES OVER WHICH THE

COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND CONTROL. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY ARISING FROM PRIVATE

LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENT ACTION, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT SOCIETAL

PRESSURES OR POLITICAL OR OTHER FACTORS ARE INVOLVED, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE IMPOSED WITHOUT REGARD TO

THE COMPANYS CAUSATION OF OR CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASSERTED

DAMAGE, OR TO OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS

PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL

TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS,

CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT

TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY

MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE

ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

25 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES WERE

LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT

INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES

(OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND

VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND

KUWAIT. TWENTY-THREE PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED

RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

CONTINUED POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING CLIMATE

CHANGE, THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT, AND POTENTIAL

MITIGATION THROUGH REGULATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION

AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS ARE

CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION. FOR

INSTANCE, THE KYOTO PROTOCOL AND CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL

WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUAL OR PENDING

FEDERAL, STATE AND PROVINCIAL REGULATIONS, ENVISION A REDUCTION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH MARKET-BASED REGULATORY

PROGRAMS, TECHNOLOGY-BASED OR PERFORMANCE-BASED STANDARDS OR A

COMBINATION OF THEM. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO EXISTING

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIMITS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE SUCH

REGULATION IS CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION

AND NEW ZEALAND.

IN 2010, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

FINALIZED TWO REGULATIONS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT THAT ESTABLISH

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS FOR NEW LIGHT-DUTY VEHICLES

AND CLARIFY PRECONSTRUCTION PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW OR

MODIFIED STATIONARY SOURCE FACILITIES WITH GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS THAT EXCEED 75,000 TONS PER YEAR OF CARBON DIOXIDE

EQUIVALENT. IN ADDITION, THE EPA RECENTLY AGREED TO DEVELOP

ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM

UTILITIES AND REFINERIES. THE AGENCY IS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP

THESE NEW REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN

MAY 2012 (UTILITIES) AND NOVEMBER 2012 (REFINERIES), SO IT IS

NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THEIR IMPACT AT THIS TIME.

THE U.S. CONGRESS HAS PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED AND MAY IN THE

FUTURE CONSIDER LEGISLATION AIMED AT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS. AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT ANY

SPECIFIC CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS IN 2011 OR BEYOND, AND IT IS

UNCLEAR HOW ANY SUCH LEGISLATION WOULD RECONCILE WITH THE CLEAN

AIR ACT OR CURRENT EPA REGULATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2010, CALIFORNIA ADOPTED REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING

THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATES

GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT, ALSO KNOWN AS AB32. THE FIRST

COMPLIANCE PERIOD OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BEGINS IN 2012

AND ENDS IN DECEMBER 2014. CHEVRON MAY INCUR COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH EMISSIONS REDUCTION ACTIVITIES, AND THE PURCHASE OF

ALLOWANCES OR CREDITS FOR ITS FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IN

ADDITION, CHEVRONS PURCHASED ENERGY COSTS FROM UTILITIES

MAY INCREASE STARTING IN JANUARY 2012, WHEN ELECTRICITY

GENERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ALLOWANCES OR CREDITS FOR

ELECTRICITY SOLD IN CALIFORNIA.

THESE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS-RELATED LAWS, POLICIES

AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE,

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS UNCERTAIN

AND IS EXPECTED TO VARY BY JURISDICTION DEPENDING ON THE LAWS

ENACTED IN EACH JURISDICTION, THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES IN

IT AND MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND VARIOUS MINERALS SUCH

AS COAL; THE UPGRADING OF PRODUCTION FROM OIL SANDS INTO

SYNTHETIC OIL; POWER GENERATION; THE CONVERSION OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS INTO REFINED PRODUCTS; THE PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION

AND REGASIFICATION OF NATURAL GAS; THE TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND CONSUMERS OR

CUSTOMERS USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS RESULT IN

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT COULD WELL BE REGULATED. SOME OF

THESE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS CONSUMERS AND CUSTOMERS

USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ACTIONS TAKEN BY

THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL.

THE EFFECT OF REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, THE SECTORS COVERED, THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON WOULD

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS OR WOULD

NEED TO PURCHASE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS ON THE OPEN MARKET OR

THROUGH AUCTIONS, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF EMISSION

ALLOWANCES AND CREDITS, AND THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR OTHER

REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER THE COSTS

INCURRED THROUGH THE PRICING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES OR INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE OR USE

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY SELLS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

SALES VOLUMES, REVENUES AND MARGINS.

CHANGES

IN MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD.

IN PREPARING THE COMPANYS PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INCLUDING ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, CHEVRONS MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER

APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS AS OF A SPECIFIED DATE. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

EXPERIENCE AS OF THAT DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK

AND UNCERTAINTY. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

AREAS REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BY

MANAGEMENT INCLUDE MEASUREMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS; ESTIMATES OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RECOVERABLE RESERVES; ACCRUALS FOR

ESTIMATED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVES; AND

IMPAIRMENTS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. CHANGES IN

ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE INFORMATION UNDERLYING THE

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

PLANS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES,

COULD AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR EXPENSES.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPERIOR

COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO, ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003

BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN

RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY

HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT

FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND

RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH

MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY

(TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO INC., WAS A MINORITY MEMBER OF

THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED

OIL COMPANY, AS THE MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS

HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE CONCLUSION OF

THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY

ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO

A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR

FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE

GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE

CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A

THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40 MILLION.

AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE

GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A

FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING

FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS

LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER

CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE

ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY; THIRD,

THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN

ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE

RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR AND BY THE PERTINENT

PROVINCIAL AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT

TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE

REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS

FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND

PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL

OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY

AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY

STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING THAT

THE COURT ASSESS $18.9 BILLION, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO

THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED

DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH

CARE SYSTEMS AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PETROECUADOR. THE

ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL

$8.4 BILLION COULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST

ENRICHMENT. IN 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY CHEVRON OF

EVIDENCE THAT THE JUDGE PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN WHICH

BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY OUTCOME,

THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE CASE WAS RECUSED. IN 2010, CHEVRON

MOVED TO STRIKE THE MINING ENGINEERS REPORT AND TO DISMISS

THE CASE BASED ON EVIDENCE OBTAINED THROUGH DISCOVERY IN THE

UNITED STATES INDICATING THAT THE REPORT WAS PREPARED BY

CONSULTANTS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS BEFORE BEING PRESENTED AS THE

MINING ENGINEERS INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL WORK AND

SHOWING FURTHER EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT. IN AUGUST 2010, THE

JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER STATING THAT HE WAS NOT BOUND BY THE

MINING ENGINEERS REPORT AND REQUIRING THE PARTIES TO

PROVIDE THEIR POSITIONS ON DAMAGES WITHIN 45 DAYS. CHEVRON

SUBSEQUENTLY PETITIONED FOR RECUSAL OF THE JUDGE, CLAIMING THAT

HE HAD DISREGARDED EVIDENCE OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT AND THAT HE

HAD FAILED TO RULE ON A NUMBER OF MOTIONS WITHIN THE STATUTORY

TIME REQUIREMENT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2010, CHEVRON SUBMITTED ITS POSITION ON DAMAGES,

ASSERTING THAT NO AMOUNT SHOULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST IT. THE

PLAINTIFFS SUBMISSION, WHICH RELIED IN PART ON THE MINING

ENGINEERS REPORT, TOOK THE POSITION THAT DAMAGES ARE

BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 BILLION AND $76 BILLION AND

THAT UNJUST ENRICHMENT SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN AN AMOUNT BETWEEN

APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION AND $38 BILLION. THE NEXT

DAY, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF

THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE

CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT. CHEVRON

PETITIONED TO HAVE THAT ORDER DECLARED A NULLITY IN LIGHT OF

CHEVRONS PRIOR RECUSAL PETITION, AND BECAUSE PROCEDURAL

AND EVIDENTIARY MATTERS REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IN OCTOBER 2010,

CHEVRONS MOTION TO RECUSE THE JUDGE WAS GRANTED. A NEW

JUDGE TOOK CHARGE OF THE CASE AND REVOKED THE PRIOR JUDGES

ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE. ON

DECEMBER 17, 2010, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE

EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE

HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT.

CHEVRON AND TEXPET FILED AN ARBITRATION CLAIM IN SEPTEMBER 2009

AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR BEFORE THE PERMANENT COURT OF

ARBITRATION IN THE HAGUE UNDER THE RULES OF THE UNITED NATIONS

COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW. THE CLAIM ALLEGES

VIOLATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADORS OBLIGATIONS UNDER

THE UNITED STATES-ECUADOR BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT) AND

BREACHES OF THE SETTLEMENT AND RELEASE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND TEXPET (DESCRIBED ABOVE), WHICH ARE

INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS PROTECTED BY THE BIT. THROUGH THE

ARBITRATION, CHEVRON AND TEXPET ARE SEEKING RELIEF AGAINST THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR, INCLUDING A DECLARATION THAT ANY JUDGMENT

AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION CONSTITUTES A

VIOLATION OF ECUADORS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BIT. ON

FEBRUARY 9, 2011, THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION ISSUED

AN ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES REQUIRING THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR

TO TAKE ALL MEASURES AT ITS DISPOSAL TO SUSPEND OR CAUSE TO BE

SUSPENDED THE ENFORCEMENT OR RECOGNITION WITHIN AND WITHOUT

ECUADOR OF ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE

PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL. CHEVRON EXPECTS TO

CONTINUE SEEKING PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND MONETARY RELIEF

BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL.

THROUGH A SERIES OF RECENT U.S. COURT PROCEEDINGS INITIATED

BY CHEVRON TO OBTAIN DISCOVERY RELATING TO THE LAGO AGRIO

LITIGATION AND THE BIT ARBITRATION, CHEVRON HAS OBTAINED

EVIDENCE THAT IT BELIEVES SHOWS A PATTERN OF FRAUD, COLLUSION,

CORRUPTION, AND OTHER MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF SEVERAL LAWYERS,

CONSULTANTS AND OTHERS ACTING FOR THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS. IN

FEBRUARY 2011, CHEVRON FILED A CIVIL LAWSUIT IN THE FEDERAL

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

AGAINST THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND SEVERAL OF THEIR LAWYERS,

CONSULTANTS AND SUPPORTERS ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE RACKETEER

INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT AND OTHER STATE LAWS.

THROUGH THE CIVIL LAWSUIT, CHEVRON IS SEEKING RELIEF THAT

INCLUDES AN AWARD OF DAMAGES AND A DECLARATION THAT ANY JUDGMENT

AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION IS THE RESULT OF

FRAUD AND OTHER UNLAWFUL CONDUCT AND IS THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE.

ON FEBRUARY 8, 2011, THE COURT ISSUED A TEMPORARY

RESTRAINING ORDER PROHIBITING THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND

PERSONS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THEM FROM TAKING ANY ACTION IN

FURTHERANCE OF RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT

AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE UNTIL MARCH 8, 2011.

CHEVRONS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IS PRESENTLY

BEFORE THE COURT.

ON FEBRUARY 14, 2011, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO

RENDERED AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IN THE CASE. THE PROVINCIAL COURT

REJECTED CHEVRONS DEFENSES TO THE EXTENT THE COURT

ADDRESSED THEM IN ITS OPINION. THE JUDGMENT ASSESSES

APPROXIMATELY $8.6 BILLION IN DAMAGES AND ABOUT $0.9 BILLION FOR

THE PLAINTIFFS REPRESENTATIVES. IT ALSO ASSESSES AN

ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.6 BILLION IN PUNITIVE

DAMAGES UNLESS THE COMPANY PROVIDES A PUBLIC APOLOGY. CHEVRON

CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THE COURTS JUDGMENT IS ILLEGITIMATE

AND UNENFORCEABLE IN ECUADOR, THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE JUDGMENT IS THE PRODUCT

OF FRAUD, AND CONTRARY TO THE LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

CHEVRON WILL APPEAL THIS DECISION IN ECUADOR. CHEVRON CANNOT

PREDICT THE TIMING OR ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE APPEALS PROCESS IN

ECUADOR. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY

IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY. BECAUSE CHEVRON HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL

ASSETS IN ECUADOR, CHEVRON WOULD EXPECT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AS A

RESULT OF THIS JUDGMENT TO BE BROUGHT IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

CHEVRON EXPECTS TO CONTEST ANY SUCH ACTIONS.

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE FOREGOING MATTERS, INCLUDING ANY

FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON, REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A

RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUDGMENT, THE 2008 ENGINEERS REPORT

AND THE SEPTEMBER 2010 PLAINTIFFS SUBMISSION, MANAGEMENT

AS REPORTED IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, IN NOVEMBER 2008,

CARB PROPOSED A CIVIL PENALTY AGAINST THE COMPANYS

RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA, REFINERY FOR A NOTICE OF VIOLATION

RELATING TO GASOLINE THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY CERTIFIED AS TO

ANY CHANGE TO THE GASOLINE. DISCUSSIONS WITH CARB OFFICIALS

RELATING TO ALL OF THESE MATTERS CONTINUE.

AS REPORTED IN THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY REPORT ON

FORM 10-Q

FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2010, ON JULY 14,

2009, CARB ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION AGAINST CHEVRON PRODUCTS

COMPANY FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF CARBS REGULATIONS

GOVERNING THE CERTIFICATION OF GASOLINE THAT OCCURRED DURING

STORAGE AT A THIRD-PARTY FACILITY AND WHICH HAD BEEN

SELF-REPORTED BY THE COMPANY ON DISCOVERY. THE COMPANY HAS

DETERMINED THAT RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER MAY RESULT IN THE

PAYMENT OF A CIVIL PENALTY EXCEEDING $100,000.

OTHER

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS

AS REPORTED IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMMITMENTS THE COMPANY UNDERTOOK TO INSTALL

AND OPERATE CERTAIN AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT EQUIPMENT AT ITS

COMPLIANCE RECORDS. THE DOJS ACTION MAY RESULT IN PAYMENT

OF A CIVIL PENALTY EXCEEDING $100,000.

AS REPORTED IN THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY REPORT ON

FORM 10-Q

FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2010, CHEVRON HAS ENTERED

INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) WITH RESPECT TO ALLEGED AIR POLLUTION

VIOLATIONS AT THE COMPANYS PERTH AMBOY, NEW JERSEY

REFINERY IDENTIFIED IN A SEPTEMBER 16, 2008 COMPLIANCE

ORDER ISSUED BY THE EPA. THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS RELATE TO

CERTAIN MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE

EMISSIONS FROM REFINERY PROCESS EQUIPMENT). BASED ON DISCUSSIONS

WITH THE EPA, IT APPEARS THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WILL

THE ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN CHEVRONS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE

CHANGED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010. RESULTS FOR THE CHEMICALS BUSINESSES ARE NOW REPORTED AS PART OF

THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT UPSTREAM-ENABLING OPERATIONS,

PRIMARILY A GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PROJECT AND MAJOR INTERNATIONAL EXPORT PIPELINES, HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED

FROM THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT TO THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT. PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT HAS

BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE 2010 PRESENTATION.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-7 FOR A DISCUSSION OF

FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING

COUNTRIES: ANGOLA, ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, AZERBAIJAN, BANGLADESH, BRAZIL, CAMBODIA, CANADA, CHAD,

CHINA, COLOMBIA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, DENMARK, INDONESIA, KAZAKHSTAN, MYANMAR, THE

NETHERLANDS, NIGERIA, NORWAY, THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN

SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, THE PHILIPPINES, REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, SINGAPORE, SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTH

KOREA, THAILAND, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE UNITED STATES, VENEZUELA AND VIETNAM.

EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY DEPEND MOSTLY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOTH

SEGMENTS IS MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. IN THE DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE

LARGEST COST COMPONENT OF REFINED PRODUCTS. THE OVERALL TREND IN EARNINGS IS TYPICALLY LESS

AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM THE COMPANYS OTHER ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS. EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANY

IN ANY PERIOD MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL IN

NATURE.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY UPSTREAM, CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC,

REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE

UNITED STATES. CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND THE

COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE

CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES.

TO SUSTAIN ITS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MUST

DEVELOP AND REPLENISH AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS THAT OFFER ATTRACTIVE FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR THE

INVESTMENT REQUIRED. IDENTIFYING PROMISING AREAS FOR EXPLORATION, ACQUIRING THE NECESSARY RIGHTS TO

EXPLORE FOR AND TO PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, DRILLING SUCCESSFULLY, AND HANDLING THE MANY

TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS IN A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER ARE ALL IMPORTANT FACTORS IN

THIS EFFORT. PROJECTS OFTEN REQUIRE LONG LEAD TIMES AND LARGE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS. FROM TIME TO

TIME, CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS HAVE SOUGHT TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACTS OR IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE

COMPANY. GOVERNMENTS MAY ATTEMPT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE

DEVELOPMENTS, TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT IN EVALUATING FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AND OTHERWISE

SEEK TO MITIGATE ANY RISKS TO THE COMPANYS CURRENT OPERATIONS OR FUTURE PROSPECTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE OR TO ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO

ITS ASSET BASE TO HELP AUGMENT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH. REFER TO THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-7 FOR DISCUSSIONS OF NET GAINS ON ASSET SALES

DURING 2010. ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES.

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN RECENT YEARS, CHEVRON AND THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY GENERALLY EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN

CERTAIN COSTS THAT EXCEEDED THE GENERAL TREND OF INFLATION IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD. THIS

INCREASE IN COSTS AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATING EXPENSES AND CAPITAL PROGRAMS FOR ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR UPSTREAM. SOFTENING OF THESE COST PRESSURES STARTED IN LATE 2008 AND

CONTINUED THROUGH MOST OF 2009. INDUSTRY COSTS BEGAN TO LEVEL OUT IN FOURTH QUARTER 2009 AND ROSE

SLIGHTLY IN 2010. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE ITS SCHEDULE OF WORK, CONTRACTING,

PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY-CHAIN ACTIVITIES TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE COSTS.

THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, THE LEVEL OF

WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANY OF MOVEMENTS IN PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS. MANAGEMENT TAKES THESE DEVELOPMENTS INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CONDUCT OF DAILY

OPERATIONS AND FOR BUSINESS PLANNING. THE COMPANY REMAINS CONFIDENT OF ITS UNDERLYING FINANCIAL

STRENGTH TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL CHALLENGES PRESENTED IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. (REFER ALSO TO THE

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-12.)

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM

EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS OR FEARS THEREOF THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL

UNREST OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. MOREOVER, ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY

IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS AND SEEKS TO MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING

ITS FACILITIES AND BUSINESSES. BESIDES THE IMPACT OF THE FLUCTUATION IN PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS, THE LONGER-TERM TREND IN EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ALSO A FUNCTION OF OTHER

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OF CONTRACTS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL. EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION, BUT ALSO COMMODITY

PRICES AND PRICES CHARGED BY THE INDUSTRYS MATERIAL AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED

BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE INDUSTRYS OWN SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH MATERIALS AND

SERVICES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY

DAMAGE TO PRODUCTION FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST.

THE CHART AT THE LEFT SHOWS THE TREND IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI)

CRUDE OIL AND U.S. HENRY HUB NATURAL GAS. THE WTI PRICE AVERAGED $79 PER BARREL FOR THE FULL-YEAR

2010, COMPARED TO $62 IN 2009. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2011, THE WTI

PRICE WAS ABOUT $85.

A DIFFERENTIAL IN CRUDE OIL PRICES EXISTS BETWEEN HIGH QUALITY (HIGH-GRAVITY, LOW-SULFUR)

CRUDES AND THOSE OF LOWER QUALITY

(LOW-GRAVITY,

HIGH-SULFUR). THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL IN ANY

PERIOD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLY OF HEAVY CRUDE AVAILABLE VERSUS THE DEMAND, WHICH IS A

FUNCTION OF THE NUMBER OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PROCESS THIS LOWER QUALITY FEEDSTOCK INTO

LIGHT PRODUCTS (MOTOR GASOLINE, JET FUEL, AVIATION GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL). THE DIFFERENTIAL

WIDENED DURING 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO BOTH STRONG DIESEL PRICES AND RELATIVELY WEAKER FUEL OIL

PRICES.

CHEVRON PRODUCES OR SHARES IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN CALIFORNIA, CHAD,

INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, VENEZUELA AND IN CERTAIN FIELDS IN

ANGOLA, CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM SECTOR OF THE NORTH SEA. (SEE PAGE FS-11 FOR THE COMPANYS

AVERAGE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS.)

IN CONTRAST TO PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL

GAS IN MANY REGIONAL MARKETS ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS IN THOSE

MARKETS. IN THE UNITED STATES, PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED ABOUT $4.50 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET

(MCF) DURING 2010, COMPARED WITH ABOUT $3.80 DURING 2009. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2011, THE HENRY HUB

SPOT PRICE WAS ABOUT $4.20 PER MCF. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES

ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER DEMAND RELATIVE TO THE VOLUMES PRODUCED IN NORTH AMERICA AND

THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN UNDERGROUND STORAGE.

FS-3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE

DIFFERENT SUPPLY, DEMAND AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE RESULTED IN LOWER

AVERAGE SALES PRICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS IN THESE LOCATIONS. IN SOME OF

THESE LOCATIONS CHEVRON IS INVESTING IN

LONG-TERM

PROJECTS TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND

LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER TO OTHER MARKETS WHERE GREATER DEMAND RESULTS IN HIGHER

PRICES. INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS AVERAGED ABOUT $4.60 PER MCF DURING 2010, COMPARED

WITH ABOUT $4.00 PER MCF DURING 2009. THESE REALIZATIONS REFLECT A STRONG DEMAND FOR ENERGY IN

CERTAIN ASIAN MARKETS. (SEE PAGE FS-11 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS FOR THE

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.)

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2010 AVERAGED 2.763 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY. ABOUT ONE-FIFTH OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2010 OCCURRED IN THE

OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF ANGOLA, NIGERIA, VENEZUELA AND THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA

AND KUWAIT. OPEC QUOTAS HAD NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS NET CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION IN 2010, WHILE

PRODUCTION IN 2009 WAS REDUCED BY AN AVERAGE OF 20,000 BARRELS PER DAY DUE TO QUOTAS IMPOSED BY

OPEC. ALL OF THE IMPOSED CURTAILMENTS TOOK PLACE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2009. AT THE DECEMBER

2010 MEETING, MEMBERS OF OPEC SUPPORTED MAINTAINING PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN EFFECT SINCE DECEMBER

2008.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2011 WILL AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 2.790

MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS AND

UNCER-

TAINTIES, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION

VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN AGREEMENTS,

CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS, DELAYS IN PROJECT

STARTUPS, FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN VARIOUS MARKETS, WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY

SHUT IN PRODUCTION, CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING GEOPOLITICS, DELAYS IN COMPLETION OF MAINTENANCE

TURNAROUNDS, GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED DECLINES IN PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS

TO OPERATIONS. THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF

ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG BETWEEN INITIAL

EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM PROJECTS GENERALLY BEGIN WELL

IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION. A SIGNIFICANT

MAJORITY OF CHEVRONS UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IS MADE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGES FS-7 THROUGH FS-8 FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM BUSINESS.

REFER

TO TABLE V BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-71 FOR A TABULATION OF THE COMPANYS PROVED NET OIL AND

GAS RESERVES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AT THE BEGINNING OF 2008 AND EACH YEAR-END FROM 2008 THROUGH 2010,

AND AN ACCOMPANYING DISCUSSION OF MAJOR CHANGES TO PROVED RESERVES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010.

GULF OF MEXICO UPDATE

IN APRIL 2010, AN ACCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE TRANSOCEAN DEEPWATER HORIZON,

A DEEPWATER DRILLING RIG IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF LIFE, THE SINKING OF THE RIG

AND A SIGNIFICANT OIL SPILL. THE RIG WAS DRILLING AN EXPLORATORY WELL AT THE BP-OPERATED MACONDO

PROSPECT. CHEVRON WAS NOT A PARTICIPANT IN THE WELL. SUBSEQUENT TO THE EVENT, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT

OF THE INTERIOR PUT IN PLACE A MORATORIUM ON THE DRILLING OF WELLS USING SUBSEA BLOWOUT PREVENTERS

(BOPS) OR SURFACE BOPS ON A FLOATING FACILITY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE PACIFIC REGIONS. IN

OCTOBER 2010, THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR LIFTED THE DRILLING MORATORIUM, PROVIDED THAT OPERATORS

CERTIFY COMPLIANCE WITH ALL THE NEWLY EXPANDED RULES AND REQUIREMENTS, AND DEMONSTRATE THE

AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE BLOWOUT CONTAINMENT RESOURCES.

THE MORATORIUM AND THE ENSUING SLOWDOWN IN ISSUING DRILLING PERMITS SINCE THE MORATORIUM WAS

LIFTED HAVE RESULTED IN DELAYS IN SHALLOW WATER DRILLING ACTIVITY, DELAYED THE DRILLING OF

EXPLORATORY DEEPWATER WELLS AND IMPACTED DEVELOPMENT DRILLING ON BOTH OPERATED AND NONOPERATED

PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE COMPANYS DAILY NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO WAS REDUCED BY ABOUT 10,000 BARRELS PER DAY FOR THE FULL YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED

SEVERAL DEEPWATER DRILLING PERMIT APPLICATIONS AND PLANS TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS IN 2011.

TWO DEEPWATER DRILLSHIPS ARE ON STAND-BY, PENDING ISSUANCE OF PERMITS FROM

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE U.S. BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT, REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT (BOEMRE), TO DRILL WELLS IN

THE GULF OF MEXICO. A THIRD DEEPWATER DRILLSHIP IS DRILLING A WATER INJECTION WELL AT THE TAHITI

FIELD. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPLETION OF PREVIOUSLY DRILLED WELLS HAS RECOMMENCED AT THE NONOPERATED

PERDIDO AND CAESAR/TONGA PROJECTS. THE FUTURE EFFECTS OF THIS INCIDENT, INCLUDING ANY NEW OR

ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE ADOPTED AND THE TIMING OF BOEMRE ISSUING DRILLING PERMITS, ARE

NOT FULLY KNOWN AT THIS TIME. CHEVRON REMAINS COMMITTED TO DEEPWATER EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN

THE GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER DEEPWATER BASINS AROUND THE WORLD.

DURING THE MORATORIUM, CHEVRON

PARTICIPATED IN A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE INDUSTRY

STANDARDS IN PREVENTION, INTERVENTION AND SPILL RESPONSE. IN JULY 2010, CHEVRON AND SEVERAL OTHER

COMPANIES ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BUILD AND DEPLOY A RAPID RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO

CAPTURE AND CONTAIN CRUDE OIL IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF A FUTURE WELL BLOWOUT IN THE DEEPWATER GULF

OF MEXICO. THE NEW SYSTEM WILL BE ENGINEERED TO BE USED IN WATER DEPTHS UP TO 10,000 FEET AND

DESIGNED TO HAVE CAPACITY TO CONTAIN 100,000 BARRELS PER DAY, WITH POTENTIAL FOR EXPANSION. THE

COMPANIES COMMITTED TO EQUALLY FUND THE INITIAL $1 BILLION INVESTMENT IN THE SYSTEM. THERE WILL BE

ADDITIONAL ONGOING COSTS FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM COMPONENTS. AN INITIAL

AGREEMENT TO SECURE CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE

SECURED AND AVAILABLE IN THE COMING MONTHS, WITH THE NEW SYSTEM TARGETED FOR COMPLETION IN EARLY

2012. THE COMPANIES HAVE FORMED AN ORGANIZATION, THE MARINE WELL CONTAINMENT COMPANY, TO OPERATE

AND MAINTAIN THIS SYSTEM. OTHER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INVITED AND ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

ORGANIZATION.

DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO MARGINS ON THE REFINING,

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE GASOLINE, DIESEL, JET FUEL, LUBRICANTS, FUEL

OIL, FUEL AND LUBRICANT ADDITIVES, AND PETROCHEMICALS. INDUSTRY MARGINS ARE SOMETIMES VOLATILE AND

CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND BALANCE FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND

PETROCHEMICALS AND BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL, OTHER REFINERY AND PETROCHEMICAL

FEEDSTOCKS, AND NATURAL GAS. INDUSTRY MARGINS CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY INVENTORY LEVELS,

GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, COST OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES, REFINERY OR CHEMICAL PLANT CAPACITY

UTILIZATION, MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AND DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES OR CHEMICAL PLANTS RESULTING FROM

UNPLANNED OUTAGES DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER, FIRES OR OTHER OPERATIONAL EVENTS.

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY FOR DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY AND

EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS REFINING, MARKETING AND PETROCHEMICAL ASSETS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT SUPPLY FUNCTIONS AND THE VOLATILITY OF TANKER-CHARTER RATES FOR THE COMPANYS SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRYS DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT

TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND

ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE COMPANYS REFINING, MARKETING AND PETROCHEMICAL ASSETS.

THE COMPANYS MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE U.S.

GULF COAST, LATIN

AMERICA, ASIA, SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. CHEVRON OPERATES OR HAS SIGNIFICANT

OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REFINERIES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS EXCEPT LATIN AMERICA. IN THIRD QUARTER

2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS EXIT FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, DELAWARE, INDIANA, KENTUCKY,

NORTH CAROLINA, NEW JERSEY, MARYLAND, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA, WEST VIRGINIA

AND PARTS OF TENNESSEE, WHERE THE COMPANY SOLD CHEVRON- AND TEXACO-BRANDED MOTOR FUELS TO RETAIL

CUSTOMERS THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 1,100 STATIONS, AND TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS THROUGH

SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS. SALES IN THESE MARKETS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

TOTAL 2009 U.S. RETAIL FUEL SALES VOLUMES.

THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS IN 2010 IMPROVED OVER 2009, BUT REMAIN

RELATIVELY WEAK DUE TO THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, EXCESS REFINED PRODUCT SUPPLIES AND SURPLUS REFINING

CAPACITY. EXPECTING THESE CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IN FIRST QUARTER 2010 THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES WOULD BE RESTRUCTURED TO IMPROVE OPERATING

EFFICIENCY AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. AS PART OF THIS

RESTRUCTURING, EMPLOYEE-REDUCTION PROGRAMS WERE ANNOUNCED FOR THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL

DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS. THE INITIAL ESTIMATE INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY 3,200 EMPLOYEES. DUE TO

REDEPLOYMENT EFFORTS WITHIN THE COMPANY, IT IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED THAT APPROXIMATELY 2,800

EMPLOYEES IN THE DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS WILL BE TERMINATED UNDER THESE PROGRAMS BEFORE THE END OF

2011. ABOUT 1,100 OF THE AFFECTED EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2010, 1,400

EMPLOYEES WERE TERMINATED WORLDWIDE. REFER TO NOTE 23 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-59, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. IN 2010, THE COMPANY SOLICITED BIDS FOR 13 U.S.

TERMINALS AND CERTAIN OPERATIONS IN EUROPE (INCLUDING THE COMPANYS PEMBROKE REFINERY), THE

CARIBBEAN, AND SELECT CENTRAL AMERICA AND AFRICA MARKETS. THESE SALES ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS

ONGOING EFFORT TO CONCENTRATE DOWNSTREAM RESOURCES AND CAPITAL ON STRATEGIC GLOBAL ASSETS. THESE

POTENTIAL MARKET EXITS, DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS, AND OTHER ACTIONS MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN

FUTURE PERIODS. THROUGH FOURTH QUARTER 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF SIX U.S. TERMINALS

AND CERTAIN MARKETING BUSINESSES IN AFRICA, WHICH RESULTED IN GAINS THAT WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANY. ALSO, IN LATE 2010 THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS 23.4 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST

IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE COMPANY, WHICH RESULTED IN A GAIN ON SALE OF NEARLY $400 MILLION.

EMPLOYEE-REDUCTION PROGRAMS WERE ANNOUNCED FOR THE CORPORATE STAFFS. AS OF YEAR-END, IT WAS

EXPECTED THAT APPROXIMATELY 400 EMPLOYEES FROM THE CORPORATE STAFFS WILL BE TERMINATED UNDER THE

PROGRAMS BY THE END OF 2011, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 100 WHO WERE TERMINATED IN 2010. REFER TO NOTE

U.S. UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $4.1 BILLION IN 2010 INCREASED $1.9 BILLION FROM 2009. HIGHER

PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $2.1 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS. PARTLY

OFFSETTING THESE EFFECTS WERE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES OF $200 MILLION, IN PART DUE TO THE GULF OF

MEXICO DRILLING MORATORIUM. LOWER EXPLORATION EXPENSES WERE ESSENTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TAX ITEMS

AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSES.

U.S. UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $2.3 BILLION IN 2009 DECREASED $4.9 BILLION FROM 2008. LOWER PRICES

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS REDUCED EARNINGS BY ABOUT $5.2 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS,

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND GAINS ON ASSET SALES DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THESE EFFECTS WAS A BENEFIT OF ABOUT $1.3 BILLION RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN NET OIL EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION. AN APPROXIMATE $600 MILLION BENEFIT TO INCOME FROM LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES WAS MORE

THAN OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. THE BENEFIT FROM LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES WAS LARGELY

ASSOCIATED WITH AN ABSENCE OF CHARGES FOR DAMAGES RELATED TO THE 2008 HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR U.S. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2010 WAS

$71.59 PER BARREL, COMPARED WITH $54.36 IN 2009 AND $88.43 IN 2008. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS

REALIZATION WAS $4.26 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2010, COMPARED WITH $3.73 AND $7.90 IN 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2010 AVERAGED 708,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN 1 PERCENT FROM

2009 AND UP 6 PERCENT FROM 2008. NATURAL FIELD DECLINES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2009 WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED PRODUCTION FROM THE TAHITI FIELD. THE INCREASE BETWEEN 2009 AND 2008 WAS MAINLY DUE TO

THE START-UP OF THE BLIND FAITH FIELD IN LATE 2008 AND THE TAHITI FIELD IN SECOND QUARTER 2009. THE

NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FOR 2010 AVERAGED 489,000 BARRELS PER DAY, UP 1

PERCENT FROM 2009 AND UP 16 PERCENT COMPARED WITH 2008. NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 1.3

BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2010, DOWN APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENT FROM 2009 AND DOWN ABOUT 12

EARNINGS OF $13.6 BILLION IN 2010 INCREASED $4.9 BILLION FROM 2009. HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $4.3 BILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN NET OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN THE 2010 PERIOD BENEFITED INCOME BY ABOUT $1.2 BILLION. THIS NET BENEFIT WAS PARTLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES OF $500 MILLION. A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN TAX ITEMS OF ABOUT $450

MILLION WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSES. THE 2009 PERIOD INCLUDED GAINS OF ABOUT

$500 MILLION ON ASSET SALES AND TAX ITEMS RELATED TO THE GORGON PROJECT IN AUSTRALIA. FOREIGN

CURRENCY EFFECTS DECREASED EARNINGS BY $293 MILLION IN THE 2010 PERIOD, COMPARED WITH A REDUCTION

OF $578 MILLION A YEAR EARLIER, PRIMARILY REFLECTING NONCASH LOSSES ON BALANCE SHEET REMEASUREMENT.

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $8.7 BILLION IN 2009 DECREASED $6.4 BILLION FROM 2008.

LOWER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $7.0 BILLION, WHILE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EFFECTS AND HIGHER OPERATING AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES DECREASED INCOME BY A TOTAL OF $2.2 BILLION.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE ITEMS WERE BENEFITS OF $2.3 BILLION RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN SALES

VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND ABOUT $500 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES AND TAX ITEMS RELATED TO

THE GORGON PROJECT.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2010

WAS $72.68 PER BARREL, COMPARED WITH $55.97 IN 2009 AND $86.51 IN 2008. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS

REALIZATION WAS $4.64 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2010, COMPARED WITH $4.01 AND $5.19 IN 2009 AND

INTERNATIONAL NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF 2.06 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2010 INCREASED

ABOUT 3 PERCENT AND 11 PERCENT FROM 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE VOLUMES IN 2010 INCLUDE

SYNTHETIC OIL THAT WAS REPORTED IN 2009 AND 2008 AS PRODUCTION FROM OIL SANDS IN CANADA. ABSENT THE

IMPACT OF PRICES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY AGREEMENTS, NET OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION INCREASED 5 PERCENT IN 2010 AND 4 PERCENT IN 2009, WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEARS

PRODUCTION.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF INTERNATIONAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS 1.4 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY IN 2010, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT FROM 2009 AND 14 PERCENT FROM 2008.

INTERNATIONAL NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 3.7 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2010 WAS UP 4 PERCENT

U.S. DOWNSTREAM EARNED $1,339 MILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $121 MILLION IN

2009. IMPROVED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS INCREASED EARNINGS BY ABOUT $550 MILLION. ALSO

CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS A NEARLY $400 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF A 23.4 PERCENT OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE COMPANY. HIGHER EARNINGS FROM CHEMICALS OPERATIONS INCREASED

EARNINGS BY ABOUT $300 MILLION, LARGELY FROM IMPROVED MARGINS AT THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED CHEVRON

PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM).

EARNINGS DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION IN 2009 FROM 2008. LOWER REFINED PRODUCT MARGINS

RESULTED IN AN EARNINGS DECLINE OF $1.7 BILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF LOWER REFINED

PRODUCT MARGINS WAS A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH BENEFITED EARNINGS BY $300 MILLION, AND

AN INCREASE OF ABOUT $100 MILLION IN EARNINGS FROM CPCHEM. THE IMPROVEMENT FOR CPCHEM REFLECTED

LOWER UTILITY AND MANUFACTURING COSTS, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF AN IMPAIRMENT RECORDED IN 2008.

THESE BENEFITS MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER MARGINS ON THE SALE OF COMMODITY CHEMICALS.

SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED PRODUCTS WERE 1.35 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2010, A DECREASE OF 4

PERCENT FROM 2009. THE DECLINE WAS MAINLY IN GASOLINE AND JET FUEL SALES. SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED

PRODUCTS WERE 1.40 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2009, A DECREASE OF 1 PERCENT FROM 2008. U.S. BRANDED

GASOLINE SALES DECREASED TO 573,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN 2010, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT

AND 5 PERCENT DECLINES FROM 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN 2010, RELATIVE TO 2009 AND

2008, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED EXITS FROM SELECTED EASTERN U.S. RETAIL

MARKETS.

PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND INCREASED CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION.

DOWNSTREAM-RELATED AFFILIATE EARNINGS WERE ALSO HIGHER BETWEEN THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS, PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS FROM CPCHEM, AS A RESULT OF HIGHER MARGINS ON SALES OF COMMODITY CHEMICALS.

IMPROVED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS AND A FAVORABLE SWING IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS AT GS CALTEX

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE 40 PERCENT IN 2010, 43 PERCENT IN 2009 AND 44 PERCENT IN

2008. THE RATE WAS LOWER IN 2010 THAN IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM IMPACTS. A

LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM IN 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASED

UTILIZATION OF TAX CREDITS, WHICH HAD A GREATER IMPACT ON THE RATE THAN ONE-TIME DEFERRED TAX

BENEFITS AND RELATIVELY LOW TAX RATES ON ASSET SALES IN 2009. ALSO, A SMALLER PORTION OF COMPANY

INCOME WAS EARNED IN HIGHER TAX RATE INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM JURISDICTIONS IN 2010 THAN IN 2009.

FINALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT IMPACTS CAUSED A REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

BETWEEN PERIODS. THE RATE WAS LOWER IN 2009 THAN IN 2008 MAINLY DUE TO THE EFFECT IN 2009 OF

DEFERRED TAX BENEFITS AND RELATIVELY LOW TAX RATES ON ASSET SALES, BOTH RELATED TO AN INTERNATIONAL

UPSTREAM PROJECT. IN ADDITION, A GREATER PROPORTION OF BEFORE-TAX INCOME WAS EARNED IN 2009 BY

EQUITY AFFILIATES THAN IN 2008. (EQUITY AFFILIATE INCOME IS REPORTED AS A SINGLE AMOUNT ON AN

AFTER-TAX BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.) PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE ITEMS WAS THE

EFFECT OF A GREATER PROPORTION OF INCOME EARNED IN 2009 IN TAX JURISDICTIONS WITH HIGHER TAX RATES.

TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS WERE $11.5 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, UP FROM $10.5 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2009.

THE $1.0 BILLION INCREASE IN TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DURING 2010 INCLUDED

ISSUANCE OF $1.25 BILLION OF

TAX-EXEMPT

BONDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING

PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, REDEEMABLE

LONG-TERM

OBLIGATIONS AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF

LONG-TERM

DEBT, TOTALED $5.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, UP FROM $4.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2009.

OF THIS AMOUNT, $5.4 BILLION AND $4.2 BILLION WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH

PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END 2010, SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE

THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2011, AS THE COMPANY HAD THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY

COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD $6.0 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS

MAJOR BANKS, EXPIRING IN MAY 2013, WHICH ENABLE THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A

LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING AND CAN ALSO BE USED FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING

COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT

INTEREST RATES BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES

PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO

BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

HAS AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2013 FOR AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT

OF NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY.

THE MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE COMPANYS DEBT, AND THE COMPANYS COST

OF BORROWING CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE DEPENDING ON THESE DEBT RATINGS. THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING

PUBLIC BONDS ISSUED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION, CHEVRON CORPORATION PROFIT SHARING/SAVINGS PLAN TRUST

FUND, TEXACO CAPITAL INC. AND UNION OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE THE

OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ARE RATED AA BY STANDARD AND POORS

CORPORATION AND AA1 BY MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANYS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED

A-1+

BY STANDARD AND

POORS AND P-1 BY MOODYS. ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY,

INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE CAPITAL

PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. BASED ON ITS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT

RATINGS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH

REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO CAN MODIFY CAPITAL SPENDING PLANS DURING PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

IN JULY 2010, THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE $15 BILLION SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM INITIATED IN SEPTEMBER 2007. NO SHARE REPURCHASES OCCURRED IN 2010 UNDER THE

PROGRAM PRIOR TO ITS TERMINATION. FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 119

MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $10.1 BILLION. IN ITS PLACE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW,

ONGOING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WITH NO SET TERM OR MONETARY LIMITS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO

REPURCHASE BETWEEN $500 MILLION AND $1 BILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES PER QUARTER, AT PREVAILING

PRICES, AS PERMITTED BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SUBJECT TO MARKET

CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE COMPANY BEGAN PURCHASES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER, AND THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010, 8.8 MILLION SHARES WERE PURCHASED UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM FOR

$750 MILLION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR

2010 WERE $21.8 BILLION, INCLUDING

$1.4 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS

SHARE OF EQUITY-AFFILIATE EXPENDITURES. IN 2009 AND 2008,

EXPENDITURES WERE $22.2 BILLION AND $22.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF

$1.6 BILLION AND $2.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND $2 BILLION FOR THE

EXTENSION OF AN UPSTREAM CONCESSION IN 2009.

OF THE $21.8 BILLION OF EXPENDITURES IN 2010, 87 PERCENT, OR $18.9 BILLION, WAS RELATED TO

UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT WAS EXPENDED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2009 AND 2008.

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 82 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE

UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IN 2010, ABOUT 80 PERCENT IN 2009 AND ABOUT 70 PERCENT

IN 2008, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES

AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IN 2011, CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE $26.0 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.0 BILLION OF SPENDING BY

AFFILIATES. APPROXIMATELY 85 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, OR $22.6 BILLION, IS

BUDGETED FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUC-

TION ACTIVITIES, WITH $17.2 BILLION OF THIS AMOUNT FOR PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SPENDING

IN 2011 IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN ANGOLA, AUSTRALIA, BRAZIL, CANADA,

CHINA, NIGERIA, THAILAND, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO. ALSO INCLUDED IS FUNDING

FOR BASE BUSINESS IMPROVEMENTS AND FOCUSED EXPLORATION AND APPRAISAL PROGRAMS IN CORE HYDROCARBON

BASINS.

WORLDWIDE DOWNSTREAM SPENDING IN 2011 IS ESTIMATED AT $2.9 BILLION, WITH ABOUT $1.7 BILLION

FOR PROJECTS IN THE UNITED STATES. MAJOR CAPITAL OUTLAYS INCLUDE PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT

REFINERIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA.

INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY, POWER GENERATION AND OTHER CORPORATE BUSINESSES IN 2011 ARE

BUDGETED AT $500 MILLION.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAD NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $730 MILLION AND $647

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. DISTRIBUTIONS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

TOTALED $72 MILLION AND $71 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS

IN 2010, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $1.4 BILLION

(INCLUDING $1.19 BILLION TO THE U.S. PLANS AND $258 MILLION TO THE INTERNATIONAL PLANS). THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2011 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION ($650 MILLION FOR THE

U.S. PLANS AND $300 MILLION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PLANS). ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT

UPON INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC

FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO

OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS. REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION OF PENSION ACCOUNTING IN

THE COMPANYS GUARANTEE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN

EXPECTED TO BE OPERATIONAL BY 2012. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM

GUARANTEE AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE

NUMEROUS CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY OF

ANY AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON HAS RECORDED NO LIABILITY FOR ITS OBLIGATION UNDER

THIS GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON

AND MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT

TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300 MILLION. THROUGH THE END

OF 2010, THE COMPANY HAD PAID $48 MILLION UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED FOR

POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS HAD TO BE ASSERTED BY FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND MUST BE

ASSERTED NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES,

THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS

AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ARE TO BE NET OF

AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR

MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. THE ACQUIRER OF THOSE

ASSETS SHARED IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF $200

MILLION, WHICH HAD BEEN REACHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT, AFTER

REACHING THE $200 MILLION OBLIGATION, CHEVRON IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE

INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE

INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE ASSETS IN 1997.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY THAT ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

WITH RESPECT TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT

AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE

AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY,

DOES NOT INCLUDE OBLIGATIONS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND

REGASIFIED NATURAL GAS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS OF THE 36.4 PERCENT-OWNED ANGOLA LNG

AFFILIATE. THE LNG PLANT IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN 2012 AND IS DESIGNED

TO PRODUCE 5.2 MILLION METRIC TONS OF LNG AND RELATED NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PER YEAR. VOLUMES

AND PRICES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE NEITHER FIXED NOR DETERMINABLE.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS DISCUSSED BELOW. THE ESTIMATES OF FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK DISCUSSED BELOW

DO NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS PROJECTION OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE

MARKET CHANGES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING

THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A, OF THE COMPANYS 2010 ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO THE PRICE

VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS

AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF

ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND

STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL

GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY REFINERIES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES WERE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN 2010.

THE COMPANYS MARKET EXPOSURE POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN

INTERNAL RISK CONTROL GROUP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, WHICH HAVE

BEEN APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING

ACTIVITIES CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND ON ELECTRONIC PLATFORMS OF THE INTER-CONTINENTAL EXCHANGE AND CHICAGO MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE. IN ADDITION, CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCT SWAP CONTRACTS AND OPTION

CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS

COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES

REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM PUBLISHED MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER

INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CHEVRONS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY

INSTRUMENTS IN 2010 WAS A QUARTERLY AVERAGE DECREASE OF $1 MILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS AND A QUARTERLY

AVERAGE INCREASE OF $18 MILLION IN TOTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY USES A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON A

SINGLE DAY FROM THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS ON DERIVATIVE COMMODITY

INSTRUMENTS HELD OR ISSUED, WHICH ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AS

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES (ASC 815).

VAR IS THE MAXIMUM LOSS NOT TO BE EXCEEDED WITHIN A GIVEN PROBABILITY OR CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A

GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANYS VAR MODEL USES THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION METHOD THAT INVOLVES

GENERATING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS FROM THE SPECIFIED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND CONSTRUCTING A

FULL DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTFOLIOS POTENTIAL VALUES.

THE VAR MODEL UTILIZES AN EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE FOR COMPUTING HISTORICAL

VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL, AND A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD. THAT

IS, THE COMPANYS 95 PERCENT, ONE-DAY VAR CORRESPONDS TO THE UNREALIZED LOSS IN PORTFOLIO VALUE

THAT WOULD NOT BE EXCEEDED ON AVERAGE MORE THAN ONE IN EVERY 20 TRADING DAYS, IF THE PORTFOLIO WERE

HELD CONSTANT FOR ONE DAY.

THE ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT MARKET-RISK POSITIONS CAN BE

LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED WITHIN ONE DAY. FOR HEDGING AND RISK MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY USES CONVENTIONAL

EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS AS WELL AS NON-EXCHANGE-TRADED SWAPS, MOST

OF WHICH CAN BE LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED EFFECTIVELY WITHIN ONE DAY. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE 95

PERCENT/ONE-DAY VAR FOR EACH OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY RISK EXPOSURES IN THE AREA OF DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO

MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED

PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS. THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH

RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. THERE WERE NO OPEN FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS

OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. INTEREST RATE SWAPS, IF ANY, ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT

YEAR-END 2010, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS AND LONG-TERM

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. REFER TO OTHER INFORMATION IN NOTE 12 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, PAGE FS-43, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN

NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY

BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO 19 PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS,

THE MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS. RESOLUTION OF THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE

FUTURE. THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT

DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES

MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BEFORE THE

SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO, ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO

BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS.

THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM

THE OIL EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OPERATIONS AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM.

UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF TEXACO INC., WAS A MINORITY MEMBER

OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN

STATE-OWNED

OIL COMPANY, AS THE MAJORITY

PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE CONCLUSION

OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT

THIRD-PARTY

ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE CONCESSION

AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR FOR

TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO TEXPETS OWNERSHIP

SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A

THREE-YEAR

REMEDIATION

PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40 MILLION. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT

GRANTED TEXPET AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR

FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION

OVER CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT

BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN

ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY

GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR AND BY THE PERTINENT PROVINCIAL AND

MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS

THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE

REFLECTS PETROECUADORS FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND PETROECUADORS

FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING

THAT THE COURT ASSESS $18.9 BILLION, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL

COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER

ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

PETROECUADOR. THE ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN

ADDITIONAL $8.4 BILLION COULD BE ASSESSED

AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. IN 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY CHEVRON OF EVIDENCE

THAT THE JUDGE PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN WHICH BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THEMSELVES

OUT AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY OUTCOME, THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE

CASE WAS RECUSED. IN 2010, CHEVRON

MOVED TO STRIKE THE MINING ENGINEERS REPORT AND TO DISMISS THE CASE BASED ON EVIDENCE OBTAINED THROUGH DISCOVERY IN THE UNITED STATES

INDICATING THAT THE REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CON-

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SULTANTS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS BEFORE BEING PRESENTED AS

THE MINING ENGINEERS INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL WORK AND SHOWING FURTHER EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT.

IN AUGUST 2010, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER STATING THAT HE WAS NOT BOUND BY THE MINING ENGINEERS

REPORT AND REQUIRING THE PARTIES TO PROVIDE THEIR POSITIONS ON DAMAGES WITHIN 45 DAYS. CHEVRON

SUBSEQUENTLY PETITIONED FOR RECUSAL OF THE JUDGE, CLAIMING THAT HE HAD DISREGARDED EVIDENCE OF

FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT AND THAT HE HAD FAILED TO RULE ON A NUMBER OF MOTIONS WITHIN THE STATUTORY

TIME REQUIREMENT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2010, CHEVRON SUBMITTED ITS POSITION ON DAMAGES, ASSERTING THAT NO AMOUNT SHOULD

BE ASSESSED AGAINST IT. THE PLAINTIFFS SUBMISSION, WHICH RELIED IN PART ON THE MINING ENGINEERS

REPORT, TOOK THE POSITION THAT DAMAGES ARE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $16

BILLION AND $76 BILLION AND THAT

UNJUST ENRICHMENT SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN AN AMOUNT BETWEEN

APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION AND $38 BILLION. THE

NEXT DAY, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE

PARTIES THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT. CHEVRON PETITIONED

TO HAVE THAT ORDER DECLARED A NULLITY IN LIGHT OF CHEVRONS PRIOR RECUSAL PETITION, AND BECAUSE

PROCEDURAL AND EVIDENTIARY MATTERS REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IN OCTOBER 2010, CHEVRONS MOTION TO RECUSE

THE JUDGE WAS GRANTED. A NEW JUDGE TOOK CHARGE OF THE CASE AND REVOKED THE PRIOR JUDGES ORDER

CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE. ON DECEMBER 17, 2010, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING

THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO

THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT.

CHEVRON AND TEXPET FILED AN ARBITRATION CLAIM IN SEPTEMBER 2009 AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF

ECUADOR BEFORE THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION IN THE HAGUE UNDER THE RULES OF THE UNITED

NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW. THE CLAIM ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF

ECUADORS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATES-ECUADOR BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT) AND

BREACHES OF THE SETTLEMENT AND RELEASE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND TEXPET

(DESCRIBED ABOVE), WHICH ARE INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS PROTECTED BY THE BIT. THROUGH THE ARBITRATION,

CHEVRON AND TEXPET ARE SEEKING RELIEF AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR, INCLUDING A DECLARATION THAT

ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF ECUADORS

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BIT. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2011, THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION ISSUED AN ORDER

FOR INTERIM MEASURES REQUIRING THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR TO TAKE ALL

MEASURES AT ITS DISPOSAL TO

SUSPEND OR CAUSE TO BE SUSPENDED THE ENFORCEMENT OR RECOGNITION WITHIN AND WITHOUT ECUADOR OF ANY

JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL. CHEVRON

EXPECTS TO CONTINUE SEEKING PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND MONETARY

RELIEF BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL.

THROUGH A SERIES OF RECENT U.S. COURT PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY CHEVRON TO OBTAIN DISCOVERY

RELATING TO THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION AND THE BIT ARBITRATION, CHEVRON HAS OBTAINED EVIDENCE THAT

IT BELIEVES SHOWS A PATTERN OF FRAUD, COLLUSION, CORRUPTION, AND OTHER MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF

SEVERAL LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND OTHERS ACTING FOR THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS. IN FEBRUARY 2011,

CHEVRON FILED A CIVIL LAW-

SUIT IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

AGAINST THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND SEVERAL OF THEIR LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND SUPPORTERS ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT AND OTHER STATE LAWS. THROUGH

THE CIVIL LAWSUIT, CHEVRON IS SEEKING RELIEF THAT INCLUDES AN AWARD OF DAMAGES AND A DECLARATION

THAT ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION IS THE RESULT OF FRAUD AND OTHER

UNLAWFUL CONDUCT AND IS THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE. ON FEBRUARY 8, 2011, THE COURT ISSUED A TEMPORARY

RESTRAINING ORDER PROHIBITING THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND PERSONS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THEM

FROM TAKING ANY ACTION IN FURTHERANCE OF RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON

IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE UNTIL MARCH 8, 2011.

CHEVRONS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IS PRESENTLY BEFORE THE COURT.

ON FEBRUARY 14, 2011, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO RENDERED AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IN THE

CASE. THE PROVINCIAL COURT REJECTED CHEVRONS DEFENSES TO THE EXTENT THE COURT ADDRESSED THEM IN

ITS OPINION. THE JUDGMENT ASSESSES APPROXIMATELY $8.6 BILLION IN DAMAGES AND ABOUT $0.9 BILLION

FOR THE PLAINTIFFS REPRESENTATIVES. IT ALSO ASSESSES AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.6

BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNLESS THE COMPANY PROVIDES A PUBLIC APOLOGY. CHEVRON CONTINUES TO

BELIEVE THE COURTS JUDGMENT IS ILLEGITIMATE AND UNENFORCEABLE IN ECUADOR, THE UNITED STATES AND

OTHER COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE JUDGMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF FRAUD, AND CONTRARY TO

THE LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. CHEVRON WILL APPEAL THIS DECISION IN ECUADOR. CHEVRON CANNOT

PREDICT THE TIMING OR ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE APPEALS PROCESS IN ECUADOR. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE

A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY. BECAUSE CHEVRON HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS IN

ECUADOR, CHEVRON WOULD EXPECT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS JUDGMENT TO BE BROUGHT IN

OTHER JURISDICTIONS. CHEVRON  EXPECTS TO CONTEST ANY SUCH ACTIONS.

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE FOREGOING MATTERS, INCLUDING ANY FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON,

REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A

RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUDGMENT, THE

2008 ENGINEERS REPORT AND THE SEPTEMBER 2010 PLAINTIFFS SUBMISSION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE

THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE ANY UTILITY IN CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR

MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO LAWS, REGULATIONS,

PRIVATE CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL

SETTLEMENTS OR THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE

THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING

MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE

OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND

MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE

DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES

INCLUDED IN THE $1,507 MILLION YEAR-END 2010 RESERVE BALANCE WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

AT APPROXIMATELY 182 SITES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR

OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE

LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2010 WAS $185 MILLION. THE

FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON

TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT

DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2010 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,322 MILLION, $814 MILLION

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS,

MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), CHEMICAL FACILITIES, AND PIPELINES. THE

REMAINING $508 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($100

MILLION), UPSTREAM ($329 MILLION) AND OTHER BUSINESSES ($79 MILLION). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES,

WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND

ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF

CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND

VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF

THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2010 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET OBLIGATIONS WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. THE LIABILITY BALANCE OF

APPROXIMATELY $12.5 BILLION FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2010 RELATED PRIMARILY TO

UPSTREAM PROPERTIES.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS

FACILITIES, NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS

REACH THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS

BEEN MADE, AS THE INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED. REFER TO NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-47

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH TAX

RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR ALL TAX

JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A FINAL

DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS. THE

ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITY OR

DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION OF

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AN INCREASE OF $283

MILLION FROM 2009. THE 2009 BALANCE REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $317 MILLION FROM 2008.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED

WITH WELL WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS

TO WHETHER THE WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. THE EFFECT ON

EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE $2.7 BILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END 2010 IS

UNCERTAIN PENDING FUTURE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NORMAL PROJECT EVALUATION AND ADDITIONAL DRILLING.

REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-50, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUSPENDED WELLS.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS

BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM

RESERVE AT ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE

OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT

FOR THE FOUR ZONES. FOR THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET

BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD

BE OWED TO CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT

AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

ON APRIL 26, 2010, A CALIFORNIA APPEALS COURT ISSUED A RULING RELATED TO

THE ADEQUACY OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (EIR) SUPPORTING THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN PERMITS BY THE CITY OF

RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA, TO REPLACE AND UPGRADE CERTAIN FACILITIES AT CHEVRONS REFINERY IN

RICHMOND.

SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WITH PLAINTIFFS IN THE CASE ENDED LATE FOURTH QUARTER 2010, AND THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS OPTIONS GOING FORWARD, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REQUESTING THE CITY TO REVISE

THE EIR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE COURT OF APPEAL OR

OTHER ACTIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR THE PROJECT ARE UNCERTAIN. DUE TO

THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION, OR POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF ANY ACTION OR

COMBINATION OF ACTIONS, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE FINANCIAL EFFECTS, IF ANY,

OF THE RULING CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE MAY BE

SIGNIFICANT TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE FUTURE PERIOD.

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS; U.S. FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS

OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO

RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE

EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY

OWNED FACILITIES AND AT

THIRD-PARTY-OWNED

WASTE DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION

MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT

NON-CHEVRON

SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE

BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO

FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED

ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT

STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON

ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2010 AT

APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION FOR ITS

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE

APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1.5 BILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION,

CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED SITES, AND THE ABANDONMENT AND

RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR 2011, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $1.5 BILLION.

THESE CAPITAL COSTS ARE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS AND THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR

EXISTING FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE TO.

PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY

WITH EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY

PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER

DIFFERENT REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING

TO THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT

NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE; AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH

NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

RULES THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER

EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES, WHICH REQUIRE ...BY

ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING DATA, (THE RESERVES) CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE

CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE...UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHERE EXISTING

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDE PRICES BASED ON THE AVERAGE PRICE DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO

THE END OF  THE REPORTING PERIOD. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION, BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-71, FOR THE CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND TO

TABLE VII, CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FROM PROVED

RESERVES ON PAGE FS-80 FOR ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE VALUES FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2010. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32,

INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE

TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-22, INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS

UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES. THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO ESTIMATES,

UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-32. THE

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED

CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT

WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE

COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS

AND EXPENSE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN

OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE

AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING OPEB OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES.

NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-52, INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AT THE END OF 2010 AND 2009; THE COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE FOR

THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010; AND THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THOSE PERIODS.

FS-20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS OPERATING

EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE YEAR-END 2010 AND 2009 FUNDED STATUS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS AND

OBLIGATIONS, OF EACH OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IS RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET. THE DIFFERENCES RELATED TO OVERFUNDED PENSION PLANS ARE REPORTED AS A LONG-TERM

ASSET IN DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERFUNDED OR

UNFUNDED PENSION AND OPEB PLANS ARE REPORTED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR RESERVES FOR EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS. AMOUNTS YET TO BE RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF PENSION OR OPEB EXPENSE ARE REPORTED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THE COMPANY USES A PROCESS THAT

INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE

AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS

ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8 PERCENT SINCE 2002. FOR THE 10 YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2010, ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS AVERAGED 4.7 PERCENT FOR THIS PLAN. THE ACTUAL RETURN FOR 2010 WAS 11.6

PERCENT AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROAD RECOVERY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS

OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY

MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET

VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY

FIXED-INCOME

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 4.8

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN AND 5.0 PERCENT FOR ITS OPEB PLAN. THESE

RATES WERE SELECTED BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO

THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF

YEAR-END

2010. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF

2009 WERE 5.3 PERCENT FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN AND 5.8 PERCENT FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. OPEB

PLAN, AND 6.3 PERCENT AT THE END OF 2008 FOR BOTH THE U.S. PENSION AND OPEB PLANS.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE

PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2010 WAS $1.1 BILLION. AS AN

INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE

COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. PENSION

PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2010 BY APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION. A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 61 PERCENT OF

THE  COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2010 BY

APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION.

AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION OBLIGATION, THUS CHANGING THE

FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE TOTAL PENSION LIABILITY ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, FOR UNDERFUNDED PLANS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.3

BILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION, A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S.

PENSION PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION, WHICH WOULD HAVE

DECREASED THE PLANS UNDERFUNDED STATUS FROM APPROXIMATELY $0.9 BILLION TO $0.6 BILLION. OTHER

PLANS WOULD BE LESS UNDERFUNDED AS DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE. THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN

THE WORLDS FINANCIAL MARKETS.

IN 2010, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $1.45 BILLION (INCLUDING $1.19 BILLION

TO THE U.S. PLANS). IN 2011, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $950

MILLION. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2010 WAS $166 MILLION AND THE TOTAL LIABILITY,

WHICH REFLECTED THE UNFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AT THE END OF 2010, WAS $3.6 BILLION.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2010, A

1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED

FOR ABOUT 69 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE DECREASED OPEB EXPENSE BY

APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION. A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE SAME PLAN, WHICH

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 85 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE DECREASED TOTAL OPEB

LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2010 BY APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION.

FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS

LIMITED TO 4 PERCENT PER YEAR. FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES UNDER AGE 65 WHOSE CLAIMS

EXPERIENCES ARE COMBINED FOR RATING PURPOSES, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES START WITH 8

PERCENT IN 2011 AND GRADUALLY DROP TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2018 AND BEYOND. AS AN INDICATION OF THE HEALTH

CARE COST-TREND RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2010, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE

IN THE RATES FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 85 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE INCREASED OPEB

EXPENSE BY $8 MILLION.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE EXPENSE AND THE FUNDED STATUS OF

EACH PLAN AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN BENEFIT PLAN COSTS IN THE YEAR THE DIFFERENCE

OCCURS. INSTEAD, THE DIFFERENCES ARE

TO NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-52, FOR INFORMATION ON THE $6.7 BILLION OF BEFORE-TAX ACTUARIAL

LOSSES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010; A DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD USED TO

AMORTIZE THOSE COSTS; AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EXPENSE DURING 2011.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE COMPANY

ASSESSES ITS PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND,

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED PROVED

RESERVE QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL

MARKET SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED

PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS. REFER ALSO TO THE

DISCUSSION OF IMPAIRMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN NOTE 9 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-37.

NO MAJOR INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E AND INVESTMENTS WERE RECORDED FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF

OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT

PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN

THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR

ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS, WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN

NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD,

AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES,

ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING

VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED

TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME.

IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE.

DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES WHETHER ANY

WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN

SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD

OR CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET

REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY

PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE

ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED

OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A

DECISION IS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS. THAT IS, THE ASSETS WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THEY ARE CLASSIFIED

AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, LESS COSTS TO SELL, ARE LESS THAN THE

ASSETS ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS

REQUIRED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR GOODWILL (ASC 350), THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT THE

REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT

BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR

CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY

FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON

CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION,

THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION, AND

IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS GENERALLY RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES

IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY REPORTS

THESE LOSSES AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AN EXCEPTION TO

FS-22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIS HANDLING IS FOR INCOME TAX MATTERS, FOR

WHICH BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT (I.E., LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION. FOR

ADDITIONAL  DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES, REFER TO NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-47. REFER

ALSO TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS SECTION FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE THREE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN

USED IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT

MUST BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING (ASC 860), ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (ASU 2009-16)

THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2009-16 IN DECEMBER 2009. THIS STANDARD BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 CHANGES HOW COMPANIES ACCOUNT FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES. ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE DID NOT

HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

CONSOLIDATION (ASC 810), IMPROVEMENTS TO FINANCIAL REPORTING BY ENTERPRISES INVOLVED WITH

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(ASU

2009-17)

THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2009-17 IN DECEMBER 2009. THIS STANDARD

BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY JANUARY 1, 2010. ASU 2009-17 REQUIRES THE ENTERPRISE TO

QUALITATIVELY ASSESS IF IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITY (VIE), AND IF

SO, THE VIE MUST BE CONSOLIDATED. ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

RECEIVABLES (ASC 310), DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

(ASU

2010-20)

IN JULY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2010-20, WHICH BECAME

EFFECTIVE WITH THE COMPANYS REPORTING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THIS STANDARD AMENDS AND EXPANDS

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THESE AMENDMENTS, COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO DISAGGREGATE, BY

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT OR CLASS OF FINANCING RECEIVABLE, CERTAIN EXISTING DISCLOSURES AND PROVIDE

CERTAIN NEW DISCLOSURES ABOUT FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DID NOT CHANGE THE COMPANYS EXISTING DISCLOSURES.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY

ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE, AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED

AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO

OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL

MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING

THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT  PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A

MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT

OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS; LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND REGASIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL

GAS (LNG); TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL EXPORT PIPELINES; PROCESSING,

TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS; AND A GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PROJECT. DOWNSTREAM

OPERATIONS RELATE PRIMARILY TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL

AND REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR

EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR; AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR

INDUSTRIAL USES, AND ADDITIVES FOR FUELS AND LUBRICANT OILS.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES SUBJECT THE

COMPANY TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT

IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS

ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH

THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURES AND

CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO

AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO

50 PERCENT, OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY

DECISIONS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY

CURRENTLY IN INCOME.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND

THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A

DECLINE IS OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE

INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT

FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS

MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT CHANGED FOR

SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY

INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT

PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS

FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE AFFILIATES

REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES

AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED

TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY,

GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT

TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN

CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS COMMODITY TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM

TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. INTEREST

RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. WHERE CHEVRON IS A

PARTY TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, FAIR VALUE RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE GENERALLY OFFSET ON THE BALANCE

SHEET.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE IN

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

BANK TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS ARE REPORTED AS TIME DEPOSITS. THE

BALANCE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND IS MARKED-TO-MARKET,

WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST,

USING A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT

FS-32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

(LIFO) METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET. MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND OTHER

INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED

PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED

PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE CAPITALIZED FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT HAVE

FOUND CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED WHEN

THE DRILLING IS COMPLETED, PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF

RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. ALL OTHER

EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-50, FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES,

ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR

A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN

INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION,

DEVELOPMENT AREA OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN DOWNSTREAM, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE GENERALLY

DONE ON THE BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A MARKETING AREA OR MARKETING ASSETS BY COUNTRY.

IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE

EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE

LOWER VALUE. REFER TO NOTE 9, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-37, RELATING TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

AS REQUIRED UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

CODIFICATION (ASC) 410), THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND A

LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET AND

THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 25, ON PAGE FS-62, RELATING TO AROS.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD

GENERALLY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD, AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES

FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION

PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR MINING ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD AS THE PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE

DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO

AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES AND FROM SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE (INCLUDING THOSE FOR PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS), REPAIRS

AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED

BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR GOODWILL (ASC 350), THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING

UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT

BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS OR TO

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR

CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION

COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL

FS-33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

MINERAL-PRODUCING

PROPERTIES, A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS MADE, FOLLOWING

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS. REFER TO NOTE 25, ON PAGE

FS-62, FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS AROS.

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A

LIABILITY FOR ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER

PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF

FUTURE COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE

COMPANYS OWN INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR

REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL, PETROLEUM AND

CHEMICALS PRODUCTS, AND ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, NET OF

ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FROM

PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON THE

ENTITLEMENT METHOD. EXCISE, VALUE-ADDED AND SIMILAR TAXES ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY ON A

REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTION BETWEEN A SELLER AND A CUSTOMER ARE PRESENTED ON A GROSS BASIS. THE

ASSOCIATED AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN AS A FOOTNOTE TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ON PAGE FS-27.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION

OF ONE ANOTHER (INCLUDING BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS) ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED ON A NET BASIS AND

REPORTED IN PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

STOCK

OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ISSUES STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND ACCOUNTS FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (ASC 718). FOR EQUITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS, TOTAL

COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE, AND FOR LIABILITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS, TOTAL COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON THE SETTLEMENT VALUE. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL AWARDS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO EARN

THE AWARD, WHICH IS THE SHORTER OF THE VESTING PERIOD OR THE TIME PERIOD AN EMPLOYEE BECOMES

ELIGIBLE TO RETAIN THE AWARD AT RETIREMENT. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED

UNDER THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE GRADED VESTING PROVISIONS BY WHICH ONE-THIRD OF

EACH AWARD VESTS ON THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT. THE COMPANY

AMORTIZES THESE GRADED AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

NOTE 2

AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE ATLAS ENERGY, INC.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, CHEVRON ANNOUNCED PLANS TO ACQUIRE ATLAS ENERGY, INC. THE ACQUISITION WAS

COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2011 FOR $4,470, INCLUDING ASSUMED DEBT. THE ACQUISITION WILL BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION (ASC 805). ATLAS HOLDS ONE OF THE PREMIER ACREAGE POSITIONS IN THE

MARCELLUS SHALE, CONCENTRATED IN SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA.

NOTE 3

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

THE COMPANY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (ASC 810) IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, AND RETROACTIVE TO THE EARLIEST PERIOD

PRESENTED. OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES HELD BY PARTIES OTHER THAN THE PARENT

ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE AMOUNT OF

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PARENT AND THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE BOTH

PRESENTED ON THE FACE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE TERM EARNINGS IS DEFINED AS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHEVRON CORPORATION.

ACTIVITY FOR THE EQUITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008 IS AS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR CASH-FLOW CLASSIFICATIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS (ASC 718),

THE NET DECREASE (INCREASE) IN OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES REDUCTIONS OF $67, $25 AND $106

FOR EXCESS INCOME TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE OFFSET BY AN EQUAL AMOUNT IN NET (PURCHASES) SALES OF TREASURY

SHARES.

THE NET (PURCHASES) SALES OF TREASURY SHARES REPRESENTS THE COST OF COMMON SHARES PURCHASED

LESS THE COST OF SHARES ISSUED FOR

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS. PURCHASES TOTALED $775, $6 AND

$8,011 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. PURCHASES IN 2010 AND 2008 INCLUDED SHARES PURCHASED

UNDER THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.

IN 2010, NET (PURCHASES) SALES OF OTHER SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF RESTRICTED CASH

ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL-INVESTMENT PROJECTS AT THE COMPANYS PASCAGOULA AND EL SEGUNDO REFINERIES

AND THE ANGOLA LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PROJECT THAT WAS INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AND

RECLASSIFIED FROM

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TO DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY ISSUED $1,250 AND $350, IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, OF

TAX EXEMPT BONDS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR U.S. REFINERY PROJECTS.

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS EXCLUDES CHANGES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

THAT DID NOT AFFECT CASH. IN 2008, NET (PURCHASES) SALES OF TREASURY SHARES EXCLUDES $680 OF

TREASURY SHARES ACQUIRED IN EXCHANGE FOR A U.S. UPSTREAM PROPERTY AND $280 IN CASH. THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THIS PROPERTY IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WAS

NOT SIGNIFICANT. IN 2008, A $2,450 INCREASE IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE

TO PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AT COST WERE CONSIDERED NONCASH TRANSACTIONS AND EXCLUDED

FROM NET DECREASE (INCREASE) IN OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. IN 2009,

THE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM NET DECREASE (INCREASE) IN

OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL AND WERE REPORTED AS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE AMOUNT IS RELATED TO

UPSTREAM OPERATING AGREEMENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2008 EXCLUDES A

$1,400 INCREASE IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AN ADDITIONAL

INTEREST IN AN EQUITY AFFILIATE THAT REQUIRED A CHANGE TO THE CONSOLIDATED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

THE INVESTMENT DURING 2008. THIS ADDITION WAS OFFSET PRIMARILY BY REDUCTIONS IN INVESTMENTS AND

ADVANCES AND WORKING CAPITAL AND AN INCREASE IN NON-CURRENT DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES.

REFER ALSO TO NOTE 25, ON PAGE FS-62, FOR A DISCUSSION OF REVISIONS TO THE COMPANYS AROS THAT ALSO

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (ASC 820) ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR

VALUE AND STIPULATE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARDS APPLY TO RECURRING AND

NONRECURRING FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. AMONG THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IS THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE COMPANY USES

TO VALUE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED AS

FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1: QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR

THE COMPANY, LEVEL 1 INPUTS INCLUDE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR WHICH THE PARTIES ARE

WILLING TO TRANSACT AT THE EXCHANGE-QUOTED PRICE AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY

TRADED.

LEVEL 2: INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. FOR THE

COMPANY, LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, PRICES OBTAINED

THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES, AND PRICES THAT CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OTHER OBSERVABLE

INPUTS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE COMPLETE TERM OF A CONTRACT.

LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE LEVEL 3 INPUTS FOR ANY OF ITS RECURRING

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. LEVEL 3 INPUTS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN NONRECURRING MEASUREMENTS OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN

2010, THE COMPANY USED LEVEL 3 INPUTS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN NONRECURRING

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS.

THE COMPANY CALCULATES FAIR VALUE FOR ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES BASED

ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE CASH THAT

WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SOLD AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

DERIVATIVES

THE

COMPANY RECORDS ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  OTHER THAN ANY COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE  ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AT FAIR VALUE, WITH VIRTUALLY ALL THE OFFSETTING AMOUNT ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR PROVISIONS AS CONTRACTS THAT ARE PUBLICLY TRADED

ON A REGULAR BASIS, THE COMPANY USES THE MARKET VALUES OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS AS AN

INPUT FOR FAIR VALUE CALCULATIONS.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PRINCIPALLY INCLUDE CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED

PRODUCT FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 INCLUDE

FUTURES, SWAPS AND OPTIONS CONTRACTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS SUCH AS THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE.

DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INCLUDE SWAPS, OPTIONS, AND FORWARD CONTRACTS PRINCIPALLY

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES, THE FAIR VALUES FOR WHICH ARE OBTAINED

FROM THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES, INDUSTRY PRICING SERVICES AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY OBTAINS

MULTIPLE SOURCES OF PRICING INFORMATION FOR THE LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS. SINCE THIS PRICING INFORMATION

IS GENERATED FROM OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY CONSISTENT. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT MATERIALLY ADJUST THIS INFORMATION. THE COMPANY INCORPORATES INTERNAL REVIEW, EVALUATION AND

ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES, INCLUDING A COMPARISON OF LEVEL 2 FAIR VALUES DERIVED FROM THE COMPANYS

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FOR-

WARD CURVES (ON A SAMPLE BASIS) WITH THE PRICING

INFORMATION TO DOCUMENT REASONABLE, LOGICAL AND

SUPPORTABLE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS AND PROPER LEVEL OF CLASSIFICATION.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND BANK TIME DEPOSITS IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. PORTFOLIOS. THE INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS

CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE PRIMARILY BANK TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS AND MONEY

MARKET FUNDS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HAD CARRYING/FAIR VALUES OF $14,060 AND $8,716 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE INSTRUMENTS HELD IN TIME DEPOSITS ARE

BANK TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS AND HAD CARRYING/FAIR VALUES OF $2,855 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND BANK TIME DEPOSITS REFLECT THE CASH

THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SETTLED AT YEAR-END.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DO NOT INCLUDE INVESTMENTS WITH A CARRYING/FAIR VALUE OF $855 AND

$123 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RESTRICTED

FUNDS RELATED TO AN INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND U.S. REFINERY PROJECTS, WHICH

ARE REPORTED IN DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. LONG-TERM

DEBT OF $5,636 AND $5,705 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $6,311 AND $6,229 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND

DECEMBER 31, 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET

APPROXIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT THE END OF 2010 AND

2009 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET

RISKS RELATED TO PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS,

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF

ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND

STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY

REFINERIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED

TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS PRINCIPALLY INCLUDE CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

REFINED PRODUCT FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS, AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. NONE OF THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS DESIGNATED AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS AFFILIATES

MAKE SUCH DESIGNATION. THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVES ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS NO MATERIAL MARKET OR

CREDIT RISKS TO ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF ITS COMMODITY

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY USES INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS TO GOVERN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE

OF THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE

COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY

AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET MARK-TO-MARKET

EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND

IS A REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO USES OTHER NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK.

REFLECTED IN INCOME. THERE WERE NO OPEN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 OR 2009.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS

OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. AT YEAR-END 2010 AND 2009, THE

COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS, TIME DEPOSITS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE

COMPANYS

SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE

PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THESE INVESTMENT

POLICIES LIMIT THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.

SIMILAR POLICIES ON DIVERSIFICATION AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE

DISPERSED AMONG THE COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF

ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, REQUIRING

LETTERS OF CREDIT IS A PRINCIPAL METHOD USED TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ALTHOUGH EACH SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS

OWN AFFAIRS, CHEVRON CORPORATION MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR

AFFILIATES. THE INVESTMENTS ARE GROUPED INTO TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS, UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM,

REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND OPERATING SEGMENTS AS DEFINED IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING (ASC 280). UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXPLORING FOR,

DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND REGASIFICATION

ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG); TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL

EXPORT PIPELINES; PROCESSING, TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS; AND A

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PROJECT. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REFINING OF CRUDE OIL INTO

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING OF CRUDE OIL AND

REFINED PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR; AND MANUFACTURING AND

MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT

ADDITIVES. ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE MINING OPERATIONS, POWER GENERATION

BUSINESSES, WORLDWIDE CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT FINANCING ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES, ENERGY SERVICES, AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND

TECHNOLOGY.

THE SEGMENTS ARE SEPARATELY MANAGED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES UNDER A STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES

SEGMENT MANAGERS WHO REPORT TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) (TERMS AS

DEFINED IN ASC 280). THE CODM IS THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (EXCOM), A COMMITTEE OF SENIOR

OFFICERS THAT INCLUDES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND EXCOM REPORTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

CHEVRON CORPORATION.

THE OPERATING SEGMENTS REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY, AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING (ASC 280), THAT ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES (A) FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE

EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM,

WHICH MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS AND ASSESSES THEIR

PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT MANAGERS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO AND MAINTAIN REGULAR

CONTACT WITH THE COMPANYS CODM TO DISCUSS THE SEGMENTS OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. THE CODM APPROVES ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS AT THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT

LEVEL, AS WELL AS REVIEWS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY FUNDING FOR MAJOR PROJECTS AND APPROVES MAJOR

CHANGES TO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY BUDGETS. HOWEVER, BUSINESS-UNIT MANAGERS WITHIN THE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY

RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ALL OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH

DAILY OPERATIONS. COMPANY OFFICERS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE EXCOM ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT

RESPONSIBILITIES AND PARTICIPATE IN OTHER COMMITTEES FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN ACTING AS THE CODM.

THE

ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN CHEVRONS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE CHANGED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010. CHEMICALS BUSINESSES ARE NOW REPORTED AS PART OF THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT UPSTREAM-ENABLING OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY A GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

PROJECT AND MAJOR INTERNATIONAL EXPORT PIPELINES, HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED FROM THE DOWNSTREAM

SEGMENT TO THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT. PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT HAS BEEN REVISED TO

CONFORM TO THE 2010 PRESENTATION.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY COUNTRY OF OPERATION IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ITS COUNTRY OF

DOMICILE. OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED AS INTERNATIONAL (OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES).

SEGMENT EARNINGS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ON AN AFTER-TAX

BASIS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF DEBT FINANCING INTEREST EXPENSE OR INVESTMENT INTEREST

INCOME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE COMPANY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS AND ASSETS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE

BILLED FOR THE DIRECT USE OF CORPORATE SERVICES. NONBILLABLE COSTS REMAIN AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL IN

ALL OTHER. EARNINGS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

DESCRIPTIONS OF MAJOR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATES,

ARE AS FOLLOWS.

TENGIZCHEVROIL

CHEVRON HAS A 50 PERCENT EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO), A JOINT

VENTURE FORMED IN 1993 TO DEVELOP THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV CRUDE OIL FIELDS IN KAZAKHSTAN OVER A

40-YEAR

PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN TCO WAS

ABOUT

$190 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN TCOS NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE RESULTS FROM

CHEVRON ACQUIRING A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN TCO AT A VALUE GREATER THAN THE UNDERLYING BOOK

VALUE FOR THAT PORTION OF TCOS NET ASSETS. SEE NOTE 7, ON PAGE FS-36, FOR SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL

INFORMATION FOR 100 PERCENT OF TCO.

PETROPIAR

CHEVRON HAS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST IN PETROPIAR, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2008 TO

OPERATE THE HAMACA HEAVY-OIL PRODUCTION AND UPGRADING PROJECT. THE PROJECT, LOCATED IN VENEZUELAS

ORINOCO BELT, HAS A 25-YEAR CONTRACT TERM. PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF PETROPIAR, CHEVRON HAD A 30

PERCENT INTEREST IN THE HAMACA PROJECT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

INVESTMENT IN PETROPIAR WAS APPROXIMATELY $190 LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

PETROPIARS NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF CHEVRONS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

PETROPIARS NET ASSETS OVER THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE VENTURE.

CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM

CHEVRON HAS A 15 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM, A

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY, WHICH PROVIDES THE CRITICAL EXPORT ROUTE FOR CRUDE OIL FROM BOTH TCO AND

KARACHAGANAK. THE COMPANY JOINED THE CONSORTIUM IN 1997 AND HAS INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES TOTALING

$974 WHICH INCLUDES LONG TERM LOANS OF $1,046 AT YEAR-END 2010. THE LOANS WERE PROVIDED TO FUND 30

PERCENT OF THE PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION. THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE CONSORTIUM

BECAUSE IT DOES NOT DIRECT ACTIVITIES OF THE CONSORTIUM AND ONLY RECEIVES ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE

OF THE FINANCIAL RETURNS.

PETROBOSCAN

CHEVRON HAS A 39 PERCENT INTEREST IN PETROBOSCAN, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2006

TO OPERATE THE BOSCAN FIELD IN VENEZUELA UNTIL 2026. CHEVRON PREVIOUSLY OPERATED THE FIELD UNDER AN

OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT

IN PETROBOSCAN WAS APPROXIMATELY $250 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCANS

NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REFLECTS THE EXCESS OF THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY

CHEVRON OVER ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCANS NET ASSETS.

ANGOLA LNG LTD.

CHEVRON HAS A 36 PERCENT INTEREST IN ANGOLA LNG LTD., WHICH WILL PROCESS AND

LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS PRODUCED IN ANGOLA FOR DELIVERY TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

LITIGATION

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO 19 PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS. RESOLUTION OF THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY

CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT DETERMINABLE, BUT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES MTBE IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BEFORE THE

SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO AGRIO, ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO

BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD

OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

OPERATIONS AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE

ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY OF

TEXACO INC., WAS A MINORITY

MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, AS THE

MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CON-

DUCTED SOLELY BY PETROECUADOR. AT THE

CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE

CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND

PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO

TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A

THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40. AFTER CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY

REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET AND ALL RELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM

ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR

FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION

OVER CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT

BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN

ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY

GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR AND BY THE PERTINENT PROVINCIAL AND

MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS

THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS

FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE

OPERATIONS.

IN 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A

FS-45

LITIGATION - CONTINUED

REPORT RECOMMENDING

THAT THE COURT ASSESS $18,900, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL

COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER

ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

PETROECUADOR. THE ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL $8,400 COULD BE ASSESSED

AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. IN 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY CHEVRON OF EVIDENCE

THAT THE JUDGE PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN WHICH BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING THEMSELVES

OUT AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY OUTCOME, THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER THE

CASE WAS RECUSED. IN 2010, CHEVRON MOVED TO STRIKE THE MINING ENGINEERS REPORT AND TO DISMISS THE

CASE BASED ON EVIDENCE OBTAINED THROUGH DISCOVERY IN THE UNITED STATES INDICATING THAT THE REPORT

WAS PREPARED BY CONSULTANTS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS BEFORE BEING PRESENTED AS THE MINING ENGINEERS

INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL WORK AND SHOWING FURTHER EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT. IN AUGUST 2010, THE

JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER STATING THAT HE WAS NOT BOUND BY THE MINING ENGINEERS REPORT AND REQUIRING

THE PARTIES TO PROVIDE THEIR POSITIONS ON DAMAGES WITHIN 45 DAYS. CHEVRON SUBSEQUENTLY PETITIONED

FOR RECUSAL OF THE JUDGE, CLAIMING THAT HE HAD DISREGARDED EVIDENCE OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT AND

THAT HE HAD FAILED TO RULE ON A NUMBER OF MOTIONS WITHIN THE STATUTORY TIME REQUIREMENT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2010, CHEVRON SUBMITTED ITS POSITION ON DAMAGES, ASSERTING THAT NO AMOUNT SHOULD

BE ASSESSED AGAINST IT. THE PLAINTIFFS SUBMISSION, WHICH RELIED IN PART ON THE MINING ENGINEERS

REPORT, TOOK THE POSITION THAT DAMAGES ARE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $16,000 AND $76,000 AND THAT

UNJUST ENRICHMENT SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN AN AMOUNT BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $5,000 AND $38,000. THE NEXT

DAY, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES

THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT. CHEVRON PETITIONED TO HAVE

THAT ORDER DECLARED A NULLITY IN LIGHT OF CHEVRONS PRIOR RECUSAL PETITION, AND BECAUSE PROCEDURAL

AND EVIDENTIARY MATTERS REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IN OCTOBER 2010, CHEVRONS MOTION TO RECUSE THE JUDGE

WAS GRANTED. A NEW JUDGE TOOK CHARGE OF THE CASE AND REVOKED THE PRIOR JUDGES ORDER CLOSING THE

EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE. ON DECEMBER 17, 2010, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE

EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT

HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT.

CHEVRON

AND TEXPET FILED AN ARBITRATION CLAIM IN SEPTEMBER 2009 AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR

BEFORE THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION IN THE HAGUE UNDER THE RULES OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON

INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW. THE CLAIM ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADORS

OBLIGATIONS UNDER

THE UNITED STATES-ECUADOR BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT) AND BREACHES OF THE SETTLEMENT AND

RELEASE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND TEXPET (DESCRIBED ABOVE), WHICH ARE

INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS PROTECTED

BY THE BIT. THROUGH THE ARBITRATION, CHEVRON AND TEXPET ARE SEEKING

RELIEF AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR, INCLUDING A DECLARATION THAT ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON

IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF ECUADORS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BIT. ON

FEBRUARY 9, 2011, THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION ISSUED AN ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES REQUIRING

THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR TO TAKE ALL MEASURES AT ITS DISPOSAL TO SUSPEND OR CAUSE TO BE SUSPENDED

THE ENFORCEMENT OR RECOGNITION WITHIN AND WITHOUT ECUADOR OF ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE

LAGO AGRIO CASE PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL. CHEVRON EXPECTS TO CONTINUE SEEKING

PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND MONETARY RELIEF BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL.

THROUGH A SERIES OF RECENT U.S. COURT PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY CHEVRON TO OBTAIN DISCOVERY

RELATING TO THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION AND THE BIT ARBITRATION, CHEVRON HAS OBTAINED EVIDENCE THAT

IT BELIEVES SHOWS A PATTERN OF FRAUD, COLLUSION, CORRUPTION, AND OTHER MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF

SEVERAL LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND OTHERS ACTING FOR THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS. IN FEBRUARY 2011,

CHEVRON FILED A CIVIL LAWSUIT IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

AGAINST THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND SEVERAL OF THEIR LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND SUPPORTERS ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT

AND OTHER STATE LAWS. THROUGH

THE CIVIL LAWSUIT, CHEVRON IS SEEKING RELIEF THAT INCLUDES AN AWARD OF DAMAGES AND A DECLARATION

THAT ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION IS THE RESULT OF FRAUD AND OTHER

UNLAWFUL CONDUCT AND IS THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE. ON FEBRUARY 8, 2011, THE COURT ISSUED A TEMPORARY

RESTRAINING ORDER PROHIBITING THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND PERSONS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THEM

FROM TAKING ANY ACTION IN FURTHERANCE OF RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON

IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE UNTIL MARCH 8, 2011. CHEVRONS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IS PRESENTLY BEFORE THE COURT.

ON FEBRUARY 14, 2011, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO RENDERED AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IN THE CASE.

THE PROVINCIAL COURT REJECTED CHEVRONS DEFENSES TO THE EXTENT THE COURT ADDRESSED THEM IN ITS

OPINION. THE JUDGMENT ASSESSES APPROXIMATELY $8,600 IN DAMAGES AND ABOUT $900 FOR THE PLAINTIFFS

REPRESENTATIVES. IT ALSO ASSESSES AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8,600 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES

UNLESS THE COMPANY PROVIDES A PUBLIC APOLOGY. CHEVRON CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THE COURTS JUDGMENT IS

ILLEGITIMATE AND UNENFORCEABLE IN ECUADOR, THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY ALSO

BELIEVES THE JUDGMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF FRAUD, AND CONTRARY TO THE LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

CHEVRON WILL APPEAL THIS DECISION IN ECUADOR. CHEVRON CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OR ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF THE APPEALS PROCESS IN ECUADOR. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY

IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY. BECAUSE CHEVRON HAS NO SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS IN ECUADOR, CHEVRON WOULD

EXPECT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS  AS A RESULT OF THIS JUDGMENT TO BE BROUGHT IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

CHEVRON  EXPECTS TO CONTEST ANY SUCH ACTIONS.

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE FOREGOING MATTERS, INCLUDING ANY FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON,

REMAINS UNCERTAIN.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A

RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUDGMENT, THE 2008

ENGINEERS REPORT AND THE SEPTEMBER 2010 PLAINTIFFS SUBMISSION, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THESE

DOCUMENTS HAVE ANY UTILITY IN CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR

MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 43.0 PERCENT IN 2009 TO 40.3 PERCENT IN 2010.

THE RATE WAS LOWER IN 2010 THAN IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM IMPACTS. A LOWER

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM IN 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASED

UTILIZATION OF TAX CREDITS, WHICH HAD A GREATER IMPACT ON THE RATE THAN ONE-TIME DEFERRED TAX

BENEFITS AND RELATIVELY LOW TAX RATES ON ASSET SALES IN 2009. ALSO, A SMALLER PORTION OF COMPANY

INCOME WAS EARNED IN HIGHER TAX RATE INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM JURISDICTIONS IN 2010 THAN IN 2009.

FINALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT IMPACTS CAUSED A REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

BETWEEN PERIODS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS DEFERRED TAXES ON A TAX-JURISDICTION BASIS AND CLASSIFIES THOSE NET

$8,553

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2010 INCREASED BY ALMOST $1,400 FROM YEAR-END 2009. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $700 IN 2010. INCREASES PRIMARILY RELATED TO

ADDITIONAL FOREIGN TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM EARNINGS IN HIGH-TAX-RATE INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS (WHICH WERE

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY VALUATION ALLOWANCES) AND TO INCREASED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THESE EFFECTS WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN DEFERRED CREDITS RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE USAGE OF TAX BENEFITS IN

INTERNATIONAL TAX JURISDICTIONS.

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS, TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES. IT REDUCES THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

TO AMOUNTS THAT ARE, IN MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. TAX LOSS

UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES (ASC

740-10), A COMPANY RECOGNIZES A TAX BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITION ONLY IF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A

LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION BASED SOLELY ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TERM TAX POSITION IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR INCOME

TAXES

(ASC

740-10-20) REFERS TO A POSITION IN A PREVIOUSLY FILED TAX RETURN OR A POSITION EXPECTED TO BE

TAKEN IN A FUTURE TAX RETURN THAT IS REFLECTED IN MEASURING CURRENT OR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIODS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE INDICATES THE CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008. THE TERM UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR INCOME TAXES (ASC 740-10-20) REFERS TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A TAX

POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN AND THE BENEFIT MEASURED AND RECOGNIZED IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. INTEREST AND PENALTIES ARE NOT INCLUDED.

APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE $3,507 OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED. CERTAIN OF THESE

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE TO TAX CARRYFORWARDS THAT MAY REQUIRE A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE

AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH RECOGNITION.

TAX POSITIONS FOR CHEVRON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX AUDITS

BY MANY TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS,

EXAMINATIONS OF TAX RETURNS FOR CERTAIN PRIOR TAX YEARS HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010. FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE LATEST YEARS FOR WHICH INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS HAD BEEN

FINALIZED WERE AS FOLLOWS: UNITED STATES  2005, NIGERIA 

1994, ANGOLA  2001 AND SAUDI ARABIA

 2003.

THE COMPANY ENGAGES IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES REGARDING THE RESOLUTION OF TAX

MATTERS IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. BOTH THE OUTCOME OF THESE TAX MATTERS AND THE TIMING OF

RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE OF THE TAX AUDITS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. HOWEVER, IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT DEVELOPMENTS ON TAX MATTERS IN CERTAIN TAX JURISDICTIONS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COMPANYS TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT STILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER OF MATTERS BEING

EXAMINED IN THE VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS.

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THE COMPANY REPORTS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO

LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, ACCRUALS

OF $225 FOR ANTICIPATED INTEREST AND PENALTY OBLIGATIONS WERE INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET, COMPARED WITH ACCRUALS OF $232 AS OF YEAR-END 2009. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) ASSOCIATED

WITH INTEREST AND PENALTIES WAS $40, $(20) AND $79 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON SHORT-TERM DEBT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD $6,000 IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR

BANKS, EXPIRING IN MAY 2013, THAT ENABLE THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM

BASIS. THESE FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING AND CAN ALSO BE USED FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE

PURPOSES. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH

NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT INTEREST RATES

BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES PUBLISHED BY

SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO BORROWINGS WERE

OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED $5,400 AND $4,190, RESPECTIVELY, OF

SHORT-TERM DEBT AS LONG-TERM. SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF

WORKING CAPITAL WITHIN ONE YEAR, AS THE COMPANY HAS BOTH THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED

BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

TRANSFERS

AND SERVICING (ASC 860), ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (ASU 2009-16)

THE

FASB ISSUED ASU 2009-16 IN DECEMBER 2009. THIS STANDARD BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY

1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 CHANGES HOW COMPANIES ACCOUNT FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND ELIMINATES

THE CONCEPT OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES. ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

CONSOLIDATION (ASC 810), IMPROVEMENTS TO FINANCIAL REPORTING BY ENTERPRISES INVOLVED WITH

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(ASU

2009-17)

THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2009-17 IN DECEMBER 2009. THIS STANDARD

BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY JANUARY 1, 2010. ASU 2009-17 REQUIRES THE ENTERPRISE TO

QUALITATIVELY ASSESS IF IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITY (VIE), AND IF

SO, THE VIE MUST BE CONSOLIDATED. ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

RECEIVABLES (ASC 310), DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND THE

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

(ASU

2010-20)

IN JULY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2010-20, WHICH BECAME

EFFECTIVE WITH THE COMPANYS REPORTING AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THIS STANDARD AMENDS AND EXPANDS

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE CREDIT QUALITY OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND THE RELATED ALLOWANCE

FOR CREDIT LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF THESE AMENDMENTS, COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO DISAGGREGATE, BY

PORTFOLIO SEGMENT OR CLASS OF FINANCING RECEIVABLE, CERTAIN EXISTING DISCLOSURES AND PROVIDE

CERTAIN NEW DISCLOSURES ABOUT FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND RELATED ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.

ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DID NOT CHANGE THE COMPANYS EXISTING DISCLOSURES.

NOTE 19

ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS

(ASC 932) PROVIDE THAT EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS CONTINUE TO BE CAPITALIZED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF

DRILLING WHEN (A) THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND (B) THE ENTITY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE

ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. IF EITHER CONDITION IS NOT MET OR IF AN ENTERPRISE

OBTAINS INFORMATION THAT RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OR OPERATIONAL VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT, THE EXPLORATORY WELL WOULD BE ASSUMED

TO BE IMPAIRED, AND ITS COSTS, NET OF ANY SALVAGE VALUE, WOULD BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. (NOTE THAT AN

ENTITY IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE EXPLORATORY OR EXPLORATORY-TYPE STRATIGRAPHIC WELL AS A

PRODUCING WELL.) THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PROVIDE A NUMBER OF INDICATORS THAT CAN ASSIST AN ENTITY

IN DEMONSTRATING THAT SUFFICIENT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND ECONOMIC

VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BEFORE PRODUCTION COULD BEGIN AND FOR WHICH ADDITIONAL DRILLING EFFORTS WERE

NOT UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. ADDITIONAL DRILLING WAS NOT DEEMED NECESSARY

BECAUSE THE PRESENCE OF HYDROCARBONS HAD ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES WERE IN

PROCESS TO ENABLE A FUTURE DECISION ON PROJECT DEVELOPMENT.

THE PROJECTS FOR THE $1,317 REFERENCED ABOVE HAD THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE PROJECTS ECONOMIC VIABILITY: (A) $501 (THREE PROJECTS)  PROJECT

ADDITION, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, PERFORMANCE UNITS

AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WAS $194 ($126 AFTER TAX), $170 ($110 AFTER TAX) AND $132 ($86 AFTER

TAX) FOR 2010,

2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. NO SIGNIFICANT STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST WAS CAPITALIZED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

CASH RECEIVED IN PAYMENT FOR OPTION

EXERCISES UNDER ALL

SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR

2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $385, $147 AND $404, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTIONS FROM

OPTION EXERCISES WERE $66, $25 AND $103 FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH PAID TO SETTLE PERFORMANCE UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS WAS $140, $89 AND $136 FOR

2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

CHEVRON LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)

AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND NONSTOCK GRANTS. FROM APRIL 2004 THROUGH JANUARY 2014, NO MORE THAN 160

MILLION SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP, AND NO MORE THAN 64 MILLION OF THOSE SHARES MAY BE IN

A FORM OTHER THAN A STOCK OPTION, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT OR AWARD REQUIRING FULL PAYMENT FOR

SHARES BY THE AWARD RECIPIENT. FOR THE MAJOR TYPES OF AWARDS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010,

THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS VARY BETWEEN THREE YEARS FOR THE PERFORMANCE UNITS AND 10 YEARS FOR THE STOCK

OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

TEXACO STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (TEXACO SIP)

ON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF TEXACO IN OCTOBER

2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRON OPTIONS. THESE

OPTIONS, WHICH HAVE 10-YEAR CONTRACTUAL LIVES EXTENDING INTO 2011, RETAINED A PROVISION FOR BEING

RESTORED. THIS PROVISION ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISES A STOCK OPTION TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS

EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WHO HAS SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING

OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES

EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE RESTORED

OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE IS THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED OPTION IS GRANTED. BEGINNING IN 2007,

RESTORED OPTIONS WERE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP. NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE FORMER

TEXACO PLANS.

UNOCAL SHARE-BASED PLANS (UNOCAL PLANS)

WHEN CHEVRON ACQUIRED UNOCAL IN AUGUST 2005, OUTSTANDING

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS UNOCAL PLANS WERE EXCHANGED FOR

FULLY VESTED CHEVRON OPTIONS AND APPRECIATION RIGHTS. THESE AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME PROVISIONS AS

THE ORIGINAL UNOCAL PLANS. UNEXERCISED AWARDS BEGAN EXPIRING IN EARLY 2010 AND WILL CONTINUE TO

2,679,108 SHARES. DURING 2010, 1,104,000 UNITS WERE GRANTED, 881,759 UNITS VESTED

WITH CASH PROCEEDS DISTRIBUTED TO RECIPIENTS AND 173,475 UNITS WERE FORFEITED. AT DECEMBER 31,

2010, UNITS OUTSTANDING WERE 2,727,874, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THESE

INSTRUMENTS WAS $266. IN ADDITION, OUTSTANDING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER

AWARDS THAT WERE

GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS LTIP AND FORMER TEXACO AND UNOCAL PROGRAMS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

1.6 MILLION

EQUIVALENT SHARES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. A LIABILITY OF $40 WAS RECORDED FOR THESE AWARDS.

IN

MARCH 2009, CHEVRON GRANTED ALL ELIGIBLE LTIP EMPLOYEES RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN LIEU OF

AN ANNUAL CASH BONUS. A TOTAL OF 453,965 UNITS WERE GRANTED AT $69.70 PER UNIT AT THE TIME OF THE

GRANT. THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SPECIAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WAS RECOGNIZED IN 2009. ALL

OF THE SPECIAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN NOVEMBER 2010.

NOTE 21

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY PREFUNDS

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS AS REQUIRED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS OR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE PREFUNDING

PROVIDES ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL QUALIFIED PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT TYPICALLY FUND

U.S. NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAWS AND

REGULATIONS BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT

RETURNS MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT (OPEB) PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL

BENEFITS, AS WELL AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS ARE

UNFUNDED, AND THE COMPANY AND RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE

RETIREES IN THE COMPANYS MAIN U.S. MEDICAL PLAN IS SECONDARY TO MEDICARE (INCLUDING PART D) AND

THE INCREASE TO THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 4

PERCENT EACH YEAR. CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY.

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (ASC 715),

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE

OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF EACH OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AS AN ASSET

OR LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE

FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS FOR 2010 AND

NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES

RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER 31,

2010, FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB PLANS ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER APPROXIMATELY 10, 12 AND 10 YEARS,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMORTIZATION

PERIODS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS

UNDER THE PLANS. THESE LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE HIGHER OF

THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO

AMORTIZATION IS DETERMINED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS. DURING 2011, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ACTUARIAL

LOSSES OF $314, $114 AND $64 WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S.

PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, RESPEC

-

TIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES AN ADDITIONAL $250 WILL BE RECOGNIZED FROM ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS DURING 2011 RELATED TO LUMP-SUM SETTLEMENT COSTS FROM U.S.

PENSION PLANS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR RECOGNIZING PRIOR SERVICE COSTS (CREDITS) RECORDED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WAS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN AND 11

YEARS FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND 12 YEARS FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS. DURING 2011, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES PRIOR SERVICE

(CREDITS) COSTS OF $(8), $27 AND

$(72) WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, RESPECTIVELY.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON

PENSION ASSETS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF

EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIFIC

ASSET-CLASS RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN

ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH

THESE STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002

FOR U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2010, THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8 PERCENT.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF

PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE YEAR-END

MEASUREMENT DATE, AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING

RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF

DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TODAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR.

FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 4.8

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN AND 5.0 PERCENT FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLAN. THIS RATE WAS BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO

THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF

YEAR-END 2010.

THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF

2009 WERE 5.3 PERCENT AND 5.8 PERCENT FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN AND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DISCOUNT RATE AT THE END OF

2008 WAS 6.3 PERCENT FOR BOTH THE U.S. PENSION PLAN AND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES START WITH 8 PERCENT IN 2011 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2018 AND

BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES STARTED

WITH 7 PERCENT IN 2010 AND GRADUALLY DECLINED TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2018 AND BEYOND. IN BOTH

MEASUREMENTS, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS WAS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR

RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE IMPACT IS MITIGATED BY THE 4 PERCENT CAP ON THE COMPANYS MEDICAL

CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PLAN. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE IN THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

PLAN ASSETS AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY

THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

OPEB PLANS (ASC 715) PROVIDE USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF: HOW INVESTMENT

ALLOCATION DECISIONS ARE MADE; THE MAJOR CLASSES OF PLAN ASSETS; THE INPUTS AND VALUATION

TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS; THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ON CHANGES IN PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PERIOD; AND SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS

OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS.

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE COMPANY USES TO VALUE THE PENSION ASSETS IS DIVIDED

INTO THREE LEVELS.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - CONTINUED

LEVEL 1: FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS ARE MEASURED USING UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES

FOR THE ASSETS OR THE PRICES OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE PLANS HAVE THE ABILITY

TO ACCESS.

LEVEL 2: FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS ARE MEASURED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS IN

ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS IN INACTIVE MARKETS; INPUTS OTHER

THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET; AND INPUTS THAT ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM

OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BY CORRELATION OR OTHER MEANS. IF THE

ASSET HAS A CONTRACTUAL TERM, THE LEVEL 2 INPUT IS OBSERVABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF

THE ASSET. THE FAIR VALUES FOR LEVEL 2 ASSETS ARE GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY BROKER

QUOTES, INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND EXCHANGES.

LEVEL 3: INPUTS TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ARE UNOBSERVABLE FOR THESE ASSETS. VALUATION MAY

BE PERFORMED USING A FINANCIAL MODEL WITH ESTIMATED INPUTS ENTERED INTO THE MODEL.

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE PENSION PLANS ARE TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST

RATE OF TOTAL RETURN WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS OF RISK AND LIQUIDITY, TO DIVERSIFY AND MITIGATE

POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR

BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANYS U.S. AND U.K. PENSION PLANS COMPRISE 86 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PENSION ASSETS.

BOTH THE U.S. AND U.K. PLANS HAVE AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE THAT REGULARLY MEETS DURING THE YEAR TO

REVIEW THE ASSET HOLDINGS AND THEIR RETURNS. TO ASSESS THE PLANS INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, LONG-TERM

ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE CHEVRON BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED THE

FOLLOWING APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES 40-70 PERCENT, FIXED INCOME AND CASH 20-65

PERCENT, REAL ESTATE 0-15 PERCENT, AND OTHER 0-5 PERCENT. FOR THE U.K. PENSION PLAN, THE U.K. BOARD

OF TRUSTEES HAS ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING ASSET ALLOCATION GUIDELINES, WHICH ARE REVIEWED

REGULARLY: EQUITIES 60-80 PERCENT AND FIXED INCOME AND CASH 20-40 PERCENT. THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES THAT

VARY BY PLAN. ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION WITHIN APPROVED RANGES IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF CURRENT

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS RISK. THERE ARE NO

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK IN PLAN ASSETS DUE TO THE DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENT CLASSES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT PREFUND ITS OPEB OBLIGATIONS.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

IN 2010, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $1,192 AND $258 TO ITS

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2011, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO

BE APPROXIMATELY $650 AND $300 TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL

CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PAYING OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $225 IN 2011,

AS COMPARED WITH $183 PAID IN 2010.

THE FOLLOWING BENEFIT PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE ESTIMATED FUTURE SERVICE, ARE EXPECTED TO BE

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - CONTINUED

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF CHEVRON AND CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP).

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE

FUNDED EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE

RELEASE OF COMMON STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (LESOP), WHICH IS

DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION THAT FOLLOWS. TOTAL COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS

WITHIN THE ESIP WERE $253, $257, AND $231 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS

REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF SHARES RELEASED FROM THE LESOP TOTALING $97, $184 AND $40 IN 2010, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING AMOUNTS, TOTALING $156, $73 AND $191 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENT OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRON ESIP IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP).

IN 1989, CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LESOP AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES PARTIAL

PREFUNDING OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

AS PERMITTED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (ASC 718), THE DEBT OF THE

LESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED COMPENSATION

AND BENEFIT PLAN TRUST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE. INTEREST ACCRUED ON LESOP DEBT IS

RECORDED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF

RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL LESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE COMPUTATIONS.

TOTAL CREDITS TO EXPENSE FOR THE LESOP WERE $1, $3 AND $1 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. THE NET CREDIT FOR THE RESPECTIVE YEARS WAS COMPOSED OF CREDITS TO COMPENSATION

EXPENSE OF $6, $15 AND $15 AND CHARGES TO INTEREST EXPENSE FOR LESOP DEBT OF $5, $12 AND $14.

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES, $46, $110 AND $35 WERE USED IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED IN 2010, 2009 OR 2008, AS

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY THE LESOP WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE.

SHARES HELD IN THE LESOP ARE RELEASED AND ALLOCATED TO THE ACCOUNTS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS

BASED ON DEBT SERVICE DEEMED TO BE PAID IN THE YEAR IN PROPORTION TO THE TOTAL OF

CURRENT-YEAR AND REMAINING DEBT SERVICE. LESOP SHARES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, WERE AS

BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, TEXACO ESTABLISHED A BENEFIT PLAN

TRUST FOR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS. AT YEAR-END 2010, THE TRUST

CONTAINED 14.2 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRON TREASURY STOCK. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE SHARES OR USE THE

DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT PAY SUCH

BENEFITS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS. THE

TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUSTS BENEFICIARIES. THE

SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE PURPOSES UNTIL

DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD BY THE TRUST IN PAYMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, UNOCAL ESTABLISHED VARIOUS GRANTOR TRUSTS TO FUND

OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS, INCLUDING THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL

RETIREMENT PLANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, TRUST ASSETS OF $57 WERE INVESTED PRIMARILY IN

INTEREST-EARNING ACCOUNTS.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

THE CHEVRON INCENTIVE PLAN IS AN ANNUAL CASH BONUS PLAN FOR ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES THAT LINKS AWARDS TO CORPORATE, UNIT AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR CASH BONUSES WERE $766, $561 AND $757 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2010, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED EMPLOYEE REDUCTION PROGRAMS RELATED TO THE

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION OF ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES AND CORPORATE STAFFS. THE INITIAL

ESTIMATE INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY 3,200 EMPLOYEES IN DOWNSTREAM AND 600 EMPLOYEES FROM CORPORATE

STAFFS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO BE TERMINATED UNDER THE PROGRAMS. DUE TO REDEPLOYMENT EFFORTS WITHIN

THE COMPANY, TOTAL EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REDUCED FROM

APPROXIMATELY 3,800 EMPLOYEES TO APPROXIMATELY 3,200 EMPLOYEES. ABOUT 1,500 OF THE AFFECTED

EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. ABOUT 1,500 EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TERMINATED TO DATE, AND

THE PROGRAMS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2011.

A BEFORE-TAX CHARGE OF $244 ($175 AFTER TAX) WAS RECORDED IN FIRST QUARTER 2010, WITH $191

REPORTED AS OPERATING EXPENSES AND $53 AS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN TERMINATIONS RESULTING FROM REASSIGNMENTS

WITHIN THE COMPANY, AN ADJUSTMENT TO TOTAL CHARGES WAS MADE IN FOURTH QUARTER 2010, WHICH

EFFECTIVELY REDUCED THE TOTAL BEFORE-TAX CHARGE FROM $244 TO $234 ($167 AFTER TAX). THE ACCRUED

LIABILITY IS CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. APPROXIMATELY $71 ($45 AFTER

TAX) IS ASSOCIATED WITH TERMINATIONS IN U.S. DOWNSTREAM, $119 ($92 AFTER TAX) IN INTERNATIONAL

DOWNSTREAM AND $44 ($30 AFTER TAX) IN ALL OTHER.

DURING THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF 2010, THE COMPANY MADE PAYMENTS OF $96 ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

LIABILITIES. THE MAJORITY OF THE PAYMENTS WERE IN DOWNSTREAM.

INCOME

TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED. REFER TO NOTE 15, BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-47,

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR WHICH

TAX RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION FOR ALL

TAX JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

GUARANTEES

THE COMPANYS GUARANTEE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PAYMENTS UNDER

A TERMINAL USE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY A COMPANY AFFILIATE. THE TERMINAL IS EXPECTED TO BE

OPERATIONAL BY 2012. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM GUARANTEE

AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY OF ANY

AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON HAS RECORDED NO LIABILITY FOR ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THIS

GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND

MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE

INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO

MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300. THROUGH THE END OF 2010, THE COMPANY PAID $48 UNDER THESE

INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS

THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS

HAD TO BE ASSERTED BY FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN

FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM

LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS

MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ARE TO BE NET OF

AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR

MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. THE ACQUIRER OF THOSE

ASSETS SHARED IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF $200, WHICH

HAD BEEN REACHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT, AFTER REACHING THE $200

OBLIGATION, CHEVRON IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

THE SALE OF THE ASSETS IN 1997.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY THAT ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT

TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS

TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS,

UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS

ARE: 2011  $17,200; 2012  $4,100; 2013  $3,500;

2014  $3,100; 2015  $3,000; 2016 AND

AFTER 

$7,700.

A PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS MAY

ULTIMATELY BE SHARED WITH PROJECT PARTNERS. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$6,500 IN 2010, $8,100 IN 2009 AND $5,100 IN 2008.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO LAWS, REGULATIONS, PRIVATE

CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

OR THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE

COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL

FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS

THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE

ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

CHEVRONS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WAS $1,507. INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE

WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT APPROXIMATELY 182 SITES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS

A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND

LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2010 WAS

$185. THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY

FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE

CHEVRON TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2010 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,322, $814 RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS

(I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), CHEMICAL FACILITIES, AND PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $508 WAS

ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($100), UPSTREAM ($329) AND OTHER

BUSINESSES ($79). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION

OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL

EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF

PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND

MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2010 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

REFER TO NOTE 25 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS MAY

PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER

WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM

RESERVE AT ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE

OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT

FOR THE FOUR ZONES. FOR THIS RANGE OF SETTLEMENT, CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET

BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200, AND THE POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED

TO CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $150. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN

THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

ON APRIL 26, 2010, A CALIFORNIA APPEALS COURT ISSUED A RULING RELATED TO THE

ADEQUACY OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (EIR) SUPPORTING THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN PERMITS BY THE

CITY OF RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA, TO REPLACE AND UPGRADE CERTAIN FACILITIES AT CHEVRONS REFINERY IN

RICHMOND. SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WITH PLAINTIFFS IN THE CASE ENDED LATE FOURTH QUARTER 2010, AND

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE ITS OPTIONS GOING FORWARD, WHICH MAY INCLUDE REQUESTING THE CITY

TO REVISE THE EIR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE COURT OF APPEAL OR OTHER ACTIONS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR THE PROJECT ARE

UNCERTAIN. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION, OR POTENTIAL OUTCOMES

OF ANY ACTION OR COMBINATION OF ACTIONS, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE FINANCIAL

EFFECTS, IF ANY, OF THE RULING CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE

MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE FUTURE PERIOD.

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS; U.S. FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS

OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO

RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (ASC 410), THE

COMPANY RECORDS THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) WHEN THERE

IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE

LONG-LIVED

ASSET AND THE

LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM THE ASSET RETIREMENT

ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY MAY EXIST ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF

SETTLEMENT THAT MAY BE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL. THIS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR

METHOD OF SETTLEMENT IS FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION

EXISTS TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. RECOGNITION OF THE ARO INCLUDES: (1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF

A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING ASSET, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION

OF THE ASSET, AND (3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND DISCOUNT RATES.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

ACCOUNTING FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING ASSETS. NO SIGNIFICANT AROS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE DOWNSTREAM LONG-LIVED ASSETS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED, AS INDETERMINATE

SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED

ARO. THE COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS OF ITS DOWNSTREAM LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS, THE

WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS. THE SYSTEM

CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS AT THE TIME OF

REPORTING  THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND THREE NONCOMMERCIAL. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL CLASSIFICATION

ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES OF UNPROVED: PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE NONCOMMERCIAL

CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA

DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE IN THE FUTURE FROM KNOWN

RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. NET

PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

ARE THE QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND

ENGINEERS. AS PART OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COM-

PANY MAINTAINS A RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE RESERVES

MANAGER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF A CORPORATE DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE CORPORATE

RESERVES MANAGER, WHO ACTS AS CHAIRMAN OF THE RAC, HAS MORE THAN 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE

OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND A MASTER OF SCIENCE IN PETROLEUM ENGINEERING DEGREE FROM STANFORD

UNIVERSITY. HIS EXPERIENCE INCLUDES 15 YEARS OF MANAGING OIL AND GAS RESERVES PROCESSES. HE IS THE

ACTING CHAIRMAN OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE, CURRENTLY

SERVES ON THE UNITED NATIONS EXPERT GROUP ON RESOURCES CLASSIFICATION AND IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF

THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM EVALUATION ENGINEERS. HE IS ALSO A PAST MEMBER OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON

RESERVES EVALUATOR TRAINING AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION COMMITTEE.

ALL RAC MEMBERS ARE DEGREED PROFESSIONALS, EACH WITH MORE THAN 15 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS

ASPECTS OF RESERVES ESTIMATION RELATING TO RESERVOIR ENGINEERING, PETROLEUM ENGINEERING, EARTH

SCIENCE, OR ACCOUNTING POLICY AND FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN SEC

GUIDELINES FOR PROVED RESERVES CLASSIFICATION AND RECEIVE ANNUAL TRAINING ON THE PREPARATION OF

RESERVES ESTIMATES. THE RAC MANAGES ITS ACTIVITIES THROUGH TWO OPERATING COMPANY-LEVEL RESERVES

MANAGERS. THESE TWO RESERVES MANAGERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE RAC SO AS TO PRESERVE THE

CORPORATE-LEVEL INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: ESTABLISH THE POLICIES AND PROCESSES USED

WITHIN THE OPERATING UNITS TO ESTIMATE RESERVES; PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS AND OVERSIGHT OF THE

BUSINESS UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVES ESTIMATES AND CHANGES; CONFIRM THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT

RESERVE VOLUMES ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND APPROPRIATE STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND

TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH PROVIDES STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED

CORPORATEWIDE FOR CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON RESERVES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM

BUSINESS UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR

CHANGES ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND PLANNING COMMITTEE, WHOSE MEMBERS

INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANYS ANNUAL RESERVE

ACTIVITY IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IF MAJOR CHANGES TO RESERVES WERE TO OCCUR

BETWEEN THE ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE BOARD.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE THE

LARGEST PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED-RESERVE

RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL.

REVISED OIL AND GAS REPORTING

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE SEC ISSUED ITS FINAL RULE,

MODERNIZATION

OF OIL AND GAS

REPORTING.

THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FINAL RULE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY WITH

ITS FORM 10-K FILING FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FINAL RULE CHANGED A NUMBER OF OIL

AND GAS RESERVE ESTIMATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SEC REGULATIONS S-K AND S-X.

SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FASB UPDATED

EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES  OIL AND GAS

(TOPIC 932) TO ALIGN THE OIL

AND GAS RESERVES ESTIMATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WITH THE SECS FINAL RULE. THE NEW

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO DATA REPORTED FOR 2009 AND 2010.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT THE END OF 2010, PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES TOTALED 2.6 BILLION BARRELS

OF OIL-EQUIVALENT (BOE). APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT OF THESE

RESERVES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO NATURAL GAS, OF WHICH ABOUT HALF WERE LOCATED IN AUSTRALIA. CRUDE OIL,

CONDENSATE AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGLS) ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 32 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH THE

LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF THESE RESERVES IN AFRICA, ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES. SYNTHETIC OIL

ACCOUNTED FOR THE BALANCE OF THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AND WAS LOCATED IN CANADA IN THE OTHER

AMERICAS REGION.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES OF EQUITY AFFILIATES AMOUNTED TO

1.3 BILLION BOE. AT YEAR-END, CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE AND NGLS

REPRESENTED 59 PERCENT OF THESE RESERVES, WITH TCO ACCOUNTING FOR

THE MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT. NATURAL GAS REPRESENTED 25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH APPROXIMATELY 45

PERCENT OF THOSE RESERVES FROM TCO. THE BALANCE IS ATTRIBUTED TO SYNTHETIC OIL IN VENEZUELA IN THE

OTHER REGION.

IN

2010, A TOTAL OF 447 MILLION BOE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM PROVED

UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. IN OTHER

AMERICAS, 171 MILLION BOE

WERE TRANSFERRED, PRIMARILY DUE TO STARTUP OF A SYNTHETIC CRUDE EXPANSION PROJECT IN CANADA. IN THE

AFRICA REGION, 135 MILLION BOE WERE TRANSFERRED TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT

DRILLING IN NIGERIA AND ANGOLA AND THE START-UP OF A NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT IN NIGERIA.

TRANSFERS IN ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE REMAINDER. PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES DECLINED SLIGHTLY, WITH 13 MILLION BOE

TRANSFERRED TO PROVED DEVELOPED.

THERE WERE NO MATERIAL DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED OR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

INVESTMENT TO CONVERT PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

DURING 2010, INVESTMENTS

TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $8.3 BILLION WERE MADE BY CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES TO

ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. IN AUSTRALIA, $2.6 BILLION WAS EXPENDED,

WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AT THE GORGON LNG PROJECT. IN THE AFRICA

REGION, $2.1 BILLION WAS EXPENDED ON VARIOUS PROJECTS, INCLUDING OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN

NIGERIA AND ANGOLA. IN NIGERIA, CONSTRUCTION PROGRESSED ON A DEEPWATER PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES CONTINUED AT A NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT. IN ANGOLA, OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT DRILLING

WAS PROGRESSED ALONG WITH SEVERAL GAS INJECTION PROJECTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, EXPENDITURES

TOTALED $1.1 BILLION FOR THREE OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND VARIOUS

SMALLER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. IN THE ASIA REGION, EXPENDITURES DURING THE YEAR TOTALED $0.9

BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED CONSTRUCTION OF A GAS PROCESSING FACILITY IN THAILAND, A GAS DEVELOPMENT

PROJECT IN CHINA AND THE COMPLETION OF A STEAM-FLOOD PROJECT IN INDONESIA. IN OTHER AMERICAS,

DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOTALED $0.8 BILLION FOR A VARIETY OF PROJECTS, INCLUDING A SYNTHETIC

CRUDE PROJECT IN CANADA. IN EUROPE, $0.1 BILLION WAS EXPENDED ON VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

AFFILIATED COMPANIES EXPENDED $0.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY ON AN LNG PROJECT IN ANGOLA.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE

RESERVES THAT REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS PROVED

UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS ARE A RESULT OF SEVERAL PHYSICAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT OPTIMAL

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION, SUCH AS THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN ADVERSE

AND REMOTE LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS OF INFRASTRUCTURE OR PLANT CAPACITIES THAT DICTATE

PROJECT TIMING, COMPRESSION PROJECTS THAT ARE

PENDING RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES, AND CONTRACTUAL LIMITATIONS THAT DICTATE PRODUCTION LEVELS.

AT YEAR-END 2010, THE COMPANY HELD APPROXIMATELY 1.7 BILLION BOE OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES THAT HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE. THE RESERVES ARE HELD BY

CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE RESERVES ARE IN LOCATIONS WHERE THE

COMPANY HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF DEVELOPING MAJOR PROJECTS.

IN AFRICA, APPROXIMATELY 330 MILLION BOE IS RELATED TO DEEPWATER AND NATURAL GAS

DEVELOPMENTS IN NIGERIA AND ANGOLA. MAJOR NIGERIAN DEEPWATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INCLUDE AGBAMI,

WHICH STARTED PRODUCTION IN 2008 AND HAS ONGOING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO MAINTAIN FULL

UTILIZATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY, AND THE USAN DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND

IS EXPECTED TO ENTER PRODUCTION IN 2012. ALSO IN NIGERIA, VARIOUS FIELDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESCRAVOS GAS PROJECTS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IN ANGOLA, THE

TOMBUA-LANDANA DEEPWATER PROJECT BECAME OPERATIONAL IN 2009. ONGOING DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IS

EXPECTED TO BRING THIS FIELD TO MAXIMUM PRODUCTION IN 2011.

IN ASIA, APPROXIMATELY 230 MILLION BOE ARE RELATED TO CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE PATTANI

FIELD IN THE GULF OF THAILAND AND CONTRACTUAL CONSTRAINTS AT THE MALAMPAYA FIELD (PHILIPPINES). THE

TIMING OF COMPRESSION INSTALLATION ALIGNS WITH NATURAL FIELD DECLINES AND/OR TO MEET CONTRACTUAL

REQUIREMENTS. ONGOING DEVELOPMENT IS SCHEDULED TO MAINTAIN PRODUCTION WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE

CONSTRAINTS.

IN AUSTRALIA, APPROXIMATELY 130 MILLION BOE REMAIN UNDEVELOPED OVER FIVE YEARS DUE TO

FUTURE COMPRESSION PROJECTS AT THE NORTH WEST SHELF VENTURE, SCHEDULED FOR 2013.

IN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 70 MILLION BOE REMAIN PROVED UNDEVELOPED, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO A STEAMFLOOD EXPANSION.

AFFILIATED COMPANIES HOLD APPROXIMATELY 940 MILLION BOE OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

HELD FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE. THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY

800 MILLION BOE. FIELD PRODUCTION IS CONSTRAINED BY PLANT CAPACITY LIMITATIONS. FURTHER FIELD

DEVELOPMENT TO CONVERT THE REMAINING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IS SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN LINE WITH

RESERVOIR DEPLETION.

IN VENEZUELA, THE AFFILIATE THAT OPERATES THE HAMACA FIELDS SYNTHETIC HEAVY OIL UPGRADING

OPERATION ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 140 MILLION BOE OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES HELD OVER FIVE

YEARS. DEVELOPMENT DRILLING CONTINUES AT HAMACA TO OPTIMIZE UTILIZATION OF UPGRADER CAPACITY.

ANNUALLY, THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER ANY CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES,

SUCH AS CHANGES TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS, REGULATIONS OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES, THAT WOULD WARRANT A

REVISION TO RESERVE ESTIMATES. FOR 2010, THIS ASSESSMENT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN

RESERVES CLASSIFIED AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE RATIO OF PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO TOTAL PROVED

FS-73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

RESERVES HAS RANGED BETWEEN 35 PERCENT AND 39 PERCENT. THE CONSISTENT COMPLETION OF MAJOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS HAS KEPT THE RATIO IN A NARROW RANGE OVER THIS TIME PERIOD.

PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, PROVED RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS WERE 7.7 BILLION BOE. (REFER TO THE TERM RESERVES ON PAGE E-26 FOR

THE DEFINITION OF OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.) APPROXIMATELY 22 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RESERVES WERE

LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUITY AFFILIATES,

PROVED RESERVES WERE 2.8 BILLION BOE, 79 PERCENT OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS 50

PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN TCO.

ASIDE FROM THE TENGIZ FIELD IN THE TCO AFFILIATE, NO SINGLE PROPERTY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. ABOUT 25 OTHER INDIVIDUAL

PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS EACH CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT AND 5 PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYS OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR 49 PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYS TOTAL  OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. THESE PROPERTIES WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED, LOCATED IN

THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, SOUTH AMERICA, WEST AFRICA, ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA.

IN

THE UNITED STATES, TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2010 WERE

1.7 BILLION BOE.

CALIFORNIA PROPERTIES ACCOUNTED FOR 43 PERCENT OF THE U.S. RESERVES, WITH MOST CLASSIFIED AS HEAVY

OIL. BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE NEED

TO EMPLOY ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, THE PRODUCING OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE IN

NATURE. MOST OF THE COMPANYS HEAVY-OIL FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOY A CONTINUOUS STEAMFLOODING

PROCESS. THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION CONTAINS 21 PERCENT OF THE U.S. RESERVES, WITH LIQUIDS

REPRESENTING ABOUT 15 PERCENT OF RESERVES. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE AND, AS A

RESULT, ARE ALSO CAPITAL INTENSIVE. OTHER U.S. AREAS REPRESENT THE REMAINING 36 PERCENT OF U.S.

RESERVES, WHICH ARE ABOUT EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS. FOR PRODUCTION OF CRUDE

OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, INCLUDING WATERFLOOD AND CO

2

INJECTION.

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EVENTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE COMPANYS CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT PERMITTING,

PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, DECLINES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS,

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND

SYNTHETIC OIL, AND CHANGES THERETO FOR THE YEARS 2008, 2009 AND 2010 ARE SHOWN IN THE

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF LIQUIDS PROVED RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2008 THROUGH

2010 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2008, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 536 MILLION BARRELS FOR

WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND INCREASED RESERVES BY 267 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY

AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS IN THE ASIA REGION, WHICH ADDED

574 MILLION BARRELS. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE WAS IN THE PARTITIONED ZONE, AS A RESULT OF A

CONCESSION EXTENSION, AND INDONESIA. IN INDONESIA, RESERVES INCREASED DUE MAINLY TO THE IMPACT OF

LOWER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE RESERVE CALCULATIONS FOR

PRODUCTION-SHARING

CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS A

RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND IMPROVED WATERFLOOD AND STEAMFLOOD PERFORMANCE. UPWARD REVISIONS

WERE ALSO RECORDED IN KAZAKHSTAN AND AZERBAIJAN AND WERE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFECT OF LOWER

YEAR-END PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH  PRODUCTION-SHARING AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY CONTRACTS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS IN EUROPE AND THE

UNITED STATES. FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, THE 249 MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR TCO WAS DUE TO THE

EFFECT OF LOWER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE ROYALTY

DETERMINATION AND THE EFFECT OF FACILITY OPTIMIZATION AT THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV FIELDS.

IN 2009, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 355 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES AND DECREASED RESERVES BY 187 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS 460 MILLION BARRELS IN THE OTHER AMERICAS REGION DUE TO THE

INCLUSION OF SYNTHETIC OIL RELATED TO CANADIAN OIL SANDS. IN THE UNITED STATES, RESERVES INCREASED

63 MILLION BARRELS AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND PERFORMANCE REVISIONS. THE INCREASES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES OF 121 MILLION BARRELS IN ASIA AND 46 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA.

IN ASIA, DECREASES IN INDONESIA AND AZERBAIJAN WERE DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER 12-MONTH AVERAGE

PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS AND THE EFFECT

OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE REVISIONS. IN AFRICA, RESERVES IN NIGERIA DECLINED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS AS WELL AS RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, TCO DECLINED BY 184 MILLION BARRELS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF

HIGHER 12-MONTH AVERAGE

PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION. FOR OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES, 266 MILLION BARRELS OF HEAVY CRUDE

OIL WERE RECLASSIFIED TO SYNTHETIC OIL FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN VENEZUELA.

IN 2010, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES 103 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

DECREASED RESERVES 21 MILLION BARRELS FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND RECOVERY FACTORS ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE 63 MILLION

BARREL INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES. INCREASES IN THE OTHER REGIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

ASIA REGION, WHICH DECREASED AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON

PRODUCTION-SHARING

CONTRACTS IN KAZAKHSTAN. FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, THE PRICE EFFECT ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AT TCO

DECREASED RESERVES BY 33 MILLION BARRELS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN VENEZUELA.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN 2008, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED WORLDWIDE LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY

37 MILLION BARRELS. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE LARGEST ADDITION WAS IN THE ASIA REGION RELATED

TO GAS REINJECTION IN KAZAKHSTAN. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 10 MILLION BARRELS DUE TO

IMPROVED SECONDARY RECOVERY AT BOSCAN.

IN 2009, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 86 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE.

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR 50 MILLION BARRELS. THE LARGEST ADDITION WAS RELATED TO

IMPROVED SECONDARY RECOVERY IN NIGERIA. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 36 MILLION BARRELS

DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS RELATED TO THE TCO SOUR GAS INJECTION/SECOND GENERATION PLANT (SGI/SGP)

FACILITIES.

IN 2010, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED VOLUMES BY 77 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, RESERVES IN AFRICA INCREASED 58 MILLION BARRELS DUE PRIMARILY TO SECONDARY RECOVERY

PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA. RESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED 11 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN CALIFORNIA. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 3 MILLION

BARRELS.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2008, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED

CONSOLIDATED COMPANY RESERVES 33 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE. THE UNITED STATES INCREASED RESERVES 17

MILLION BARRELS, PRIMARILY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE AFRICA, ASIA, AND OTHER AMERICAS REGIONS

INCREASED RESERVES 16 MILLION BARRELS WITH NO ONE COUNTRY RESULTING IN ADDITIONS GREATER THAN 5

MILLION BARRELS.

IN 2009, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 52 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE.

THE LARGEST ADDITIONS WERE 20 MILLION BARRELS IN THE AUSTRALIA REGION RELATED TO THE GORGON PROJECT

AND 13 MILLION BARRELS IN THE OTHER AMERICAS REGION RELATED TO DELINEATION DRILLING IN ARGENTINA.

AFRICA AND THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR 10 MILLION BARRELS AND 6 MILLION BARRELS, RESPECTIVELY.

IN 2010, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES RESERVES 63 MILLION

BARRELS WORLDWIDE. THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER AMERICAS EACH INCREASED RESERVES 19 MILLION BARRELS,

AND ASIA INCREASED RESERVES 16 MILLION BARRELS. NO SINGLE AREA IN THE UNITED STATES WAS

INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT. DRILLING ACTIVITY IN ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

THE INCREASE IN OTHER AMERICAS. IN ASIA, THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO ACTIVITY IN

AZERBAIJAN.

CHANGES FOR 2008

THROUGH 2010 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2008, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY

1,166 BCF AND INCREASED RESERVES FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES BY 1,130 BCF. IN THE ASIA REGION,

POSITIVE REVISIONS TOTALED 1,073 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. ALMOST HALF OF THE INCREASE WAS

ATTRIBUTED TO THE KARACHAGANAK FIELD IN KAZAKHSTAN, DUE MAINLY TO THE EFFECTS OF LOW YEAR-END

PRICES ON THE PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT AND THE RESULTS OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND IMPROVED

RECOVERY. OTHER LARGE UPWARD REVISIONS WERE RECORDED FOR THE PATTANI FIELD IN THAILAND DUE TO A

SUCCESSFUL DRILLING CAMPAIGN. IN THE OTHER AMERICAS REGION, IMPROVED FIELD PERFORMANCE AND NEW

CONTRACTS IN COLOMBIA, AND TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, RESPECTIVELY, ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE 154 BCF

INCREASE.

FOR THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, AN INCREASE OF 498 BCF REFLECTED THE IMPACTS OF LOWER

YEAR-END PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND FACILITY OPTIMIZATION. RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ANGOLA LNG PROJECT ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE 632 BCF INCREASE IN OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

IN 2009, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES 569 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND DECREASED

RESERVES 44 BCF FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET INCREASES WERE 493 BCF IN

ASIA, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF RESERVOIR STUDIES IN BANGLADESH AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN

THAILAND. THESE RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DOWNWARD REVISION DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN MYANMAR. IN THE AUSTRALIA REGION, THE 166 BCF INCREASE IN

RESERVES RESULTED FROM IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND COMPRESSION. IN THE OTHER AMERICAS

REGION, RESERVES DECREASED 126 BCF, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. IN THE UNITED STATES, A NET INCREASE OF 39 BCF

WAS THE RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PERFORMANCE

REVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA AND

MID-CONTINENT

AREAS.

FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES, A DOWNWARD REVISION OF 237 BCF AT TCO WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND AN INCREASE IN GAS INJECTION FOR SGI/SGP FACILITIES. THIS

DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PERFORMANCE AND DRILLING OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO THE ANGOLA LNG

PROJECT.

FS-77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

IN 2010, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 197 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, WHICH WAS

MORE THAN OFFSET BY A 268 BCF DECREASE IN NET REVISIONS FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, A NET INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES OF 220 BCF, PRIMARILY IN THE MID-CONTINENT AREA AND

THE GULF OF MEXICO, WAS THE RESULT OF A NUMBER OF SMALL UPWARD REVISIONS RELATED TO IMPROVED

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND DRILLING ACTIVITY, NONE OF WHICH WERE INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE

INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES ON

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN THE ASIA REGION. FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES, A DOWNWARD REVISION OF 324

BCF AT TCO WAS DUE TO THE PRICE EFFECT ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND A CHANGE IN THE

VARIABLE-ROYALTY CALCULATION. THIS DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL

RESERVES RELATED TO THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2009, WORLDWIDE EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES OF 4,387

BCF WERE ATTRIBUTED TO CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. IN AUSTRALIA, THE GORGON PROJECT ACCOUNTED FOR ALL

OF THE 4,276 BCF ADDITIONS. IN ASIA, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN THAILAND ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

THE INCREASE. IN THE UNITED STATES, DELINEATION DRILLING IN CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY

OF THE INCREASE.

SALES

IN 2009, WORLDWIDE SALES OF 117 BCF WERE RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

FOR THE OTHER AMERICAS REGION, THE SALE OF PROPERTIES IN ARGENTINA ACCOUNTED FOR 84 BCF. THE SALE

OF PROPERTIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE 33 BCF DECREASE IN THE UNITED

STATES.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH

FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING PROVED OIL

AND GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FASB. ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING 12-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO

YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE LIMITED TO THOSE

PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND

PRODUCE YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF

YEAR-END ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END STATUTORY TAX RATES.

THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PRETAX

NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE

CALCULATED USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES

A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN FUTURE EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN RESERVES WILL BE

PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES

ARE IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND

POSSIBLE RESERVES, WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE

VALUATION PRESCRIBED BY THE FASB REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND SHOULD

NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL AND GAS

RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED MEASURE NET CASH FLOWS REFERS TO THE STANDARDIZED
