cautionary
statement relevant to forward-looking information
for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the
private securities litigation reform act of 1995
this annual report on
form10-k
of chevron corporation contains forward-looking statements
relating to chevrons operations that are based on
managements current expectations, estimates and
projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
energy-related industries. words such as
anticipates, expects,
intends, plans, targets,
projects, believes, seeks,
schedules, estimates,
budgets and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. these statements are
not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
the companys control and are difficult to predict.
therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
statements. the reader should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. unless legally required, chevron undertakes no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.
among the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing
refining, marketing and chemical margins; actions of competitors
or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude
oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or
product substitutes; technological developments; the results of
operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the
inability or failure of the companys joint-venture
partners to fund their share of operations and development
activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net
production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas
development projects; potential delays in the development,
construction or
start-up of
planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of
the companys net production or manufacturing facilities or
delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents,
political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude oil
production quotas that might be imposed by the organization of
petroleum exporting countries; the potential liability for
remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment
or product changes under existing or future environmental
statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability
resulting from other pending or future litigation; the
companys future acquisition or disposition of assets and
gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments;
government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations,
industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions
on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements
compared with the u.s.dollar; the effects of changed
accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles
promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors set forth
under the heading risk factors on pages 32 through
34 in this report. in addition, such statements could be
affected by general domestic and international economic and
political conditions. unpredictable or unknown factors not
discussed in this report could also have material adverse
effects on
forward-looking
statements.

summary
description of chevron
chevron
corporation,*
a delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
management and technology support to u.s.and international
subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
generation and energy services. upstream operations consist
primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil
and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and
regasification associated with liquefied natural gas;
transporting crude oil by major international oil export
pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas;
and a
gas-to-liquids
project. downstream operations consist primarily of refining of
crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil
andrefined products; transporting of crude oil and refined
products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and
railcar; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity
petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and
lubricant additives.
a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pagese-4
and e-5. as
of december31, 2010, chevron had approximately
62,000employees (including about 3,900 service station
employees). approximately 30,000employees (including about
3,600 service station employees), or 48percent, were
employed in u.s.operations.
overview
of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
control over some of them. governmental policies, particularly
in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
their operations and formulate their products and, in some
cases, limiting their profits directly. prices for crude oil,
natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
determined by supply and demand for these commodities. however,
some governments impose price controls on refined products such
as gasoline or diesel fuel. the members of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec) are typically the
worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production
levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
other energy sources also play a significant part. seasonality
is not a primary driver of changes in the companys
quarterly earnings during the year.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron
competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum
companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor
required to develop and operate those properties. in its
downstream business, chevron also competes with fully
integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent
refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and
national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of
various goods or services in many national and international
markets.
operating
environment
refer to pages fs-2 through fs-10 of this
form10-k
in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations for a discussion of the
companys current business environment and outlook.
*incorporated
in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the
company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and
chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. in 2005, chevrontexaco
corporation changed its name to chevron corporation. as used in
this report, the term chevron and such terms as
the company, the corporation,
our, we and us may refer to
chevron corporation, one or more of its consolidated
subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
otherwise it does not include affiliates of
chevron i.e., those companies accounted for by the
equity method (generally owned 50percent or less) or
investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms
are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.

strategic direction
chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value
and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
will enable it to outperform its competitors. in the upstream,
the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core
areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a
high-impact global gas business. in the downstream, the
strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the
value chain. the company also continues to utilize technology
across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to
invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency
solutions.

description
of business and properties
the upstream and downstream activities of the company and its
equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with
operations in north america, south america, europe, africa, asia
and australia. tabulations of segment sales and other operating
revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending
december31, 2010, and assets as of the end of 2010 and
2009 for the united states and the companys
international geographic areas are in note11
to the consolidated financial statements beginning on
pagefs-41.
similar comparative data for the companys investments in
and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
equipment are in notes12 and 13 on pages fs-43 through
fs-45.
capital
and exploratory expenditures
total expenditures for 2010 were $21.8billion, including
$1.4billion for the companys share of
equity-affiliate expenditures. in 2009 and 2008, expenditures
were $22.2billion and $22.8billion, respectively,
including the companys share of affiliates
expenditures of $1.6billion in 2009 and $2.3billion
in 2008.
of the $21.8billion in expenditures for 2010,
87percent, or $18.9billion, was related to upstream
activities. approximately 80percent was expended for
upstream operations in 2009 and 2008. international upstream
accounted for about 82percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in 2010, more than 80percent in 2009 and about
70percent in 2008, reflecting the companys
continuing focus on opportunities available outside the united
states.
in 2011, the company estimates capital and exploratory
expenditures will be $26.0billion, including
$2.0billion of spending by affiliates. approximately
85percent of the total, or $22.6billion, is budgeted
for exploration and production activities, with
$17.2billion of that amount for projects outside the
united states. acquisition costs associated with the announced
purchase of atlas energy, inc., are not included.
refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and
exploratory expenditures on
pagefs-13.
upstream
the table on the following page summarizes the net production of
liquids and natural gas for 2010 and 2009 by the company and its
affiliates. worldwide oil-equivalent production, including
volumes from synthetic oil in 2010 and oil sands in 2009, was
2.763million barrels per day, up about 2percent from
2009. the increase was mainly associated with the
start-up and
ramp-up of
several major capital projects the expansion at
tengiz in kazakhstan, the tahiti field in the u.s.gulf of
mexico, frade in brazil, agbami in nigeria, and
tombua-landana
and mafumeira norte in angola. normal field declines and the
impact of higher prices on cost-recovery volumes and other
contractual provisions decreased net production from last
years comparative period. refer to the results of
operations section beginning on
pagefs-7
for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
2008 2010 changes in production for crude oil and
natural gas liquids, and natural gas.
the company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent
production in 2011 will be approximately 2.790million
barrels per day based on the average west texas intermediate
crude oil price of $79 per barrel in 2010. this estimate is
subject to many factors and uncertainties, including additional
quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on production
volumes calculated under production-sharing and variable-royalty
provisions of certain agreements, changes in fiscal terms or
restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in
project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in
various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production,
civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of
maintenance turnarounds,
greater-than-expected
declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions
to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also
affected by the size and number of economic investment
opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag
between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production
activities in key areas, beginning on page9, for a
discussion of the companys major crude oil and natural gas
development projects.

reserves
refer to table v beginning on
pagefs-71
for a tabulation of the companys proved net crude oil and
natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of
2008 and each year-end from 2008 through 2010. a discussion of
reserves governance and major changes to proved reserves by
geographic area for the three-year period ending
december31, 2010 is summarized in the discussion for table
v. discussion is also provided beginning on
pagefs-71
regarding the nature of, status of and planned future activities
associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves.
the company recognizes reserves for projects with various
development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. the
external factors that impact the duration of a project include
scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating
conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual
limitations. during 2010, the company provided crude oil and
natural gas reserves estimates for 2009 to the department of
energy, energy information administration (eia) that agree with
the 2009 reserve volumes in table v. this reporting fulfilled
the requirement that such estimates be consistent with, and not
differ more than 5percent from, the information furnished
to the securities and exchange commission (sec) in the
companys 2009 annual report on
form10-k.
during 2011, the company will file estimates of crude oil and
natural gas reserves with the department of energy, eia,
consistent with the 2010 reserve data reported in table v.

delivery
commitments
the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
operations under a variety of contractual obligations. most
contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
quantities, as discussed below.
in the united states, the company is contractually committed to
deliver to third parties 253billion cubic feet of natural
gas through 2013. the company believes it can satisfy these
contracts through a combination of equity production from the
companys proved developed u.s.reserves and third
party purchases. these contracts include a variety of pricing
terms, including both index and fixed-price contracts.
outside the united states, the company is contractually
committed to deliver a total of 953billion cubic feet of
natural gas from 2011 through 2013 from australia, colombia,
denmark and the philippines to third parties. the sales
contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally
referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural
gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. the
company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities
available from production of the companys proved developed
reserves in these countries.

indicates the fractional number of wells completed during the
year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. completion
refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the
production of crude oil or natural gas or, in the case of a dry
well, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.
some exploratory wells are not drilled with the intention of
producing from the well bore. in such cases,
completion refers to the completion of drilling.
further categorization of productive or dry is based on the
determination as to whether hydrocarbons in a sufficient
quantity were found to justify completion as a producing well,
whether or not the well is actually going to be completed as a
producer.
represents wells that are in the process of drilling but have
been neither abandoned nor completed as of the last day of the

chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the
worlds major hydrocarbon basins. the companys
upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new
legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity
natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas
business. the map at left indicates chevrons primary areas
of exploration and production.
a)
united
states
upstream activities in the united states are concentrated in
california, the gulf of mexico, louisiana, texas,
newmexico, the rocky mountains and alaska. average net
oil-equivalent production in the united states during 2010 was
708,000barrels per day.
in california, the company has significant production in the
sanjoaquin valley. in 2010, average net oil-equivalent
production was 199,000barrels per day, composed of
178,000barrels of crude oil, 96million cubic feet of
natural gas and 5,000barrels of natural gas liquids.
approximately 84percent of the crude oil production is
considered heavy oil (typically with api gravity lower than 22
degrees).
average net oil-equivalent production during 2010 for the companys combined interests in the gulf of mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 260,000barrels per day. the daily oil-equivalent production was composed of 169,000barrels of crude oil, 445million cubic feet of natural gas and 17,000barrels of natural gas liquids. in april 2010, an accident occurred at the bp-operated macondo prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico, resulting in a loss of life, the sinking of the rig and a significant oil spill. chevron was not a participant in the well. subsequent to the event, the u.s.department of the interior placed a moratorium on the drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers (bops) or surface bops on a floating facility in the gulf of mexico and the pacific
regions. during the moratorium, chevron participated in a number
of industry efforts to identify opportunities to improve
industry standards in prevention, intervention and spill
response. in july 2010, chevron and several other major energy
companies announced plans to build and deploy a rapid response
system that will be available to capture and contain oil in the
unlikely event of a potential future well blowout in the
deepwater gulf of mexico. in october 2010, the secretary of the
interior lifted the moratorium on deepwater drilling activity,
provided that operators certify compliance with new rules and
requirements. the drilling moratorium and the ensuing slowdown
in issuing drilling permits have resulted in delays in shallow
water drilling activity, delayed drilling of exploratory
deepwater wells and impacted development drilling on both
operated and nonoperated projects in the gulf of mexico. in
addition, the companys net oil-equivalent production in
the gulf of mexico was reduced by about 10,000barrels per
day for the full year.
chevron was engaged in various exploration and development
activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico during 2010. first
oil at the perdido regional development was achieved in first
quarter 2010. the development includes a 37.5percent
nonoperated working interest in a producing host facility in
alaminos canyon designed to service multiple nonoperated fields,
including chevrons 33.3percent-owned great white,
60percent-owned silvertip and 57.5percent-owned
tobago. the development has an expected production life of
approximately 25years.
the final investment decision was made for the tahiti 2
waterflood project in third quarter 2010. tahiti 2 is the second
development phase for the 58percent-owned and operated
tahiti field and is designed to increase recovery and maintain
table of contents
production near the facility capacity of 125,000barrels of
oil per day. the project includes three water injection wells,
two additional production wells and the facilities required to
deliver water to the injection wells. drilling began on the
first water injection well in september 2010. the field has an
estimated production life of 30years. as of the end of
2010, proved reserves had not been recognized for this second
development phase of the tahiti field.
during 2010, work continued at the 60percent-owned and
operated big foot discovery. the project completed front-end
engineering and design (feed) in june 2010 and a final
investment decision was made in december 2010. total maximum
production is expected to reach 79,000barrels of
oil-equivalent per day. first production is expected in 2014,
and at the end of 2010 proved reserves had not been recognized.
the field has an estimated production life of 20years.
the topsides modifications to the host facility of the
caesar/tonga project were completed in 2010. the company has a
20.3percent nonoperated working interest in the caesar and
tonga partnerships unitized area. development plans include a
total of four wells and a subsea tieback to a nearby third-party
production facility. work on the subsea system, commissioning of
the topsides and the initial well completion program carried
over into 2011. a recent mechanical issue involving the
production riser system has delayed first production. proved
reserves have been recognized for the project.
the jack and st. malo fields are located within 25miles of
each other and are being jointly developed. chevron has a
50percent working interest in jack and a 51percent
working interest in st. malo, following the acquisition of an
additional 9.8percent equity interest in st. malo in march
2010. both fields are company operated. the feed activities
initiated in 2009 continued into 2010, and a final investment
decision was achieved in october 2010. the facility is planned
to have an initial design capacity of 177,000barrels of
oil-equivalent per day. total project costs for the initial
phase of development are estimated at $7.5billion and
start-up is
expected in 2014. the project has an estimated production life
of 30years. at the end of 2010, proved reserves had not
been recognized.
assessment of development concepts continued in 2010 for the
appraised resource potential on the mad dogii development
project, in which the company has a 15.6percent
nonoperated working interest. these areas are outside the
drilling radius of the existing floating production facility. a
decision on the development concept, followed by the project
moving into the feed stage, is expected to occur in the
second-half 2011. at the end of 2010, proved reserves had not
been recognized.
studies to screen and evaluate future development alternatives
in the tubular bells unitized area, in which the company has a
30percent nonoperated working interest, continued into
2010, and a subsea tieback to a planned third-party host
facility was selected as the development concept. feed commenced
in fourth quarter 2010 with a final investment decision expected
in second quarter 2011. at the end of 2010, proved reserves had
not been recognized.
deepwater exploration activities in 2010 included participation
in five exploratory wells two wildcat, two appraisal
and one delineation. drilling operations on two exploratory
wells were interrupted and stopped in second quarter 2010 as a
result of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the gulf of
mexico, including drilling of the first appraisal well at the
55percent-owned and operated buckskin discovery. the first
appraisal well at knotty head was completed in march 2010 and
interpretation of well results continued into 2011. chevron has
a 25percent nonoperated working interest in the knotty
head discovery. at the end of 2010, the company had not
recognized proved reserves for any of these exploration projects.
during 2010, the company added 15 new leases to its deepwater
portfolio as a result of bid awards stemming from a gulf of
mexico lease sale early in the year.
besides the activities connected with the development and
exploration projects in the gulf of mexico, the company also has
contracted capacity of 1billion cubic feet per day at the
third-party sabine pass liquefied natural gas (lng)
regasification terminal in louisiana to enable the import of
natural gas for the north america market. chevron has also
contracted 1.6billion cubic feet per day of capacity in a
third-party pipeline system connecting the sabine pass lng
terminal to the natural gas pipeline grid. the pipeline provides
access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10major
interstate pipeline systems, including an interconnect with
chevrons sabine pipeline, which connects to the henry hub.
the henry hub interconnects to nine interstate and four
intrastate pipelines and is the pricing point for natural gas
futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange.
outside california and the gulf of mexico, the company manages
operations across the mid-continental united states and alaska.
during 2010, the companys u.s.production outside
california and the gulf of mexico averaged 249,000net
oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 91,000barrels
of crude oil, 773million cubic feet of natural gas and
29,000barrels of natural gas liquids.

the company continues to pursue its interest in tight carbonate
oil resources in west texas in the wolfcamp and associated
formations where advances in drilling and completion
technologies have opened up widespread targets such as the
100percent-owned and operated lupin project, where first
oil was realized in mid-2010. additional production growth is
expected from both operated and nonoperated interests in these
formations in future years through continued use of these
advances in drilling and completion technologies. the company
also continued the appraisal of the haynesville shale gas play
in east texas.
in the piceance basin in northwestern colorado, the company
continued development of its 100percent-owned and operated
natural gas field. development drilling and completion
activities continued in 2010, with 115 completed wells available
to supply natural gas to the central processing facility. the

facilities, completion of previously drilled wells, and
designing a pilot to test liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) as an
alternative fracture fluid beginning in fourth quarter 2011.
future work is expected to be completed in multiple stages. the
full development plan includes drilling more than
2,000wells from multi-well pads over the next 30 to
40years. proved reserves for subsequent stages of the
project had not been recognized at year-end 2010.
in february 2011, chevron acquired atlas energy, inc. the
acquisition provides an attractive natural gas resource position
in the appalachian basin, primarily located in southwestern
pennsylvania, and consists of approximately 850,000 total acres
of marcellus shale and utica shale. the acquisition provides a
49percent interest in laurel mountain midstream, llc, an
affiliate that owns more than 1,000miles of natural gas
gathering lines servicing the marcellus. the acquisition also
provides assets in michigan, which include antrim shale
producing assets and approximately 380,000 total acres in the

environmental
protection
virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are
subject to various u.s.federal, state and local
environmental, healthand safety laws and regulations and
to similar laws and regulations in other countries. these
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to
become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business.
in 2010, the companys u.s.capitalized environmental
expenditures were $639million, representing about
12percent of the companys total consolidated
u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures. these
environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
existing facilities as well as those associated with new
facilities. the expenditures relate mostly to air- and
water-quality projects and activities at the companys
refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
facilities. for 2011, the company estimates u.s.capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
table of contents
approximately $800million. the future annual capital costs
are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
future changes to regulatory requirements.
environmental-related regulations, including those intended to
address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global
climate change, continue to evolve. for instance, in december
2009, the u.s.environmental protection agency (epa) issued
a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, which found
that emissions of six greenhouse gases threaten the public
health and welfare. greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and
engines also contribute to such pollution. subsequently, in
2010, the epa finalized two regulations under the clean air act
that establish greenhouse gas emission standards for new
light-duty vehicles and clarify preconstruction permitting
requirements for new or modified stationary source facilities
with greenhouse gas emissions that exceed 75,000 tons per year
of carbon dioxide equivalent. in november 2010, the agency
issued updated guidance on determining the best available
control technologies (bact) that would be required to be
implemented by certain new and modified stationary source
facilities beginning in january 2011, but there remains
significant uncertainty regarding the impact of applying bact
requirements on a case by case basis. finally, in two recent
settlement agreements, the epa agreed to schedules for
undertaking additional greenhouse gas rulemakings applicable to
utilities and refineries. the agency is beginning to develop
these new regulations, which are scheduled to be effective in
may 2012 (utilities) and november 2012 (refineries), so it is
not possible to predict their impact at this time. the
epas endangerment finding, motor vehicle greenhouse gas
standards, and greenhouse gas permit rule have all been
challenged in federal courts and decisions arepending.
the epa also finalized its revised renewable fuel standard
(rfs2) regulations as required by the energy independence and
security act of 2007. the regulations require fuel providers to
blend increased volumes of renewable fuels into gasoline and
diesel each year and establish specific greenhouse gas reduction
and feedstock criteria for subcategories of renewable fuel,
including cellulosic fuel, advanced biofuel and biomass-based
diesel. the specific impacts of this regulation are determined
by many factors, including fluctuating markets for renewable
fuels and epa regulatory decisions on potential waivers of
volume requirements.
additionally, under californias global warming solutions
act, enacted in 2006, the california air resources board (carb),
charged with implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon
fuel standard intended to reduce the carbon intensity of
transportation fuels. the state is behind schedule in completing
certain elements of the standard. consequently, initial carbon
intensity reduction requirements are effective as of january
2011, but carb has delayed other aspects of compliance until it
completes further updates to the regulation later in the year.
in december 2010, carb adopted regulations implementing the cap
and trade program requirements of the global warming solutions
act. the first compliance period of the cap and trade program
begins in 2012 and ends in december 2014. carb has yet to
develop detailed regulations to implement this portion of the
act, including the determination of how emissions allowances
will be allocated and traded during this period. the effect of
any such regulation on the companys business is uncertain.

item1a.
risk
factors
chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business
portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating
sufficient cash to fund capital and exploratory expenditures and
to pay dividends. nevertheless, some inherent risks could
materially impact the companys financial results of
operations or financial condition.
chevron
is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
prices.
chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the
companys results of operations is the price of crude oil,
which can be influenced by general economic conditions and
geopolitical risk. chevron accepts the risk of changing
commodity prices as part of its business planning process. as
such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure
to fluctuations in crude oil prices.
during extended periods of historically low prices for crude
oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and
exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected.
upstream assets may also become impaired. the impact on
downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for
refined products and the associated margins on refined product
sales.
the
scope of chevrons business will decline if the company
does not successfully develop resources.
the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron
is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
produces with good prospects for future production or through
acquisitions, the companys business will decline. creating
and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many
factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore,
develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to
bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion
on budget and schedule; and efficient and profitable operation
of mature properties.
the
companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human
factors.
chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
inhospitable regions. the companys operations and
facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes beyond its control, including
hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil
unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes,
explosions and system failures, any of which could result in
suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural
environment.
the
companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that
require significant and continuous oversight.
chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and
mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the
crude oil and natural gas industry. the company seeks to
minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and
building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe
and reliable manner. however, failure to manage these risks
effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including
releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in
personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of
revenues, legal liability
and/or
disruption to operations. chevron has implemented and maintains
a system of policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to
manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency
risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies;
and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents.
nonetheless, in certain situations where chevron is not the
operator, the company may have limited influence and control
over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and
control such risks.
chevrons
business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation
or government action.
the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
companys business. chevron operations also produce
byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. often these
operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the
company may have limited influence and control. any of these
activities could result in liability arising from private
litigation or government action, either as a result of an
accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
on the effects of the companys operations on human health
or the environment. in addition, to the extent that societal
pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is
possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to
the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted
damage, or to other mitigating factors.
table of contents
political
instability could harm chevrons business.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
governments to increase public ownership of the companys
partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional
taxes or royalties.
in certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal
unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
government and the company or other governments may affect
thecompanys operations. those developments have, at
times, significantly affected the companys related
operations andresults and are carefully considered by
management when evaluating the level of current and future
activity in suchcountries. at december31, 2010,
25percent of the companys net proved reserves were
located in kazakhstan. thecompany also has significant
interests in organization of petroleum exporting countries
(opec)-member countriesincluding angola, nigeria and
venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and
kuwait. twenty-three percent of the companys net proved
reserves, including affiliates, were located in opec countries
at december31, 2010.
regulation
of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons
operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons
products.
continued political attention to issues concerning climate
change, the role of human activity in it, and potential
mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on
the companys operations and financial results.
international agreements and national or regional legislation
and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are
currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. for
instance, the kyoto protocol and californias global
warming solutions act, along with other actual or pending
federal, state and provincial regulations, envision a reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions through market-based regulatory
programs, technology-based or performance-based standards or a
combination of them. the company is subject to existing
greenhouse gas emissions limits in jurisdictions where such
regulation is currently effective, including the european union
and new zealand.
in 2010, the u.s.environmental protection agency (epa)
finalized two regulations under the clean air act that establish
greenhouse gas emission standards for new light-duty vehicles
and clarify preconstruction permitting requirements for new or
modified stationary source facilities with greenhouse gas
emissions that exceed 75,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide
equivalent. in addition, the epa recently agreed to develop
additional regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from
utilities and refineries. the agency is beginning to develop
these new regulations, which are scheduled to be effective in
may 2012 (utilities) and november 2012 (refineries), so it is
not possible to predict their impact at this time.
the u.s.congress has previously considered and may in the
future consider legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. at this time it is not possible to predict any
specific congressional actions in 2011 or beyond, and it is
unclear how any such legislation would reconcile with the clean
air act or current epa regulations.
in december 2010, california adopted regulations implementing
the cap and trade program requirements of the states
global warming solutions act, also known as ab32. the first
compliance period of the cap and trade program begins in 2012
and ends in december 2014. chevron may incur costs associated
with emissions reduction activities, and the purchase of
allowances or credits for its facilities in california. in
addition, chevrons purchased energy costs from utilities
may increase starting in january 2012, when electricity
generators are required to purchase allowances or credits for
electricity sold in california.
these and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies
and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance,
operating and maintenance costs. the level of expenditure
required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain
and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws
enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in
it and market conditions. the companys exploration and
production of crude oil, natural gas and various minerals such
as coal; the upgrading of production from oil sands into
synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and
natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction
and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude
oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or
customers use of the companys products result in
greenhouse gas emissions that could well be regulated. some of
these activities, such as consumers and customers
use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by
the companys competitors in response to such laws and
regulations, are beyond the companys control.
the effect of regulation on the companys financial
performance will depend on a number of factors including, among
others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions
reductions required by law, the extent to which chevron would
table of contents
be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would
need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or
through auctions, the price and availability of emission
allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other
regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs
incurred through the pricing of the companys products.
material price increases or incentives to conserve or use
alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the
company currently sells and adversely affect the companys
sales volumes, revenues and margins.
changes
in managements estimates and assumptions may have a
material impact on the companys consolidated financial
statements and financial or operations performance in any given
period.
in preparing the companys periodic reports under the
securities exchange act of 1934, including its financial
statements, chevrons management is required under
applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and
assumptions as of a specified date. these estimates and
assumptions are based on managements best estimates and
experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk
and uncertainty. materially different results may occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by
management include measurement of benefit obligations for
pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of
crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for
estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and
impairments to property, plant and equipment. changes in
estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the
assumptions, such as changes in the companys business
plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices,
could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

legal
proceedings
ecuador
chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior
court of nueva loja in lago agrio, ecuador, brought in may 2003
by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain
residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly
had operations. the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment
from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks
unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and
restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health
monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company
(texpet), a subsidiary of texaco inc., was a minority member of
this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned
oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations
have been conducted solely by petroecuador. at the conclusion of
the consortium and following an independent third-party
environmental audit of the concession area, texpet entered into
a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador
for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the
government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the
consortium. pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a
three-year remediation program at a cost of $40million.
after certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the
government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a
full release from any and all environmental liability arising
from the consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this
lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. as to matters of law, the
company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over
chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the
action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third,
that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the
releases from liability previously given to texpet by the
republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent
provincial and municipal governments. with regard to the facts,
the company believes that the evidence confirms that
texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the
remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors
failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and
petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control
over the operations.
in 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify
and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify
steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that
the court assess $18.9billion, which would, according to
the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported
damages, including wrongful death claims, and
table of contents
pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health
care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador. the
engineers report also asserted that an additional
$8.4billion could be assessed against chevron for unjust
enrichment. in 2009, following the disclosure by chevron of
evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which
businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome,
the judge presiding over the case was recused. in 2010, chevron
moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss
the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the
united states indicating that the report was prepared by
consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the
mining engineers independent and impartial work and
showing further evidence of misconduct. in august 2010, the
judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the
mining engineers report and requiring the parties to
provide their positions on damages within 45days. chevron
subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that
he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he
had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory
time requirement.
in september 2010, chevron submitted its position on damages,
asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. the
plaintiffs submission, which relied in part on the mining
engineers report, took the position that damages are
between approximately $16billion and $76billion and
that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between
approximately $5billion and $38billion. the next
day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of
the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the
case file so that he could prepare a judgment. chevron
petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of
chevrons prior recusal petition, and because procedural
and evidentiary matters remain unresolved. in october 2010,
chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted. a new
judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges
order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. on
december17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the
evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he
had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment.
chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september 2009
against the republic of ecuador before the permanent court of
arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations
commission on international trade law. the claim alleges
violations of the republic of ecuadors obligations under
the united states-ecuador bilateral investment treaty (bit) and
breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the
republic of ecuador and texpet (described above), which are
investment agreements protected by the bit. through the
arbitration, chevron and texpet are seeking relief against the
republic of ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment
against chevron in the lago agrio litigation constitutes a
violation of ecuadors obligations under the bit. on
february9, 2011, the permanent court of arbitration issued
an order for interim measures requiring the republic of ecuador
to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be
suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without
ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case
pending further order of the tribunal. chevron expects to
continue seeking permanent injunctive relief and monetary relief
before the tribunal.
through a series of recent u.s.court proceedings initiated
by chevron to obtain discovery relating to the lago agrio
litigation and the bit arbitration, chevron has obtained
evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion,
corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers,
consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs. in
february 2011, chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal
district court for the southern district of newyork
against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers,
consultants and supporters alleging violations of the racketeer
influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws.
through the civil lawsuit, chevron is seeking relief that
includes an award of damages and a declaration that any judgment
against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of
fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable.
on february8, 2011, the court issued a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and
persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in
furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment
against chevron in the lago agrio case until march8, 2011.
chevrons motion for a preliminary injunction is presently
before the court.
on february 14, 2011, the provincial court in lago agrio
rendered an adverse judgment in the case. the provincial court
rejected chevrons defenses to the extent the court
addressed them in its opinion. the judgment assesses
approximately $8.6 billion in damages and about $0.9 billion for
the plaintiffs representatives. it also assesses an
additional amount of approximately $8.6 billion in punitive
damages unless the company provides a public apology. chevron
continues to believe the courts judgment is illegitimate
and unenforceable in ecuador, the united states and other
countries. the company also believes the judgment is the product
of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence.
chevron will appeal this decision in ecuador. chevron cannot
predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in
ecuador. chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any
imposition of liability. because chevron has no substantial
assets in ecuador, chevron would expect enforcement actions as a
result of this judgment to be brought in other jurisdictions.
chevron expects to contest any such actions.
the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any
financial effect on chevron, remains uncertain. management does
not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a
range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the defects
table of contents
associated with the judgment, the 2008 engineers report
and the september 2010 plaintiffs submission, management
does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating
a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). moreover, the
highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides
no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss
(or a range of loss).
california
air resources board
as reported in the companys annual report on
form10-k
for the year ended december31, 2009, in november 2008, the
california air resources board (carb) proposed a civil penalty
against the companys sacramento, california, terminal for
alleged violations between august and december 2007 of
carbs regulations governing the minimum concentration of
additives in gasoline. due to a computer programming error, the
sacramento terminals automatic dispensers had failed to
inject additive detergent into a gasoline line.
as reported in the companys annual report on
form10-k
for the year ended december31, 2009, in november 2008,
carb proposed a civil penalty against the companys
richmond, california, refinery for a notice of violation
relating to gasoline that was not properly certified as to
composition. the company corrected the composition certificates
for the gasoline without requiring any change to the composition
of the gasoline. in july 2009, carb issued the refinery a notice
of violation relating to an error in gasoline blending that
caused the product composition certifications to be in error.
the composition certifications were corrected without requiring
any change to the gasoline. discussions with carb officials
relating to all of these matters continue.
as reported in the companys quarterly report on
form10-q
for the quarter ended september30, 2010, on july14,
2009, carb issued a notice of violation against chevron products
company for alleged violations of carbs regulations
governing the certification of gasoline that occurred during
storage at a third-party facility and which had been
self-reported by the company on discovery. the company has
determined that resolution of this matter may result in the
payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.
other
government proceedings
as reported in the companys annual report on
form10-k
for the year ended december31, 2009, in july 2009, the
hawaii department of health (doh) alleged that chevron is
obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding $100,000
in conjunction with commitments the company undertook to install
and operate certain air pollution abatement equipment at its
hawaii refinery pursuant to clean air act settlement with the
united states environmental protection agency and doh. the
company has disputed many of the allegations.
as reported in the companys quarterly report on
form10-q
for the quarter ended march31, 2010, in march 2010, the
united states department of justice (doj) indicated that it
intends to seek a civil penalty against the companys
service station operations in puerto rico for alleged violations
of the commonwealth of puerto ricos underground storage
tank regulations. the alleged violations include failure to test
leak detectors, perform release monitoring and maintain
compliance records. the dojs action may result in payment
of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.
as reported in the companys quarterly report on
form10-q
for the quarter ended june30, 2010, chevron has entered
into negotiations with the united states environmental
protection agency (epa) with respect to alleged air pollution
violations at the companys perth amboy, new jersey
refinery identified in a september16, 2008 compliance
order issued by the epa. the alleged violations relate to
certain management and reporting requirements set forth in the
epas leak detection and repair regulations (these
regulations pertain to the control and monitoring of fugitive
emissions from refinery process equipment). based on discussions
with the epa, it appears that the resolution of this matter will
result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.
in the fourth quarter 2010, chevron paid the united states
department of transportation a $423,000 civil penalty as the
result of an 800barrel crude oil spill that occurred on
june12, 2010. the spill originated from a pipeline that
runs from the companys rangely colorado field to its salt
lake refinery.
the california attorney general has alleged violations of the
states underground storage tank regulations at the
companys service stations in the state of california. the
allegations are part of a state-wide enforcement action which
the company determined in the fourth quarter 2010may
result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.

refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs-7 for a discussion of

business environment and outlook
chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following
countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad,
china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the
netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between
saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south
korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela and vietnam.
earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream
business segments. the single biggest factor that affects the results of operations for both
segments is movement in the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the
largest cost component of refined products. the overall trend in earnings is typically less
affected by results from the companys other activities and investments. earnings for the company
in any period may also be influenced by events or transactions that are infrequent or unusual in
nature.
the companys operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic,
regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the
united states. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the
company or other governments may impact the companys operations or investments. those
developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are
carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries.
to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must
develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the
investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to
explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many
technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in
this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. from time to
time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the
company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. the company will continue to monitor these
developments, take them into account in evaluating future investment opportunities, and otherwise
seek to mitigate any risks to the companys current operations or future prospects.
the company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to
its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and growth. refer to the
results of operations section beginning on page fs-7 for discussions of net gains on asset sales
during 2010. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could
result in significant gains or losses.
fs-2
table of contents
in recent years, chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in
certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. this
increase in costs affected the companys operating expenses and capital programs for all business
segments, but particularly for upstream. softening of these cost pressures started in late 2008 and
continued through most of 2009. industry costs began to level out in fourth quarter 2009 and rose
slightly in 2010. the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting,
procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs.
the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of
worldwide economic activity and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude
oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily
operations and for business planning. the company remains confident of its underlying financial
strength to address potential challenges presented in the current environment. (refer also to the
liquidity and capital resources section beginning on page fs-12.)
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:
upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over
which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic
conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum
exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and
regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil
unrest or political uncertainty. moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit
the companys production capacity in an affected region. the company monitors developments closely
in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating
its facilities and businesses. besides the impact of the fluctuation in prices for crude oil and
natural gas, the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other
factors, including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and
natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulations.
price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the
production of crude oil and natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the companys control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity
prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers, which can be affected
by the volatility of the industrys own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and
services. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by
damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.
the chart at the left shows the trend in benchmark prices for west texas intermediate (wti)
crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the wti price averaged $79 per barrel for the full-year
2010, compared to $62 in 2009. as of mid-february2011, the wti
price was about $85.
a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur)
crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any
period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand, which is a
function of the number of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into
light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the differential
widened during 2010 primarily due to both strong diesel prices and relatively weaker fuel oil
prices.
chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad,
indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in
angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page fs-11 for the companys
average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)
in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural
gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those
markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged about $4.50 per thousand cubic feet
(mcf)during 2010, compared with about $3.80 during 2009. as of mid-february2011, the henry hub
spot price was about $4.20 per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states
are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america and
the level of inventory in underground storage.

table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
certain international natural gas markets in which the company operates have
different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances, which historically have resulted in lower
average sales prices for the companys production of natural gas in these locations. in some of
these locations chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and
liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets where greater demand results in higher
prices. international natural gas realizations averaged about $4.60 per mcf during 2010, compared
with about $4.00 per mcf during 2009. these realizations reflect a strong demand for energy in
certain asian markets. (see page fs-11 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the
u.s. and international regions.)
the companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2010 averaged 2.763million barrels
per day. about one-fifth of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2010 occurred in the
opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia
and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2010, while
production in 2009 was reduced by an average of 20,000 barrels per day due to quotas imposed by
opec. all of the imposed curtailments took place during the first half of 2009. at the december
2010 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining production quotas in effect since december
2008.
the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2011 will average approximately 2.790
million barrels per day. this estimate is subject to many factors and
uncer-
tainties, including additional quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on production
volumes calculated under production sharing and variable-royalty provisions of certain agreements,
changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project
startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may
shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance
turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions
to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of
economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial
exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well
in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant
majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the united states.
refer to the results of operations section on pages fs-7 through fs-8 for additional
discussion of the companys upstream business.

gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2008 and each year-end from 2008 through 2010,

gulf of mexico update in april2010, an accident occurred on the transocean deepwater horizon,
a deepwater drilling rig in the gulf of mexico, resulting in a loss of life, the sinking of the rig
and a significant oil spill. the rig was drilling an exploratory well at the bp-operated macondo
prospect. chevron was not a participant in the well. subsequent to the event, the u.s. department
of the interior put in place a moratorium on the drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers
(bops) or surface bops on a floating facility in the gulf of mexico and the pacific regions. in
october2010, the secretary of the interior lifted the drilling moratorium, provided that operators
certify compliance with all the newly expanded rules and requirements, and demonstrate the
availability of adequate blowout containment resources.
the moratorium and the ensuing slowdown in issuing drilling permits since the moratorium was
lifted have resulted in delays in shallow water drilling activity, delayed the drilling of
exploratory deepwater wells and impacted development drilling on both operated and nonoperated
projects in the gulf of mexico. the companys daily net oil-equivalent production in the gulf of
mexico was reduced by about 10,000 barrels per day for the full year. the company has submitted
several deepwater drilling permit applications and plans to submit additional applications in 2011.
two deepwater drillships are on stand-by, pending issuance of permits from
fs-4
table of contents
the u.s. bureau of ocean energy management, regulation and enforcement (boemre), to drill wells in
the gulf of mexico. a third deepwater drillship is drilling a water injection well at the tahiti
field. additionally, the completion of previously drilled wells has recommenced at the nonoperated
perdido and caesar/tonga projects. the future effects of this incident, including any new or
additional regulations that may be adopted and the timing of boemre issuing drilling permits, are
not fully known at this time. chevron remains committed to deepwater exploration and development in
the gulf of mexico and other deepwater basins around the world.
during the moratorium, chevron
participated in a number of industry efforts to identify opportunities to improve industry
standards in prevention, intervention and spill response. in july2010, chevron and several other
companies announced plans to build and deploy a rapid response system that will be available to
capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future well blowout in the deepwater gulf
of mexico. the new system will be engineered to be used in water depths up to 10,000 feet and
designed to have capacity to contain 100,000 barrels per day, with potential for expansion. the
companies committed to equally fund the initial $1billion investment in the system. there will be
additional ongoing costs for operations and maintenance of the system components. an initial
agreement to secure containment equipment has been announced, and other equipment is expected to be
secured and available in the coming months, with the new system targeted for completion in early
2012. the companies have formed an organization, the marine well containment company, to operate
and maintain this system. other companies have been invited and encouraged to participate in this
organization.
downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining,
manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel
oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and
can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and
petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical
feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels,
geopolitical events, cost of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity
utilization, maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from
unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.
other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of the
crude oil and product supply functions and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product
tankers. other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and
energy costs to operate the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.
the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s.
gulf coast, latin
america, asia, southern africa and the united kingdom. chevron operates or has significant
ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas except latin america. in third quarter
2010, the company completed its exit from the district of columbia, delaware, indiana, kentucky,
north carolina, new jersey, maryland, ohio, pennsylvania, south carolina, virginia, west virginia
and parts of tennessee, where the company sold chevron- and texaco-branded motor fuels to retail
customers through approximately 1,100 stations, and to commercial and industrial customers through
supply arrangements. sales in these markets represented approximately 8percent of the companys
total 2009 u.s. retail fuel sales volumes.
the companys refining and marketing margins in 2010 improved over 2009, but remain
relatively weak due to the economic slowdown, excess refined product supplies and surplus refining
capacity. expecting these conditions to continue for several years, in first quarter 2010 the
company announced that its downstream businesses would be restructured to improve operating
efficiency and achieve sustained improvement in financial performance. as part of this
restructuring, employee-reduction programs were announced for the united states and international
downstream operations. the initial estimate included approximately 3,200 employees. due to
redeployment efforts within the company, it is currently expected that approximately 2,800
employees in the downstream operations will be terminated under these programs before the end of
2011. about 1,100 of the affected employees are located in the united states. during 2010, 1,400
employees were terminated worldwide. refer to note 23 of the consolidated financial statements,
beginning on page fs-59, for further discussion. in 2010, the company solicited bids for 13 u.s.
terminals and certain operations in europe (including the companys pembroke refinery), the
caribbean, and select central america and africa markets. these sales are part of the companys
ongoing effort to concentrate downstream resources and capital on strategic global assets. these
potential market exits, dispositions of assets, and other actions may result in gains or losses in
future periods. through fourth quarter 2010, the company completed the sale of six u.s. terminals
and certain marketing businesses in africa, which resulted in gains that were not material to the
company. also, in late 2010 the company completed the sale of its 23.4percent ownership interest
in the colonial pipeline company, which resulted in a gain on sale of nearly $400million.
refer to the results of operations section on page fs-9 for additional discussion of the
companys downstream operations.
all
other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash
management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations,
real estate activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies. in first quarter 2010,
employee-reduction programs were announced for the corporate staffs. as of year-end, it was
expected that approximately 400 employees from the corporate staffs will be terminated under the
programs by the end of 2011, including approximately 100 who were terminated in 2010. refer to note

u.s. upstream earnings of $4.1billion in 2010 increased $1.9billion from 2009. higher
prices for crude oil and natural gas increased earnings by $2.1billion between periods. partly
offsetting these effects were higher operating expenses of $200million, in part due to the gulf of
mexico drilling moratorium. lower exploration expenses were essentially offset by higher tax items
and higher depreciation expenses.
u.s. upstream earnings of $2.3billion in 2009 decreased $4.9billion from 2008. lower prices
for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by about $5.2billion between periods,

financial condition and results of operations
and gains on asset sales declined by approximately $900million. partially offsetting
these effects was a benefit of about $1.3billion resulting from an increase in net oil equivalent
production. an approximate $600million benefit to income from lower operating expenses was more
than offset by higher depreciation expense. the benefit from lower operating expenses was largely
associated with an absence of charges for damages related to the 2008 hurricanes in the gulf of
mexico.
the companys average realization for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2010 was
$71.59 per barrel, compared with $54.36 in 2009 and $88.43 in 2008. the average natural gas
realization was $4.26 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, compared with $3.73 and $7.90 in 2009 and
2008, respectively.
net oil-equivalent production in 2010 averaged 708,000 barrels per day, down 1percent from
2009 and up 6percent from 2008. natural field declines between 2010 and 2009 were mostly offset by
increased production from the tahiti field. the increase between 2009 and 2008 was mainly due to
the start-up of the blind faith field in late 2008 and the tahiti field in second quarter 2009. the
net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2010 averaged 489,000 barrels per day, up 1
percent from 2009 and up 16percent compared with 2008. net natural gas production averaged 1.3
billion cubic feet per day in 2010, down approximately 6percent from 2009 and down about 12
percent from 2008. refer to the selected operating data table on page fs-11 for the three-year

earnings of $13.6billion in 2010 increased $4.9billion from 2009. higher prices for crude
oil and natural gas increased earnings by $4.3billion, and an increase in net oil-equivalent
production in the 2010 period benefited income by about $1.2billion. this net benefit was partly
offset by higher operating expenses of $500million. a favorable change in tax items of about $450
million was mostly offset by higher depreciation expenses. the 2009 period included gains of about
$500million on asset sales and tax items related to the gorgon project in australia. foreign
currency effects decreased earnings by $293million in the 2010 period, compared with a reduction
of $578million a year earlier, primarily reflecting noncash losses on balance sheet remeasurement.
international upstream earnings of $8.7billion in 2009 decreased $6.4billion from 2008.
lower prices for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by $7.0billion, while foreign currency
effects and higher operating and depreciation expenses decreased income by a total of $2.2billion.
partially offsetting these items were benefits of $2.3billion resulting from an increase in sales
volumes of crude oil and about $500million associated with asset sales and tax items related to
the gorgon project.
the companys average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2010
was $72.68 per barrel, compared with $55.97 in 2009 and $86.51 in 2008. the average natural gas
realization was $4.64 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, compared with $4.01 and $5.19 in 2009 and
2008, respectively.
international net oil-equivalent production of 2.06million barrels per day in 2010 increased
about 3percent and 11percent from 2009 and 2008, respectively. the volumes in 2010 include
synthetic oil that was reported in 2009 and 2008 as production from oil sands in canada. absent the
impact of prices on certain production-sharing and variable-royalty agreements, net oil-equivalent
production increased 5percent in 2010 and 4percent in 2009, when compared with the prior years
production.
the net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 1.4million barrels
per day in 2010, an increase of approximately 3percent from 2009 and 14percent from 2008.
international net natural gas production of 3.7billion cubic feet per day in 2010 was up 4percent

u.s. downstream earned $1,339million in 2010, compared with a loss of $121million in
2009. improved margins on refined products increased earnings by about $550million. also
contributing to the increase was a nearly $400million gain on the sale of a 23.4percent ownership
interest in the colonial pipeline company. higher earnings from chemicals operations increased
earnings by about $300million, largely from improved margins at the 50percent-owned chevron
phillips chemical company llc (cpchem).
earnings decreased approximately $1.5billion in 2009 from 2008. lower refined product margins
resulted in an earnings decline of $1.7billion. partially offsetting the effects of lower refined
product margins was a decrease in operating expenses, which benefited earnings by $300million, and
an increase of about $100million in earnings from cpchem. the improvement for cpchem reflected
lower utility and manufacturing costs, as well as the absence of an impairment recorded in 2008.
these benefits more than offset lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals.
sales volumes of refined products were 1.35million barrels per day in 2010, a decrease of 4
percent from 2009. the decline was mainly in gasoline and jet fuel sales. sales volumes of refined
products were 1.40million barrels per day in 2009, a decrease of 1percent from 2008. u.s. branded
gasoline sales decreased to 573,000 barrels per day in 2010, representing approximately 7percent
and 5percent declines from 2009 and 2008, respectively. the decline in 2010, relative to 2009 and
2008, was primarily due to the previously announced exits from selected eastern u.s. retail
markets.

manufacture and sale of gasoline and other
refined products increased earnings by about
$1.0billion, and a favorable swing in
mark-to-market effects on derivative

the absence of 2009 gains on asset sales of
about $550

transportation costs. foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $135million in 2010, compared
with a reduction of $191million in 2009.
earnings of $594million in 2009
decreased about $1.2billion from 2008. a decline of
approximately $2.6billion between periods was associated with weaker margins on the manufacture and
sale of gasoline and other refined products and the absence of gains recorded in 2008 on derivative
instruments. foreign currency effects produced an unfavorable
variance of about $300million. partially
offsetting these items were a $1.0billion benefit from
lower operating expenses associated mainly with contract labor, professional services and
transportation costs, and about a $550million increase in gains on asset sales related to refined
products marketing operations, primarily in certain countries in latin america and africa.
international refined product sales volumes of 1.76million barrels per day in 2010 were 5
percent lower than in 2009, mainly due to asset sales in certain countries in africa and latin
america. refined product sales volumes of 1.85million barrels per day in 2009 were 8percent lower
than in 2008, mainly due to the effects of asset sales and lower demand.

millions of dollars
income from equity affiliates
$
5,637
$
3,316
$
5,366
income from equity affiliates increased in 2010 from 2009 largely due to higher
upstream-related earnings from tengizchevroil (tco)in kazakhstan and petropiar in venezuela,
principally related to higher prices for crude oil and increased crude oil production.
downstream-related affiliate earnings were also higher between the comparative periods, primarily
due to higher earnings from cpchem, as a result of higher margins on sales of commodity chemicals.
improved margins on refined products and a favorable swing in foreign currency effects at gs caltex
in south korea also contributed to the increase in downstream affiliate earnings in the 2010
period. income from equity affiliates decreased in 2009 from 2008. upstream-related affiliate
income declined about $1.3billion mainly due to lower earnings for tco as a result of lower prices
for crude oil. downstream-related affiliate earnings were lower by approximately $1.0billion
primarily due to weaker margins and an unfavorable swing in foreign

$
26,551
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 were about $1.6billion

compensation and benefits; $200million of increased construction, repair and maintenance expense;
and an increase of about $200million associated with higher tanker charter rates. in addition,
charges of $234million related to employee reductions were included in the 2010 period. total
expenses for 2009 decreased approximately $4.2billion from 2008 primarily due to $1.4billion of
lower fuel and transportation expenses; $800million of decreased costs for contract labor and
professional services; the absence of uninsured 2008 hurricane-related charges of $700million; a

effective income tax rates were 40percent in 2010, 43percent in 2009 and 44percent in
2008. the rate was lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to international upstream impacts. a
lower effective tax rate in international upstream in 2010 was primarily driven by an increased
utilization of tax credits, which had a greater impact on the rate than one-time deferred tax
benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales in 2009. also, a smaller portion of company
income was earned in higher tax rate international upstream jurisdictions in 2010 than in 2009.
finally, foreign currency remeasurement impacts caused a reduction in the effective tax rate
between periods. the rate was lower in 2009 than in 2008 mainly due to the effect in 2009 of
deferred tax benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales, both related to an international
upstream project. in addition, a greater proportion of before-tax income was earned in 2009 by
equity affiliates than in 2008. (equity affiliate income is reported as a single amount on an
after-tax basis on the consolidated statement of income.) partially offsetting these items was the
effect of a greater proportion of income earned in 2009 in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates.

financial condition and results of operations
liquidity and capital resources
cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities total balances were $17.1
billion and $8.8billion at december31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. cash provided by operating
activities in 2010 was $31.4billion, compared with $19.4billion in 2009 and $29.6billion in
2008. cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
approximately $1.4billion, $1.7billion and $800million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.0
billion in 2010, $2.6billion in 2009 and $1.5billion in 2008. cash provided by operating
activities during 2010 was more than sufficient to fund the companys $21.8billion capital and
exploratory program, pay $5.7billion of dividends to shareholders and repurchase $750million of
common stock.
restricted cash of $855million and $123million associated with various capital-investment
projects at december31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was invested in short-term marketable
securities and recorded as deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
dividends dividends paid to common stockholders were approximately $5.7billion in 2010, $5.3
billion in 2009 and $5.2billion in 2008. in april2010, the company increased its quarterly common
stock dividend by 5.9percent, to $0.72 per share.
debt and capital lease obligations total debt and capital lease obligations were $11.5billion
at december31, 2010, up from $10.5billion at year-end 2009.
the $1.0billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2010 included
issuance of $1.25billion of tax-exempt bonds, partially offset by a decrease in short-term
obligations. the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting
primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of
long-term debt, totaled $5.6billion at december31, 2010, up from $4.6billion at year-end 2009.
of this amount, $5.4billion and $4.2billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each
period, respectively. at year-end 2010, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require
the use of working capital in 2011, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by
committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.
at december31, 2010, the company had $6.0billion in committed credit facilities with various
major banks, expiring in may2013, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a
long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for
general corporate purposes. the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring
commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management
believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at
interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates
published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no
borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2010. in addition, the company
has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in march2013 for an unspecified amount
of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.
the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the companys debt, and the companys cost
of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding
public bonds issued by chevron corporation, chevron corporation profit sharing/savings plan trust
fund, texaco capital inc. and union oil company of california. all of these securities are the
obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poors
corporation and aa1 by moodys investors service. the companys u.s. commercial paper is rated
a-1+ by standard and
poors and p-1 by moodys. all of these ratings denote high-quality,
investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital
program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt
ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash
requirements. the company also can modify capital spending plans during periods of low prices for
crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity

common stock repurchase program in july2010, the company terminated the $15billion share
repurchase program initiated in september2007. no share repurchases occurred in 2010 under the
program prior to its termination. from the inception of the program, the company acquired 119
million shares at a cost of $10.1billion. in its place, the board of directors approved a new,
ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. the company expects to
repurchase between $500million and $1billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing
prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market
conditions and other factors. the company began purchases of its common stock in the fourth
quarter, and through december31, 2010, 8.8million shares were purchased under the new program for
$750million.
capital and exploratory expenditures
total expenditures for
2010 were $21.8billion, including
$1.4billion for the companys
share of equity-affiliate expenditures. in 2009 and 2008,
expenditures were $22.2billion and $22.8billion, respectively,
including the companys share of
affiliates expenditures of
$1.6billion and $2.3billion, respectively, and $2billion for the
extension of an upstream concession in 2009.
of the $21.8billion of expenditures in 2010, 87percent, or $18.9billion, was related to
upstream activities. approximately 80percent was expended for upstream operations in 2009 and 2008.
international upstream accounted for about 82percent of the worldwide
upstream investment in 2010, about 80percent in 2009 and about 70percent
in 2008, reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities
available outside the united states.
the company estimates that in 2011, capital and exploratory
expenditures will be $26.0billion, including $2.0billion of spending by
affiliates. approximately 85percent of the total, or $22.6billion, is
budgeted for exploration and produc-
tion activities, with $17.2billion of this amount for projects outside the united states. spending
in 2011 is primarily focused on major development projects in angola, australia, brazil, canada,
china, nigeria, thailand, the united kingdom and the u.s. gulf of mexico. also included is funding
for base business improvements and focused exploration and appraisal programs in core hydrocarbon
basins.
worldwide downstream spending in 2011 is estimated at $2.9billion, with about $1.7billion
for projects in the united states. major capital outlays include projects under construction at
refineries in the united states and south korea.
investments in technology, power generation and other corporate businesses in 2011 are
budgeted at $500million.
noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $730million and $647
million at december31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. distributions to noncontrolling interests
totaled $72million and $71million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
pension obligations in 2010, the companys pension plan contributions were $1.4billion
(including $1.19billion to the u.s. plans and $258million to the international plans). the
company estimates contributions in 2011 will be approximately $950million ($650million for the
u.s. plans and $300million for the international plans). actual contribution amounts are dependent
upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic
factors. additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to
offset increases in plan obligations. refer also to the discussion of pension accounting in
critical accounting estimates and assumptions, beginning on page fs-20.

interest
coverage ratio  income before income tax expense, plus interest and
debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. this ratio indicates the companys
ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. the companys interest coverage ratio in 2010 was
higher than 2009 due to higher before-tax income. the companys interest coverage ratio in 2009
was lower than 2008 due to lower before-tax income.
debt
ratio  total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders
equity, which indicates the companys leverage. the decrease between 2010 and 2009 was due to a
higher chevron corporation stockholders equity balance. the increase in 2009 over 2008 was
primarily due to the increase in debt.

the companys guarantee of approximately $600million is associated with certain
payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. the terminal is
expected to be operational by 2012. over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum
guarantee amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are
numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of
any amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under
this guarantee.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon
and motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the
company would be required to perform if the indemnified liabilities become actual losses. were that
to occur, the company could be required to make future payments up to $300million. through the end
of 2010, the company had paid $48million under these indemnities and continues to be obligated for
possible additional indemnification payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims had to be asserted by february2009 for equilon indemnities and must be
asserted no later than february2012 for motiva indemnities. under the terms of these indemnities,
there is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. the company posts no assets
as collateral and has made no payments under the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or
motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. the acquirer of those
assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200
million, which had been reached at december31, 2009. under the indemnification agreement, after
reaching the $200million obligation, chevron is solely responsible until april2022, when the
indemnification expires. the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these
indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.
although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable
and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput
and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the
agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity,
fs-14
table of contents
drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the
companys business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various
commitments are: 2011  $17.2billion; 2012  $4.1billion; 2013  $3.5billion; 2014  $3.1
billion; 2015  $3.0billion; 2016 and
after  $7.7billion. a portion of these commitments may
ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under the agreements were approximately
$6.5billion in 2010, $8.1billion in 2009 and $5.1billion in 2008.

does not include amounts related to the companys income tax liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions. the company is unable to make reasonable estimates for the
periods in which these liabilities may become payable. the company does not expect
settlement of such liabilities will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity in any single period.
$5.4billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in long-term debt. the repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire
amounts in the 2012-2013 period.
does not include obligations to purchase the companys share of natural gas liquids and
regasified natural gas associated with operations of the 36.4percent-owned angola lng
affiliate. the lng plant is expected to commence operations in 2012 and is designed
to produce 5.2million metric tons of lng and related natural gas liquids per year. volumes
and prices associated with these purchase obligations are neither fixed nor determinable.
financial and derivative instruments
the market risk associated with the companys portfolio of financial and derivative
instruments is discussed below. the estimates of financial exposure to market risk discussed below
do not represent the companys projection of future market changes. the actual impact of future
market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including
those set forth under the heading risk factors in parti, item1a, of the companys 2010 annual
report on form 10-k.
derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural
gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. the company also uses derivative
commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. the results of these activities were not
material to the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2010.
the companys market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal risk control group in accordance with the companys risk management policies, which have
been approved by the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
the derivative commodity instruments used in the companys risk management and trading
activities consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the new york mercantile
exchange and on electronic platforms of the inter-continental exchange and chicago mercantile
exchange. in addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap contracts and option
contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas
companies in the over-the-counter markets.
virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other
independent third-party quotes. the change in fair value of chevrons derivative commodity
instruments in 2010 was a quarterly average decrease of $1million in total assets and a quarterly
average increase of $18million in total liabilities.
the company uses a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate the potential loss in fair value on a
single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity
instruments held or issued, which are recorded on the balance sheet at december31, 2010, as
derivative commodity instruments in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives (asc 815).
var is the maximum loss not to be exceeded within a given probability or confidence level over a
given period of time. the companys var model uses the monte carlo simulation method that involves
generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified probability distributions and constructing a
full distribution of a portfolios potential values.
the var model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average for computing historical
volatilities and correlations, a 95percent confidence level, and a one-day holding period. that
is, the companys 95percent, one-day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value
that would not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were
held constant for one day.
the one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be
liquidated or hedged within one day. for hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most
of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. the
following table presents the 95
percent/one-day var for each of the companys primary risk exposures in the area of derivative
commodity instruments at december31, 2010 and 2009.

foreign currency the company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to
manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. the
foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. there were no open foreign currency derivative
contracts at december31, 2010.
interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest rate swaps, if any, are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at
year-end 2010, the company had no interest rate swaps.
transactions with related parties
chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. these arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term
purchase agreements. refer to other information in note 12 of the consolidated financial
statements, page fs-43, for further discussion. management believes these agreements have been
negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.
litigation and other contingencies
mtbe
chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary
butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. chevron is a party to 19 pending lawsuits and claims,
the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the
future. the companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not
determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. the company no longer uses
mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states.
ecuador
chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the
superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio, ecuador, brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to
be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations.
the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from
the oil exploration and
production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental
remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program.
until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of texaco inc., was a minority member
of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority
partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador. at the conclusion
of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession
area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for
texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership
share of the consortium. pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation
program at a cost of $40 million. after certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government
granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental
liability arising from the consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously
given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and
municipal governments. with regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms
that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage
reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuadors
further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.
in 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $18.9 billion, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an
additional $8.4 billion could be assessed
against chevron for unjust enrichment. in 2009, following the disclosure by chevron of evidence
that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves
out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the
case was recused. in 2010, chevron
moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states
indicating that the report was prepared by con-
fs-16
table of contents
sultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as
the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct.
in august2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers
report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45days. chevron
subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of
fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory
time requirement.
in september2010, chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should
be assessed against it. the plaintiffs submission, which relied in part on the mining engineers
report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16
billion and $76 billion and that
unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between
approximately $5 billion and $38 billion. the
next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the
parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. chevron petitioned
to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal petition, and because
procedural and evidentiary matters remain unresolved. in october2010, chevrons motion to recuse
the judge was granted. a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order
closing the evidentiary phase of the case. on december17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing
the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so
that he could prepare a judgment.
chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september2009 against the republic of
ecuador before the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united
nations commission on international trade law. the claim alleges violations of the republic of
ecuadors obligations under the united states-ecuador bilateral investment treaty (bit)and
breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet
(described above), which are investment agreements protected by the bit. through the arbitration,
chevron and texpet are seeking relief against the republic of ecuador, including a declaration that
any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation constitutes a violation of ecuadors
obligations under the bit. on february9, 2011, the permanent court of arbitration issued an order
for interim measures requiring the republic of ecuador to take all
measures at its disposal to
suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without ecuador of any
judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending further order of the tribunal. chevron
expects to continue seeking permanent injunctive relief and monetary
relief before the tribunal.
through a series of recent u.s. court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery
relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration, chevron has obtained evidence that
it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of
several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs. in february2011,
chevron filed a civil law-
suit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york
against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging
violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws. through
the civil lawsuit, chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration
that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other
unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. on february8, 2011, the court issued a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them
from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against chevron
in the lago agrio case until march8, 2011.
chevrons motion for a preliminary injunction is presently before the court.
on february14, 2011, the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the
case. the provincial court rejected chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in
its opinion. the judgment assesses approximately $8.6billion in damages and about $0.9billion
for the plaintiffs representatives. it also assesses an additional amount of approximately $8.6
billion in punitive damages unless the company provides a public apology. chevron continues to
believe the courts judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in ecuador, the united states and
other countries. the company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to
the legitimate scientific evidence. chevron will appeal this decision in ecuador. chevron cannot
predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in ecuador. chevron will continue
a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability. because chevron has no substantial assets in
ecuador, chevron would expect enforcement actions as a result of this judgment to be brought in
other jurisdictions. chevron  expects to contest any such actions.
the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on chevron,
remains uncertain. management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a
range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the defects associated with the judgment, the
2008 engineers report and the september2010 plaintiffs submission, management does not believe
these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).
moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for
management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations,
private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal
settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate
the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including
mtbe, by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including,
but not limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude
oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and
mining operations, whether operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable
due to such factors as the unknown

magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and
extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys
liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are
recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

included in the $1,507million year-end 2010 reserve balance were remediation activities
at approximately 182 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible
party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)or
other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state
laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2010 was $185million. the
federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron
to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2010 environmental reserves balance of $1,322million, $814million
related to the companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants,
marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. the
remaining $508million was associated with various sites in international downstream ($100
million), upstream ($329million) and other businesses ($79million). liabilities at all sites,
whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the companys plans and
activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities
include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of
contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and
vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of
the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2010 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
the company records asset obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. these asset
retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. the liability balance of
approximately $12.5billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2010 related primarily to
upstream properties.
for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals
facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets
reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has
been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of
the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

obligations and the discussion of environmental matters on page fs-19.

income taxes the company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. refer to note 15 beginning on page fs-47 for a discussion of the periods for which tax
returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax
jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the company does not
expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
suspended wells the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude oil and natural gas fields. the
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity or
development decisions or both. at december31, 2010, the company had approximately $2.7billion of
suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $283
million from 2009. the 2009 balance reflected an increase of $317million from 2008.
the future trend of the companys exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. the effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $2.7billion of suspended wells at year-end 2010 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.
refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-50, for additional discussion of suspended wells.
equity redetermination for crude oil and natural gas producing operations, ownership
agreements may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and
natural gas reserves. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses
that could be material to earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has
been under way since 1996 for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum
reserve at elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were
owned by the u.s. department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount
for the four zones. for this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200million, and the possible maximum net amount that could
be owed to chevron is estimated at about $150million. the timing of the settlement and the exact
amount within this range of estimates are uncertain.
other contingencies on april26, 2010, a california appeals court issued a ruling related to
the adequacy of an environmental impact report (eir)supporting the issuance of certain permits by the city of
richmond, california, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at chevrons refinery in
richmond.
settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and the company
continues to evaluate its options going forward, which may include requesting the city to revise
the eir to address the issues identified by the court of appeal or
other actions. management believes the outcomes associated with the potential options for the project are uncertain. due to
the uncertainty of the companys future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or
combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any,
of the ruling can be made at this time. however, the companys ultimate exposure may be
significant to net income in any one future period.
chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; u.s. federal,
state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. the amounts
of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to
resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. an obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2010 at
approximately $2.9billion for its
consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were
approximately $1.4billion of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.5billion of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and
restoration of sites.
for 2011, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.5billion.
these capital costs are
fs-19

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental
regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by
prior releases of hazardous materials. although these costs may be significant to the results of
operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the
companys liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted
accounting principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over
different reporting periods. all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the
companys financial condition or operating performance is material.
besides those meeting these critical criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. although
not associated with highly uncertain matters, these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be more likely than not. another
example is the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves under sec rules, which require ...by
analysis of geosciences and engineering data, (the reserves) can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible...under existing economic conditions where existing
economic conditions include prices based on the average price during the 12-month period prior to
the end of  the reporting period. refer to table v, reserve quantity information, beginning on
page fs-71, for the changes in these estimates for the three years ending december31, 2010, and to
table vii, changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved
reserves on page fs-80 for estimates of proved-reserve values for each of the three years ended
december31, 2010. note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-32,
includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration
and production activities. the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the
timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical accounting policy for impairment of properties, plant and
equipment and investments in affiliates, beginning on page fs-22, includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and
gas properties. this commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. significant accounting policies are
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-32. the
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the audit committee of the board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension plan obligations
and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. for other postretirement benefit (opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care
and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining opeb obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed
health care cost-trend rates.
note 21, beginning on page fs-52, includes information on the funded status of the companys
pension and opeb plans at the end of 2010 and 2009; the components of pension and opeb expense for
the three years ending december31, 2010; and the underlying assumptions for those periods.
fs-20
table of contents
pension and opeb expense is reported on the consolidated statement of income as operating
expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses and applies to all business segments.
the year-end 2010 and 2009 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and
obligations, of each of the companys pension and opeb plans is recognized on the consolidated
balance sheet. the differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a long-term
asset in deferred charges and other assets. the differences associated with underfunded or
unfunded pension and opeb plans are reported as accrued liabilities or reserves for employee
benefit plans. amounts yet to be recognized as components of pension or opeb expense are reported
in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
to estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses a process that
incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future performance
and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. asset allocations
are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the
companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. the expected
long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 70percent of the companys pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8percent since 2002. for the 10years ending december31,
2010, actual asset returns averaged 4.7percent for this plan. the actual return for 2010 was 11.6
percent and was associated with the broad recovery in the financial markets.
the year-end market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market
value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2010, the company selected a 4.8
percent discount rate for the major u.s. pension plan and 5.0percent for its opeb plan. these
rates were selected based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the citigroup pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2010. the discount rates at the end of
2009 were 5.3percent for the major u.s. pension plan and 5.8percent for the companys u.s. opeb
plan, and 6.3percent at the end of 2008 for both the u.s. pension and opeb plans.
an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2010 was $1.1billion. as an
indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1
percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the
companys primary u.s. pension
plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2010 by approximately $65million. a 1
percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for about 61percent of
the  companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2010 by
approximately $140million.
an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the
funded status of a plan reported on the consolidated balance sheet. the total pension liability on
the consolidated balance sheet at december31, 2010, for underfunded plans was approximately $3.3
billion. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary u.s.
pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $300million, which would have
decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately $0.9billion to $0.6billion. other
plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. the actual rates of return on plan
assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in
the worlds financial markets.
in 2010, the companys pension plan contributions were $1.45billion (including $1.19billion
to the u.s. plans). in 2011, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $950
million. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2010 was $166million and the total liability,
which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2010, was $3.6billion.
as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2010, a
1percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary u.s. opeb plan, which accounted
for about 69percent of the companywide opeb expense, would have decreased opeb expense by
approximately $15million. a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 85percent of the companywide opeb liabilities, would have decreased total opeb
liabilities at the end of 2010 by approximately $80million.
for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4percent per year. for active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims
experiences are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 8
percent in 2011 and gradually drop to 5percent for 2018 and beyond. as an indication of the health
care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2010, a 1percent increase
in the rates for the main u.s. opeb plan, which accounted for 85percent of the companywide opeb liabilities, would have increased opeb
expense by $8million.
differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of
each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference
occurs. instead, the differences are

to note 21, beginning on page fs-52, for information on the $6.7billion of before-tax actuarial
losses recorded by the company as of december31, 2010; a description of the method used to
amortize those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2011.
impairment of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company
assesses its properties, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
such indicators include changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved
reserve quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the
asset over its estimated fair value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions. refer also to the
discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in note 9 beginning on page fs-37.
no major individual impairments of pp&e and investments were recorded for the three years
ending december31, 2010. a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if
other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not
practicable, given the broad range of the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in
the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair
any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown
number of other assets to become impaired.
investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method,
as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees,
are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying
value. when such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded
to the income statement for the difference between the investments carrying value and its
estimated fair value at the time.
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company
considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial
performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that
will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of
the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.
from time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when
significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field
or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. that is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified
as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets associated carrying values.
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as
required by accounting standards for goodwill (asc 350), the company tests such goodwill at the
reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.
contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. for example, the costs from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation,
the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and
improvements in technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies
if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally reports
these losses as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of income. an exception to
fs-22
table of contents
this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than
not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. for
additional  discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to note 15 beginning on page fs-47. refer
also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three
years ended december31, 2010.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

became effective for the company january1, 2010. asu 2009-17 requires the enterprise to
qualitatively assess if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable-interest entity (vie), and if
so, the vie must be consolidated. adoption of the standard did not have an impact on the companys
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
receivables (asc 310), disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the
allowance for credit losses (asu
2010-20) in july2010, the fasb issued asu 2010-20, which became
effective with the companys reporting at december31, 2010. this standard amends and expands
disclosure requirements about the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance
for credit losses. as a result of these amendments, companies are required to disaggregate, by
portfolio segment or class of financing receivable, certain existing disclosures and provide
certain new disclosures about financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevron corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of chevron corporation and its subsidiaries at december31, 2010 and
december31, 2009 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended december31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2010, based on criteria
established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting.
our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule, and on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting
oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall
financial statement  presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.
the nature of the companys operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. the company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent-owned and variable-interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to
50percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity
currently in income.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of
the investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a
decline is other
than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the
investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment
for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments
market value. the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for
subsequent recoveries in fair value.
differences between the companys carrying value of an equity
investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent
practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various
factors giving rise to the difference. when appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates
reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values
and the affiliates historical book values.
derivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. for the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative
instruments are reported in current income. the company may enter into interest rate swaps from
time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest
rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as
fair value hedges. interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair
value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. where chevron is a
party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for
derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance
sheet.
short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents.
bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90days are reported as time deposits. the
balance of short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and is marked-to-market,
with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income.
inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost,
using a last-in, first-out
fs-32
table of contents
note 1 summary of significant accounting policies - continued
(lifo)method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials, supplies and other
inventories generally are stated at average cost.
properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have
found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when
the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. all other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-50, for additional
discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties,
are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the united states, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. in downstream, impairment reviews are generally
done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing area or marketing assets by country.
impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value. refer to note 9, beginning on page fs-37, relating to fair value measurements.
as required under accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (accounting standards
codification (asc)410), the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a
liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. refer also to note 25, on page fs-62, relating to aros.
depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas
producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method
generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. depletion expenses
for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production
method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation
provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses for mining assets are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. the capitalized costs of all other
plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the
straight-line method generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as other income.
expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs
and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as
incurred. major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as required
by accounting standards for goodwill (asc 350), the company tests such goodwill at the reporting
unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.
environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future remediation
costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs
can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and canadian marketing facilities, the accrual
fs-33
table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note 1 summary of significant accounting policies - continued
is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. for
crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an aro is made, following
accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. refer to note 25, on page
fs-62, for a discussion of the companys aros.
for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a
liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for
other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other
parties are not able to pay their respective shares.
the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of
future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
companys own internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all
gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. the cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in currency translation adjustment on the
consolidated statement of equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on the
entitlement method. excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. the
associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the consolidated statement of income on page fs-27.
purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation
of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and
reported in purchased crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income.
stock
options and other share-based compensation the company issues stock options and other
share-based compensation to its employees and accounts for these transactions under the accounting
standards for share-based compensation (asc 718). for equity awards, such as stock options, total
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock
appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. the company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn
the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes
eligible to retain the award at retirement. stock options and stock appreciation rights granted
under the companys long-term incentive plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of
each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. the company
amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.

agreement to acquire atlas energy, inc.
in november2010, chevron announced plans to acquire atlas energy, inc. the acquisition was
completed in february2011 for $4,470, including assumed debt. the acquisition will be accounted
for as a business combination (asc 805). atlas holds one of the premier acreage positions in the
marcellus shale, concentrated in southwestern pennsylvania.

noncontrolling interests
the company adopted accounting standards for noncontrolling interests (asc 810) in the
consolidated financial statements effective january1, 2009, and retroactive to the earliest period
presented. ownership interests in the companys subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
are presented separately from the parents equity on the consolidated balance sheet. the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both

in accordance with accounting standards for cash-flow classifications for stock options (asc 718),
the net decrease (increase)in operating working capital includes reductions of $67, $25 and $106
for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. these amounts are offset by an equal amount in net (purchases)sales of treasury
shares.
the net (purchases)sales of treasury shares represents the cost of common shares purchased
less the cost of shares issued for share-based compensation plans. purchases totaled $775, $6 and
$8,011 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. purchases in 2010 and 2008 included shares purchased
under the companys common stock repurchase programs.
in 2010, net (purchases)sales of other short-term investments consist of restricted cash
associated with capital-investment projects at the companys pascagoula and el segundo refineries
and the angola liquefied natural gas project that was invested in short-term securities and
reclassified from
cash and cash equivalents to deferred charges and other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. the company issued $1,250 and $350, in 2010 and 2009, respectively, of
tax exempt bonds as a source of funds for u.s. refinery projects.
the consolidated statement of cash flows excludes changes to the consolidated balance sheet
that did not affect cash. in 2008, net (purchases)sales of treasury shares excludes $680 of
treasury shares acquired in exchange for a u.s. upstream property and $280 in cash. the carrying
value of this property in properties, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet was
not significant. in 2008, a $2,450 increase in accrued liabilities and a corresponding increase
to properties, plant and equipment, at cost were considered noncash transactions and excluded
from net decrease (increase)in operating working capital and capital expenditures. in 2009,
the payments related to these accrued liabilities were excluded from net decrease (increase)in
operating working capital and were reported as capital expenditures. the amount is related to
upstream operating agreements outside the united states. capital expenditures in 2008 excludes a
$1,400 increase in properties, plant and equipment related to the acquisition of an additional
interest in an equity affiliate that required a change to the consolidated method of accounting for
the investment during 2008. this addition was offset primarily by reductions in investments and
advances and working capital and an increase in non-current deferred income tax liabilities.
refer also to note 25, on page fs-62, for a discussion of revisions to the companys aros that also
did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending december31, 2010.

leasing arrangements involve tanker charters, crude oil production and processing equipment,
service stations, office buildings, and other facilities. other leases are classified as operating
leases and are not capitalized. the payments on such leases are recorded as expense. details of the

fair value measurements
accounting standards for
fair value measurement (asc 820) establish a framework for measuring fair
value and stipulate disclosures about fair value measurements. the standards apply to recurring and
nonrecurring financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that require or permit fair value
measurements. among the required disclosures is the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses
to value an asset or a liability. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as
follows:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted)in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. for
the company, level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are
willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively
traded.
level 2: inputs other than level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. for the
company, level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained
through third-party broker quotes, and prices that can be corroborated with other observable
inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract.
level 3: unobservable inputs. the company does not use level 3 inputs for any of its recurring
fair value measurements. level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value
associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. in
2010, the company used level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of certain nonrecurring
nonfinancial assets.

marketable
securities the company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based
on quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. the fair values reflect the cash that
would have been received if the instruments were sold at december31, 2010.
derivatives the
company records its derivative instruments  other than any commodity derivative
contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale  on the consolidated balance
sheet at fair value, with virtually all the offsetting amount on the consolidated statement of
income. for derivatives with identical or similar provisions as contracts that are publicly traded
on a regular basis, the company uses the market values of the publicly traded instruments as an
input for fair value calculations.
the companys derivative instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined
product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. derivatives classified as level 1 include
futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the new york mercantile
exchange.
derivatives classified as level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts principally
with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values for which are obtained
from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. the company obtains
multiple sources of pricing information for the level 2 instruments. since this pricing information
is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. the company does
not materially adjust this information. the company incorporates internal review, evaluation and
assessment procedures, including a comparison of level 2 fair values derived from the companys
internally developed for-
ward curves (on a sample basis) with the pricing
information to document reasonable, logical and
supportable fair value determinations and proper level of classification.
impairments of properties,
plant and equipment in accordance with the accounting standard for the
impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets (asc 360), during 2010
and 2009 long-lived  assets held
and used with carrying amounts of $142 and $949 were written down to fair values of $57 and $490
resulting in  before-tax losses of $85 and $459, respectively. the fair values were determined from
internal cash flow models, using discount rates consistent with those used by the company to
evaluate cash flows of other assets of a similar nature.
long-lived assets held for sale with carrying amounts of $49 and $160 were written down to a
fair value of $13 and $68, resulting in a before-tax loss of $36 and $92 in 2010 and 2009,
respectively. the fair values were determined based on bids received from prospective buyers and
from internal cash-flow models consistent with those used by the company to evaluate cash flows of
other assets of a similar nature.
impairments of investments and advances in accordance with the accounting standards under the
equity method of accounting (asc 323) and the cost method of accounting (asc 325), during 2010 and
2009 investments with carrying amounts of $15 and $81 were written down to fair values of $0 and
$39 resulting in before-tax losses of $15 and $42, respectively. the fair values were determined
using discount rates consistent with those used by the company to evaluate cash flows of other
investments of a similar nature.

assets and liabilities not required to be measured at fair value the company holds cash
equivalents and bank time deposits in u.s. and non-u.s. portfolios. the instruments classified as
cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90days or less and money
market funds. cash and cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of $14,060 and $8,716 at
december31, 2010 and december31, 2009, respectively. the instruments held in time deposits are
bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90days and had carrying/fair values of $2,855 at
december31, 2010. the fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits reflect the cash
that would have been received or paid if the instruments were settled at year-end.
cash and cash equivalents do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $855 and
$123 at december31, 2010 and december31, 2009, respectively. these investments are restricted
funds related to an international upstream development project and u.s. refinery projects, which
are reported in deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. long-term
debt of $5,636 and $5,705 had estimated fair values of $6,311 and $6,229 at december31, 2010 and
december31, 2009, respectively.
the carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
approximate their fair values. fair values of other financial instruments at the end of 2010 and
2009 were not material.
note 10
financial and derivative instruments
derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market
risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids,
liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company
refineries. from time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited
trading purposes.
the companys derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and
refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. none of the companys derivative
instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the companys affiliates
make such designation. the companys derivatives are not material to the companys financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. the company believes it has no material market or
credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity
derivative activities.
the company uses international swaps and derivatives association agreements to govern
derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. depending on the nature
of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. when the
company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty
and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market
exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and
is a reasonable measure of the companys credit risk exposure. the company also uses other netting
agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate
credit risk.

foreign currency the company may enter into currency derivative contracts to manage some of its
foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions,
including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. the currency derivative
contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. there were no open currency derivative contracts at december31, 2010 or 2009.
interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges.
interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at year-end 2010 and 2009, the
company had no interest rate swaps.
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the
companys short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. these investment
policies limit the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk.
similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the companys
counterparties in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. as a result, the company believes
concentrations of credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers. when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring
letters of credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.

operating segments and geographic data
although each subsidiary of chevron is responsible for its
own affairs, chevron corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their
affiliates. the investments are grouped into two business segments, upstream and downstream,
representing the companys reportable segments and operating segments as defined in accounting
standards for segment reporting (asc 280). upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification
associated with liquefied natural gas (lng); transporting crude oil by major international oil
export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a
gas-to-liquids project. downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into
petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and
refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and
marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant
additives. all other activities of the company include mining operations, power generation
businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative
functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, and alternative fuels and
technology.
the segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
segment managers who report to the companys chief operating decision maker (codm) (terms as
defined in asc 280). the codm is the companys executive committee (excom), a committee of senior
officers that includes the chief executive officer, and excom reports to the board of directors of
chevron corporation.
the operating segments represent components of the company, as described in accounting
standards for segment reporting (asc 280), that engage in activities (a)from which revenues are
earned and expenses are incurred; (b)whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm,
which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their
performance; and (c)for which discrete financial information is available.
segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the companys codm to discuss the segments operating activities and financial
performance. the codm approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and
exploratory budgets. however, business-unit managers within the operating segments are directly
responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and all other matters connected with
daily operations. company officers who are members of the excom also have individual management
responsibilities and participate in other committees for purposes other than acting as the codm.
the
activities reported in chevrons upstream and downstream operating segments have changed effective january1, 2010. chemicals businesses are now reported as part of the downstream segment.
in addition, the companys significant upstream-enabling operations, primarily a gas-to-liquids
project and major international export pipelines, have been reclassified from the downstream
segment to the upstream segment. prior period information in this report has been revised to
conform to the 2010 presentation.
the companys primary country of operation is the united states of america, its country of
domicile. other components of the companys operations are reported as international (outside
the united states).
segment earnings the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. however, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in
all other. earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:

segment sales and other operating revenues operating segment sales and other operating revenues,
including internal transfers, for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, are presented in the table at
the right. products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that
approximate market prices.
revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude
oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. revenues for the
downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as
gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude
oil. this segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of additives for fuels and
lubricant oils and the transportation and trading of refined products, crude oil and natural gas
liquids. all other activities include revenues from mining operations, power generation
businesses, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.
other than the united states, no single country accounted for 10percent or more of the
companys total sales and other operating revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the companys
carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates,
are as follows:
tengizchevroil chevron has a 50percent equity ownership interest in tengizchevroil (tco), a joint
venture formed in 1993 to develop the tengiz and korolev crude oil fields in kazakhstan over a
40-year period. at december31, 2010, the companys carrying value of its investment in tco was
about
$190 higher than the amount of underlying equity in tcos net assets. this difference results from
chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in tco at a value greater than the underlying book
value for that portion of tcos net assets. see note 7, on page fs-36, for summarized financial
information for 100percent of tco.
petropiar chevron has a 30percent interest in petropiar, a joint stock company formed in 2008 to
operate the hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. the project, located in venezuelas
orinoco belt, has a 25-year contract term. prior to the formation of petropiar, chevron had a 30
percent interest in the hamaca project. at december31, 2010, the companys carrying value of its
investment in petropiar was approximately $190 less than the amount of underlying equity in
petropiars net assets. the difference represents the excess of chevrons underlying equity in
petropiars net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.
caspian pipeline consortium chevron has a 15percent interest in the caspian pipeline consortium, a
variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both tco and
karachaganak. the company joined the consortium in 1997 and has investments and advances totaling
$974 which includes long term loans of $1,046 at year-end 2010. the loans were provided to fund 30
percent of the pipeline construction. the company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium
because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share
of the financial returns.
petroboscan chevron has a 39percent interest in petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006
to operate the boscan field in venezuela until 2026. chevron previously operated the field under an
operating service agreement. at december31, 2010, the companys carrying value of its investment
in petroboscan was approximately $250 higher than the amount of underlying equity in petroboscans
net assets. the difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by
chevron over its underlying equity in petroboscans net assets.
angola lng ltd. chevron has a 36percent interest in angola lng ltd., which will process and
liquefy natural gas produced in angola for delivery to international markets.

litigation
mtbe chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. chevron is a party to 19 pending lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury
claims, may be filed in the future.
the companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable, but
could be material to net income in any one period. the company no longer uses mtbe in the
manufacture of gasoline in the united states.
ecuador
chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the
superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio, ecuador, brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to
be representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had
operations. the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production
operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the
alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of
texaco inc., was a minority
member of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the
majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been con-
ducted solely by petroecuador. at the
conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the
concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and
petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to
texpets ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a
three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. after certifying that the sites were properly
remediated, the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from
any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously
given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and
municipal governments. with regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms
that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors
failure to timely fulfill its
legal obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the
operations.
in 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a
fs-45
table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note 14 litigation - continued
report recommending
that the court assess $18,900, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be assessed
against chevron for unjust enrichment. in 2009, following the disclosure by chevron of evidence
that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves
out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the
case was recused. in 2010, chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the
case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report
was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers
independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. in august2010, the
judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring
the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45days. chevron subsequently petitioned
for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and
that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement.
in september2010, chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should
be assessed against it. the plaintiffs submission, which relied in part on the mining engineers
report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and that
unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000. the next
day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties
that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. chevron petitioned to have
that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal petition, and because procedural
and evidentiary matters remain unresolved. in october2010, chevrons motion to recuse the judge
was granted. a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the
evidentiary phase of the case. on december17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the
evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that
he could prepare a judgment.
chevron
and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september2009 against the republic of ecuador
before the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations commission on
international trade law. the claim alleges violations of the republic of ecuadors
obligations under
the united states-ecuador bilateral investment treaty (bit)and breaches of the settlement and
release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet (described above), which are
investment agreements protected
by the bit. through the arbitration, chevron and texpet are seeking
relief against the republic of ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against chevron
in the lago agrio litigation constitutes a violation of ecuadors obligations under the bit. on
february9, 2011, the permanent court of arbitration issued an order for interim measures requiring
the republic of ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended
the enforcement or recognition within and without ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the
lago agrio case pending further order of the tribunal. chevron expects to continue seeking
permanent injunctive relief and monetary relief before the tribunal.
through a series of recent u.s. court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery
relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration, chevron has obtained evidence that
it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of
several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs. in february2011,
chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york
against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters alleging
violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act
and other state laws. through
the civil lawsuit, chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration
that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other
unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. on february8, 2011, the court issued a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them
from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against chevron
in the lago agrio case until march8, 2011. chevrons motion for a preliminary injunction is presently before the court.
on february14, 2011, the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case.
the provincial court rejected chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its
opinion. the judgment assesses approximately $8,600 in damages and about $900 for the plaintiffs
representatives. it also assesses an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages
unless the company provides a public apology. chevron continues to believe the courts judgment is
illegitimate and unenforceable in ecuador, the united states and other countries. the company also
believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence.
chevron will appeal this decision in ecuador. chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate
outcome of the appeals process in ecuador. chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any
imposition of liability. because chevron has no substantial assets in ecuador, chevron would
expect enforcement actions  as a result of this judgment to be brought in other jurisdictions.
chevron  expects to contest any such actions.

note 14 litigation - continued
the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on chevron,
remains uncertain.
management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a
range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the defects
associated with the judgment, the 2008
engineers report and the september2010 plaintiffs submission, management does not believe these
documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).
moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for
management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

in 2010, before-tax income for u.s. operations, including related corporate and other charges, was
$6,528, compared with before-tax income of $1,310 and $10,765 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. for
international operations, before-tax income was $25,527, $17,218 and $32,292 in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively. u.s. federal income tax expense was reduced by $162, $204 and $198 in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively, for business tax credits.

the companys effective tax rate decreased from 43.0percent in 2009 to 40.3percent in 2010.
the rate was lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to international upstream impacts. a lower
effective tax rate in international upstream in 2010 was primarily driven by an increased
utilization of tax credits, which had a greater impact on the rate than one-time deferred tax
benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales in 2009. also, a smaller portion of company
income was earned in higher tax rate international upstream jurisdictions in 2010 than in 2009.
finally, foreign currency remeasurement impacts caused a reduction in the effective tax rate
between periods.
the company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net
amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or

deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2010 increased by almost $1,400 from year-end 2009. the
increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and
equipment.
deferred tax assets increased by approximately $700 in 2010. increases primarily related to
additional foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions (which were
substantially offset by valuation allowances) and to increased temporary differences for asset
retirement obligations, environmental reserves and employee benefits. these effects were partially
offset by reductions in deferred credits resulting primarily from the usage of tax benefits in
international tax jurisdictions.
the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit
carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. it reduces the deferred tax assets
to amounts that are, in managements assessment, more likely than not to be realized. tax loss

exist in many international jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss
carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2011 through
2036. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $6,669 will expire between 2011 and 2020.

income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have
been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. undistributed earnings of international
consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made
for possible future remittances totaled $21,347 at december31, 2010. this amount represents
earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business. it is not practicable
to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of earnings that
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. at the end of 2010, deferred income taxes were recorded
for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations for which the company no longer
intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings. the company does not anticipate incurring significant
additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.
uncertain income tax positions under accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes (asc
740-10), a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a
likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the
technical merits of the position. the term tax position in the accounting standards for income
taxes
(asc
740-10-20) refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be
taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets
and liabilities for interim or annual periods.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the
years ended december31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. the term unrecognized tax benefits in the
accounting standards for income taxes (asc 740-10-20) refers to the differences between a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in
the financial statements. interest and penalties are not included.

approximately 80percent of the $3,507 of unrecognized tax benefits at december31, 2010,
would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. certain of these
unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance
at the time of any such recognition.
tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits
by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. for the companys major tax jurisdictions,
examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december31,
2010. for these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been
finalized were as follows: united states  2005, nigeria
1994, angola  2001 and saudi arabia
2003.
the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax
matters in the various jurisdictions. both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of
resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. however, it is reasonably
possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant
increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12months.
given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being
examined in the various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax
benefits.
on the consolidated statement of income, the company reports interest and penalties related to
liabilities for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. as of december31, 2010, accruals
of $225 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance
sheet, compared with accruals of $232 as of year-end 2009. income tax expense (benefit)associated
with interest and penalties was $40, $(20) and $79 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

weighted-average interest rates at december31, 2010 and 2009, were 0.16percent and 0.08
percent, respectively.
redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are
included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders
within one year following the balance sheet date.
in 2010, $1,250 of tax-exempt bonds related to projects at the pascagoula and el segundo refineries
were issued.
the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt.
at december31, 2010, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.
at december31, 2010, the company had $6,000 in committed credit facilities with various major
banks, expiring in may2013, that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term
basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general
corporate
purposes. the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with
new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes
appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates
based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by
specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no borrowings were
outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2010.
at december31, 2010 and 2009, the company classified $5,400 and $4,190, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital within one year, as the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced
by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

for credit losses. as a result of these amendments, companies are required to disaggregate, by
portfolio segment or class of financing receivable, certain existing disclosures and provide
certain new disclosures about financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses.
adoption of the standard did not change the companys existing disclosures.

accounting for suspended exploratory wells
accounting standards for the costs of exploratory wells
(asc 932) provide that exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized after the completion of
drilling when (a)the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
producing well and (b)the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. if either condition is not met or if an enterprise
obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed
to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. (note that an
entity is not required to complete the exploratory or exploratory-type stratigraphic well as a
producing well.) the accounting standards provide a number of indicators that can assist an entity
in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic
viability of the project. the following table indicates the changes to the companys suspended
exploratory well costs for the three years ended december31, 2010:

certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.
of the $2,299 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at december31,
2010, $982 (26 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly
planned for the near future. the $1,317 balance is related to 27 projects in areas requiring a major
capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were
not under way or firmly planned for the near future. additional drilling was not deemed necessary
because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in
process to enable a future decision on project development.
the projects for the $1,317 referenced above had the following activities associated with
assessing the reserves and the projects economic viability: (a) $501 (three projects)  project
sanction approved and construction is in progress, with initial recognition of proved reserves expected upon
reaching economic producibility per sec guidelines;
(b) $263 (six projects)  development alternatives under review;
(c) $178 (three projects)  in
process of entering contracts for front-end engineering and design;
(d) $154 (three projects)

stock options and other share-based compensation
compensation expense for stock options for 2010,
2009 and 2008 was $229 ($149 after tax), $182 ($119 after tax) and $168 ($109 after tax), respectively. in
addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance units
and restricted stock units was $194 ($126 after tax), $170 ($110 after tax) and $132 ($86 after
tax) for 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively. no significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at
december31, 2010 and 2009.
cash received in payment for option
exercises under all
share-based payment arrangements for
2010, 2009 and 2008 was $385, $147 and $404, respectively. actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from
option exercises were $66, $25 and $103 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $140, $89 and $136 for
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
chevron long-term incentive plan (ltip) awards under the ltip may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. from april2004 through january2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the ltip, and no more than 64million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient. for the major types of awards outstanding as of december31, 2010,
the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance units and 10years for the stock
options and stock appreciation rights.
texaco stock incentive plan (texaco sip) on the closing of the acquisition of texaco in october
2001, outstanding options granted under the texaco sip were converted to chevron options. these
options, which have 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. this provision enables a participant who exercises a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares
exchanged or withheld. the restored
options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price is the
market value of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. beginning in 2007,
restored options were issued under the ltip. no further awards may be granted under the former
texaco plans.
unocal share-based plans (unocal plans) when chevron acquired unocal in august2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various unocal plans were exchanged for
fully vested chevron options and appreciation rights. these awards retained the same provisions as
the original unocal plans. unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to
expire through early 2015.

the total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market
price) of options exercised during 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $259, $91 and $433, respectively. during
this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these
awards.
as of
december31, 2010, there was $242 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans. that
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7years.
at
january1, 2010, the number of ltip performance units outstanding was equivalent to
2,679,108 shares. during 2010, 1,104,000 units were granted, 881,759 units vested
with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 173,475 units were forfeited. at december31,
2010, units outstanding were 2,727,874, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these
instruments was $266. in addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other
awards that were
granted under various ltip and former texaco and unocal programs totaled approximately
1.6million
equivalent shares as of december31, 2010. a liability of $40 was recorded for these awards.
in
march2009, chevron granted all eligible ltip employees restricted stock units in lieu of
an annual cash bonus. a total of 453,965 units were granted at $69.70 per unit at the time of the
grant. the expense associated with these special restricted stock units was recognized in 2009. all
of the special restricted stock units were distributed in november2010.
note 21
employee benefit plans
the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically prefunds
defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding
provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified plans are subject to the employee
retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the company does not typically fund
u.s. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and
regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment
returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives.
the company also sponsors other postretirement (opeb)plans that provide medical and dental
benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans are
unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. medical coverage for medicare-eligible
retirees in the companys main u.s. medical plan is secondary to medicare (including partd) and
the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4
percent each year. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
under accounting standards for postretirement benefits (asc 715),
the company recognizes the
overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset
or liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
the
funded status of the companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans for 2010 and
2009 is on the following page:

net actuarial losses
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31,
2010, for the companys u.s. pension, international pension and opeb plans are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over approximately 10, 12 and 10years,
respectively. these amortization
periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits
under the plans. these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10percent of the higher of
the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. the amount subject to
amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. during 2011, the company estimates actuarial
losses of $314, $114 and $64 will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s.
pension, international pension and opeb plans, respec-
tively. in addition, the company
estimates an additional $250 will be recognized from accumulated
other comprehensive loss during 2011 related to lump-sum settlement costs from u.s.
pension plans.
the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits)recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31, 2010, was approximately seven and 11
years for u.s. and international pension plans, respectively, and 12years for other postretirement
benefit plans. during 2011, the company estimates prior service
(credits) costs of $(8), $27 and
$(72) will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international
pension and opeb plans, respectively.

expected return on plan assets the companys estimated long-term rates of return on
pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of
expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific
asset-class risk factors. asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan
asset/liability studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with
these studies.
there have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for u.s. plans, which account for 70percent of the companys pension plan assets. at december31,
2010, the estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.8percent.
the market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end
measurement date, as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting
rules. management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-today market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year.
for other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2010, the company selected a 4.8
percent discount rate for the u.s. pension plan and 5.0percent for the u.s. postretirement benefit
plan. this rate was based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the citigroup pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2010. the discount rates at the end of
2009 were 5.3percent and 5.8percent for the u.s. pension plan and the u.s. opeb plan,
respectively. the discount rate at the end of
2008 was 6.3percent for both the u.s. pension plan and the u.s. opeb plan.
other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
december31, 2010, for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care
cost-trend rates start with 8percent in 2011 and gradually decline to 5percent for 2018 and
beyond. for this measurement at december31, 2009, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started
with 7percent in 2010 and gradually declined to 5percent for 2018 and beyond. in both
measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4percent.
assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. the impact is mitigated by the 4percent cap on the companys medical
contributions for the primary u.s. plan. a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

plan assets and investment strategy the accounting standards for defined benefit pension and
opeb plans (asc 715) provide users of financial statements with an understanding of: how investment
allocation decisions are made; the major classes of plan assets; the inputs and valuation
techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; the effect of fair value measurements
using unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period; and significant concentrations
of risk within plan assets.
the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided
into three levels:
fs-55
table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note
21 employee benefit plans - continued
level 1: fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices
for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability
to access.
level 2: fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in
active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. if the
asset has a contractual term, the level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of
the asset. the fair values for level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker
quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges.
level 3: inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. valuation may
be performed using a financial model with estimated inputs entered into the model.

u.s. equities include investments in the companys common stock in the amount of
$38 at december31, 2010 and $29 at december31, 2009.
collective trusts/mutual funds for u.s. plans are entirely index funds; for
international plans, they are mostly index funds. for these index funds, the level 2
designation is partially based on the restriction that advance notification of redemptions,
typically two business days, is required.
mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income
instruments in order to diversify and lower risk.
the year-end valuations of the u.s. real estate assets are based on internal
appraisals by the real estate managers, which are updates of third-party appraisals that occur
at least once a year for each property in the portfolio.
the other asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet
settled (level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (level 2); insurance
contracts and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (level 3).
certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to their 2010 presentation.

the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest
rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate
potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for
benefit payments and portfolio management.
the companys u.s. and u.k. pension plans comprise 86percent of the total pension assets.
both the u.s. and u.k. plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to
review the asset holdings and their returns. to assess the plans investment performance, long-term
asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
for the primary u.s. pension plan, the chevron board of directors has established the
following approved asset allocation ranges: equities 40-70percent, fixed income and cash 20-65
percent, real estate 0-15percent, and other 0-5percent. for the u.k. pension plan, the u.k. board
of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed
regularly: equities 60-80percent and fixed income and cash 20-40percent. the other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that
vary by plan. actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current
economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. there are no
significant concentrations of risk in plan assets due to the diversification of investment classes.
the company does not prefund its opeb obligations.
cash contributions and benefit payments in 2010, the company contributed $1,192 and $258 to its
u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. in 2011, the company expects contributions to
be approximately $650 and $300 to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $225 in 2011,
as compared with $183 paid in 2010.
the following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be
paid by the company in the next 10years:

employee savings investment plan eligible employees of chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the chevron employee savings investment plan (esip).
charges to expense for the esip represent the companys contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop), which is
described in the section that follows. total company matching contributions to employee accounts
within the esip were $253, $257, and $231 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. this cost was
reduced by the value of shares released from the lesop totaling $97, $184 and $40 in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively. the remaining amounts, totaling $156, $73 and $191 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, represent open market purchases.
employee stock ownership plan within the chevron esip is an employee stock ownership plan (esop).
in 1989, chevron established a lesop as a constituent part of the esop. the lesop provides partial
prefunding of the companys future commitments to the esip.
as permitted by accounting standards for share-based compensation (asc 718), the debt of the
lesop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of equity.
the company reports compensation expense equal to lesop debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the lesop for debt service. interest accrued on lesop debt is
recorded as interest expense. dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. all lesop shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.
total credits to expense for the lesop were $1, $3 and $1 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. the net credit for the respective years was composed of credits to compensation
expense of $6, $15 and $15 and charges to interest expense for lesop debt of $5, $12 and $14.
of the dividends paid on the lesop shares, $46, $110 and $35 were used in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, to service lesop debt. no contributions were required in 2010, 2009 or 2008, as
dividends received by the lesop were sufficient to satisfy lesop debt service.
shares held in the lesop are released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants
based on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of
current-year and remaining debt service. lesop shares as of december31, 2010 and 2009, were as

benefit plan trusts prior to its acquisition by chevron, texaco established a benefit plan
trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. at year-end 2010, the trust
contained 14.2million shares of chevron treasury stock. the trust will sell the shares or use the
dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such
benefits. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the
trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the
shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until
distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
prior to its acquisition by chevron, unocal established various grantor trusts to fund
obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental
retirement plans. at december31, 2010 and 2009, trust assets of $57 were invested primarily in
interest-earning accounts.
employee incentive plans the chevron incentive plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible
employees that links awards to corporate, unit and individual performance in the prior year.
charges to expense for cash bonuses were $766, $561 and $757 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
chevron also has the ltip for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its
subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. awards under the ltip consist of
stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in note 20, on page fs-51.
note 22
equity
retained earnings at december31, 2010 and 2009, included approximately $9,159 and $8,122,

the 160million shares that were reserved for issuance under the chevron corporation long-term
incentive plan (ltip).

corporation non-employee directors equity compensation and deferral plan.
note 23
restructuring and reorganization
in the first quarter 2010, the company announced employee reduction programs related to the
restructuring and reorganization of its downstream businesses and corporate staffs. the initial
estimate included approximately 3,200 employees in downstream and 600 employees from corporate
staffs that were expected to be terminated under the programs. due to redeployment efforts within
the company, total employee terminations under the programs are expected to be reduced from
approximately 3,800 employees to approximately 3,200 employees. about 1,500 of the affected
employees are located in the united states. about 1,500 employees have been terminated to date, and
the programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2011.
a before-tax charge of $244 ($175 after tax) was recorded in first quarter 2010, with $191
reported as operating expenses and $53 as selling, general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of income. due to the reduction in terminations resulting from reassignments
within the company, an adjustment to total charges was made in fourth quarter 2010, which
effectively reduced the total before-tax charge from $244 to $234 ($167 after tax). the accrued
liability is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet. approximately $71 ($45 after
tax) is associated with terminations in u.s. downstream, $119 ($92 after tax) in international
downstream and $44 ($30 after tax) in all other.
during the last nine months of 2010, the company made payments of $96 associated with these
liabilities. the majority of the payments were in downstream.

taxes the company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. refer to note 15, beginning on page fs-47, for a discussion of the periods for which
tax returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all
tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the company does not
expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
guarantees the companys guarantee of approximately $600 is associated with certain payments under
a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. the terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and
motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. the company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300. through the end of 2010, the company paid $48 under these
indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification payments in the
future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the

that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to december2001. claims
had to be asserted by february2009 for equilon indemnities and must be asserted no later than
february2012 for motiva indemnities. under the terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum
limit on the amount of potential future payments. the company posts no assets as collateral and has
made no payments under the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or
motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. the acquirer of those
assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which
had been reached at december31, 2009. under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200
obligation, chevron is solely responsible until april2022, when the indemnification expires. the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
the sale of the assets in 1997.
although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable
and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect
to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements
typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs,
utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys
business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments
are: 2011  $17,200; 2012  $4,100; 2013  $3,500;
2014  $3,100; 2015  $3,000; 2016 and after
$7,700. a portion of these commitments may
ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under the agreements were approximately
$6,500 in 2010, $8,100 in 2009 and $5,100 in 2008.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private
claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements
or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects
on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the
company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.
chevrons environmental reserve as of december31, 2010, was $1,507. included in this balance
were remediation activities at approximately 182 sites for which the company had been identified as
a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental
protection agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund
law or analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2010 was
$185. the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability
for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require
chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites

of the remaining year-end 2010 environmental reserves balance of $1,322, $814 related to the
companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations
(i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. the remaining $508 was
associated with various sites in international downstream ($100), upstream ($329) and other
businesses ($79). liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2010 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
refer to note 25 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations.
equity redetermination for crude oil and natural gas producing operations, ownership agreements may
provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas
reserves. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be
material to earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum
reserve at elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were
owned by the u.s. department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount
for the four zones. for this range of settlement, chevron estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed
to chevron is estimated at about $150. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount within
this range of estimates are uncertain.
other contingencies on april26, 2010, a california appeals court issued a ruling related to the
adequacy of an environmental impact report (eir)supporting the issuance of certain permits by the
city of richmond, california, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at chevrons refinery in
richmond. settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and
the company continues to evaluate its options going forward, which may include requesting the city
to revise the eir to address the issues identified by the court of appeal or other actions.
management believes the outcomes associated with the potential options for the project are
uncertain. due to the uncertainty of the companys future course of action, or potential outcomes
of any action or combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial
effects, if any, of the ruling can be made at this time. however, the companys ultimate exposure
may be significant to net income in any one future period.
chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; u.s. federal,
state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. the amounts
of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to
resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.

asset retirement obligations
in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (asc 410), the
company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (aro)when there
is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement
activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of
settlement that may be beyond the companys control. this uncertainty about the timing and/or
method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information
exists to reasonably estimate fair value. recognition of the aro includes: (1)the present value of
a liability and offsetting asset, (2)the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation
of the asset, and (3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates.
accounting standards for asset retirement obligations primarily affect the companys
accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing assets. no significant aros associated with any
legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate
settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated
aro. the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in
facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2010, 2009 and 2008:

invested in chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company and the companys
share of stock transactions of affiliates, which, under
the applicable accounting rules, may be recorded directly to the companys retained earnings
instead of net income. diluted eps includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive
effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the companys stock option programs (refer to

table v reserve quantity information
reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification
system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers, the
world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists. the system
classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting  three deemed commercial and three noncommercial. within the commercial classification
are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. the noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all sec and company standards.
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known
reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. net
proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual
arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. proved developed reserves
are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of
reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and
engineers. as part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the com-
pany maintains a reserves advisory committee (rac)that is chaired by the corporate reserves
manager, who is a member of a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman
responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and production activities. the corporate
reserves manager, who acts as chairman of the rac, has more than 30years experience working in the
oil and gas industry and a master of science in petroleum engineering degree from stanford
university. his experience includes 15years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. he is the
acting chairman of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee, currently
serves on the united nations expert group on resources classification and is an active member of
the society of petroleum evaluation engineers. he is also a past member of the joint committee on
reserves evaluator training and the california conservation committee.
all rac members are degreed professionals, each with more than 15years experience in various
aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth
science, or accounting policy and financial reporting. the members are knowledgeable in sec
guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of
reserves estimates. the rac manages its activities through two operating company-level reserves
managers. these two reserves managers are not members of the rac so as to preserve the
corporate-level independence.
the rac has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used
within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the
business units recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are
recognized in accordance with sec guidelines; determine that

reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and
technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which provides standardized procedures used
corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
during the year, the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream
business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. major
changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee, whose members
include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. the companys annual reserve
activity is also reviewed with the board of directors. if major changes to reserves were to occur
between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the board.
rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have the
largest proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve
records and documentation of their compliance with the corporate reserves manual.
revised oil and gas reporting in december2008, the sec issued its final rule, modernization
of oil and gas
reporting. the disclosure requirements under the final rule became effective for the company with
its form 10-k filing for the year ending december31, 2009. the final rule changed a number of oil
and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements under sec regulations s-k and s-x.
subsequently, the fasb updated extractive industries  oil and gas (topic 932) to align the oil
and gas reserves estimation and disclosure requirements with the secs final rule. the new
disclosure requirements have been applied to data reported for 2009 and 2010.
proved undeveloped reserve quantities at the end of 2010, proved undeveloped
reserves for consolidated companies totaled 2.6billion barrels
of oil-equivalent (boe). approximately 63percent of these
reserves are attributed to natural gas, of which about half were located in australia. crude oil,
condensate and natural gas liquids (ngls) accounted for about 32percent of the total, with the
largest concentration of these reserves in africa, asia and the united states. synthetic oil
accounted for the balance of the proved undeveloped reserves and was located in canada in the other
americas region.
fs-72
table of contents
table v
reserve quantity information - continued
proved
undeveloped reserves of equity affiliates amounted to
1.3billion boe. at year-end, crude oil, condensate and ngls
represented 59percent of these reserves, with tco accounting for
the majority of this amount. natural gas represented 25percent of the total, with approximately 45
percent of those reserves from tco. the balance is attributed to synthetic oil in venezuela in the
other region.
in
2010, a total of 447million boe was transferred from proved
undeveloped to proved developed for consolidated companies. in other
americas, 171million boe
were transferred, primarily due to startup of a synthetic crude expansion project in canada. in the
africa region, 135million boe were transferred to proved developed as a result of development
drilling in nigeria and angola and the start-up of a natural gas processing plant in nigeria.
transfers in asia and the united states accounted for most of the remainder. proved undeveloped
reserves for affiliated companies declined slightly, with 13million boe
transferred to proved developed.
there were no material downward revisions of proved undeveloped reserves for consolidated or
affiliated companies.
investment to convert proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves during 2010, investments
totaling approximately $8.3billion were made by consolidated companies and equity affiliates to
advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. in australia, $2.6billion was expended,
which was primarily driven by construction activities at the gorgon lng project. in the africa
region, $2.1billion was expended on various projects, including offshore development projects in
nigeria and angola. in nigeria, construction progressed on a deepwater project and development
activities continued at a natural gas processing plant. in angola, offshore development drilling
was progressed along with several gas injection projects. in the united states, expenditures
totaled $1.1billion for three offshore development projects in the gulf of mexico and various
smaller development projects. in the asia region, expenditures during the year totaled $0.9
billion, which included construction of a gas processing facility in thailand, a gas development
project in china and the completion of a steam-flood project in indonesia. in other americas,
development expenditures totaled $0.8billion for a variety of projects, including a synthetic
crude project in canada. in europe, $0.1billion was expended on various development projects.
affiliated companies expended $0.7billion, primarily on an lng project in angola.
proved undeveloped reserves for five years or more
reserves that remain classified as proved
undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several physical factors that affect optimal
project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse
and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate
project timing, compression projects that are
pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.
at year-end 2010, the company held approximately 1.7billion boe of proved undeveloped
reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. the reserves are held by
consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the
company has a proven track record of developing major projects.
in africa, approximately 330million boe is related to deepwater and natural gas
developments in nigeria and angola. major nigerian deepwater development projects include agbami,
which started production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full
utilization of infrastructure capacity, and the usan development, which is under construction and
is expected to enter production in 2012. also in nigeria, various fields and infrastructure
associated with the escravos gas projects are currently under development. in angola, the
tombua-landana deepwater project became operational in 2009. ongoing development drilling is
expected to bring this field to maximum production in 2011.
in asia, approximately 230million boe are related to continued development of the pattani
field in the gulf of thailand and contractual constraints at the malampaya field (philippines). the
timing of compression installation aligns with natural field declines and/or to meet contractual
requirements. ongoing development is scheduled to maintain production within the infrastructure
constraints.
in australia, approximately 130million boe remain undeveloped over five years due to
future compression projects at the north west shelf venture, scheduled for 2013.
in the united states, approximately 70million boe remain proved undeveloped, primarily
related to a steamflood expansion.
affiliated companies hold approximately 940million boe of proved undeveloped reserves
held for five years or more. the tco affiliate in kazakhstan accounts for approximately
800million boe. field production is constrained by plant capacity limitations. further field
development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with
reservoir depletion.
in venezuela, the affiliate that operates the hamaca fields synthetic heavy oil upgrading
operation accounts for about 140million boe of proved undeveloped reserves held over five
years. development drilling continues at hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity.
annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances,
such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a
revision to reserve estimates. for 2010, this assessment did not result in any material changes in
reserves classified as proved undeveloped. over the past three years, the ratio of proved
undeveloped reserves to total proved
fs-73
table of contents
table v
reserve quantity information - continued
reserves has ranged between 35percent and 39percent. the consistent completion of major capital
projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period.
proved reserve quantities
at december31, 2010, proved reserves for the companys
consolidated operations were 7.7billion boe. (refer to the term reserves on page e-26 for
the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) approximately 22percent of the total reserves were
located in the united states. for the companys interests in equity affiliates,
proved reserves were 2.8billion boe, 79percent of which were associated with the companys 50
percent ownership in tco.
aside from the tengiz field in the tco affiliate, no single property accounted for more than 5
percent of the companys total oil-equivalent proved reserves. about 25 other individual
properties in the companys portfolio of assets each contained between 1percent and 5percent of
the companys oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for 49percent of
the companys total  oil-equivalent proved reserves. these properties were geographically dispersed, located in
the united states, canada, south america, west africa, asia, and australia.
in
the united states, total proved reserves at year-end 2010 were
1.7billion boe.
california properties accounted for 43percent of the u.s. reserves, with most classified as heavy
oil. because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need
to employ enhanced recovery methods, the producing operations are capital intensive in
nature. most of the companys heavy-oil fields in california employ a continuous steamflooding
process. the gulf of mexico region contains 21percent of the u.s. reserves, with liquids
representing about 15percent of reserves. production operations are mostly offshore and, as a
result, are also capital intensive. other u.s. areas represent the remaining 36percent of u.s.
reserves, which are about evenly split between liquids and natural gas. for production of crude
oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including waterflood and co2
injection.
for the three years ending december31, 2010, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. apart from acquisitions, the
companys ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and
circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, declines in oil and gas prices, opec constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest.
the companys estimated net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and
synthetic oil, and changes thereto for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 are shown in the
table on the following page. the companys estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page fs-77.

reserve quantities are 24percent, 26percent and 32percent for
consolidated companies for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved reserve changes for 2008 through
2010 are discussed below:
revisions in 2008, net revisions increased reserves by 536million barrels for
worldwide consolidated companies and increased reserves by 267million barrels for equity
affiliates. for consolidated companies, the largest increase was in the asia region, which added
574million barrels. the majority of the increase was in the partitioned zone, as a result of a
concession extension, and indonesia. in indonesia, reserves increased due mainly to the impact of
lower year-end prices on the reserve calculations for production-sharing contracts, as well as a
result of development drilling and improved waterflood and steamflood performance. upward revisions
were also recorded in kazakhstan and azerbaijan and were mainly associated with the effect of lower
year-end prices on the calculation of reserves associated with  production-sharing and
variable-royalty contracts. these increases were offset by downward revisions in europe and the
united states. for affiliated companies, the 249million-barrel increase for tco was due to the
effect of lower year-end prices on the royalty
determination and the effect of facility optimization at the tengiz and korolev fields.
in 2009, net revisions increased reserves by 355million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and decreased reserves by 187million barrels for equity affiliates. for consolidated
companies, the largest increase was 460million barrels in the other americas region due to the
inclusion of synthetic oil related to canadian oil sands. in the united states, reserves increased
63million barrels as a result of development drilling and performance revisions. the increases
were partially offset by decreases of 121million barrels in asia and 46million barrels in africa.
in asia, decreases in indonesia and azerbaijan were driven by the effect of higher 12-month average
prices on the calculation of reserves associated with production-sharing contracts and the effect
of reservoir performance revisions. in africa, reserves in nigeria declined as a result of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts as well as reservoir performance.
for affiliated companies, tco declined by 184million barrels primarily due to the effect of
higher 12-month average
fs-75

prices on royalty determination. for other affiliated companies, 266million barrels of heavy crude
oil were reclassified to synthetic oil for the activities in venezuela.
in 2010, net revisions increased reserves 103million barrels for consolidated companies and
decreased reserves 21million barrels for affiliated companies. for consolidated companies,
improved reservoir performance and recovery factors accounted for a majority of the 63million
barrel increase in the united states. increases in the other regions were partially offset by the
asia region, which decreased as a result of the effect of higher prices on  production-sharing
contracts in kazakhstan. for affiliated companies, the price effect on royalty determination at tco
decreased reserves by 33million barrels. this was partially offset by improved reservoir
performance and development drilling in venezuela.
improved recovery in 2008, improved recovery increased worldwide liquids volumes by
37million barrels. for consolidated companies, the largest addition was in the asia region related
to gas reinjection in kazakhstan. affiliated companies increased reserves 10million barrels due to
improved secondary recovery at boscan.
in 2009, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 86million barrels worldwide.
consolidated companies accounted for 50million barrels. the largest addition was related to
improved secondary recovery in nigeria. affiliated companies increased reserves 36million barrels
due to improvements related to the tco sour gas injection/second generation plant (sgi/sgp)
facilities.
in 2010, improved recovery increased volumes by 77million barrels worldwide. for consolidated
companies, reserves in africa increased 58million barrels due primarily to secondary recovery
performance in nigeria. reserves in the united states increased 11million, primarily in california. affiliated companies increased reserves 3million
barrels.
extensions and discoveries in 2008, extensions and discoveries increased
consolidated company reserves 33million barrels worldwide. the united states increased reserves 17
million barrels, primarily in the gulf of mexico. the africa, asia, and other americas regions
increased reserves 16million barrels with no one country resulting in additions greater than 5
million barrels.
in 2009, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 52million barrels worldwide.
the largest additions were 20million barrels in the australia region related to the gorgon project
and 13million barrels in the other americas region related to delineation drilling in argentina.
africa and the united states accounted for 10million barrels and 6million barrels, respectively.
in 2010, extensions and discoveries increased consolidated companies reserves 63million
barrels worldwide. the united states and other americas each increased reserves 19million barrels,
and asia increased reserves 16million barrels. no single area in the united states was
individually significant. drilling activity in argentina and brazil accounted for the majority of
the increase in other americas. in asia, the increase was primarily related to activity in
azerbaijan.

includes reserves disposed of through nonmonetary transactions.
total as sold volumes are 4.5 bcf, 4.5 bcf and 4.6 bcf for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
includes reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (psc) (refer to page e-25 for the definition of a psc). psc-related reserve quantities are 29percent, 31percent and 40percent for consolidated companies for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas  proved-reserve changes for 2008
through 2010 are discussed below:
revisions in 2008, net revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by
1,166 bcf and increased reserves for affiliated companies by 1,130 bcf. in the asia region,
positive revisions totaled 1,073 bcf for consolidated companies. almost half of the increase was
attributed to the karachaganak field in kazakhstan, due mainly to the effects of low year-end
prices on the production-sharing contract and the results of development drilling and improved
recovery. other large upward revisions were recorded for the pattani field in thailand due to a
successful drilling campaign. in the other americas region, improved field performance and new
contracts in colombia, and trinidad and tobago, respectively, accounted for most of the 154 bcf
increase.
for the tco affiliate in kazakhstan, an increase of 498 bcf reflected the impacts of lower
year-end prices on royalty determination and facility optimization. reserves associated with the
angola lng project accounted for a majority of the 632 bcf increase in other affiliated companies.
in 2009, net revisions increased reserves 569 bcf for consolidated companies and decreased
reserves 44 bcf for affiliated companies. for consolidated companies, net increases were 493 bcf in
asia, primarily as a result of reservoir studies in bangladesh and development drilling in
thailand. these results were partially offset by a downward revision due to the impact of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts in myanmar. in the australia region, the 166 bcf increase in
reserves resulted from improved reservoir performance and compression. in the other americas
region, reserves decreased 126 bcf, driven primarily by the effect of higher prices on
production-sharing contracts in trinidad and tobago. in the united states, a net increase of 39 bcf
was the result of development drilling in the gulf of mexico, partially offset by performance
revisions in the california and  mid-continent areas.
for equity affiliates, a downward revision of 237 bcf at tco was due to the effect of higher
prices on royalty determination and an increase in gas injection for sgi/sgp facilities. this
decline was partially offset by performance and drilling opportunities related to the angola lng
project.

reserve quantity information - continued
in 2010, net revisions increased reserves by 197 bcf for consolidated companies, which was
more than offset by a 268 bcf decrease in net revisions for affiliated companies. for consolidated
companies, a net increase in the united states of 220 bcf, primarily in the mid-continent area and
the gulf of mexico, was the result of a number of small upward revisions related to improved
reservoir performance and drilling activity, none of which were individually significant. the
increase was partially offset by downward revisions due to the impact of higher prices on
production-sharing contracts in the asia region. for equity affiliates, a downward revision of 324
bcf at tco was due to the price effect on royalty determination and a change in the
variable-royalty calculation. this decline was partially offset by the recognition of additional
reserves related to the angola lng project.
extensions and discoveries in 2009, worldwide extensions and discoveries of 4,387
bcf were attributed to consolidated companies. in australia, the gorgon project accounted for all
of the 4,276 bcf additions. in asia, development drilling in thailand accounted for the majority of
the increase. in the united states, delineation drilling in california accounted for the majority
of the increase.
sales in 2009, worldwide sales of 117 bcf were related to consolidated companies.
for the other americas region, the sale of properties in argentina accounted for 84 bcf. the sale
of properties in the gulf of mexico accounted for the majority of the 33 bcf decrease in the united
states.

standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows related to proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil
and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the fasb. estimated future
cash inflows from production are computed by applying 12-month average prices for oil and gas to
year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are limited to those
provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. future
development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and
produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of
year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations.
estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates.
these rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax
net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. discounted future net cash flows are
calculated using 10percent midperiod discount factors. discounting requires
a year-by-year estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be
produced.
the information provided does not represent managements estimate of the companys expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. estimates of proved-reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. the
valuation prescribed by the fasb requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future
development and production costs. the calculations are made as of december31 each year and should
not be relied upon as an indication of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil and gas
reserves. in the following table, standardized measure net cash flows refers to the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows.
