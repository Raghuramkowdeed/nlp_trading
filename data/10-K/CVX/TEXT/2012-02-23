cautionary
statement relevant to forward-looking information
for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the
private securities litigation reform act of 1995
this annual report on
form10-k
of chevron corporation contains forward-looking statements
relating to chevrons operations that are based on
managements current expectations, estimates and
projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
energy-related industries. words such as
anticipates, expects,
intends, plans, targets,
projects, believes, seeks,
schedules, estimates,
budgets and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. these statements are
not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
the companys control and are difficult to predict.
therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
statements. the reader should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. unless legally required, chevron undertakes no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.
among the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements
are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices; changing
refining, marketing and chemical margins; actions of competitors
or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude
oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or
product substitutes; technological developments; the results of
operations and financial condition of equity affiliates; the
inability or failure of the companys joint-venture
partners to fund their share of operations and development
activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net
production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas
development projects; potential delays in the development,
construction or
start-up of
planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of
the companys net production or manufacturing facilities or
delivery/transportation networks due to war, accidents,
political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude oil
production quotas that might be imposed by the organization of
petroleum exporting countries; the potential liability for
remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment
or product changes under existing or future environmental
statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability
resulting from other pending or future litigation; the
companys future acquisition or disposition of assets and
gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments;
government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations,
industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions
on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements
compared with the u.s.dollar; the effects of changed
accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles
promulgated by
rule-setting
bodies; and the factors set forth under the heading risk
factors on pages 29 through 31 in this report. in
addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and
international economic and political conditions. other
unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report
could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking
statements.

summary
description of chevron
chevron
corporation,*
a delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
management and technology support to u.s.and international
subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
generation and energy services. upstream operations consist
primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil
and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and
regasification associated with liquefied natural gas;
transporting crude oil by major international oil export
pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas;
and a
gas-to-liquids
project. downstream operations consist primarily of refining
crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and
refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by
pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and
manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals,
plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.
a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pages e-4
and e-5. as
of december31, 2011, chevron had approximately
61,000employees (including about 3,800 service station
employees). approximately 30,000employees (including about
3,500 service station employees), or 49percent, were
employed in u.s.operations.
overview
of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors. prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum
products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply
and demand. the members of the organization of petroleum
exporting countries (opec) are typically the worlds swing
producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major
factor in determining worldwide supply. demand for crude oil and
its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the
conditions of local, national and global economies, although
weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources
also play a significant part. laws and governmental policies,
particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the
environment affect where and how companies conduct their
operations and formulate their products and, in some cases,
limit their profits directly.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron
competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum
companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor
required to develop and operate those properties. in its
downstream business, chevron also competes with fully
integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent
refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and
national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of
various goods or services in many national and international
markets.

description
of business and properties
the upstream and downstream activities of the company and its
equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with
operations in north america, south america, europe, africa, asia
and australia. tabulations of segment sales and other operating
revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending
december31, 2011, and assets as of the end of 2011 and
2010 for the united states and the companys
international geographic areas are in note11
to the consolidated financial statements beginning on
pagefs-37.
similar comparative data for the companys investments in
and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
equipment are in notes12 and 13 on pages fs-39 through
fs-41.
capital
and exploratory expenditures
total expenditures for 2011 were $29.1billion, including
$1.7billion for the companys share of
equity-affiliate expenditures. in 2010 and 2009, expenditures
were $21.8billion and $22.2billion, respectively,
including the companys share of affiliates
expenditures of $1.4billion in 2010 and $1.6billion
in 2009.
of the $29.1billion in expenditures for 2011,
89percent, or $25.9billion, was related to upstream
activities. approximately 87 and 80percent was expended
for upstream operations in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
international upstream accounted for about 68percent of
the worldwide upstream investment in 2011, about 82percent
in 2010 and about 80percent in 2009. these amounts exclude
the acquisition of atlas energy, inc. in 2011. refer to a
discussion of the acquisition of atlas energy, inc., in
note2 to the consolidated financial statements on
pagefs-30.
in 2012, the company estimates capital and exploratory
expenditures will be $32.7billion, including
$3billion of spending by affiliates. approximately
87percent of the total, or $28.5billion, is budgeted
for exploration and production activities, with
$22.3billion, or about 78percent, of this amount for
projects outside the united states.
refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and
exploratory expenditures on pages fs-11 through fs-12.
upstream
the table on the following page summarizes the net production of
liquids and natural gas for 2011 and 2010 by the company and its
affiliates. worldwide oil-equivalent production was
2.673million barrels per day, down about three percent
from 2010. the decrease was mainly associated with normal field
declines, maintenance-related downtime and the impact of higher
prices on entitlement volumes. the
start-up and
ramp-up of
several major capital projects the perdido project
in the u.s.gulf of mexico, the expansion at the athabasca
oil sands project in canada, the frade field in brazil, and the
platongii natural gas project in thailand as
well as acquisitions in the marcellus shale, partially offset
the decrease in net production from 2010. refer to the
results of operations section beginning on
pagefs-6
for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
2009 2011 changes in production for crude oil and
natural gas liquids, and natural gas.
the company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent
production in 2012 will be approximately 2.680million
barrels per day based on the average brent price of $111 per
barrel in 2011. this estimate is subject to many factors and
uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec,
price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or
restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in
project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in
various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production,
civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of
maintenance turnarounds,
greater-than-expected
declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions
to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also
affected by the size and number of economic investment
opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag
between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production
activities in key areas, beginning on page8, for a
discussion of the companys major crude oil and natural gas
development projects.

delivery
commitments
the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
operations under a variety of contractual obligations. most
contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
quantities, as discussed below.
in the united states, the company is contractually committed to
deliver to third parties 232billion cubic feet of natural
gas through 2014. the company believes it can satisfy these
contracts through a combination of equity production from the
companys proved developed u.s.reserves and
third-party purchases. these contracts include a variety of
pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts.
outside the united states, the company is contractually
committed to deliver a total of 891billion cubic feet of
natural gas from 2012 through 2014 from operations in australia,
colombia, denmark and the philippines to third parties. the
sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
delivery. the company believes it can satisfy these contracts
from quantities available from production of the companys
proved developed reserves in these countries.

the discussion that follows references the status of proved
reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
on production and for projects recently placed on production.
reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent
discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage or for
mature areas of production that do not have individual projects
requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory
investment. amounts indicated for project costs represent total
project costs, not the companys share of costs for
projects that are less than wholly owned.
chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the
worlds major hydrocarbon basins. the companys
upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new

mining
chevrons
u.s.-based
mining company continues its efforts to divest its remaining
coal mining operations. the company completed the sale of the
north river mine and other coal-related assets in alabama in
second quarter 2011, and the sale of its kemmerer, wyoming,
surface coal mine in first quarter 2012. the company is pursuing
the sale of its 50percent interest in youngs creek mining
company, llc, which was formed to develop a coal mine in
northern wyoming. activities related to final reclamation
continued in 2011 at the company-operated surface coal mine in
mckinley, newmexico, which ceased coal production at the
end of 2009.
at year-end 2011, chevron had 153million tons of proven
and probable coal reserves in the united states, including
reserves of low-sulfur coal. coal sales from wholly owned mines
in 2011 were 6million tons, down about 2million tons
from 2010.
table of contents
in addition to the coal operations, chevron owns and operates
the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico. at year-end 2011,
chevron had 53million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves
at questa. production and underground development at questa
continued at reduced levels in 2011 in response to weak prices
for molybdenum.

research
and technology
the companys energy technology organization supports
chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by providing
technology, services and competency development in earth
sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and
completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process
technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health,
environment and safety disciplines. the information technology
organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data
management, security and network technology to provide a
standardized digital infrastructure and enable chevrons
global operations and business processes.
chevron technology ventures (ctv) manages investments and
projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
into chevrons core businesses. as of the end of 2011, ctv
continued to explore technologies such as next-generation
biofuels and advanced solar. in 2011, the company completed
construction and commissioned the worlds largest
solar-to-steam generation project for use in
enhanced-oil-recovery operations in coalinga, california. the
project will test the viability of using solar power to produce
steam to improve oil recovery.
chevrons research and development expenses were
$627million, $526million and $603million for
the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are
not certain.
environmental
protection
the company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to
avoid potential spills or leaks and minimize the impact of those
that may occur. chevron requires its facilities and operations
to have operating standards and processes and emergency response
plans that address all credible and significant risks identified
by site-specific risk and impact assessments. chevron also
requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these
plans. in the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs,
chevron also maintains a worldwide emergency response team
comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of
emergency response, including post-incident remediation.
table of contents
to complement the companys capabilities, chevron maintains
active membership in international oil spill response
cooperatives, including the marine spill response corporation,
which operates in u.s.territorial waters, and oil spill
response, ltd. (osrl), which operates globally. the company is a
founding member of the marine well containment company, whose
primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment
and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely
event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the
gulf of mexico. in addition, the company is a member of the
subsea well response project (swrp). swrps objective is to
further develop the industrys capability to contain and
shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of
the world. in late 2011, upon detection of ocean floor oil seeps
in the deepwater frade field in brazil, chevron rapidly deployed
capabilities and processes in coordination with osrl. in early
2012, the company rapidly deployed response capabilities to
address a natural gas well control incident in nigeria.
virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are
subject to various u.s.federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
similar laws and regulations in other countries. these
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
regulations pertaining to the companys operations are, or
are expected to become, embedded in the normal costs of
conducting business.
in 2011, the companys u.s.capitalized environmental
expenditures were $345million, representing about
3percent of the companys total consolidated
u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures. these
environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
existing facilities as well as those associated with new
facilities. the expenditures relate mostly to air- and
water-quality projects and activities at the companys
refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
facilities. for 2012, the company estimates u.s.capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
approximately $410million. the future annual capital costs
are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
future changes to regulatory requirements.
regulations intended to protect the environment, including those
intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and
global climate change, continue to evolve. legislation,
regulations and market-based programs that could affect the
companys operations exist at the international or
multinational (such as the kyoto protocol and the european
unions emissions trading system), national (such as the
u.s.environmental protection agencys rules for
stricter emission standards and increased renewable fuel content
for transportation fuels), and regional (such as
californias global warming solutions act) levels.

item1a.
risk
factors
chevron is a global energy company with a diversified business
portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating
sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and
exploratory expenditures. nevertheless, some inherent risks
could materially impact the companys financial results of
operations or financial condition.
chevron
is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
prices.
chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the
companys results of operations is the price of crude oil,
which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry
inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization
of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage
and disruptions, competing fuel prices and geopolitical risk.
chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of
its business planning process. as such, an investment in the
company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in crude
oil prices.
table of contents
during extended periods of historically low prices for crude
oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and
exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected.
upstream assets may also become impaired. the impact on
downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for
refined products and the associated margins on refined product
sales.
the
scope of chevrons business will decline if the company
does not successfully develop resources.
the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron
is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
produces with good prospects for future production or through
acquisitions, the companys business will decline. creating
and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many
factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore,
develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to
bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion
on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable
operation of mature properties.
the
companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human
factors.
chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
inhospitable regions. the companys operations and
facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes beyond its control, including
hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil
unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system
failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could
result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the
natural environment.
the
companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that
require significant and continuous oversight.
chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and
mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the
crude oil and natural gas industry. the company seeks to
minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and
building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe
and reliable manner. however, failure to manage these risks
effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including
releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in
personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of
revenues, legal liability
and/or
disruption to operations. chevron has implemented and maintains
a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance
mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability
and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws
and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected
incidents. nonetheless, in certain situations where chevron is
not the operator, the company may have limited influence and
control over third parties, which may limit its ability to
manage and control such risks.
chevrons
business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation
or government action.
the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its
business. chevron operations also produce byproducts, which may
be considered pollutants. often these operations are conducted
through joint ventures over which the company may have limited
influence and control. any of these activities could result in
liability or significant delays in operations arising from
private litigation or government action, either as a result of
an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new
conclusions on the effects of the companys operations on
human health or the environment. in addition, to the extent that
societal pressures or political or other factors are involved,
it is possible that such liability could be imposed without
regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the
asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.
the
company does not insure against all potential losses, which
could result in significant financial exposure.
the company does not have commercial insurance or third-party
indemnities to cover fully all operational risks or potential
liability in the event of a significant incident or series of
incidents causing catastrophic loss. as a result the company is,
to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. the
company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and
borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would
arise from such an event or series of events. the occurrence of
a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the
company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is
significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on
the companys results of operations or financial condition.
political
instability and significant changes in the regulatory
environment could harm chevrons business.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be
table of contents
taken by governments to increase public ownership of the
companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose
additional taxes or royalties.
in certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed
restrictions on the companys operations, export and
exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure
requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness
or relations with other governments or third parties. in other
countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten
the safety of employees and the companys continued
presence in those countries and internal unrest, acts of
violence or strained relations between a government and the
company or other governments may adversely affect the
companys operations. those developments have, at times,
significantly affected the companys related operations and
results and are carefully considered by management when
evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries. at december31, 2011, 22percent of the
companys net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan.
the company also has significant interests in opec-member
countries, including angola, nigeria and venezuela and in the
partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. twenty-two
percent of the companys net proved reserves, including
affiliates, were located in opec countries at december31,
2011.
regulation
of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons
operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons
products.
continued political attention to issues concerning climate
change, the role of human activity in it, and potential
mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on
the companys operations and financial results.
international agreements and national or regional legislation
and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are
currently in various stages of discussion or implementation.
these and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies
and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance,
operating and maintenance costs. the level of expenditure
required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain
and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each
jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market
conditions. greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated
include those arising from the companys exploration and
production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of
production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation;
the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined
products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of
natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and
related products and consumers or customers use of
the companys products. some of these activities, such as
consumers and customers use of the companys
products, as well as actions taken by the companys
competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond
the companys control.
the effect of regulation on the companys financial
performance will depend on a number of factors including, among
others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions
reductions required by law, the extent to which chevron would be
entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need
to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through
auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and
credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on
the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through
the pricing of the companys products. material price
increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy
sources could reduce demand for products the company currently
sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes,
revenues and margins.
changes
in managements estimates and assumptions may have a
material impact on the companys consolidated financial
statements and financial or operations performance in any given
period.
in preparing the companys periodic reports under the
securities exchange act of 1934, including its financial
statements, chevrons management is required under
applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and
assumptions as of a specified date. these estimates and
assumptions are based on managements best estimates and
experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk
and uncertainty. materially different results may occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by
management include measurement of benefit obligations for
pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of
crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for
estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and
impairments to property, plant and equipment. changes in
estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the
assumptions, such as changes in the companys business
plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices,
could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

certain
governmental proceedings
in november 2008, the california air resources board (carb)
proposed a civil penalty against chevrons sacramento,
california, terminal for alleged violations between august and
december 2007 of carbs regulations governing the minimum
concentration of additives in gasoline. due to a computer
programming error, the sacramento terminals automatic
dispensers allegedly failed to inject additive detergent into a
gasoline line. it appears that the resolution of these notices
of violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty
exceeding $100,000.
in november 2008, carb proposed a civil penalty against
chevrons richmond, california, refinery for a notice of
violation relating to gasoline that was not properly certified
as to composition. the composition certificates for the gasoline
were corrected without requiring any change to the composition
of the gasoline. in july 2009, carb issued the refinery a notice
of violation relating to an error in gasoline blending that
caused the product composition certifications to be in error.
the composition certifications were corrected without requiring
any change to the gasoline. discussions with carb officials
relating to all of these matters continue. it appears that the
resolution of these notices of violation may result in the
payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.
in july 2009, carb issued a notice of violation against chevron
products company for alleged violations of carbs
regulations governing the certification of gasoline that
occurred during storage at a third-party facility and which had
been self-reported by chevron on discovery. chevron believes
that this matter will not result in the payment of a civil
penalty exceeding $100,000.
in 2011, carb made penalty demands with respect to four notices
of violation against chevron for alleged violations of
carbs fuel blend regulations at certain california
terminals and refineries. it appears that the resolution of
these notices of violation may result in the payment of a civil
penalty exceeding $100,000.
in july 2009, the hawaii department of health (doh) alleged that
chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding
$100,000 in conjunction with commitments chevron undertook to
install and operate certain air emission control equipment at
its hawaii refinery pursuant to a clean air act settlement with
the united states environmental protection agency (epa) and doh.
chevron has disputed many of the allegations.
chevron has entered into negotiations with the epa with respect
to alleged air quality violations at chevrons perth amboy,
new jersey refinery identified in a september16, 2008
compliance order issued by the epa. the alleged violations
relate to certain management and reporting requirements set
forth in the epas leak detection and repair regulations
(these regulations pertain to the control and monitoring of
fugitive emissions from refinery process equipment). based on
discussions with the epa, it appears that the resolution of this
matter may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding
$100,000.
the epa indicated that it would assess chevrons salt lake
city refinery a civil penalty for alleged violations of federal
requirements and utahs air pollution laws. these alleged
violations were the subject of an august20, 2008 epa
notice of violation (nov) for which no penalty was assessed at
the time. it appears that the resolution of this nov may result
in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.
the south coast air quality management district (scaqmd) issued
a nov to chevrons huntington beach, california, terminal
seeking a civil penalty for alleged violations involving the
repair of two holes in the roof of a tank at the terminal. based
on a july8, 2011, settlement communication with the
scaqmd, it appears that the resolution of this nov may result in
the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000.
table of contents
chevron reached a final resolution of an administrative penalty
proceeding brought by the utah department of environmental
quality by agreeing to pay the state of utah a civil penalty of
$500,000 as the result of two crude oil releases. the first
release occurred in june 2010 and the second occurred in
december 2010. in addition, chevron agreed to pay the state of
utah and the salt lake city corporation $4million in
damages and restoration projects. the public review period
passed and the penalty has been paid.

business environment and outlook
chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following
countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad,
china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the
netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the
philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and
tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela and vietnam.
earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream
business segments. the single biggest factor that affects the results of operations for the company
is movement in the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost
component
of refined products. seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the companys quarterly
earnings during the year.
to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must
develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the
investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to
explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many
technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in
this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments.
the companys operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic,
regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the
united states. from time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or
impose additional costs on the company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. civil
unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other
governments may impact the companys operations or investments. those developments have at times
significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by
management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.
the company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to
its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and growth. refer to the
results of operations section beginning on page fs-6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales
during 2011. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could
result in significant gains or losses.
the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of
worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude
oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily
operations and for business planning.
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:
upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over
which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic
conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum
exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and
regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that
fs-2
table of contents
may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors
could also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region. the company monitors
developments closely in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to
manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the
upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the companys ability to find or
acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts,
and changes in tax laws and regulations.
the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and
supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and
exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural
gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control. external factors include not
only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys
material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own
supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. capital and exploratory expenditures
and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe
weather or civil unrest.
the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for west texas intermediate (wti)crude
oil, brent crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the wti price averaged $95 per barrel for the
full-year 2011, compared to $79 in 2010. as of mid-february2012, the wti price was about $99 per
barrel. the brent price averaged $111 per barrel for the full-year 2011, compared to $80 in 2010.
as of mid-february2012, the brent price was about $118 per barrel. the majority of the companys
equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. wti traded at a discount to brent
throughout 2011 due to excess crude supply in the u.s. midcontinent market. the discount narrowed
in fourth quarter 2011 as crude inventories declined.
a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur)
crudes and those of lower
quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with
the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of
refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor
gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the differential widened during 2011
primarily due to rising diesel prices and lower availability of light, sweet crude oil due to
supply disruptions in libya.
chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad,
indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in
angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page fs-10 for the companys
average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)
in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural
gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those
markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged about $4.00 per thousand cubic feet
(mcf)during 2011, compared with about $4.50 during 2010. as of mid-february2012, the henry hub
spot price was about $2.50 per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states
are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes
produced in north america.
outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply,
demand and regulatory circumstances. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects
to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other
markets. international natural gas realizations averaged about $5.40 per mcf during 2011, compared
with about $4.60 per mcf during 2010. (see page fs-10 for the companys average natural gas
realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
the companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2011 averaged 2.673million
barrels per day. about one-fifth of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2011 occurred in
the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi
arabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2011 or
2010. at their december2011 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining the current production
level of 30million barrels per day and made no change to the production quotas in effect since
december2008.
the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2012 will average approximately 2.680
million barrels per day based on the average brent price of $111 per barrel for the full-year 2011.
this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by
opec, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of
company operations, delays in project startups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various
markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays
in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature
fields, or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also
affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale
projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in
upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and
natural gas production. a significant majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the
united states.
refer to the results of operations section on pages fs-6 through fs-7 for additional
discussion of the companys upstream business.
refer to table v beginning on page fs-67 for a tabulation of the companys proved net oil and
gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2009 and each year-end from 2009 through 2011,
and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the
three-year period ending december31, 2011.
in early november2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field in
brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series
of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. the
resulting surface sheen has since dissipated and there have been no
coastal or wildlife impacts.
upon detection, the company immediately took steps to stop the
release. chevrons emergency plan,
approved by the brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency ibama, was
implemented according to the law and industry standards. the
source of the seep was contained
within four days. as of december31, 2011 the financial impact of the incident was not material to the companys annual net
income. however, the companys ultimate exposure related to fines and penalties is not currently
determinable, and could be significant to net income in any one period.
downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining,
manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel
oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and
can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and
petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical
feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels,
geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity
utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from
unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.
other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its
crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the
companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product
tankers. other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and
energy costs to operate the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.
the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s.
gulf coast, asia, and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in
refineries in each of these areas. in 2011, the companys margins improved over 2010, supported by
higher global product demand and tighter global refined product supplies. the company made further
progress during 2011 implementing the previously-announced restructuring of its downstream
businesses, including the employee-reduction programs for the united states and international
operations. approximately 2,300 employees in the downstream operations are currently expected to be
released under these programs. about 2,100 employees have been released through december31, 2011,
with the programs being substantially completed. substantially all of the remaining employees
designated for release under the programs are expected to leave in 2012. about 900 of the affected
employees were located in the united states. refer to note 23 of the consolidated financial
statements, on pages fs-55 through fs-56, for further discussion.

the company progressed its ongoing effort to concentrate downstream resources and capital on
strategic assets. on august1, 2011, the company completed the sale of its 220,000-barrel-per-day
pembroke refinery and its fuels marketing and aviation assets in the united kingdom and ireland.
through year-end 2011, the company had also completed the sale of 13 u.s. terminals, certain
marketing businesses in africa, lpg storage and distribution operations in china, and its fuels
marketing and aviation businesses in 16 countries in the caribbean and latin america regions. in
2012, the company also expects to complete the sale of its fuels, finished lubricants and aviation
businesses in spain and certain fuels marketing and aviation businesses in the central caribbean,
pending customary regulatory approvals.
also in 2011, caltex australia ltd. (cal), the companys 50percent-owned affiliate, initiated
a review of its refining operations in australia, which is ongoing. upon completion, should the
review result in a decision to significantly alter the operational role of cals refineries,
chevron may recognize a loss that could be significant to net income in any one period.

operating developments
key operating developments and other events during 2011 and early 2012 included the
following:
upstream
australia chevron and its joint-venture partners reached the final investment decision to proceed
with development of the wheatstone project. construction started in late 2011. chevron holds a 72.1
percent interest in the foundation natural gas processing facilities, which are located at
ashburton north, along the northwest coast of australia. the company plans to supply natural gas to
the foundation project from the chevron-operated and 90.2percent-owned wheatstone and iago fields.
the lng facilities will also be a destination for third-party natural gas.
through the end of 2011, chevron has signed binding sales and purchase agreements with two
asian customers for the delivery of about 60percent of
chevrons net lng off-take from the
wheatstone project. discussions continue with potential customers to increase sales to 85 to 90
percent of chevrons net lng off-take and to sell down equity.
during 2011, the company announced natural gas discoveries at the 50percent-owned and
operated orthrus deep prospect in block wa-24-r, the 50percent-owned and operated vos prospect in
block wa-439-p, and the 67percent-
owned and operated acme west prospect in block wa-205-p. in january2012, the company also
announced a natural gas discovery at the 50percent-owned and operated satyr-3 prospect in block
wa-374-p. these discoveries are expected to contribute to potential expansion at company-operated
lng projects.
kazakhstan/russia during 2011, the caspian pipeline consortium began construction on a project
to increase the pipeline design capacity by 670,000 barrels per day. the project is expected to be
implemented in three phases, with capacity increasing progressively until reaching maximum capacity
of 1.4million barrels per day in 2016.
nigeria in december2011, a final investment decision was reached to develop the 40
percent-owned and operated sonam natural gas field in the escravos area. the project is designed
to deliver 215million cubic feet of natural gas per day to the domestic market and produce
30,000 barrels of liquids per day.
thailand in october2011, the 69.9percent-owned and operated platong ii natural gas project
commenced production. the project ramped up to total average daily production of 377million cubic
feet of natural gas and 11,000 barrels of condensate as of the end of 2011.
united kingdom in fourth quarter 2011, the company reached a final investment decision for the
clair ridge project, located west of the shetland islands. chevron has a 19.4percent nonoperated
working interest in the project.
united states in fourth quarter 2011, a final investment decision was made for the tubular
bells project in the deepwater gulf of mexico. the development includes a 42.9percent nonoperated
working interest in the tubular bells unitized area.
drilling operations at the 43.8percent-owned and operated moccasin prospect resulted in a new
discovery of crude oil. the company also drilled a successful appraisal well at the 55
percent-owned buckskin prospect. both prospects are in the deepwater gulf of mexico.
in february2011, chevron acquired atlas energy, inc. the acquisition provided a natural gas
resource position in the marcellus shale and utica shale, primarily located in southwestern
pennsylvania and ohio. the acquisition also provided a 49percent interest in laurel mountain
midstream, llc, an affiliate that owns more than 1,000 miles of natural gas gathering lines
servicing the marcellus. in addition, the acquisition provided assets in michigan, which include
antrim shale producing assets and approximately

350,000 total acres in the antrim and collingwood/utica shale formations. additional asset
acquisitions in 2011 expanded the companys holdings in the marcellus and utica to approximately
700,000 and 600,000 total acres, respectively.
downstream
africa during 2011, the company completed the sale of certain marketing businesses in five
countries in africa.
caribbean and latin america in 2011, the company completed the sale of its fuels marketing and
aviation businesses in 16 countries in the caribbean and latin america. in fourth quarter 2011, the
company signed agreements to sell certain fuels marketing and aviation businesses in the central
caribbean. the company expects to complete these sales in 2012 following receipt of required local
regulatory and government approvals.
europe in august2011, the company completed the sale of its refining and marketing assets in
the united kingdom and ireland, including the pembroke refinery.

u.s. upstream earnings of $6.51billion in 2011 increased $2.4billion from 2010. the
benefit of higher crude oil realizations increased earnings by $2.8billion between periods. partly
offsetting this effect were lower net oil-equivalent production which decreased earnings by about
$400million and higher operating expenses of $200million.
u.s. upstream earnings of $4.1billion in 2010 increased $1.9billion from 2009. higher prices
for crude oil and natural gas increased earnings by $2.1billion between periods. partly offsetting
these effects were higher operating expenses of $200million, in part due to the gulf of mexico
drilling moratorium. lower exploration expenses were essentially offset by higher tax items and
higher depreciation expenses.
the companys average realization for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2011 was
$97.51 per barrel, compared with $71.59 in 2010 and $54.36 in 2009. the average natural gas
realization was $4.04 per thousand cubic feet in 2011, compared with $4.26 and $3.73 in 2010 and
2009, respectively.
net oil-equivalent production in 2011 averaged 678,000 barrels per day, down 4percent from
2010 and 5percent from 2009. between 2011 and 2010, the decrease in production was associated with
normal field declines and maintenance-related downtime. partially offsetting this decrease were new
production from acquisitions in the marcellus shale and increases at the perdido project in the
gulf of mexico. natural field declines between 2010 and 2009 were
fs-6

mostly offset by increased production from the tahiti field. the net liquids component of
oil-equivalent production for 2011 averaged 465,000 barrels per day, down 5percent from 2010 and 4
percent from 2009. net natural gas production averaged about 1.3billion cubic feet per day in
2011, down approximately 3percent from 2010 and about 9percent from 2009. refer to the selected

international upstream earnings of $18.3billion in 2011 increased $4.7billion from
2010. higher prices for crude oil increased earnings by $7.1billion. this benefit was partly
offset by higher tax items of about $1.7billion and higher operating expenses, including fuel, of
about $1.0billion. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $211million in 2011, compared
with a decrease of $293million a year earlier.
earnings of $13.6billion in 2010 increased $4.9billion from 2009. higher prices for crude
oil and natural gas increased earnings by $4.3billion, and an increase in net oil-equivalent
production in the 2010 period benefited income by about $1.2billion. this net benefit was partly
offset by higher operating expenses of $500million. a favorable change in tax items of about $450
million was mostly offset by higher depreciation expenses. the 2009 period included gains of about
$500million on asset sales and tax items related to the gorgon project in australia. foreign
currency effects decreased earnings by $293million in the 2010 period, compared with a reduction
of $578million a year earlier, primarily reflecting noncash losses on balance sheet remeasurement.
the companys average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2011
was $101.53 per barrel, compared with $72.68 in 2010 and $55.97 in 2009. the average natural gas
realization was $5.39 per thousand cubic feet in 2011, compared with $4.64 and $4.01 in 2010 and
2009, respectively.
international net oil-equivalent production of 2.0million barrels per day in 2011 decreased
about 3percent from
2010 and remained relatively flat with 2009. the volumes in 2011 and 2010 include synthetic oil that was
reported in 2009 as production from oil sands in canada. absent price effects on entitlement
volumes, net oil-equivalent production decreased 1percent in 2011 and increased 5percent in 2010,
when compared with the prior years production.
the net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was about 1.4million
barrels per day in 2011, a decrease of approximately 3percent from 2010 and an increase of
approximately 2percent from 2009. international net natural gas production of 3.7billion cubic
feet per day in 2011 was down 2percent from 2010 and up 2percent from 2009.

u.s. downstream operations earned $1.5billion in 2011, compared with $1.3billion in
2010. earnings benefited by $300million from improved margins on refined products, $200million
from higher earnings from the 50percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem), and
$50million from the absence of 2010 charges related to employee reductions. these benefits were
partly offset by the absence of a $400million gain on the sale of the companys ownership interest
in the colonial pipeline company recognized in 2010.
earnings increased $1.5billion in 2010 from 2009. improved margins on refined products
increased earnings by about $550million. also contributing to the increase was the nearly $400
million gain on the sale of the companys ownership interest in the colonial pipeline company.
higher earnings from chemicals operations increased earnings by about $300million, largely from
improved margins at cpchem.
refined product sales of 1.26million barrels per day in 2011 declined 7percent, mainly due
to lower gasoline, gas oil, and kerosene sales. sales volumes of refined products were 1.35million
barrels per day in 2010, a decrease of 4percent from 2009. the decline was mainly in gasoline and
jet fuel sales. u.s. branded gasoline sales decreased to 514,000 barrels per day in 2011,
representing approximately 10percent and 17percent declines from 2010 and 2009, respectively. the
decline in 2011, relative to 2010 and 2009, was primarily

international downstream earned $2.1billion in 2011, compared with $1.1billion in
2010. gains on asset sales benefited earnings by $700million, primarily from the sale of the
pembroke refinery and related marketing assets in the united kingdom and ireland. also contributing
to earnings were improved margins of $200million and the absence of 2010 charges of $90million
related to employee reductions. these benefits were partly offset by unfavorable mark-to-market
effects of derivative instruments of about $180million. foreign currency effects decreased
earnings by $65million in 2011, compared with a decrease of $135million a year earlier.
earnings of $1.1billion in 2010 increased $545million from 2009. higher margins on the
manufacture and sale of gasoline and other refined products increased earnings by about $1.0
billion, and a favorable swing in mark-to-market
effects on derivative instruments benefited
earnings by about $300million. partially offsetting these items was the absence of 2009 gains on
asset sales of about $550million and higher expenses of about $200million, primarily related to
employee reductions and transportation costs. foreign currency effects reduced earnings by $135
million in 2010, compared with a reduction of $191million in 2009.
total refined product sales of 1.69million barrels per day in 2011
declined 4percent, primarily due to the sale of the companys refining
and marketing assets in the united kingdom and ireland. excluding the
impact of 2011 asset
sales, sales volumes were up 3percent between the comparative periods. international refined
product sales volumes of 1.76million barrels per day in 2010 were 5percent lower than in 2009,
mainly due to asset sales in certain countries in africa and latin america.

higher employee compensation and benefits of $700million. in part, increased fuel purchases
reflected a new commercial arrangement that replaced a prior product exchange agreement for
upstream operations in indonesia.
total expenses in 2010 were about $1.6billion higher than 2009, primarily due to $600million
of higher fuel expenses; $500million for employee compensation and benefits; $200million of
increased construction, repair and maintenance expense; and an increase of about $200million
associated with higher tanker charter rates. in addition, charges of $234million related to

effective income tax rates were 43percent in 2011, 40percent in 2010 and 43percent in
2009. the rate was higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to higher effective tax rates in
certain international upstream jurisdictions. the higher international upstream effective tax rates
were driven primarily by lower utilization of non-u.s. tax credits in 2011 and the effect of changes
in income tax rates between periods, which were partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement
impacts. the rate was lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to international upstream effects,
including an increased utilization of tax credits, which had a greater impact on the rate than
one-time deferred tax benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales in 2009. also, a smaller
portion of company income was earned in higher tax rate international upstream jurisdictions in
2010 than in 2009. finally, foreign currency remeasurement impacts caused a reduction in the
effective tax rate between periods.

liquidity and capital resources
cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities total balances were $20.1billion
and $17.1billion at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. cash provided by operating
activities in 2011 was $41.1billion, compared with $31.4billion in 2010 and $19.4billion in
2009. cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
approximately $1.5billion, $1.4billion and $1.7billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was more than sufficient to fund the $27.4
billion cash component of the companys capital and exploratory program and pay $6.1billion of
dividends to shareholders. in addition, the company completed the $4.5billion acquisition of atlas
energy, inc., funded from the companys operating cash flows. cash provided by investing activities
included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $3.5billion in 2011, $2.0billion in
2010, and $2.6billion in 2009.
restricted cash of $1.2billion and $855million associated with various capital-investment
projects, acquisitions pending tax deferred exchanges, and upstream abandonment activities at
december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was invested in short-term marketable securities and
recorded as deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
dividends dividends paid to common stockholders were approximately $6.1billion in 2011, $5.7
billion in 2010 and $5.3billion in 2009. in october2011, the company increased its quarterly
dividend by 3.8percent to 81 cents per common share. this followed an increase of 8.3percent
announced in second quarter 2011.

debt and capital lease obligations total debt and capital lease
obligations were $10.2billion at december31, 2011, down from $11.5billion at year-end 2010.
the $1.3billion decrease in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2011 included the
early redemption of a $1.5billion bond due to mature in march2012. the companys debt and capital
lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable
long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $5.9billion at december
31, 2011, compared with $5.6billion at year-end 2010. of these amounts, $5.6billion and $5.4
billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. at year-end 2011,
settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2012, as
the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to
refinance them on a long-term basis.
at december31, 2011, the company had $6.0billion in committed credit facilities with various
major banks, expiring in december2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a
long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for
general corporate purposes. the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring
commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management
believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at
interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates
published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no
borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2011. in addition, the company
has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in march2013 for an unspecified amount
of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.
the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the companys debt, and the companys cost
of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding
public bonds issued by chevron corporation, chevron corporation profit sharing/savings plan trust
fund and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by,
chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poors
corporation and aa1 by moodys
investors service. the companys u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poors and p-l
by moodys. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital
program and cash that
may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality
debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated
cash requirements. the company also can modify capital spending plans during any extended periods
of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity
chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the
companys high-quality debt ratings.
common stock repurchase program in july2010, the board of directors approved an
ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. the company expects to
repurchase between $500million and $2billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing
prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market
conditions and other factors. during 2011, the company purchased 42.3million common shares for
$4.25billion. from the inception of the program through 2011, the company had purchased 51.1
million shares for $5.0billion.
capital and exploratory expenditures total expenditures for 2011 were $29.1
billion, including $1.7billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures.
in 2010
and 2009,
expenditures were $21.8billion and $22.2billion, respectively, including the companys
share of affiliates expenditures of $1.4billion and $1.6billion, respectively.
of the $29.1billion of expenditures in 2011, 89percent, or $25.9
billion, was related to upstream activities. approximately 87percent
and 80percent were expended for upstream operations in 2010 and 2009.
international upstream accounted for about 68percent of the worldwide
upstream investment in 2011, about 82percent in 2010 and about 80
percent in 2009. these amounts exclude the acquisition of atlas energy,
inc. in 2011.
the company estimates that in 2012 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $32.7billion,
including $3.0billion of spending

by affiliates. approximately 87percent of the total, or $28.5billion, is budgeted for exploration
and production activities. approximately $22.3billion, or 78percent, of this amount is for
projects outside the united states. spending in 2012 is primarily focused on major development
projects in angola, australia, brazil, canada, china, kazakhstan, nigeria, russia, the united
kingdom and the u.s. gulf of mexico. also included is funding for enhancing recovery and mitigating
natural field declines for currently-producing assets, and for focused exploration and appraisal
activities.
worldwide downstream spending in 2012 is estimated at $3.6billion, with about $2.1billion
for projects in the united states. major capital outlays include projects under construction at
refineries in the united states and south korea, expansion of additives production capacity in
singapore, and chemicals projects in the united states and saudi arabia.
investments in technology, power generation and other corporate businesses in 2012 are
budgeted at $600million.
noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $799million
and $730million at december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. distributions to noncontrolling
interests totaled $71million and $72million in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

current ratio  current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates
the companys ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. the current ratio
in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that chevrons inventories are valued on a
last-in, first-out basis. at year-end 2011, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement
costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $9.0billion.
interest coverage ratio  income before income tax
expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized
interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests,
divided by before-tax interest costs. this
ratio indicates the
companys ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. the companys
interest coverage ratio in 2011 was higher than 2010 and 2009 due to
higher before-tax income.
debt ratio  total debt as a percentage of total debt
plus chevron corporation stockholders equity, which indicates the
companys leverage. the decrease between 2011 and 2010 was due to lower
debt and a higher chevron corporation stockholders equity balance. the
decrease between 2010 and 2009 was due to a higher chevron corporation
stockholders equity balance.

guarantee amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are
numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of

financing arrangements. the agreements typically provide goods and services, such as
pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold
in the ordinary course of the companys business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required
payments under these various commitments are: 2012  $6.0billion; 2013  $4.0billion; 2014  $3.9
billion; 2015  $3.2billion; 2016  $1.9billion; 2017 and after  $7.4billion. a portion of
these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under the

does not include amounts related to the companys income tax liabilities associated
with uncertain tax positions. the company is unable to make reasonable estimates for the
periods in which these liabilities may become payable. the company does not expect settlement
of such liabilities will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity in any single period.
$5.6billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in
long- term debt. the repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire
amounts in the 20132014 period.
does not include commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable.
these obligations are generally monetized in a relatively short period of time through sales
transactions or similar agreements with third parties. examples include obligations to
purchase lng, regasified natural gas and refinery products at indexed prices.
financial and derivative instruments
the market risk associated with the companys portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is
discussed below. the estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the companys
projection of future market changes. the actual impact of future market changes could differ
materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the
heading risk factors in parti, item1a, of the companys 2011 annual report on form 10-k.
derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to
the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied
natural gas and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its
activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for
the pur-
chase, sale
and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for
company refineries. the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading
purposes. the results of these activities were not material to the companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows in 2011.
the companys market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal risk control group in accordance with the companys risk management policies, which have
been approved by the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
the derivative commodity instruments used in the companys risk management and trading
activities consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the new york mercantile
exchange and on electronic platforms of the inter-continental exchange and chicago mercantile
exchange. in addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap contracts and option
contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas
companies in the over-the-counter markets.
derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded
at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with accounting standards for
derivatives (asc 815), with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. fair values are derived
principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. the change in
fair value of chevrons derivative commodity instruments in 2011 was a quarterly average increase
of $22million in total assets and a quarterly average decrease of $17million in total
liabilities.
the company uses a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate the potential loss in fair value on a
single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity
instruments held or issued. var is the maximum projected loss not to be exceeded within a given
probability or confidence level over a given period of time. the companys var model uses the monte
carlo simulation method that involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified
probability distributions and constructing a full distribution of a portfolios potential values.
the var model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average for computing historical
volatilities and correlations, a 95percent confidence level, and a one-day holding period. that
is, the companys 95percent, one-day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value
that would not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were
held constant for one day.
the one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated
or hedged within one day. for hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most
of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. the following table presents the
95percent/one-day var for each of the companys primary risk exposures in the area of derivative
commodity instruments at december31, 2011 and 2010.

foreign currency the company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts
to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. the
foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. there were no open foreign currency derivative
contracts at december31, 2011.
interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time
as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest rate swaps,
if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected
in income. at year-end 2011, the company had no interest rate swaps.
transactions with related parties
chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity
affiliates. these arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term
purchase agreements. refer to other information in note 12 of the consolidated financial
statements, page fs-40, for further discussion. management believes these agreements have been
negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies
pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings
related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements
or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct
or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of
chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the company or
other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites,
including, but not limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous
sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations,
terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown
magnitude of
possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the companys
liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to
which such costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental
obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of
additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the
period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position or liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such
expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the companys competitive position
relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or chemical companies.
the following table displays the annual changes to the companys before-tax environmental
remediation reserves, including those for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state
laws.

included in the $1,404million year-end 2011 reserve balance were remediation activities at
approximately 180 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible
party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)or
other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state
laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2011 was $185million. the
federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron
to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.
fs-14
table of contents
of the remaining year-end 2011 environmental reserves balance of $1,219million,
$675million related to the companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other
plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and
pipelines. the remaining $544million was associated with various sites in international downstream
($95million), upstream ($368million) and other businesses ($81million). liabilities at all
sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the companys plans
and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities
include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of
contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid
and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural
attenuation of the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2011 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
the company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. these asset
retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. the liability balance of
approximately $12.8billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2011 related primarily to
upstream properties.
for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities,
no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the
end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been
made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.
refer also to note 25 on page fs-58, related to the companys asset retirement obligations and
the discussion of environmental matters beginning on page fs-15.
suspended wells the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a
final determination of the commercial potential of the related crude oil and natural gas
fields. the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future
drilling activity or development decisions or both. at december31, 2011, the company had
approximately $2.4billion of suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and
equipment, a decrease
of $284million from 2010. the 2010 balance reflected an
increase of $283million from 2009.
the future trend of the companys exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. the effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $2.4billion of suspended wells at year-end 2011 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.
refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-47, for additional discussion of suspended wells.
income taxes information related to income tax contingencies is included on pages
fs-43 through fs-45 in note 15 and page fs-56 in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements
under the heading income taxes.
other contingencies information related to other contingencies is included on
pages fs-57 through fs-58 in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements under the heading
other contingencies.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. an obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2011 at approximately $2.7billion for its
consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were approximately $1.0billion of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.7billion of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or
divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites.
for 2012, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.0billion. these
capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and
the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional
investments in new or existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred
in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the
environment; comply with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and
restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. although these costs may be
significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to
have a material effect on the companys liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting
principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different
reporting periods. all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
2.
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the
companys financial condition or operating performance is material.
besides those meeting these critical criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. although
not associated with highly uncertain matters, these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be more likely than not. another
example is the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves under sec rules, which require
... by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, (the reserves) can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economi-
cally
producible... under existing economic
conditions where existing economic conditions include prices based on the average price during the
12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. refer to table v, reserve quantity
information, beginning on page fs-67, for the changes in these estimates for the three years
ending december31, 2011, and to table vii, changes in the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows from proved reserves on page fs-76 for estimates of proved-reserve values
for each of the three years ended december31, 2011. note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, beginning on page fs-28, includes a description of the successful efforts method of
accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. the estimates of crude oil and
natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical accounting policy for impairment of properties, plant and
equipment and investments in affiliates, beginning on page fs-18, includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and
gas properties. this commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. significant accounting policies are
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-28. the
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the audit committee of the board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension plan
obligations and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. for other postretirement benefit (opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care
and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining opeb obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed
health care cost-trend rates.
note 21, beginning on page fs-49, includes information on the funded status of the companys
pension and opeb plans at the end of 2011 and 2010; the components of pension and opeb expense for
the three years ended december31, 2011; and the underlying assumptions for those periods.
fs-16
table of contents
pension and opeb expense is reported on the consolidated statement of income as
operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses and applies to all business
segments. the year-end 2011 and 2010 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets
and obligations, of each of the companys pension and opeb plans is recognized on the consolidated
balance sheet. the differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a long-term
asset in deferred charges and other assets. the differences associated with underfunded or
unfunded pension and opeb plans are reported as accrued liabilities or reserves for employee
benefit plans. amounts yet to be recognized as components of pension or opeb expense are reported
in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
to estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses a process that
incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future performance
and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. asset allocations
are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the
companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. the expected
long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 70percent of the companys
pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8percent since 2002. for the 10years ending december31,
2011, actual asset returns averaged 5.0percent for this plan. the actual return for 2011 was
slightly negative and was associated with the broad decline in the financial markets in the second
half of the year. additionally, with the exception of two other years within this 10year period,
actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.8percent.
the year-end market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market
value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2011, the company selected a 3.8
percent discount rate for the major u.s. pension plan and 4.0percent for its opeb plan. these
rates were selected based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the citigroup pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2011. the discount rates at the end of
2010 and 2009 were 4.8percent and 5.3percent, respectively, for the major u.s. pension plan, and
5.0percent and 5.8percent, respectively, for the companys u.s. opeb plan.
an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2011 was
$1.2billion. as
an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1
percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the companys primary u.s. pension
plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2011 by approximately $75million. a 1
percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for about 63percent of
the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2011 by
approximately $145million.
an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the
funded status of a plan reported on the consolidated balance sheet. the aggregate funded status
recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at december31, 2011, was a net liability of
approximately $5.4billion. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the
discount rate assumption, a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys
primary u.s. pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $375million,
which would have decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately $2.5billion to $2.1
billion. other plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. the actual rates of
return on plan assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of
unanticipated changes in the worlds financial markets.
in 2011, the companys pension plan contributions were $1.5billion (including $1.2billion to
the u.s. plans). in 2012, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $900million.
actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory requirements and other economic factors. additional funding may be required if
investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
for
the companys opeb plans, expense for 2011 was $220million, and the total liability,
which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2011, was $3.8billion.
as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2011, a
1percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary u.s. opeb plan, which accounted
for about 76percent of the companywide opeb expense, would have decreased opeb expense by
approximately $10million. a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 81percent of the companywide opeb liabilities, would have decreased total opeb
liabilities at the end of 2011 by approximately $75million.
for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4percent per year. for active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims
experiences are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 8
percent in 2012 and gradually drop to 5percent for 2023 and beyond. as an indication of the health
care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2011, a 1percent increase
in the rates for the main u.s. opeb plan, which accounted for 81percent of the companywide opeb
liabilities, would have increased opeb expense by $8million.

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and
the funded status of each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the
year the difference occurs. instead, the differences are included in actuarial gain/loss and
unamortized amounts have been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the
consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 21, beginning on page fs-49, for information on the $9.6
billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december31, 2011; a
description of the method used to amortize those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be
recognized in expense during 2012.
impairment of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the
company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
such indicators include changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved
reserve quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the
asset over its estimated fair value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions. refer also to the
discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in note 9 beginning on page fs-34.
no major individual impairments of pp&e and investments were recorded for the three years
ending december31, 2011. a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if
other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not
practicable, given the broad range of the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in
the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair
any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown
number of other assets to become impaired.
investments in common stock of affiliates that
are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these
equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the
companys carrying value. when such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment
charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investments carrying
value and its estimated fair value at the time.
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company
considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial
performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that
will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of
the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.
from time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when
significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field
or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. that is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified
as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets associated carrying values.
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to
amortization. as required by accounting standards for goodwill (asc 350), the company tests such
goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if
an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount.
contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording
liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can
frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. for
fs-18
table of contents
example, the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates
based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount
of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of
changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information
on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if
management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally reports
these losses as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of income. an exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than
not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. for
additional
discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to note 15 beginning on page
fs-43. refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on
earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters
for the three years ended december31, 2011.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevron corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of chevron corporation and its subsidiaries at december31, 2011,
and december31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended december31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2011, based on
criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over
financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the
financial statement schedule, and on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on
our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public
company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

note 1
summary of significant accounting policies
general upstream operations consist primarily of
exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and
regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (lng); transporting crude oil by major
international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas;
and a gas-to-liquids project. downstream operations relate primarily to refining crude oil into
petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined
products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing
of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and additives for fuels and lubricant
oils.
the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in
which the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to
50percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity
currently in income.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of
the investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to
retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to
allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. the new cost basis of
investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity
in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and
liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference.
when appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to
reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values.
derivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. for the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative
instruments are reported in current income. the company may enter into interest rate swaps from
time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest
rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as
fair value hedges. interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair
value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. where chevron is a
party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for
derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance
sheet.
short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents.
bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90days are reported as time deposits. the
balance of short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and is marked-to-market,
with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income.
inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost,
using a last-in, first-out method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials,
supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost.

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies - continued
properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil
and natural gas exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related
plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related
asset retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are
capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that
are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells
that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as
proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient
quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making
sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.
all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 19, beginning on page fs-47, for
additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties,
are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the united states, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. in downstream, impairment reviews are performed on
the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate.
impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value. refer to note 9, beginning on page fs-34, relating to fair value measurements.
the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is
a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. refer also to note 25, on page fs-58, relating to aros.
depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas
producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method,
generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. depletion expenses
for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production
method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation
provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.
the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their
estimated useful lives. in general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and
equipment in the united states; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate
international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses, and from sales as other income.
expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects),
repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed
as incurred. major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as required
by accounting standards for goodwill (asc 350), the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit
level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit
below its carrying amount.
environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future remediation
costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs
can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and canadian marketing facilities, the accrual
is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. for
crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an aro is made in
accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. refer to
note 25, on page fs-58, for a discussion of the companys aros.
fs-29
table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note 1 summary of significant accounting policies - continued
for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company
records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable
amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because
the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares.
the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of
future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
companys own internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all
gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. the cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in currency translation adjustment on the
consolidated statement of equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on the
entitlement method. excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. the
associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the consolidated statement of income, on page fs-23.
purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation
of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and
reported in purchased crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income.
stock
options and other share-based compensation the company issues stock options and other
share-based compensation to its employees and accounts for these transactions under the accounting
standards for share-based compensation (asc 718). for equity awards, such as stock options, total
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock
appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. the company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense for
all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting
period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted under the companys long-term incentive plan have
graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third
anniversaries of the date of grant. the company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line
basis.
note 2
acquisition of atlas energy, inc.
on february17, 2011, the company acquired atlas energy, inc. (atlas), which held one of the
premier acreage positions in the marcellus shale, concentrated in southwestern pennsylvania. the
aggregate purchase price of atlas was approximately $4,500, which included $3,009
cash for all the common shares of atlas, a $403  cash advance to facilitate atlas
purchase of a 49percent interest in laurel mountain midstream llc and about $1,100  of
assumed debt. subsequent to the close of the transaction, the company paid off the assumed debt and
made payments of $184  in connection with atlas equity awards. as part of the acquisition,
chevron assumed the terms of a carry arrangement whereby reliance marcellus, llc, funds 75percent
of chevrons drilling costs, up to $1,300.
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination (asc 805) which, among other
things, requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date
fair values. provisional fair value measurements were made in first quarter 2011 for acquired
assets and assumed liabilities, and the measurement process was finalized in fourth quarter 2011.
proforma financial information is not presented as it would not be materially different from
the information presented in the consolidated statement of income.

note 2 acquisition of atlas energy inc. - continued
properties were measured primarily using an income approach. the fair values of
the acquired oil and gas properties were based on significant inputs not observable in the market
and thus represent level 3 measurements. refer to note 9, beginning on page fs-34 for a definition
of fair value hierarchy levels. significant inputs included estimated resource volumes, assumed
future production profiles, estimated future commodity prices, a discount rate of 8percent, and
assumptions on the timing and amount of future operating and development costs. all the properties
are in the united states and are included in the upstream segment.
the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was $3,400  in cash. the
$27  of goodwill was assigned to the upstream segment and represents the amount of the
consideration transferred in excess of the values assigned to the individual assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets
acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. none of the goodwill
is deductible for tax purposes. goodwill recorded in the acquisition is not subject to
amortization, but will be tested periodically for impairment as required by the applicable
accounting standard (asc 350).
note 3
noncontrolling interests
the company adopted the accounting standard for noncontrolling interests (asc 810) in the
consolidated financial statements effective january1, 2009, and retroactive to the earliest period
presented. ownership interests in the companys subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
are presented separately from the parents equity on the consolidated balance sheet. the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both
presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. the term earnings is defined as
net income attributable to chevron corporation.

and 8.8million common shares for $4,250 and $750 under its ongoing share repurchase program,
respectively.
in 2011 and 2010, net sales (purchases)of other short-term investments consist of
restricted cash associated with capital-investment projects at the companys pascagoula and el
segundo refineries, acquisitions pending tax deferred exchanges, and upstream abandonment
activities that was invested in short-term securities and reclassified from cash and cash
equivalents to deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. the company
issued $374, $1,250 and $350 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of tax exempt bonds as a source
of funds for u.s. refinery projects, which is included in proceeds from issuance of long-term
debt.
the consolidated statement of cash flows excludes changes to the consolidated balance sheet
that did not affect cash. in 2009, payments related to accrued liabilities were excluded from
net decrease (increase)in operating working capital and were reported as capital expenditures.
the accrued liabilities were related to upstream operating agreements outside the united states
recorded in 2008. refer also to note 25, on page fs-58, for a discussion of revisions to the
companys aros that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending

fair value measurements
accounting standards for fair value measurement (asc 820) establish a framework for measuring
fair value and stipulate disclosures about fair value measurements. the standards apply to
recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements of financial and nonfinancial assets and
liabilities. among the required disclosures is the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses
to value an asset or a liability. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as
follows:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted)in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. for
the company, level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are
willing to transact at the
exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded.
level 2: inputs other than level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. for the
company, level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained
through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable
inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract.
level 3: unobservable inputs. the company does not use level 3 inputs for any of its recurring
fair value measurements. level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value
associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities.
the table below shows the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis at december31, 2011 and december31, 2010.
marketable securities the company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on
quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. the fair values reflect the cash that
would have been received if the instruments were sold at december31, 2011.
derivatives the company
records its derivative instruments  other than any commodity derivative
contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale  on the consolidated balance sheet
at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the consolidated statement of income. for derivatives
with identical or similar provisions as contracts that are publicly traded on a regular basis, the
company uses the market values of the publicly traded instruments as an input for fair value
calculations.
the companys derivative instruments principally include futures, swaps, options and forward
contracts for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. derivatives classified as level 1
include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the new york
mercantile exchange.

fair value measurements - continued
derivatives classified as level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts
principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which
are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. the company
obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the level 2 instruments. since this pricing
information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. the
company does not materially adjust this information. the company incorporates internal review,
evaluation and assessment procedures, including a comparison of level 2 fair values derived from
the companys internally developed forward curves (on a sample basis) with the pricing information
to document reasonable, logical and supportable fair value determinations and proper level of
classification.
impairments of properties, plant and equipment the company did not have any material long-lived
assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2011 or 2010.
impairments of investments and advances the company did not have any material investments and
advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2011 or 2010.
assets and liabilities not required to be measured at fair value the company holds cash equivalents
and bank time deposits in u.s. and non-u.s. portfolios. the instruments classified as cash
equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90days or less and money market
funds. cash and cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of $15,864 and $14,060 at december31,
2011, and december31, 2010, respectively. the instruments held in time deposits are bank time
deposits with maturities greater than 90days, and had carrying/fair values of $3,958 and $2,855 at
december31, 2011, and december31, 2010, respectively. the fair values of cash, cash equivalents
and bank time deposits reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were
settled at december31, 2011.
cash and cash equivalents do not include investments with a carrying/fair value
of $1,240  and $855  at december31, 2011, and december31, 2010, respectively. at
december31, 2011, these investments include restricted funds related to various capital-investment
projects, acquisitions pending tax deferred exchanges, and upstream abandonment activities which
are reported in deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. long-term debt of $4,101 and $5,636 at december31, 2011, and december31, 2010, had estimated fair
values of $4,928 and $6,311, respectively.
the carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheet approximate their fair values. fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at
december31, 2011 and 2010 were not material.
the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis at december31, 2011, is as follows:

financial and derivative instruments
derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market
risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids,
liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company
refineries. from time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited
trading purposes.
the companys derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and
refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. none of the companys derivative
instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the companys affiliates
make such designation. the companys derivatives are not material to the companys financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. the company believes it has no material market or
credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity
derivative activities.
the company uses international swaps and derivatives association agreements to govern
derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. depending on the nature
of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. when the
company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty
and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market
exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and
is a reasonable measure of the companys credit risk exposure. the company also uses other netting
agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate
credit risk.
derivative instruments measured at fair value at december31, 2011, december31, 2010, and
december31, 2009, and their classification on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statement of income are as follows:

foreign currency the company may enter into currency derivative contracts to manage some of its
foreign currency exposures. these exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions,
including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. the currency derivative
contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. there were no open currency derivative contracts at december31, 2011 or 2010.
interest rates the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges.
interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. at year-end 2011 and 2010, the
company had no interest rate swaps.

table of contents
note 10 financial and derivative instruments - continued
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable
securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the companys short-term
investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings.
company investment policies limit the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations
of credit risk. similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the
companys counterparties in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. as a result, the company believes
concentrations of credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers. when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring
letters of credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.
note 11
operating segments and geographic data
although each subsidiary of chevron is responsible for its
own affairs, chevron corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their
affiliates. the investments are grouped into two business segments, upstream and downstream,
representing the companys reportable segments and operating segments as defined in accounting
standards for segment reporting (asc 280). upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification
associated with liquefied natural gas (lng); transporting crude oil by major international oil
export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a
gas-to-liquids project. downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into
petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and
refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and
marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant
additives. all other activities of the company include mining operations, power generation
businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative
functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels and
technology.
the segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
segment managers who report to the companys chief operating decision maker (codm) (terms as
defined in asc 280). the codm is the companys executive committee (excom), a committee of senior
officers that includes the chief executive officer, and excom reports to the board of directors of
chevron corporation.
the operating segments represent components of the company, as described in accounting
standards for segment reporting (asc 280), that engage in activities (a)from which revenues are
earned and expenses are incurred; (b)whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm,
which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their
performance; and (c)for which discrete financial information is available.
segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the companys codm to discuss the segments operating activities and financial
performance. the codm approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and exploratory budgets. however, business-unit managers within the
operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and
all other matters connected with daily operations. company officers who are members of the excom
also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other committees for purposes
other than acting as the codm.
the companys primary country of operation is the united states of america, its country
of domicile. other components of the companys operations are reported as international
(outside the united states).
segment earnings the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. however, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in

approximate market prices.
revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude
oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. revenues for the
downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as
gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude
oil. this segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of additives for fuels and
lubricant oils and the transportation and trading of refined products, crude oil and natural gas
liquids. all other activities include revenues from mining operations, power generation
businesses, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels and
technology companies.
other than the united states, no single country accounted for 10percent or more of the
companys total sales and other operating revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

descriptions of major affiliates,
including significant differences between the
companys carrying value of its investments
and its underlying equity in the net assets of
the affiliates, are as follows:
tengizchevroil chevron has a 50percent equity
ownership interest in tengizchevroil (tco), a
joint venture formed in 1993 to develop the
tengiz and korolev crude oil fields in
kazakhstan over a 40-year period. at december
31, 2011, the companys carrying value of its
investment in tco was about $180 higher than
the amount of underlying equity in tcos net
assets. this difference results from chevron
acquiring a portion of its interest in tco at a
value greater than the underlying book value
for that portion of tcos net assets. see note
7, on page fs-33, for summarized financial
information for 100percent of tco.

petropiar chevron has a 30percent interest in petropiar, a joint stock company formed in 2008 to
operate the hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. the project, located in venezuelas
orinoco belt, has a 25-year contract term. prior to the formation of petropiar, chevron had a 30
percent interest in the hamaca project. at december31, 2011, the companys carrying value of its
investment in petropiar was approximately $180 less than the amount of underlying equity in
petropiars net assets. the difference represents the excess of chevrons underlying equity in
petropiars net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.
caspian pipeline consortium chevron has a 15percent interest in the caspian pipeline consortium, a
variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both tco and
karachaganak. the company joined the consortium in 1997 and has investments and advances totaling
$1,094 which includes long-term loans of $l,111 at year-end 2011. the loans were provided to fund
30percent of the initial pipeline construction. the company is not the primary beneficiary of the
consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its
proportionate share of the financial returns.
petroboscan chevron has a 39percent interest in petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006
to operate the boscan field in venezuela until 2026. chevron previously operated the field under an
operating service agreement. at december31, 2011, the companys carrying value of its investment
in petroboscan was approximately $220 higher than the amount of underlying equity in petroboscans
net assets. the difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by
chevron over its underlying equity in petroboscans net assets.
angola lng ltd. chevron has a 36percent interest in angola lng ltd., which will process and
liquefy natural gas produced in angola for delivery to international markets.

litigation
mtbe chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. chevron is a party to eight pending lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the
future. the companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not
determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. the company no longer uses
mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states.
ecuador chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago
agrio, ecuador, brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain
residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit
alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks
unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental
harm, plus a health monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary
of
texaco inc., was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned
oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by
petroecuador. at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party
environmental audit of the concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the
republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the
government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to that
agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. after
certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted texpet and all related
corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the
consortium operations.
based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously
given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and
municipal governments. with regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms
that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the

millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note 14 litigation - continued
remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal
obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.
in 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $18,900, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be
assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment. in 2009, following the disclosure by chevron of
evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding
themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge
presiding over the case was recused. in 2010, chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report
and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states
indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as
the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct.
in august2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers
report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45days. chevron
subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of
fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory
time requirement.
in september2010, chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should
be assessed against it. the plaintiffssubmission, which relied in part on the mining engineers
report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and
that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000. the next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and
notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment.
chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal
petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. in october2010,
chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted. a new judge took charge of the case and revoked
the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. on december17, 2010, the judge
issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had
requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment.
on february14,
2011, the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the
case. the  court rejected chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in
its opinion. the judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900
as an award for the plaintiffs representatives. it also assessed an additional amount of
approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15
days of the judgment, which chevron did not do. on february17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the
judgment, seeking increased damages, and on march11, 2011, chevron appealed the judgment seeking
to have the judgment nullified. on january3, 2012, an appellate
panel in the provincial
court affirmed the february 14, 2011 decision and ordered that chevron pay additional attorneys fees in the amount of .10% of
the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment. the plaintiffs filed a
petition to clarify and amplify the appellate decision on january6, 2012, and the court issued a
ruling in response on january13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its january3, 2012
ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to
avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages  was within fifteen days of the clarification ruling, or february3, 2012.
chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of
liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at
trial. on january20, 2012,
chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate  panels decision to ecuadors
national court of justice. as part of the appeal, chevron  requested the suspension of
any requirement that chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under ecuadorian
law of the judgment during the cassation appeal.
on february 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted chevrons cassation appeal in a
procedural step necessary for the national court of justice to hear the appeal. the provincial court appellate panel denied chevrons
request for a suspension of the requirement that chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the first interim
award of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below.
chevron continues to believe the provincial courts judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in ecuador, the united states and other countries. the
company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate
scientific evidence. chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process
in ecuador. chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability.
chevron has no  assets in ecuador and the lago agrio  plaintiffs lawyers have stated in press releases
and through other media that they will seek to  enforce the ecuadorian
judgement   in various countries
and otherwise disrupt chevrons operations. chevron expects to contest and defend against any such
actions.

chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september2009 against the republic of
ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the permanent court of arbitration in the
hague under the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law. the claim
alleges violations of the republic of ecuadors obligations under the united statesecuador
bilateral investment treaty (bit)and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the
republic of ecuador and texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the
bit. through the arbitration, chevron and texpet are seeking relief against the republic of
ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation
constitutes a violation of ecuadors obligations under the bit. on february9, 2011, the tribunal
issued an order for interim measures requiring the republic of ecuador to take all measures at its
disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without
ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending further order of the
tribunal. on january25, 2012, the tribunal converted the order for interim measures into an
interim award. chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on january4,
2012, and the republic of ecuador opposed chevrons application and requested that the existing
order for interim measures be vacated on january9, 2012.
on february 16, 2012, the tribunal issued a second interim award mandating that the republic of ecuador take all
measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to
suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without
ecuador of the judgment against chevron and, in particular, to preclude any certification
by the republic of ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against
chevron.
chevron expects to continue seeking
permanent injunctive relief and monetary relief before the tribunal.
through a series of recent u.s. court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery
relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration, chevron has obtained evidence that
it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of
several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs. in february2011,
chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york
against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters,
alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws.
through the civil lawsuit, chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a
declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio
litigation is the result of fraud
and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. on march7, 2011, the federal district
court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in
concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any
judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending resolution of chevrons civil lawsuit by
the federal district court.
on may 31, 2011, the federal district court severed claims one through eight of chevrons complaint
from the ninth claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending
a  trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief.
on september19, 2011, the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the preliminary injunction, stayed the trial on
chevrons ninth claim, a claim for declaratory relief, that had been set for november14, 2011, and denied the
defendants mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit. the second circuit
issued its opinion on january26, 2012 ordering the dismissal of chevrons ninth claim for
declaratory relief. on february 16, 2012, the federal district court lifted the stay on claims one through eight.
the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on chevron,
remains uncertain. management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a
range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian
judgment, the 2008 engineers report on alleged damages and the september2010 plaintiffssubmission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in
calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). moreover, the highly uncertain legal
environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible
loss (or a range of loss).

the companys effective tax rate increased from 40.3percent in 2010 to 43.3percent in 2011.
this increase primarily reflected higher effective tax rates in international upstream
jurisdictions. the higher international upstream effective tax rates were driven primarily by lower
utilization of non-u.s. tax credits in 2011 and the effect of changes in income tax rates between
periods, which were partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods.

deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2011 increased by approximately $3,600 from year-end
2010. the increase was related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and
equipment.
deferred tax assets increased by approximately $2,500 in 2011. increases primarily related to
additional foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions
(which were substantially offset by valuation allowances) and to increased temporary differences
for employee benefits. these effects were partially offset by reductions in deferred credits
resulting primarily from the usage of tax benefits in international tax jurisdictions.
the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit
carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. it reduces the deferred tax assets
to amounts that are, in managements assessment, more likely than not to be realized. at the end
of 2011, tax loss carryforwards were approximately $2,160, primarily related to various
international tax jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an
expiration date, others expire at various times from 2012 through 2036. foreign tax credit
carryforwards of $8,476 will expire between 2012 and 2021.

income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have
been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. undistributed earnings of international
consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made
for possible future remittances totaled $24,376 at december31, 2011. this amount represents
earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business. it is not practicable
to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. at the end of 2011, deferred income taxes were recorded
for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of
the earnings is not planned. the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes
on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

taxes - continued
uncertain income tax positions under accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes
(asc 740-10), a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a
likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the
technical merits of the position. the term tax position in the accounting standards for income
taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a
future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and
liabilities for interim or annual periods.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the
years ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. the term unrecognized tax benefits in the
accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial
statements. interest and penalties are not included.

approximately 80percent of the $3,481 of unrecognized tax benefits at december31, 2011,
would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. certain of these
unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance
at the time of any such recognition.
tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits
by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. for the companys major tax jurisdictions,
examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years
had not been completed as of december31, 2011. for these jurisdictions, the latest years for which
income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: united states  2007, nigeria  2000,
angola  2001, saudi arabia  2003 and kazakhstan  2005.
the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of
tax matters in the various jurisdictions. both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of
resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. however, it is reasonably
possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant
increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12months.
given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being
examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible
adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.
on the consolidated statement of income, the company reports interest and penalties related to
liabilities for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. as of december31, 2011, accruals
of $118 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance
sheet, compared with accruals of $225 as of year-end 2010. income tax expense (benefit)associated
with interest and penalties was $(64), $40 and $(20) in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

weighted-average interest rates at december31, 2011 and 2010, were 0.04percent and 0.16
percent, respectively.
redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that
are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders
during the year following the balance sheet date. in 2011, $374 of tax-exempt bonds related to
projects at the pascagoula, mississippi, refinery were issued.
the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term
debt. at december31, 2011, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.
at december31, 2011, the company had $6,000 in committed credit facilities with various major
banks, expiring in december2016, that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a
long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for
general corporate purposes. the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring
commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management
believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at
interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates
published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no
borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2011.
at december31, 2011 and 2010, the company classified $5,600 and $5,400, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital within one year, as the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced
by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.

accounting for suspended exploratory wells
accounting standards for the costs of exploratory
wells (asc 932) provide that exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized after the completion
of drilling when (a)the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as
a producing well and (b)the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. if either condition is not met or if an enterprise
obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of
the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any
salvage value, would be charged to expense. (note that an entity is not required to complete the
exploratory well as a producing well.) the accounting standards provide a number of indicators that
can assist an entity in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in
assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.

of the $1,877 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at december

firmly planned for the near future. the $938 balance is related to 21 projects in areas requiring a
major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts
were not under way or firmly planned for the near future. additional drilling was not deemed
necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities
were in process to enable a future decision on project development.
the projects for the $938 referenced above had the following activities associated with
assessing the reserves and the projects economic viability: (a) $322 (six projects)  development
alternatives under review; (b) $283 (five projects)  development concept under review by
government; (c) $208 (seven projects)  undergoing front-end engineering and design with final

compensation expense for stock options for
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $265 ($172 after tax), $229 ($149 after tax) and $182 ($119 after tax),
respectively. in addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance units and restricted stock units was $214 ($139 after tax), $194 ($126 after tax) and
$170 ($110 after tax) for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. no significant stock-based
compensation cost was capitalized at december31, 2011 and 2010.
cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $948, $385 and $147, respectively. actual tax benefits realized for the tax
deductions from option exercises were $121, $66 and $25 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $151, $140 and $89 for
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
chevron long-term incentive plan (ltip) awards under the ltip may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. from april2004 through january2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the ltip, and no more than 64million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient. for the major types of awards outstanding as of december31, 2011,
the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance units and 10years for the stock
options and stock appreciation rights.
texaco stock incentive plan (texaco sip) on the closing of the acquisition of texaco in october
2001, outstanding options granted under the texaco sip were converted to chevron options. these
options, which had 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. this provision enabled a participant who exercised a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who had shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. the
restored options were fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price
was the market value of the common stock on the day the restored option was granted. beginning in
2007, restored options were issued under the ltip. no further awards may be granted under the
former texaco plans.
unocal share-based plans (unocal plans) when chevron acquired unocal in august2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various unocal plans were exchanged for
fully vested chevron options and appreciation rights. these awards retained the same provisions as
the original unocal plans. unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to
expire through early 2015.

the total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the
market price) of options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $668, $259 and $91, respectively.
during this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of
these awards.
as of december31, 2011, there was $265 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost
related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans.
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7years.
at january1, 2011, the number of ltip performance units outstanding was equivalent to
2,727,874 shares. during 2011, 1,011,200 units were granted, 810,071 units vested with cash
proceeds distributed to recipients and 47,167 units were forfeited. at december31, 2011, units
outstanding were 2,881,836, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was
$294. in addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under
various ltip and former texaco and unocal programs totaled approximately 2.2million equivalent
shares as of december31, 2011. a liability of $62 was recorded for these awards.
note 21
employee benefit plans
the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically
prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where
prefunding provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified plans are subject to
the employee retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the company does not
typically fund u.s. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under
laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and
investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives.
the company also sponsors other postretirement (opeb)plans that provide medical and dental
benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans are
unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. medical coverage for medicare-eligible
retirees in the companys main u.s. medical plan is secondary to medicare (including partd) and
the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4
percent each year. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.
under accounting standards for postretirement benefits (asc 715), the company recognizes the
overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset
or liability on the consolidated balance sheet.

net actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at
december31, 2011, for the companys u.s. pension, international pension and opeb plans are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 12 and eight years, respectively. these
amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to
receive benefits under the plans. these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10percent
of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. the
amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. during 2012, the company
estimates actuarial losses of $476, $142 and $75 will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international pension and
opeb plans, respectively. in addition, the company estimates an additional $260 will be recognized
from accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2012 related to lump-sum settlement costs from
u.s. pension plans.
the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits)
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31, 2011, was approximately six and
seven years for u.s. and international pension plans, respectively, and two years for other
postretirement benefit plans. during 2012, the company estimates prior service (credits)costs of
$(8), $21 and $(72) will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s. pension,
international pension and opeb plans, respectively.

expected return on plan assets the companys estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets
are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future
performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class
risk factors. asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability
studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.
there have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for u.s. plans, which account for 70percent of the companys pension plan assets. at december31,
2011, the estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.8percent.
the market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end
measurement date, as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting
rules. management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year.
for other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.
discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2011, the company selected a 3.8
percent discount rate for the u.s. pension plans and 4.0percent for the u.s. postretirement
benefit plan. this rate was based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit
payments to the citigroup pension discount yield curve as of year-end 2011. the discount rates at
the end of 2010 and 2009 were 4.8 and 5.3percent and 5.0 and 5.8percent for the u.s. pension
plans and the u.s. opeb plan, respectively.
other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
december31, 2011, for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care
cost-trend rates start with 8percent in 2012 and gradually decline to 5percent for 2023 and
beyond. for this measurement at december31, 2010, the assumed health care cost-trend rates
started with 8percent in 2011 and gradually declined to 5percent for 2018 and beyond. in both
measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4percent.
assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for retiree health care costs. the impact is mitigated by the 4percent cap on the companys
medical contributions for the primary u.s. plan. a one-percentage-point change in the assumed
health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

plan assets and investment strategy the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value
the pension assets is divided into three levels:
level 1: fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices for the
assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability to
access.
level 2: fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets
in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means. if the asset has a
contractual term, the level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of the asset.
the fair values for level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker quotes,
independent pricing services and exchanges.

u.s. equities include investments in the companys common stock in the amount of
$35 at december31, 2011, and $38 at december31, 2010.
collective trusts/mutual funds for u.s. plans are entirely index funds; for
international plans, they are mostly index funds. for these index funds, the level 2
designation is
partially based on the restriction that advance notification of redemptions, typically
two business days, is required.
mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income
instruments in order to diversify and lower risk.
the year-end valuations of the u.s. real estate assets are based on internal
appraisals by the real estate managers, which are updates of third-party appraisals that
occur at least once
a year for each property in the portfolio.
the other asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not
yet settled (level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (level 2);
insurance contracts
and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (level 3).

the primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate
of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential
downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit
payments and portfolio management.
the companys u.s. and u.k. pension plans comprise 86percent of the total pension assets.
both the u.s. and u.k. plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to
review the asset holdings and their returns. to assess the plans investment performance, long-term
asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
for the primary u.s. pension plan, the chevron board of directors has established the
following approved asset allocation ranges: equities 4070percent, fixed income and cash 2065
percent, real estate 015percent, and other 05percent. for the u.k. pension plan, the u.k. board
of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed
regularly: equities 6080percent and fixed income and cash 2040percent. the other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that
vary by plan. actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current
economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. to mitigate
concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active
investment managers and passive index funds.
the company does not prefund its opeb obligations.
cash contributions and benefit payments in 2011, the company contributed $1,147 and $319 to
its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. in 2012, the
company expects contributions to be approximately $600 and $300 to its u.s. and international
pension plans, respectively. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns,
changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional
funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in
plan obligations.
the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $223 in
2012, compared with $198 paid in 2011.
the following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to
be paid by the company in the next 10years:

employee savings investment plan eligible employees of chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the chevron employee savings investment plan (esip).
charges to expense for the esip represent the companys contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop), which is
described in the section that follows. total company matching contributions to employee accounts
within the esip were $263, $253 and $257 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. this cost was
reduced by the value of shares released from the

note
employee benefit plans - continued
lesop totaling $38, $97 and $184 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. the remaining
amounts, totaling $225, $156 and $73 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, represent open market
purchases.
employee stock ownership plan within the chevron esip is an employee stock ownership plan (esop).
in 1989, chevron established a lesop as a constituent part of the esop. the lesop provides
partial prefunding of the companys future commitments to the esip.
as permitted by accounting standards for share-based compensation (asc 718), the debt of the
lesop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred
compensation and benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated
statement of equity.
the company reports compensation expense equal to lesop debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the lesop for debt service. interest accrued on lesop debt is
recorded as interest expense. dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. all lesop shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share
computations.
total credits to expense for the lesop were $1, $1 and $3 in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. the net credit for the respective years was composed of credits to compensation
expense of $5, $6 and $15 and charges to interest expense for lesop debt of $4, $5 and $12.
of the dividends paid on the lesop shares, $18, $46 and $110 were used in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively, to service lesop debt. no contributions were required in 2011, 2010 or 2009,
as dividends received by the lesop were sufficient to satisfy lesop debt service.
shares held in the lesop are released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants
based on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of current-year
and remaining debt service. lesop shares as of december31, 2011 and 2010, were as follows:

benefit plan trusts prior to its acquisition by chevron, texaco established a benefit plan trust
for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. at year-end 2011, the trust contained
14.2million shares of chevron treasury stock. the trust will sell the shares or use the
dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such
benefits. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the
trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts
beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share
purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.
prior to its acquisition by chevron, unocal established various grantor trusts to fund
obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental
retirement plans. at december31, 2011 and 2010, trust assets of $51 and $57, respectively, were
invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.
employee incentive plans the chevron incentive plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible
employees that links awards to corporate, unit and individual performance in the prior year.
charges to expense for cash bonuses were $1,217, $766 and $561 in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. chevron also has the ltip for officers and other regular salaried employees of the
company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. awards under the
ltip consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in note 20,
beginning on page fs-48.

equity
retained earnings at december31, 2011 and 2010, included approximately $10,127 and $9,159,

at december31, 2011, about 67million shares of chevrons common stock remained available for
issuance from the 160million shares that were reserved for issuance under the chevron ltip. in
addition, approximately 258,000 shares remain available for issuance from the 800,000 shares of the
companys common stock that were reserved for awards under the chevron corporation non-employee
directors equity compensation and deferral plan.

restructuring and reorganization
in the first quarter 2010, the company announced employee reduction programs related to the
restructuring and reorganization of its downstream businesses and corporate staffs. total
terminations under the programs are expected to be approximately 2,700 employees. about 1,300 of
the affected employees are located in the united states. about 2,500 employees have been terminated
through december31, 2011, and the programs were substantially completed by the end of 2011.
substantially all of the remaining employees designated for termination under the programs are
expected to leave in 2012.
a before-tax charge of $244 was recorded in first quarter 2010 associated with these programs,
of which $138 remained outstanding at december31, 2010. during 2011,

other contingencies and commitments
income taxes the company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have
been calculated. refer to note 15, beginning on page fs-43, for a discussion of the periods for
which tax returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion
for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the company
does not expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions to
have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or
liquidity.
guarantees the companys guarantee of approximately $600 is associated with certain payments
under a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. the terminal commenced
operations in third quarter 2011. over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum
guarantee amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are
numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery
of amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under
this guarantee.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon
and motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the
companys interests in those investments. through the end of 2011, the company paid $48 under
these indemnities and continues to be obligated up to $250 for possible additional
indemnification payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
of assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva, or that
occurred during the
period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the environmental
conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to december2001.
claims had to be asserted by february2009 for equilon indemnities and must be asserted no later
than february2012 for motiva indemnities. in february2012, motiva enterprises llc delivered a
letter to the company purporting to preserve unmatured claims for certain motiva indemnities. the
letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount. management does not believe this
letter or any other information provides a basis to estimate the amount, if any, of a range of loss
or potential range of loss with respect to either the equilon or the
motiva indemnities. under
the terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future
payments. the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or
motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. the acquirer of those
assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which
had been reached at december31, 2009. under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200
obligation, chevron is solely responsible until april2022, when the indemnification expires. the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
the sale of the assets in 1997.
although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable
and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect
to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements
typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs,
utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys
business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these

environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private
claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements
or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects
on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the
company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.
chevrons environmental reserve as of december31, 2011, was $1,404. included in this balance
were remediation activities at approximately 180 sites for which the company had been identified as
a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental
protection agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund
law or analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2011 was
$185. the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability
for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require
chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites
are not expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2011 environmental reserves balance of $1,219, $675 related to the
companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations
(i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. the remaining $544 was
associated with various sites in international downstream ($95), upstream ($368) and other
businesses ($81). liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state
and local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2011 had a recorded liability that
was material to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.
refer to note 25 on page fs-58 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations.
other contingencies on april26, 2010, a california appeals court issued a ruling related to the
adequacy of an environmental impact report (eir)supporting the issuance of certain permits by the
city of richmond, california, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at chevrons refinery in
richmond. settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and on
march3, 2011, the trial court entered a final judgment and peremptory writ ordering the city to
set aside the project eir and conditional use permits and enjoining chevron from any further work.
on may23, 2011, the company filed an application with the city planning department for a
conditional use permit for a revised project to complete construction of the hydrogen plant,
certain sulfur removal facilities and related infrastructure. on june10, 2011, the city published
its notice of preparation of the revised eir for the project. the revised
fs-57
table of contents
note
other contingencies and commitments - continued
and recirculated eir is intended to comply with the appeals court decision. management
believes the outcomes associated with the project are uncertain. due to the uncertainty of the
companys future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or combination of actions,
management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any, can be made at this time.
however, the companys ultimate exposure may be significant to net income in any one future period.
chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; u.s. federal,
state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. the amounts
of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to
resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
note 25
asset retirement obligations
the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (aro)as an
asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. the legal obligation to perform the
asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing
and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control. this uncertainty about the
timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when
sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. recognition of the aro includes:
(1)the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2)the subsequent accretion of that
liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates
and discount rates.
aros are primarily recorded for the companys crude oil and natural gas producing assets. no
significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have
been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of
the fair value of the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream
long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a
retirement obligation.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2011, 2010 and 2009:

table v reserve quantity information
reserves governance the company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource
classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum
engineers, the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists. the
system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting  three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. within the commercial
classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. the
potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. for reserves
estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all sec and company standards.
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known
reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. net
proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual
arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.
proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. proved developed reserves
are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of
reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and
engineers. as part of the
internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a reserves advisory
committee (rac)that is chaired by the corporate reserves manager, who is a member of a corporate
department that reports directly to the vice chairman responsible for the companys worldwide
exploration and production activities. the corporate reserves manager, who acts as chairman of the
rac, has more than 30years experience working in the oil and gas industry and a master of science
in petroleum engineering degree from stanford university. his experience includes more than
15years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. he was the chairman of the society of
petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee, currently serves on the united nations expert
group on resources classification, and is an active member of the society of petroleum evaluation
engineers. he is also a past member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training and the
california conservation committee.
all rac members are degreed professionals, each with more than 15years experience in various
aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth
science, or finance. the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves
classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. the reserves
activities are managed by two operating company-level reserves managers. these two reserves
managers are not members of the rac so as to preserve the corporate-level independence.
the rac has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used
within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the
business units recommended reserves

estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with
sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate
standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which provides
standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
during
the year, the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream
business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. major
changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee, whose members include
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. the companys annual reserve activity
is also reviewed with the board of directors. if major changes to reserves were to occur between
the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the board.
rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have
large proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve
records and documentation of their compliance with the corporate reserves manual.
technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions in 2011 in 2011, additions to
chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies.
information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure
testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic, regional geologic studies,
and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves
estimates. both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools including reservoir
simulation, geologic modeling, and seismic processing have been used in the interpretation of the
subsurface data. these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and
the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and
consistent reserves estimates.
proved undeveloped reserve quantities at the end of 2011, proved undeveloped reserves for
consolidated companies totaled 3.7billion barrels of oil-equivalent (boe). approximately 68
percent of these reserves are attributed to natural gas, of which about 60percent were located
in australia. crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids
fs-68
table of contents
table v
reserve quantity information - continued
(ngls) accounted for about 29percent of the total, with the largest concentration of
these reserves in africa, asia and the united states. synthetic oil accounted for the balance of
the proved undeveloped reserves and was located in canada in the other americas region.
proved undeveloped reserves of equity affiliates amounted to 1.3billion boe. at year-end,
crude oil, condensate and ngls represented 61percent of these reserves, with tco accounting for
the majority of this amount. natural gas represented 25percent of the total, with approximately 43
percent of those reserves from tco. the remaining proved undeveloped reserves are attributed to
synthetic oil in venezuela.
in 2011, a total of 220million boe was transferred from proved undeveloped to proved
developed for consolidated companies. in the united states, approximately 90million boe were
transferred, primarily due to ongoing drilling activities in california and other locations. in
asia, 55million boe were transferred to proved developed primarily driven by the start-up of a gas
project in thailand. the start up of several small projects in africa, europe and other americas
accounted for the remainder.
affiliated companies had transfers of 25million boe from proved undeveloped to proved
developed.
investment to convert proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves during 2011, investments
totaling approximately $6.7billion were made by consolidated companies and equity affiliates to
advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. in australia, $2.1billion was expended,
which was primarily driven by construction activities at the gorgon lng project. in africa, $1.4
billion was expended on various projects, including offshore development projects in nigeria and
angola. in nigeria, construction progressed on a deepwater project and development activities
continued at a natural gas processing plant. in angola, offshore development drilling was
progressed along with several gas injection projects. in asia, expenditures during the year totaled
$1.0billion, which included construction of a gas processing facility in thailand, a gas
development project in china and development activities in indonesia. in the united states,
expenditures totaled $0.9billion for offshore development projects in the gulf of mexico. in other
americas, development expenditures totaled $0.9billion for a variety of projects, including an
offshore development project in brazil. in europe, $0.1billion was expended on various development
projects.
the companys share of affiliated companies expenditures was $0.3billion, primarily on
an lng project in angola and development activities in kazakhstan.
proved undeveloped reserves for five years or more reserves that remain proved undeveloped for
five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and
execution, such as the complex nature of the development project
in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that
dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and
contractual limitations that dictate production levels.
at year-end 2011, the company held approximately 1.8billion boe of proved undeveloped
reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. the reserves are held by
consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the
company has a proven track record of developing major projects.
in africa, approximately 330million boe is related to deepwater and natural gas developments
in nigeria and angola. major nigerian deepwater development projects include agbami, which started
production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full utilization of
infrastructure capacity, and the usan development, which is expected to start production in 2012.
also in nigeria, various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects are
currently under development.
in asia, approximately 240million boe remain classified as proved undeveloped. the majority
of the volumes relate to ongoing development activities in the pattani field (thailand) and the
malampaya field (philippines) that are scheduled to maintain production within contractual and
infrastructure constraints. the balance relates to infrastructure constraints in azerbaijan.
in australia, approximately 110million boe remain classified as undeveloped due to a
compression project at the north west shelf venture, which is scheduled for start-up in 2013.
in the united states, approximately 70million boe remain proved undeveloped, primarily
related to a steamflood expansion and deepwater development projects. in other americas and europe,
approximately 50million boe is related to contractual constraints, infrastructure limitations and
future compression projects.
affiliated companies have approximately 1.0billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves held
for five years or more. the tco affiliate in kazakhstan accounts for approximately 880million boe.
field production is constrained by plant capacity limitations. further field development to convert
the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion.
in venezuela, the affiliate that operates the hamaca fields synthetic heavy oil upgrading
operation accounts for about 120million boe of these proved undeveloped reserves. development
drilling continues at hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity.
annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances,
such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a
revision to reserve estimates. for 2011, this assessment did not result in any material changes in
reserves classified as proved undeveloped. over the past three years,
fs-69
table of contents
table v
reserve quantity information - continued
the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between
37percent and 44percent. the consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio
in a narrow range over this time period.
proved reserve quantities at december31, 2011, proved reserves for the companys consolidated
operations were 8.5billion boe. (refer to the term reserves on page e-11 for the definition of
oil-equivalent reserves.) approximately 23percent of the total reserves were located in the united
states. for the companys interests in equity affiliates, proved reserves were 2.7billion boe, 78
percent of which were associated with the companys 50percent ownership in tco.
aside from the tengiz field in the tco affiliate, no single property accounted for more than 5
percent of the companys total oil-equivalent proved reserves. about 22 other individual properties
in the companys portfolio of assets each contained between 1percent and 5percent of the
companys oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for 47percent of the
companys total oil-equivalent proved reserves. these properties were geographically dispersed,
located in the united states, canada, south america, africa, asia and australia.
in the united states, total proved reserves at year-end 2011 were 1.9billion boe. california
properties accounted for 35percent of the u.s. reserves, with most classified as heavy oil.
because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need
to employ enhanced recovery methods, most of the companys heavy-oil fields in california employ a
continuous steamflooding process. the gulf of mexico region contains 24percent of the u.s.
reserves, with liquids representing about 77percent of reserves in the gulf. production operations
are mostly offshore and, as a result, are also capital intensive. other u.s. areas represent the
remaining 41percent of u.s. reserves, with liquids accounting for about 42percent of the total.
for production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including waterflood
and co2 injection.
for the three years ending december31, 2011, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. apart from acquisitions, the
companys ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and
circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, opec constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.
the companys estimated net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and
synthetic oil and changes thereto for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 are shown in the table on the
following page. the companys estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page fs-73.

ending reserve balances in north america were 13, 14 and 12
and in south america were 100, 94 and 92 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
prospective reporting effective december31, 2009, in accordance with the sec rule on modernization of oil and gas reporting.
reserves associated with canada.
ending reserve balances in africa were 38, 36 and 31 and in south america were 119, 121 and 120 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
included are year-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (psc) (refer to page e-11 for the definition of a psc). psc-related reserve quantities are
22percent, 24percent and 26percent for consolidated companies for 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved reserve changes for 2009
through 2011 are discussed below:
revisions in 2009, net revisions increased reserves by 355million barrels for worldwide
consolidated companies and decreased reserves by 187million barrels for equity affiliates. for
consolidated companies, the largest increase was 460million barrels in other americas due to the
inclusion of synthetic oil related to canadian oil sands. in the united states, reserves increased
63million barrels as a result of development drilling and performance revisions. the increases
were partially offset by decreases of 121million barrels in asia and 46million barrels in africa.
in asia, decreases in indonesia and azerbaijan were driven by the effect of higher 12-month average
prices on the calculation of reserves associated with production-sharing contracts and the effect
of reservoir performance revisions. in africa, reserves in nigeria declined as a result of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts as well as reservoir performance.
for affiliated companies, tco declined by 184million barrels primarily due to the effect of
higher 12-month average prices on royalty determination. for other affiliated companies, 266
million barrels of heavy crude oil were reclassified to synthetic oil for the activities in
venezuela.
in 2010, net revisions increased reserves 103million barrels for consolidated companies and
decreased reserves 21million barrels for affiliated companies. for consolidated companies,
improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 63million barrel increase in the
united states. increases in the other regions were partially offset by asia, which decreased as a
result of the effect of higher prices on production-sharing contracts in kazakhstan. for affiliated
companies, the price effect on royalty determination at tco decreased reserves by 33million
barrels. this was partially offset by improved reservoir performance and development drilling in
venezuela.

reserve quantity information - continued
in 2011, net revisions increased reserves 197million barrels for consolidated
companies and increased reserves 38million barrels for affiliated companies. for consolidated
companies, improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 63million barrel
increase in the united states. in africa, improved field performance drove the 60million barrel
increase. in asia, increases from improved reservoir performance were partially offset by the
effects of higher prices on production-sharing contracts. synthetic oil reserves in canada
increased by 32million barrels, primarily due to geotechnical revisions. for affiliated companies,
improved facility and reservoir performance was partially offset by the price effect on royalty
determination at tco. continued development drilling increased reserves in venezuela.
improved recovery in 2009, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 86million barrels
worldwide. consolidated companies accounted for 50million barrels. the largest addition was
related to improved secondary recovery in nigeria. affiliated companies increased reserves 36
million barrels due to improvements related to the tco sour gas injection/second generation plant
(sgi/sgp) facilities.
in 2010, improved recovery increased volumes by 77million barrels worldwide. for consolidated
companies, reserves in africa increased 58million barrels due primarily to secondary recovery
performance in nigeria. reserves in the united states increased 11million, primarily in
california. affiliated companies increased reserves 3million barrels.
in 2011, improved recovery increased volumes by 58million barrels worldwide. for consolidated
companies, reserves in africa increased 48million barrels due primarily to secondary recovery
performance in nigeria. reserves in the united states increased by 6million, primarily in
california. other americas increased 4million barrels.
extensions and discoveries in 2009, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 52
million barrels worldwide. the largest additions were 20million barrels in australia related to
the gorgon project and 13million barrels in other americas related to delineation drilling in
argentina. africa and the united states accounted for 10million barrels and 6million barrels,
respectively.
in 2010, extensions and discoveries increased consolidated companies reserves 63million
barrels worldwide. the united states and other americas each increased reserves 19million barrels,
and asia increased reserves 16million barrels. no single area in the united states was
individually significant. drilling activity in argentina and brazil accounted for the majority of
the increase in other americas. in asia, the increase was primarily related to activity in
azerbaijan.
in 2011, extensions and discoveries increased consolidated companies reserves 299million
barrels worldwide. in the united states, additions related to two gulf of mexico projects resulted
in the majority of the 140million barrel increase. in australia, the wheatstone project increased
liquid volumes 65million barrels. africa and other americas increased reserves 34million and 30
million barrels, respectively, following the start of new projects in these areas. in europe, a new
project in the united kingdom increased reserves 26million barrels. in asia, reserves increased 4
million barrels.
purchases in 2011, purchases increased worldwide liquid volumes 42million barrels. the
acquisition of additional acreage in canada increased synthetic oil reserves 40million barrels.

ending reserve balances in north america and south america were 19, 21, 23 and 1,645, 1,794, 1,962 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
ending reserve balances in africa and south america were 1,016, 953, 898 and 187, 157, 165 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
total as sold volumes are 4.4 bcf, 4.5 bcf and 4.5 bcf for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
includes reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (psc)
(refer to page e-11 for the definition of a psc). psc-related reserve quantities are
21percent, 29percent and 31percent for consolidated companies for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas proved-reserve changes for
2009 through 2011 are discussed below:
revisions in 2009, net revisions increased reserves 569 bcf for consolidated companies and
decreased reserves 44 bcf for affiliated companies. for consolidated companies, net increases were
493 bcf in asia, primarily as a result of reservoir studies in bangladesh and development drilling
in thailand. these results were partially offset by a downward revision due to the impact of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts in myanmar. in australia, the 166 bcf increase in reserves
resulted from improved reservoir performance and compression. in other americas, reserves decreased
126 bcf, driven primarily by the effect of higher prices on production-sharing contracts in
trinidad and tobago. in the united states, a net increase of 39 bcf was the result of development
drilling in the gulf of mexico, partially offset by performance revisions in the california and
mid-continent areas.
for equity affiliates, a downward revision of 237 bcf at tco was due to the effect of higher
prices on royalty determination and an increase in gas injection for sgi/sgp facilities. this
decline was partially offset by performance and drilling opportunities related to the angola lng
project.
in 2010, net revisions increased reserves by 197 bcf for consolidated companies, which was
more than offset by a 268 bcf decrease in net revisions for affiliated companies. for consolidated
companies, a net increase in the united states of 220 bcf, primarily in the mid-continent area and
the gulf of mexico, was the result of a number of small upward revisions related to improved
reservoir performance and drilling activity, none of which were individually significant. the
increase was partially offset by downward revisions due to the impact of higher prices on
production-sharing contracts in asia. for equity affiliates, a downward revision of 324 bcf at tco
was due to the price effect on royalty determination and a change in the variable-royalty
calculation. this decline was partially offset by the recognition of additional reserves related to
the angola lng project.
fs-73
table of contents
table v
reserve quantity information - continued
in 2011, net revisions increased reserves 415 bcf for consolidated companies and
increased reserves 82 bcf for affiliated companies. for consolidated companies, improved reservoir
performance accounted for a majority of the 217 bcf increase in the united states. in asia, a net
increase of 196 bcf was driven by development drilling and improved field performance in thailand,
partially offset by the effects of higher prices on production-sharing contracts in kazakhstan. in
other americas, a negative performance revision in trinidad and tobago was partially offset by
increases in colombia from drilling activities and the reactivation of an existing field. for
affiliated companies, ongoing reservoir assessment resulted in the recognition of additional
reserves related to the angola lng project. at tco, improved facility and reservoir performance was
more than offset by the price effect on royalty determination.
extensions and discoveries in 2009, worldwide extensions and discoveries of 4,387 bcf were
attributed to consolidated companies. in australia, the gorgon project accounted for all of the
4,276 bcf additions. in asia, development drilling in thailand accounted for the majority of the
increase. in the united states, delineation drilling in california accounted for the majority of
the increase.
in 2011, extensions and discoveries increased consolidated companies reserves 4,680 bcf
worldwide. in australia, the wheatstone project accounted for the 4,035 bcf in additions. in
africa, the start of a new natural gas development project in nigeria resulted in the 290 bcf
increase. in the united states, development drilling accounted for the majority of the 287 bcf
increase.
purchases in 2011, purchases increased worldwide reserves 1,233 bcf. in the united states,
acquisitions in the marcellus shale increased reserves 1,230 bcf.
sales in 2009, worldwide sales of 117 bcf were related to consolidated companies. for other
americas, the sale of properties in argentina accounted for 84 bcf. the sale of properties in the
gulf of mexico accounted for the majority of the 33 bcf decrease in the united states.
in 2011, sales decreased consolidated companies reserves 174 bcf worldwide. in australia, the
wheatstone project unitization and equity sales agreements reduced reserves 77 bcf. in the united
states, sales in alaska and other smaller fields reduced reserves 95 bcf.

standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows related to proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding
proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the fasb.
estimated future cash inflows from production are computed by applying 12-month average prices for
oil and gas to year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are
limited to those provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting
year. future development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to
develop and produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming
continuation of year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement
obligations. estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end
statutory tax rates. these rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to
estimated future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. discounted future net
cash flows are calculated
using 10percent midperiod discount factors. discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when
future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.
the information provided does not represent managements estimate of the companys expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. estimates of proved-reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. the
valuation prescribed by the fasb requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future
development and production costs. the calculations are made as of december31 each year and should
not be relied upon as an indication of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil and gas
reserves. in the following table, standardized measure net cash flows refers to the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows.
