SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON

CORPORATION,

*

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL,

MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS, MINING OPERATIONS, POWER

GENERATION AND ENERGY SERVICES. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS; PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND

REGASIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS;

TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL EXPORT

PIPELINES; TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS;

AND A

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

PROJECT. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REFINING

CRUDE OIL INTO PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL AND

REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS BY

PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR; AND

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS,

PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT ADDITIVES.

A LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES

E-4

AND

E-5.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, CHEVRON HAD APPROXIMATELY

61,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT 3,800 SERVICE STATION

EMPLOYEES). APPROXIMATELY 30,000 EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING ABOUT

3,500 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES), OR 49 PERCENT, WERE

EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED BY SUPPLY

AND DEMAND. THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM

EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE WORLDS SWING

PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL AND THEIR PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE A MAJOR

FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY. DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND

ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE

CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH

WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO OTHER ENERGY SOURCES

ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE

ENVIRONMENT AFFECT WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT THEIR

OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME CASES,

LIMIT THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON

COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED, MAJOR GLOBAL PETROLEUM

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM

COMPANIES, FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LEASES AND OTHER PROPERTIES AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR

REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CHEVRON ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY

INTEGRATED, MAJOR PETROLEUM COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT

REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND CHEMICALS ENTITIES AND

NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES IN THE SALE OR ACQUISITION OF

VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS.

INCORPORATED

IN DELAWARE IN 1926 AS STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE NAME CHEVRON CORPORATION IN 1984 AND

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION IN 2001. IN 2005, CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION CHANGED ITS NAME TO CHEVRON CORPORATION. AS USED IN

THIS REPORT, THE TERM CHEVRON AND SUCH TERMS AS

THE COMPANY, THE CORPORATION,

OUR, WE AND US MAY REFER TO

CHEVRON CORPORATION, ONE OR MORE OF ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES, OR ALL OF THEM TAKEN AS A WHOLE, BUT UNLESS STATED

OTHERWISE IT DOES NOT INCLUDE AFFILIATES OF

CHEVRON  I.E., THOSE COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE

EQUITY METHOD (GENERALLY OWNED 50 PERCENT OR LESS) OR

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD. ALL OF THESE TERMS

ARE USED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED AS A PRECISE

DESCRIPTION OF ANY OF THE SEPARATE COMPANIES, EACH OF WHICH

MANAGES ITS OWN AFFAIRS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEVRONS

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

CHEVRONS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE

AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINED FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM ITS OPERATIONS THAT

WILL ENABLE IT TO OUTPERFORM ITS COMPETITORS. IN THE UPSTREAM,

THE COMPANYS STRATEGIES ARE TO GROW PROFITABLY IN CORE

AREAS, BUILD NEW LEGACY POSITIONS AND COMMERCIALIZE THE

COMPANYS EQUITY NATURAL GAS RESOURCE BASE WHILE GROWING A

HIGH-IMPACT GLOBAL NATURAL GAS BUSINESS. IN THE DOWNSTREAM, THE

STRATEGIES ARE TO IMPROVE RETURNS AND GROW EARNINGS ACROSS THE

VALUE CHAIN. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY

ACROSS ALL ITS BUSINESSES TO DIFFERENTIATE PERFORMANCE, AND TO

INVEST IN PROFITABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY

SOLUTIONS.

(B)

DESCRIPTION

OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY, WITH

OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA

AND AUSTRALIA. TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES, EARNINGS AND INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND ASSETS AS OF THE END OF 2011 AND

2010  FOR THE UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANYS

INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS  ARE IN NOTE 11

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-37.

SIMILAR COMPARATIVE DATA FOR THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN

AND INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT ARE IN NOTES 12 AND 13 ON PAGES FS-39 THROUGH

FS-41.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2011 WERE $29.1 BILLION, INCLUDING

$1.7 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

EQUITY-AFFILIATE EXPENDITURES. IN 2010 AND 2009, EXPENDITURES

WERE $21.8 BILLION AND $22.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES

EXPENDITURES OF $1.4 BILLION IN 2010 AND $1.6 BILLION

IN 2009.

OF THE $29.1 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2011,

89 PERCENT, OR $25.9 BILLION, WAS RELATED TO UPSTREAM

ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY 87 AND 80 PERCENT WAS EXPENDED

FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 68 PERCENT OF

THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IN 2011, ABOUT 82 PERCENT

IN 2010 AND ABOUT 80 PERCENT IN 2009. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE

THE ACQUISITION OF ATLAS ENERGY, INC. IN 2011. REFER TO A

DISCUSSION OF THE ACQUISITION OF ATLAS ENERGY, INC., IN

NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON

PAGE FS-30.

IN 2012, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE $32.7 BILLION, INCLUDING

$3 BILLION OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. APPROXIMATELY

87 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, OR $28.5 BILLION, IS BUDGETED

FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH

$22.3 BILLION, OR ABOUT 78 PERCENT, OF THIS AMOUNT FOR

PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

REFER ALSO TO A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES ON PAGES FS-11 THROUGH FS-12.

UPSTREAM

THE TABLE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE SUMMARIZES THE NET PRODUCTION OF

LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS FOR 2011 AND 2010 BY THE COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES. WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS

2.673 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN ABOUT THREE PERCENT

FROM 2010. THE DECREASE WAS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH NORMAL FIELD

DECLINES, MAINTENANCE-RELATED DOWNTIME AND THE IMPACT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON ENTITLEMENT VOLUMES. THE

START-UP

AND

RAMP-UP

OF

SEVERAL MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS  THE PERDIDO PROJECT

IN THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO, THE EXPANSION AT THE ATHABASCA

OIL SANDS PROJECT IN CANADA, THE FRADE FIELD IN BRAZIL, AND THE

PLATONG II NATURAL GAS PROJECT IN THAILAND  AS

WELL AS ACQUISITIONS IN THE MARCELLUS SHALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET

THE DECREASE IN NET PRODUCTION FROM 2010. REFER TO THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-6

FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE

2009  2011 CHANGES IN PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, AND NATURAL GAS.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS AVERAGE WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN 2012 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 2.680 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY BASED ON THE AVERAGE BRENT PRICE OF $111 PER

BARREL IN 2011. THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS AND

UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC,

PRICE EFFECTS ON ENTITLEMENT VOLUMES, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR

RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF COMPANY OPERATIONS, DELAYS IN

PROJECT STARTUPS, FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN

VARIOUS MARKETS, WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY SHUT IN PRODUCTION,

CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING GEOPOLITICS, DELAYS IN COMPLETION OF

MAINTENANCE TURNAROUNDS,

GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED

DECLINES IN PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS

TO OPERATIONS. THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IS ALSO

AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW, LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG

BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION.

REFER TO THE REVIEW OF ONGOING EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES IN KEY AREAS, BEGINNING ON PAGE 8, FOR A

COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY SELLS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FROM ITS PRODUCING

OPERATIONS UNDER A VARIETY OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. MOST

CONTRACTS GENERALLY COMMIT THE COMPANY TO SELL QUANTITIES BASED

ON PRODUCTION FROM SPECIFIED PROPERTIES, BUT SOME NATURAL GAS

SALES CONTRACTS SPECIFY DELIVERY OF FIXED AND DETERMINABLE

QUANTITIES, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO

DELIVER TO THIRD PARTIES 232 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL

GAS THROUGH 2014. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE

CONTRACTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EQUITY PRODUCTION FROM THE

COMPANYS PROVED DEVELOPED U.S. RESERVES AND

THIRD-PARTY PURCHASES. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF

PRICING TERMS, INCLUDING BOTH INDEXED AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY

COMMITTED TO DELIVER A TOTAL OF 891 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS FROM 2012 THROUGH 2014 FROM OPERATIONS IN AUSTRALIA,

COLOMBIA, DENMARK AND THE PHILIPPINES TO THIRD PARTIES. THE

SALES CONTRACTS CONTAIN VARIABLE PRICING FORMULAS THAT ARE

GENERALLY REFERENCED TO THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE FOR CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS OR OTHER PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AT THE TIME OF

DELIVERY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE CONTRACTS

FROM QUANTITIES AVAILABLE FROM PRODUCTION OF THE COMPANYS

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES IN THESE COUNTRIES.

THE FIRST PRODUCTION WELL OF THE SECOND PHASE IS EXPECTED BY

2013. INITIAL PROVED RESERVES FOR THE TAHITI 2 PROJECT WERE

RECOGNIZED IN 2011, AND THE FIELD HAS AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION

LIFE OF 30 YEARS.

THE FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION WAS MADE FOR THE TUBULAR BELLS

DEEPWATER PROJECT IN FOURTH QUARTER 2011. THE COMPANY HAS A

42.9 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST IN THE TUBULAR

BELLS UNITIZED AREA AFTER RECEIVING AN ADDITIONAL

12.9 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST RELINQUISHED BY A PARTNER IN

2011. DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN SECOND

QUARTER 2012, AND PLANS INCLUDE THREE PRODUCING AND TWO

INJECTION WELLS, WITH A SUBSEA TIEBACK TO A THIRD-PARTY

PRODUCTION FACILITY. FIRST OIL IS ANTICIPATED IN 2014, AND

46,000 BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY. PROVED RESERVES

HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THE PROJECT.

THE COMPANY HAS A 15.6 PERCENT NONOPERATED WORKING INTEREST

IN THE MAD DOG II PROJECT. FRONT-END ENGINEERING AND DESIGN

(FEED) IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE BY SECOND QUARTER 2012. IT IS

ANTICIPATED THAT THIS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WOULD REQUIRE NEW

PRODUCTION FACILITIES TO SUPPORT PLANNED MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY

PRODUCTION OF 120,000 TO 140,000 BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT.

AT THE END OF 2011, PROVED RESERVES HAD NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR

THIS PROJECT.

PROJECT.

DEEPWATER EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES IN 2011 INCLUDED PARTICIPATION

IN FOUR EXPLORATORY WELLS  TWO WILDCATS, ONE

APPRAISAL AND ONE DELINEATION. FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL PERMITTING

UNDER NEW, MORE STRINGENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR

GUIDELINES, TWO WELLS RESUMED DRILLING ACTIVITIES AFTER

OPERATIONS WERE HALTED IN 2010 AS A RESULT OF THE DEEPWATER

DRILLING MORATORIUM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. DRILLING OPERATIONS

AT THE 43.8 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED MOCCASIN PROSPECT

RESUMED IN FIRST QUARTER 2011 AND RESULTED IN A NEW DISCOVERY IN

THE LOWER TERTIARY WILCOX TREND. DRILLING OPERATIONS RESUMED IN

SECOND QUARTER 2011 AT THE 55 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED

BUCKSKIN PROSPECT, RESULTING IN A SUCCESSFUL APPRAISAL WELL.

THESE TWO DISCOVERIES, LOCATED 12 MILES APART, COULD

FACILITATE FUTURE CO-DEVELOPMENT UPON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION

OF ADDITIONAL APPRAISAL DRILLING PLANNED AT EACH PROSPECT IN

2012. DRILLING WAS TERMINATED AT THE CORONADO WILDCAT WELL DUE

TO DRILLING CONDITIONS IN THE SHALLOW SECTION OF THE WELLBORE.

THE COMPANY PLANS TO DRILL A REPLACEMENT WELL AT AN ALTERNATE

LOCATION BY MID-2012.

BESIDES THE ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPLORATION PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, THE COMPANY ALSO HAS

CONTRACTED CAPACITY AT THE THIRD-PARTY SABINE PASS LIQUEFIED

NATURAL GAS (LNG) REGASIFICATION TERMINAL IN LOUISIANA AND IN A

THIRD-PARTY PIPELINE SYSTEM CONNECTING THE SABINE PASS LNG

TERMINAL TO THE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE GRID. THE PIPELINE PROVIDES

ACCESS TO TWO MAJOR SALT DOME STORAGE FIELDS AND 10 MAJOR

INTERSTATE PIPELINE SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO CHEVRONS

SABINE PIPELINE, WHICH CONNECTS TO THE HENRY HUB. THE HENRY HUB

INTERCONNECTS TO NINE INTERSTATE AND FOUR INTRASTATE PIPELINES

PROCESSES, AND ULTIMATE TECHNICAL OR COMMERCIAL SUCCESSES ARE

NOT CERTAIN.

ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION

THE COMPANY DESIGNS, OPERATES AND MAINTAINS ITS FACILITIES TO

AVOID POTENTIAL SPILLS OR LEAKS AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THOSE

THAT MAY OCCUR. CHEVRON REQUIRES ITS FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS

TO HAVE OPERATING STANDARDS AND PROCESSES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE

PLANS THAT ADDRESS ALL CREDIBLE AND SIGNIFICANT RISKS IDENTIFIED

BY SITE-SPECIFIC RISK AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. CHEVRON ALSO

REQUIRES THAT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES BE AVAILABLE TO EXECUTE THESE

PLANS. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT A MAJOR SPILL OR LEAK OCCURS,

CHEVRON ALSO MAINTAINS A WORLDWIDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE TRAINED IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF

EMERGENCY RESPONSE, INCLUDING POST-INCIDENT REMEDIATION.

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO COMPLEMENT THE COMPANYS CAPABILITIES, CHEVRON MAINTAINS

ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL OIL SPILL RESPONSE

COOPERATIVES, INCLUDING THE MARINE SPILL RESPONSE CORPORATION,

WHICH OPERATES IN U.S. TERRITORIAL WATERS, AND OIL SPILL

RESPONSE, LTD. (OSRL), WHICH OPERATES GLOBALLY. THE COMPANY IS A

FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE MARINE WELL CONTAINMENT COMPANY, WHOSE

PRIMARY MISSION IS TO EXPEDIENTLY DEPLOY CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT

AND SYSTEMS TO CAPTURE AND CONTAIN CRUDE OIL IN THE UNLIKELY

EVENT OF A FUTURE LOSS OF CONTROL OF A DEEPWATER WELL IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS A MEMBER OF THE

SUBSEA WELL RESPONSE PROJECT (SWRP). SWRPS OBJECTIVE IS TO

FURTHER DEVELOP THE INDUSTRYS CAPABILITY TO CONTAIN AND

SHUT IN SUBSEA WELL CONTROL INCIDENTS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF

THE WORLD. IN LATE 2011, UPON DETECTION OF OCEAN FLOOR OIL SEEPS

IN THE DEEPWATER FRADE FIELD IN BRAZIL, CHEVRON RAPIDLY DEPLOYED

CAPABILITIES AND PROCESSES IN COORDINATION WITH OSRL. IN EARLY

2012, THE COMPANY RAPIDLY DEPLOYED RESPONSE CAPABILITIES TO

ADDRESS A NATURAL GAS WELL CONTROL INCIDENT IN NIGERIA.

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND TO

SIMILAR LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND

REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE, OR

ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME, EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF

CONDUCTING BUSINESS.

IN 2011, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE $345 MILLION, REPRESENTING ABOUT

3 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES. THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO RETROFIT

EXISTING FACILITIES AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW

FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR- AND

WATER-QUALITY PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS

REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING

FACILITIES. FOR 2012, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $410 MILLION. THE FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS

ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

REGULATIONS INTENDED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE

INTENDED TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. LEGISLATION,

REGULATIONS AND MARKET-BASED PROGRAMS THAT COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS EXIST AT THE INTERNATIONAL OR

MULTINATIONAL (SUCH AS THE KYOTO PROTOCOL AND THE EUROPEAN

UNIONS EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM), NATIONAL (SUCH AS THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCYS RULES FOR

STRICTER EMISSION STANDARDS AND INCREASED RENEWABLE FUEL CONTENT

FOR TRANSPORTATION FUELS), AND REGIONAL (SUCH AS

CALIFORNIAS GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT) LEVELS.

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A GLOBAL ENERGY COMPANY WITH A DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS

PORTFOLIO, A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A HISTORY OF GENERATING

SUFFICIENT CASH TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES. NEVERTHELESS, SOME INHERENT RISKS

COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON

IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL,

WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY

INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION

OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE

AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES AND GEOPOLITICAL RISK.

CHEVRON ACCEPTS THE RISK OF CHANGING COMMODITY PRICES AS PART OF

ITS BUSINESS PLANNING PROCESS. AS SUCH, AN INVESTMENT IN THE

COMPANY CARRIES SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CRUDE

OIL PRICES.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF HISTORICALLY LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL, THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM EARNINGS AND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

UPSTREAM ASSETS MAY ALSO BECOME IMPAIRED. THE IMPACT ON

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCT

SALES.

THE

SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE COMPANY

DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION OR THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING

AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING AND RENEWING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE,

DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS; DRILLING SUCCESS; ABILITY TO

BRING LONG-LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION

ON BUDGET AND ON SCHEDULE; AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE

OPERATION OF MATURE PROPERTIES.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL OR HUMAN

FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES BEYOND ITS CONTROL, INCLUDING

HURRICANES, FLOODS AND OTHER FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL

UNREST AND OTHER POLITICAL EVENTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES, SYSTEM

FAILURES, CYBER THREATS AND TERRORIST ACTS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS HAVE INHERENT RISKS AND HAZARDS THAT

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AND CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT.

CHEVRONS RESULTS DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND

MITIGATE THE RISKS AND HAZARDS INHERENT TO OPERATING IN THE

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO

MINIMIZE THESE OPERATIONAL RISKS BY CAREFULLY DESIGNING AND

BUILDING ITS FACILITIES AND CONDUCTING ITS OPERATIONS IN A SAFE

AND RELIABLE MANNER. HOWEVER, FAILURE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS

EFFECTIVELY COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED INCIDENTS, INCLUDING

RELEASES, EXPLOSIONS OR MECHANICAL FAILURES RESULTING IN

PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF LIFE, ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF

REVENUES, LEGAL LIABILITY

AND/OR

DISRUPTION TO OPERATIONS. CHEVRON HAS IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINS

A SYSTEM OF CORPORATE POLICIES, BEHAVIORS AND COMPLIANCE

MECHANISMS TO MANAGE SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, RELIABILITY

AND EFFICIENCY RISKS; TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS

AND POLICIES; AND TO RESPOND TO AND LEARN FROM UNEXPECTED

INCIDENTS. NONETHELESS, IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE CHEVRON IS

NOT THE OPERATOR, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED INFLUENCE AND

CONTROL OVER THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO

MANAGE AND CONTROL SUCH RISKS.

CHEVRONS

BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY RISKS FROM LITIGATION

OR GOVERNMENT ACTION.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF ITS

BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY

BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. OFTEN THESE OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED

THROUGH JOINT VENTURES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY MAY HAVE LIMITED

INFLUENCE AND CONTROL. ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY OR SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN OPERATIONS ARISING FROM

PRIVATE LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENT ACTION, EITHER AS A RESULT OF

AN ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW

CONCLUSIONS ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON

HUMAN HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT

SOCIETAL PRESSURES OR POLITICAL OR OTHER FACTORS ARE INVOLVED,

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH LIABILITY COULD BE IMPOSED WITHOUT

REGARD TO THE COMPANYS CAUSATION OF OR CONTRIBUTION TO THE

ASSERTED DAMAGE, OR TO OTHER MITIGATING FACTORS.

THE

COMPANY DOES NOT INSURE AGAINST ALL POTENTIAL LOSSES, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL EXPOSURE.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE OR THIRD-PARTY

INDEMNITIES TO COVER FULLY ALL OPERATIONAL RISKS OR POTENTIAL

LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT OR SERIES OF

INCIDENTS CAUSING CATASTROPHIC LOSS. AS A RESULT THE COMPANY IS,

TO A SUBSTANTIAL EXTENT, SELF-INSURED FOR SUCH EVENTS. THE

COMPANY RELIES ON EXISTING LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND

BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS THAT WOULD

ARISE FROM SUCH AN EVENT OR SERIES OF EVENTS. THE OCCURRENCE OF

A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT OR UNFORESEEN LIABILITY FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY IS NOT FULLY INSURED OR FOR WHICH INSURANCE RECOVERY IS

SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

POLITICAL

INSTABILITY AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT COULD HARM CHEVRONS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE

COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR TO IMPOSE

ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED OR PROPOSED

RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, EXPORT AND

EXCHANGE CONTROLS, BURDENSOME TAXES, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS THAT MIGHT HARM THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVENESS

OR RELATIONS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR THIRD PARTIES. IN OTHER

COUNTRIES, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN

THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED

PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF

VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND THE

COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN

EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, 22 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN OPEC-MEMBER

COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ANGOLA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE

PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. TWENTY-TWO

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING

AFFILIATES, WERE LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31,

2011.

REGULATION

OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD INCREASE CHEVRONS

OPERATIONAL COSTS AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR CHEVRONS

PRODUCTS.

CONTINUED POLITICAL ATTENTION TO ISSUES CONCERNING CLIMATE

CHANGE, THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN IT, AND POTENTIAL

MITIGATION THROUGH REGULATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGISLATION

AND REGULATORY MEASURES TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS ARE

CURRENTLY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DISCUSSION OR IMPLEMENTATION.

THESE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS-RELATED LAWS, POLICIES

AND REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL, COMPLIANCE,

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS UNCERTAIN

AND IS EXPECTED TO VARY DEPENDING ON THE LAWS ENACTED IN EACH

JURISDICTION, THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES IN IT AND MARKET

CONDITIONS. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT COULD BE REGULATED

INCLUDE THOSE ARISING FROM THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; THE UPGRADING OF

PRODUCTION FROM OIL SANDS INTO SYNTHETIC OIL; POWER GENERATION;

THE CONVERSION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INTO REFINED

PRODUCTS; THE PROCESSING, LIQUEFACTION AND REGASIFICATION OF

NATURAL GAS; THE TRANSPORTATION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

RELATED PRODUCTS AND CONSUMERS OR CUSTOMERS USE OF

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS

CONSUMERS AND CUSTOMERS USE OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMPANYS

COMPETITORS IN RESPONSE TO SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, ARE BEYOND

THE COMPANYS CONTROL.

THE EFFECT OF REGULATION ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, AMONG

OTHERS, THE SECTORS COVERED, THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

REDUCTIONS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHEVRON WOULD BE

ENTITLED TO RECEIVE EMISSION ALLOWANCE ALLOCATIONS OR WOULD NEED

TO PURCHASE COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH

AUCTIONS, THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF EMISSION ALLOWANCES AND

CREDITS, AND THE IMPACT OF LEGISLATION OR OTHER REGULATION ON

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RECOVER THE COSTS INCURRED THROUGH

THE PRICING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. MATERIAL PRICE

INCREASES OR INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE OR USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY

SOURCES COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

SELLS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS SALES VOLUMES,

REVENUES AND MARGINS.

CHANGES

IN MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD.

IN PREPARING THE COMPANYS PERIODIC REPORTS UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, INCLUDING ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, CHEVRONS MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER

APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS AS OF A SPECIFIED DATE. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

EXPERIENCE AS OF THAT DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK

AND UNCERTAINTY. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

AREAS REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BY

MANAGEMENT INCLUDE MEASUREMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS; ESTIMATES OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RECOVERABLE RESERVES; ACCRUALS FOR

ESTIMATED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LITIGATION RESERVES; AND

IMPAIRMENTS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. CHANGES IN

ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE INFORMATION UNDERLYING THE

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

PLANS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS OR CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES,

COULD AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR EXPENSES.

CERTAIN

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD (CARB)

PROPOSED A CIVIL PENALTY AGAINST CHEVRONS SACRAMENTO,

CALIFORNIA, TERMINAL FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS BETWEEN AUGUST AND

DECEMBER 2007 OF CARBS REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE MINIMUM

CONCENTRATION OF ADDITIVES IN GASOLINE. DUE TO A COMPUTER

PROGRAMMING ERROR, THE SACRAMENTO TERMINALS AUTOMATIC

DISPENSERS ALLEGEDLY FAILED TO INJECT ADDITIVE DETERGENT INTO A

GASOLINE LINE. IT APPEARS THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THESE NOTICES

OF VIOLATION MAY RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF A CIVIL PENALTY

EXCEEDING $100,000.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, CARB PROPOSED A CIVIL PENALTY AGAINST

CHEVRONS RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA, REFINERY FOR A NOTICE OF

VIOLATION RELATING TO GASOLINE THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY CERTIFIED

AS TO COMPOSITION. THE COMPOSITION CERTIFICATES FOR THE GASOLINE

WERE CORRECTED WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY CHANGE TO THE COMPOSITION

OF THE GASOLINE. IN JULY 2009, CARB ISSUED THE REFINERY A NOTICE

OF VIOLATION RELATING TO AN ERROR IN GASOLINE BLENDING THAT

CAUSED THE PRODUCT COMPOSITION CERTIFICATIONS TO BE IN ERROR.

THE COMPOSITION CERTIFICATIONS WERE CORRECTED WITHOUT REQUIRING

ANY CHANGE TO THE GASOLINE. DISCUSSIONS WITH CARB OFFICIALS

RELATING TO ALL OF THESE MATTERS CONTINUE. IT APPEARS THAT THE

RESOLUTION OF THESE NOTICES OF VIOLATION MAY RESULT IN THE

PAYMENT OF A CIVIL PENALTY EXCEEDING $100,000.

IN JULY 2009, CARB ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION AGAINST CHEVRON

PRODUCTS COMPANY FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF CARBS

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE CERTIFICATION OF GASOLINE THAT

OCCURRED DURING STORAGE AT A THIRD-PARTY FACILITY AND WHICH HAD

BEEN SELF-REPORTED BY CHEVRON ON DISCOVERY. CHEVRON BELIEVES

THAT THIS MATTER WILL NOT RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF A CIVIL

PENALTY EXCEEDING $100,000.

IN 2011, CARB MADE PENALTY DEMANDS WITH RESPECT TO FOUR NOTICES

OF VIOLATION AGAINST CHEVRON FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF

CARBS FUEL BLEND REGULATIONS AT CERTAIN CALIFORNIA

TERMINALS AND REFINERIES. IT APPEARS THAT THE RESOLUTION OF

THESE NOTICES OF VIOLATION MAY RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF A CIVIL

PENALTY EXCEEDING $100,000.

IN JULY 2009, THE HAWAII DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH) ALLEGED THAT

CHEVRON IS OBLIGATED TO PAY STIPULATED CIVIL PENALTIES EXCEEDING

$100,000 IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMMITMENTS CHEVRON UNDERTOOK TO

TO ALLEGED AIR QUALITY VIOLATIONS AT CHEVRONS PERTH AMBOY,

NEW JERSEY REFINERY IDENTIFIED IN A SEPTEMBER 16, 2008

RELATE TO CERTAIN MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SET

FORTH IN THE EPAS LEAK DETECTION AND REPAIR REGULATIONS

(THESE REGULATIONS PERTAIN TO THE CONTROL AND MONITORING OF

FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM REFINERY PROCESS EQUIPMENT). BASED ON

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EPA, IT APPEARS THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS

MATTER MAY RESULT IN THE PAYMENT OF A CIVIL PENALTY EXCEEDING

$100,000.

THE EPA INDICATED THAT IT WOULD ASSESS CHEVRONS SALT LAKE

CITY REFINERY A CIVIL PENALTY FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL

REQUIREMENTS AND UTAHS AIR POLLUTION LAWS. THESE ALLEGED

VIOLATIONS WERE THE SUBJECT OF AN AUGUST 20, 2008 EPA

NOTICE OF VIOLATION (NOV) FOR WHICH NO PENALTY WAS ASSESSED AT

THE TIME. IT APPEARS THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS NOV MAY RESULT

IN THE PAYMENT OF A CIVIL PENALTY EXCEEDING $100,000.

THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT (SCAQMD) ISSUED

A NOV TO CHEVRONS HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA, TERMINAL

EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY DEPEND MOSTLY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE COMPANY

IS MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. IN THE DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE LARGEST COST

COMPONENT

OF REFINED PRODUCTS. SEASONALITY IS NOT A PRIMARY DRIVER OF CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS QUARTERLY

EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR.

TO SUSTAIN ITS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MUST

DEVELOP AND REPLENISH AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS THAT OFFER ATTRACTIVE FINANCIAL RETURNS FOR THE

INVESTMENT REQUIRED. IDENTIFYING PROMISING AREAS FOR EXPLORATION, ACQUIRING THE NECESSARY RIGHTS TO

EXPLORE FOR AND TO PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, DRILLING SUCCESSFULLY, AND HANDLING THE MANY

TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS IN A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER ARE ALL IMPORTANT FACTORS IN

THIS EFFORT. PROJECTS OFTEN REQUIRE LONG LEAD TIMES AND LARGE CAPITAL COMMITMENTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY UPSTREAM, CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC,

REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE

UNITED STATES. FROM TIME TO TIME, CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS HAVE SOUGHT TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACTS OR

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THE COMPANY. GOVERNMENTS MAY ATTEMPT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. CIVIL

UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPACT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY

MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LONG-TERM VALUE OR TO ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO

ITS ASSET BASE TO HELP AUGMENT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH. REFER TO THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-6 FOR DISCUSSIONS OF NET GAINS ON ASSET SALES

DURING 2011. ASSET DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURINGS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES.

THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, THE LEVEL OF

WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANY OF MOVEMENTS IN PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS. MANAGEMENT TAKES THESE DEVELOPMENTS INTO ACCOUNT IN THE CONDUCT OF DAILY

OPERATIONS AND FOR BUSINESS PLANNING.

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM

EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES, AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS OR FEARS THEREOF THAT

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. ANY OF THESE FACTORS

COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY MONITORS

DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS, AND SEEKS TO

MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING ITS FACILITIES AND BUSINESSES. THE LONGER-TERM TREND IN EARNINGS FOR THE

UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ALSO A FUNCTION OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR

ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OF CONTRACTS,

AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE ITS SCHEDULE OF WORK, CONTRACTING, PROCUREMENT AND

SUPPLY-CHAIN ACTIVITIES TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE COSTS. HOWEVER, PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL

GAS CAN BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL. EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE NOT

ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION, BUT ALSO COMMODITY PRICES AND PRICES CHARGED BY THE INDUSTRYS

MATERIAL AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE INDUSTRYS OWN

SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH MATERIALS AND SERVICES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

AND OPERATING EXPENSES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY DAMAGE TO PRODUCTION FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE

WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST.

THE CHART ABOVE SHOWS THE TREND IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE

OIL, BRENT CRUDE OIL AND U.S. HENRY HUB NATURAL GAS. THE WTI PRICE AVERAGED $95 PER BARREL FOR THE

FULL-YEAR 2011, COMPARED TO $79 IN 2010. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2012, THE WTI PRICE WAS ABOUT $99 PER

BARREL. THE BRENT PRICE AVERAGED $111 PER BARREL FOR THE FULL-YEAR 2011, COMPARED TO $80 IN 2010.

AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2012, THE BRENT PRICE WAS ABOUT $118 PER BARREL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

EQUITY CRUDE PRODUCTION IS PRICED BASED ON THE BRENT BENCHMARK. WTI TRADED AT A DISCOUNT TO BRENT

THROUGHOUT 2011 DUE TO EXCESS CRUDE SUPPLY IN THE U.S. MIDCONTINENT MARKET. THE DISCOUNT NARROWED

IN FOURTH QUARTER 2011 AS CRUDE INVENTORIES DECLINED.

A DIFFERENTIAL IN CRUDE OIL PRICES EXISTS BETWEEN HIGH QUALITY (HIGH-GRAVITY, LOW-SULFUR)

CRUDES AND THOSE OF LOWER

QUALITY (LOW-GRAVITY, HIGH-SULFUR). THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL IN ANY PERIOD IS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE SUPPLY OF HEAVY CRUDE AVAILABLE VERSUS THE DEMAND, WHICH IS A FUNCTION OF THE CAPACITY OF

REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE TO PROCESS THIS LOWER QUALITY FEEDSTOCK INTO LIGHT PRODUCTS (MOTOR

GASOLINE, JET FUEL, AVIATION GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL). THE DIFFERENTIAL WIDENED DURING 2011

PRIMARILY DUE TO RISING DIESEL PRICES AND LOWER AVAILABILITY OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL DUE TO

SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS IN LIBYA.

CHEVRON PRODUCES OR SHARES IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN CALIFORNIA, CHAD,

INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, VENEZUELA AND IN CERTAIN FIELDS IN

ANGOLA, CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM SECTOR OF THE NORTH SEA. (SEE PAGE FS-10 FOR THE COMPANYS

AVERAGE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS.)

IN CONTRAST TO PRICE MOVEMENTS IN THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL

GAS IN MANY REGIONAL MARKETS ARE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS IN THOSE

MARKETS. IN THE UNITED STATES, PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED ABOUT $4.00 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET

(MCF) DURING 2011, COMPARED WITH ABOUT $4.50 DURING 2010. AS OF MID-FEBRUARY 2012, THE HENRY HUB

SPOT PRICE WAS ABOUT $2.50 PER MCF. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES

ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER DEMAND RELATIVE TO THE VOLUMES

PRODUCED IN NORTH AMERICA.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PRICE CHANGES FOR NATURAL GAS DEPEND ON A WIDE RANGE OF SUPPLY,

DEMAND AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES. IN SOME LOCATIONS, CHEVRON IS INVESTING IN LONG-TERM PROJECTS

TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE AND LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER TO OTHER

MARKETS. INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS AVERAGED ABOUT $5.40 PER MCF DURING 2011, COMPARED

WITH ABOUT $4.60 PER MCF DURING 2010. (SEE PAGE FS-10 FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS

REALIZATIONS FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2011 AVERAGED 2.673 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY. ABOUT ONE-FIFTH OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2011 OCCURRED IN

THE OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF ANGOLA, NIGERIA, VENEZUELA AND THE PARTITIONED ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI

ARABIA AND KUWAIT. OPEC QUOTAS HAD NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS NET CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION IN 2011 OR

2010. AT THEIR DECEMBER 2011 MEETING, MEMBERS OF OPEC SUPPORTED MAINTAINING THE CURRENT PRODUCTION

LEVEL OF 30 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND MADE NO CHANGE TO THE PRODUCTION QUOTAS IN EFFECT SINCE

DECEMBER 2008.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2012 WILL AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 2.680

MILLION BARRELS PER DAY BASED ON THE AVERAGE BRENT PRICE OF $111 PER BARREL FOR THE FULL-YEAR 2011.

THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY

OPEC, PRICE EFFECTS ON ENTITLEMENT VOLUMES, CHANGES IN FISCAL TERMS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SCOPE OF

COMPANY OPERATIONS, DELAYS IN PROJECT STARTUPS, FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS IN VARIOUS

MARKETS, WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT MAY SHUT IN PRODUCTION, CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING GEOPOLITICS, DELAYS

IN COMPLETION OF MAINTENANCE TURNAROUNDS, GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED DECLINES IN PRODUCTION FROM MATURE

FIELDS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO OPERATIONS. THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IS ALSO

AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE

PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG BETWEEN INITIAL EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. INVESTMENTS IN

UPSTREAM PROJECTS GENERALLY BEGIN WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF CHEVRONS UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IS MADE OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION ON PAGES FS-6 THROUGH FS-7 FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM BUSINESS.

REFER TO TABLE V BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-67 FOR A TABULATION OF THE COMPANYS PROVED NET OIL AND

GAS RESERVES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AT THE BEGINNING OF 2009 AND EACH YEAR-END FROM 2009 THROUGH 2011,

AND AN ACCOMPANYING DISCUSSION OF MAJOR CHANGES TO PROVED RESERVES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011.

IN EARLY NOVEMBER 2011, WHILE DRILLING A DEVELOPMENT WELL IN THE DEEPWATER FRADE FIELD IN

BRAZIL, AN UNANTICIPATED PRESSURE SPIKE CAUSED OIL TO MIGRATE FROM THE WELL BORE THROUGH A SERIES

OF FISSURES TO THE SEA FLOOR, EMITTING APPROXIMATELY 2,400 BARRELS OF OIL. THE

RESULTING SURFACE SHEEN HAS SINCE DISSIPATED AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO

COASTAL OR WILDLIFE IMPACTS.

UPON DETECTION, THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY TOOK STEPS TO STOP THE

RELEASE. CHEVRONS EMERGENCY PLAN,

APPROVED BY THE BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES REGULATORY AGENCY IBAMA, WAS

IMPLEMENTED ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS. THE

SOURCE OF THE SEEP WAS CONTAINED

WITHIN FOUR DAYS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE INCIDENT WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS ANNUAL NET

INCOME. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO FINES AND PENALTIES IS NOT CURRENTLY

DETERMINABLE, AND COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD.

DOWNSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY TIED TO MARGINS ON THE REFINING,

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE GASOLINE, DIESEL, JET FUEL, LUBRICANTS, FUEL

OIL, FUEL AND LUBRICANT ADDITIVES, AND PETROCHEMICALS. INDUSTRY MARGINS ARE SOMETIMES VOLATILE AND

CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND BALANCE FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND

PETROCHEMICALS AND BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL, OTHER REFINERY AND PETROCHEMICAL

FEEDSTOCKS, AND NATURAL GAS. INDUSTRY MARGINS CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY INVENTORY LEVELS,

GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS, COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES, REFINERY OR CHEMICAL PLANT CAPACITY

UTILIZATION, MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS, AND DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES OR CHEMICAL PLANTS RESULTING FROM

UNPLANNED OUTAGES DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER, FIRES OR OTHER OPERATIONAL EVENTS.

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING PROFITABILITY FOR DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE RELIABILITY AND

EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS REFINING, MARKETING AND PETROCHEMICAL ASSETS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS

CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT SUPPLY FUNCTIONS, AND THE VOLATILITY OF TANKER-CHARTER RATES FOR THE

COMPANYS SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRYS DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT

TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND

ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE COMPANYS REFINING, MARKETING AND PETROCHEMICAL ASSETS.

THE COMPANYS MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, THE U.S.

GULF COAST, ASIA, AND SOUTHERN AFRICA. CHEVRON OPERATES OR HAS SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN

REFINERIES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS. IN 2011, THE COMPANYS MARGINS IMPROVED OVER 2010, SUPPORTED BY

HIGHER GLOBAL PRODUCT DEMAND AND TIGHTER GLOBAL REFINED PRODUCT SUPPLIES. THE COMPANY MADE FURTHER

PROGRESS DURING 2011 IMPLEMENTING THE PREVIOUSLY-ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING OF ITS DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE EMPLOYEE-REDUCTION PROGRAMS FOR THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS. APPROXIMATELY 2,300 EMPLOYEES IN THE DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE

RELEASED UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. ABOUT 2,100 EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN RELEASED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2011,

WITH THE PROGRAMS BEING SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING EMPLOYEES

DESIGNATED FOR RELEASE UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE EXPECTED TO LEAVE IN 2012. ABOUT 900 OF THE AFFECTED

EMPLOYEES WERE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. REFER TO NOTE 23 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ON PAGES FS-55 THROUGH FS-56, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

U.S. UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $6.51 BILLION IN 2011 INCREASED $2.4 BILLION FROM 2010. THE

BENEFIT OF HIGHER CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $2.8 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS. PARTLY

OFFSETTING THIS EFFECT WERE LOWER NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WHICH DECREASED EARNINGS BY ABOUT

$400 MILLION AND HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES OF $200 MILLION.

U.S. UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $4.1 BILLION IN 2010 INCREASED $1.9 BILLION FROM 2009. HIGHER PRICES

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $2.1 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS. PARTLY OFFSETTING

THESE EFFECTS WERE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES OF $200 MILLION, IN PART DUE TO THE GULF OF MEXICO

DRILLING MORATORIUM. LOWER EXPLORATION EXPENSES WERE ESSENTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TAX ITEMS AND

HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSES.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR U.S. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2011 WAS

$97.51 PER BARREL, COMPARED WITH $71.59 IN 2010 AND $54.36 IN 2009. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS

REALIZATION WAS $4.04 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2011, COMPARED WITH $4.26 AND $3.73 IN 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2011 AVERAGED 678,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN 4 PERCENT FROM

2010 AND 5 PERCENT FROM 2009. BETWEEN 2011 AND 2010, THE DECREASE IN PRODUCTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

NORMAL FIELD DECLINES AND MAINTENANCE-RELATED DOWNTIME. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS DECREASE WERE NEW

PRODUCTION FROM ACQUISITIONS IN THE MARCELLUS SHALE AND INCREASES AT THE PERDIDO PROJECT IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO. NATURAL FIELD DECLINES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2009 WERE

MOSTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRODUCTION FROM THE TAHITI FIELD. THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FOR 2011 AVERAGED 465,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN 5 PERCENT FROM 2010 AND 4

PERCENT FROM 2009. NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED ABOUT 1.3 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN

2011, DOWN APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT FROM 2010 AND ABOUT 9 PERCENT FROM 2009. REFER TO THE SELECTED

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $18.3 BILLION IN 2011 INCREASED $4.7 BILLION FROM

2010. HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL INCREASED EARNINGS BY $7.1 BILLION. THIS BENEFIT WAS PARTLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER TAX ITEMS OF ABOUT $1.7 BILLION AND HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING FUEL, OF

ABOUT $1.0 BILLION. FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $211 MILLION IN 2011, COMPARED

WITH A DECREASE OF $293 MILLION A YEAR EARLIER.

EARNINGS OF $13.6 BILLION IN 2010 INCREASED $4.9 BILLION FROM 2009. HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS INCREASED EARNINGS BY $4.3 BILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN NET OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION IN THE 2010 PERIOD BENEFITED INCOME BY ABOUT $1.2 BILLION. THIS NET BENEFIT WAS PARTLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES OF $500 MILLION. A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN TAX ITEMS OF ABOUT $450

MILLION WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSES. THE 2009 PERIOD INCLUDED GAINS OF ABOUT

$500 MILLION ON ASSET SALES AND TAX ITEMS RELATED TO THE GORGON PROJECT IN AUSTRALIA. FOREIGN

CURRENCY EFFECTS DECREASED EARNINGS BY $293 MILLION IN THE 2010 PERIOD, COMPARED WITH A REDUCTION

OF $578 MILLION A YEAR EARLIER, PRIMARILY REFLECTING NONCASH LOSSES ON BALANCE SHEET REMEASUREMENT.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2011

WAS $101.53 PER BARREL, COMPARED WITH $72.68 IN 2010 AND $55.97 IN 2009. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS

REALIZATION WAS $5.39 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2011, COMPARED WITH $4.64 AND $4.01 IN 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY.

INTERNATIONAL NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF 2.0 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2011 DECREASED

ABOUT 3 PERCENT FROM

2010 AND REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT WITH 2009. THE VOLUMES IN 2011 AND 2010 INCLUDE SYNTHETIC OIL THAT WAS

REPORTED IN 2009 AS PRODUCTION FROM OIL SANDS IN CANADA. ABSENT PRICE EFFECTS ON ENTITLEMENT

VOLUMES, NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION DECREASED 1 PERCENT IN 2011 AND INCREASED 5 PERCENT IN 2010,

WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEARS PRODUCTION.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF INTERNATIONAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS ABOUT 1.4 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY IN 2011, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT FROM 2010 AND AN INCREASE OF

APPROXIMATELY 2 PERCENT FROM 2009. INTERNATIONAL NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 3.7 BILLION CUBIC

FEET PER DAY IN 2011 WAS DOWN 2 PERCENT FROM 2010 AND UP 2 PERCENT FROM 2009.

U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS EARNED $1.5 BILLION IN 2011, COMPARED WITH $1.3 BILLION IN

2010. EARNINGS BENEFITED BY $300 MILLION FROM IMPROVED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS, $200 MILLION

FROM HIGHER EARNINGS FROM THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM), AND

$50 MILLION FROM THE ABSENCE OF 2010 CHARGES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS. THESE BENEFITS WERE

PARTLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF A $400 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST

IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE COMPANY RECOGNIZED IN 2010.

EARNINGS INCREASED $1.5 BILLION IN 2010 FROM 2009. IMPROVED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS

INCREASED EARNINGS BY ABOUT $550 MILLION. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS THE NEARLY $400

MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE COMPANY.

HIGHER EARNINGS FROM CHEMICALS OPERATIONS INCREASED EARNINGS BY ABOUT $300 MILLION, LARGELY FROM

IMPROVED MARGINS AT CPCHEM.

REFINED PRODUCT SALES OF 1.26 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2011 DECLINED 7 PERCENT, MAINLY DUE

TO LOWER GASOLINE, GAS OIL, AND KEROSENE SALES. SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED PRODUCTS WERE 1.35 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY IN 2010, A DECREASE OF 4 PERCENT FROM 2009. THE DECLINE WAS MAINLY IN GASOLINE AND

JET FUEL SALES. U.S. BRANDED GASOLINE SALES DECREASED TO 514,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN 2011,

REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT AND 17 PERCENT DECLINES FROM 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM EARNED $2.1 BILLION IN 2011, COMPARED WITH $1.1 BILLION IN

2010. GAINS ON ASSET SALES BENEFITED EARNINGS BY $700 MILLION, PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF THE

PEMBROKE REFINERY AND RELATED MARKETING ASSETS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IRELAND. ALSO CONTRIBUTING

TO EARNINGS WERE IMPROVED MARGINS OF $200 MILLION AND THE ABSENCE OF 2010 CHARGES OF $90 MILLION

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE MARK-TO-MARKET

EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OF ABOUT $180 MILLION. FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS DECREASED

EARNINGS BY $65 MILLION IN 2011, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF $135 MILLION A YEAR EARLIER.

EARNINGS OF $1.1 BILLION IN 2010 INCREASED $545 MILLION FROM 2009. HIGHER MARGINS ON THE

MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF GASOLINE AND OTHER REFINED PRODUCTS INCREASED EARNINGS BY ABOUT $1.0

BILLION, AND A FAVORABLE SWING IN MARK-TO-MARKET

EFFECTS ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BENEFITED

EARNINGS BY ABOUT $300 MILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE ITEMS WAS THE ABSENCE OF 2009 GAINS ON

ASSET SALES OF ABOUT $550 MILLION AND HIGHER EXPENSES OF ABOUT $200 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $135

MILLION IN 2010, COMPARED WITH A REDUCTION OF $191 MILLION IN 2009.

TOTAL REFINED PRODUCT SALES OF 1.69 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2011

DECLINED 4 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS REFINING

AND MARKETING ASSETS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IRELAND. EXCLUDING THE

IMPACT OF 2011 ASSET

SALES, SALES VOLUMES WERE UP 3 PERCENT BETWEEN THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS. INTERNATIONAL REFINED

PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES OF 1.76 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2010 WERE 5 PERCENT LOWER THAN IN 2009,

MAINLY DUE TO ASSET SALES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA.

MARGINS ON SALES OF COMMODITY CHEMICALS. IMPROVED MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS AND A FAVORABLE SWING

OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $2.4 BILLION BETWEEN

HIGHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS OF $700 MILLION. IN PART, INCREASED FUEL PURCHASES

REFLECTED A NEW COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENT THAT REPLACED A PRIOR PRODUCT EXCHANGE AGREEMENT FOR

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA.

TOTAL EXPENSES IN 2010 WERE ABOUT $1.6 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO $600 MILLION

OF HIGHER FUEL EXPENSES; $500 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS; $200 MILLION OF

INCREASED CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE; AND AN INCREASE OF ABOUT $200 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER TANKER CHARTER RATES. IN ADDITION, CHARGES OF $234 MILLION RELATED TO

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE 43 PERCENT IN 2011, 40 PERCENT IN 2010 AND 43 PERCENT IN

2009. THE RATE WAS HIGHER IN 2011 THAN IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES IN

CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM JURISDICTIONS. THE HIGHER INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM EFFECTIVE TAX RATES

WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER UTILIZATION OF NON-U.S. TAX CREDITS IN 2011 AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES

IN INCOME TAX RATES BETWEEN PERIODS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT

IMPACTS. THE RATE WAS LOWER IN 2010 THAN IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM EFFECTS,

INCLUDING AN INCREASED UTILIZATION OF TAX CREDITS, WHICH HAD A GREATER IMPACT ON THE RATE THAN

ONE-TIME DEFERRED TAX BENEFITS AND RELATIVELY LOW TAX RATES ON ASSET SALES IN 2009. ALSO, A SMALLER

PORTION OF COMPANY INCOME WAS EARNED IN HIGHER TAX RATE INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM JURISDICTIONS IN

2010 THAN IN 2009. FINALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT IMPACTS CAUSED A REDUCTION IN THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BETWEEN PERIODS.

OBLIGATIONS WERE $10.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, DOWN FROM $11.5 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2010.

THE $1.3 BILLION DECREASE IN TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DURING 2011 INCLUDED THE

EARLY REDEMPTION OF A $1.5 BILLION BOND DUE TO MATURE IN MARCH 2012. THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL

LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, REDEEMABLE

LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALED $5.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2011, COMPARED WITH $5.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2010. OF THESE AMOUNTS, $5.6 BILLION AND $5.4

BILLION WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END 2011,

SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2012, AS

THE COMPANY HAD THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO

REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD $6.0 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS

MAJOR BANKS, EXPIRING IN DECEMBER 2016, WHICH ENABLE THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A

LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING AND CAN ALSO BE USED FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING

COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT

INTEREST RATES BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES

PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO

BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

HAS AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2013 FOR AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT

OF NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY.

THE MAJOR DEBT RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE COMPANYS DEBT, AND THE COMPANYS COST

OF BORROWING CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE DEPENDING ON THESE DEBT RATINGS. THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING

PUBLIC BONDS ISSUED BY CHEVRON CORPORATION, CHEVRON CORPORATION PROFIT SHARING/SAVINGS PLAN TRUST

FUND AND TEXACO CAPITAL INC. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES ARE THE OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY,

CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ARE RATED AA BY STANDARD AND POORS

CORPORATION AND AA1 BY MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANYS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND P-L

BY MOODYS. ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY, INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE CAPITAL

PROGRAM AND CASH THAT

MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. BASED ON ITS HIGH-QUALITY

DEBT RATINGS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED

CASH REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO CAN MODIFY CAPITAL SPENDING PLANS DURING ANY EXTENDED PERIODS

OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY

CHEMICALS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE PAYING THE COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE

COMPANYS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

IN JULY 2010, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN

ONGOING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WITH NO SET TERM OR MONETARY LIMITS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO

REPURCHASE BETWEEN $500 MILLION AND $2 BILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES PER QUARTER, AT PREVAILING

PRICES, AS PERMITTED BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SUBJECT TO MARKET

CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. DURING 2011, THE COMPANY PURCHASED 42.3 MILLION COMMON SHARES FOR

$4.25 BILLION. FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM THROUGH 2011, THE COMPANY HAD PURCHASED 51.1

MILLION SHARES FOR $5.0 BILLION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2011 WERE $29.1

BILLION, INCLUDING $1.7 BILLION FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF EQUITY-AFFILIATE EXPENDITURES.

IN 2010

AND 2009,

EXPENDITURES WERE $21.8 BILLION AND $22.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS

SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF $1.4 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

OF THE $29.1 BILLION OF EXPENDITURES IN 2011, 89 PERCENT, OR $25.9

BILLION, WAS RELATED TO UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY 87 PERCENT

AND 80 PERCENT WERE EXPENDED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2010 AND 2009.

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 68 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE

UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IN 2011, ABOUT 82 PERCENT IN 2010 AND ABOUT 80

PERCENT IN 2009. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF ATLAS ENERGY,

INC. IN 2011.

PERIODS IN WHICH THESE LIABILITIES MAY BECOME PAYABLE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT SETTLEMENT

OF SUCH LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD.

$5.6 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO REFINANCE IS INCLUDED IN

LONG- TERM DEBT. THE REPAYMENT SCHEDULE ABOVE REFLECTS THE PROJECTED REPAYMENT OF THE ENTIRE

AMOUNTS IN THE 20132014 PERIOD.

4

DOES NOT INCLUDE COMMODITY PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT FIXED OR DETERMINABLE.

THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE GENERALLY MONETIZED IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THROUGH SALES

TRANSACTIONS OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE OBLIGATIONS TO

PURCHASE LNG, REGASIFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY PRODUCTS AT INDEXED PRICES.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS

DISCUSSED BELOW. THE ESTIMATES OF FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK DO NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS

PROJECTION OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE MARKET CHANGES COULD DIFFER

MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE

HEADING RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A, OF THE COMPANYS 2011 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO

THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, LIQUEFIED

NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF ITS

ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR

THE PUR-

CHASE, SALE

AND STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR

COMPANY REFINERIES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING

PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN 2011.

THE COMPANYS MARKET EXPOSURE POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN

INTERNAL RISK CONTROL GROUP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, WHICH HAVE

BEEN APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING

ACTIVITIES CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND ON ELECTRONIC PLATFORMS OF THE INTER-CONTINENTAL EXCHANGE AND CHICAGO MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE. IN ADDITION, CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCT SWAP CONTRACTS AND OPTION

CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS

COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR

DERIVATIVES (ASC 815), WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED

PRINCIPALLY FROM PUBLISHED MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY QUOTES. THE CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE OF CHEVRONS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IN 2011 WAS A QUARTERLY AVERAGE INCREASE

OF $22 MILLION IN TOTAL ASSETS AND A QUARTERLY AVERAGE DECREASE OF $17 MILLION IN TOTAL

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY USES A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON A

SINGLE DAY FROM THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS ON DERIVATIVE COMMODITY

INSTRUMENTS HELD OR ISSUED. VAR IS THE MAXIMUM PROJECTED LOSS NOT TO BE EXCEEDED WITHIN A GIVEN

PROBABILITY OR CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANYS VAR MODEL USES THE MONTE

CARLO SIMULATION METHOD THAT INVOLVES GENERATING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS FROM THE SPECIFIED

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND CONSTRUCTING A FULL DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTFOLIOS POTENTIAL VALUES.

THE VAR MODEL UTILIZES AN EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE FOR COMPUTING HISTORICAL

VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS, A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL, AND A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD. THAT

IS, THE COMPANYS 95 PERCENT, ONE-DAY VAR CORRESPONDS TO THE UNREALIZED LOSS IN PORTFOLIO VALUE

THAT WOULD NOT BE EXCEEDED ON AVERAGE MORE THAN ONE IN EVERY 20 TRADING DAYS, IF THE PORTFOLIO WERE

HELD CONSTANT FOR ONE DAY.

THE ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT MARKET-RISK POSITIONS CAN BE LIQUIDATED

OR HEDGED WITHIN ONE DAY. FOR HEDGING AND RISK MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY USES CONVENTIONAL

EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FUTURES AND OPTIONS AS WELL AS NON-EXCHANGE-TRADED SWAPS, MOST

OF WHICH CAN BE LIQUIDATED OR HEDGED EFFECTIVELY WITHIN ONE DAY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE

95 PERCENT/ONE-DAY VAR FOR EACH OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY RISK EXPOSURES IN THE AREA OF DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED

PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE COMMITMENTS. THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH

RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. THERE WERE NO OPEN FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM TIME TO TIME

AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED

IN INCOME. AT YEAR-END 2011, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS EQUITY

AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS AND LONG-TERM

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. REFER TO OTHER INFORMATION IN NOTE 12 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, PAGE FS-40, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN

NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES

PURSUANT TO LAWS, REGULATIONS, PRIVATE CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

OR THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT

OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF

CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS

SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS,

TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY

DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN

MAGNITUDE OF

POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE

ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS

LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO

WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL

OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF

ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH

EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION

RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

INCLUDED IN THE $1,404 MILLION YEAR-END 2011 RESERVE BALANCE WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT

APPROXIMATELY 180 SITES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR

OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE

LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2011 WAS $185 MILLION. THE

FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON

TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FS-14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2011 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,219 MILLION,

$675 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER

PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), CHEMICAL FACILITIES, AND

PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $544 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM

($95 MILLION), UPSTREAM ($368 MILLION) AND OTHER BUSINESSES ($81 MILLION). LIABILITIES AT ALL

SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS

AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF

CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID

AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL

ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE AND

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2011 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. THE LIABILITY BALANCE OF

APPROXIMATELY $12.8 BILLION FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2011 RELATED PRIMARILY TO

UPSTREAM PROPERTIES.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS FACILITIES,

NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS REACH THE

END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS BEEN

MADE, AS THE INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

REFER ALSO TO NOTE 25 ON PAGE FS-58, RELATED TO THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND

THE DISCUSSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-15.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A

FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

FIELDS. THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF FUTURE

DRILLING ACTIVITY OR DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD

APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION OF SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, A DECREASE

OF $284 MILLION FROM 2010. THE 2010 BALANCE REFLECTED AN

INCREASE OF $283 MILLION FROM 2009.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED

WITH WELL WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS

TO WHETHER THE WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. THE EFFECT ON

EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE $2.4 BILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END 2011 IS

UNCERTAIN PENDING FUTURE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NORMAL PROJECT EVALUATION AND ADDITIONAL DRILLING.

REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-47, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUSPENDED WELLS.

INCOME TAXES

INFORMATION RELATED TO INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES IS INCLUDED ON PAGES

FS-43 THROUGH FS-45 IN NOTE 15 AND PAGE FS-56 IN NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UNDER THE HEADING INCOME TAXES.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

INFORMATION RELATED TO OTHER CONTINGENCIES IS INCLUDED ON

PAGES FS-57 THROUGH FS-58 IN NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER THE HEADING

OTHER CONTINGENCIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE

EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY

OWNED FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION

MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT NON-CHEVRON SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE

BEEN HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO

FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED

ACCEPTABLE AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT

STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON

ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2011 AT APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION FOR ITS

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1.7 BILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION,

CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR ELIMINATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR

DIVESTED SITES, AND THE ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION OF SITES.

FOR 2012, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $1.0 BILLION. THESE

CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND

THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

FS-15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL

INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR EXISTING FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED

IN THE FUTURE TO: PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE

ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY WITH EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND

RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER DIFFERENT

REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING

TO THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT

NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE; AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH

NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

RULES THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER

EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES, WHICH REQUIRE

... BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING DATA, (THE RESERVES) CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMI-

CALLY

PRODUCIBLE... UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS WHERE EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDE PRICES BASED ON THE AVERAGE PRICE DURING THE

12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY

INFORMATION, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-67, FOR THE CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND TO TABLE VII, CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED

FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FROM PROVED RESERVES ON PAGE FS-76 FOR ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE VALUES

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-28, INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-18, INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS

UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES. THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO ESTIMATES,

UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-28. THE

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED

CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT

WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE

COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN

OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE

THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN

OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE

AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING OPEB OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES.

NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-49, INCLUDES INFORMATION ON THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AT THE END OF 2011 AND 2010; THE COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE FOR

THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011; AND THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THOSE PERIODS.

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS

OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THE YEAR-END 2011 AND 2010 FUNDED STATUS, MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS

AND OBLIGATIONS, OF EACH OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OPEB PLANS IS RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET. THE DIFFERENCES RELATED TO OVERFUNDED PENSION PLANS ARE REPORTED AS A LONG-TERM

ASSET IN DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERFUNDED OR

UNFUNDED PENSION AND OPEB PLANS ARE REPORTED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR RESERVES FOR EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS. AMOUNTS YET TO BE RECOGNIZED AS COMPONENTS OF PENSION OR OPEB EXPENSE ARE REPORTED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THE COMPANY USES A PROCESS THAT

INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE

AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS

ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8 PERCENT SINCE 2002. FOR THE 10 YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2011, ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS AVERAGED 5.0 PERCENT FOR THIS PLAN. THE ACTUAL RETURN FOR 2011 WAS

SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROAD DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO OTHER YEARS WITHIN THIS 10 YEAR PERIOD,

ACTUAL ASSET RETURNS FOR THIS PLAN EQUALED OR EXCEEDED 7.8 PERCENT.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS

OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY

MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET

VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 3.8

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN AND 4.0 PERCENT FOR ITS OPEB PLAN. THESE

RATES WERE SELECTED BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO

THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END 2011. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF

2010 AND 2009 WERE 4.8 PERCENT AND 5.3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN, AND

5.0 PERCENT AND 5.8 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. OPEB PLAN.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE

PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2011 WAS

$1.2 BILLION. AS

AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. PENSION

PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2011 BY APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION. A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 63 PERCENT OF

THE COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2011 BY

APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION.

AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE PENSION OBLIGATION, THUS CHANGING THE

FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE AGGREGATE FUNDED STATUS

RECOGNIZED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, WAS A NET LIABILITY OF

APPROXIMATELY $5.4 BILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION LIABILITIES TO THE

DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION, A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE PLAN OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $375 MILLION,

WHICH WOULD HAVE DECREASED THE PLANS UNDERFUNDED STATUS FROM APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION TO $2.1

BILLION. OTHER PLANS WOULD BE LESS UNDERFUNDED AS DISCOUNT RATES INCREASE. THE ACTUAL RATES OF

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLDS FINANCIAL MARKETS.

IN 2011, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE $1.5 BILLION (INCLUDING $1.2 BILLION TO

THE U.S. PLANS). IN 2012, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION.

ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED IF

INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

FOR

THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2011 WAS $220 MILLION, AND THE TOTAL LIABILITY,

WHICH REFLECTED THE UNFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AT THE END OF 2011, WAS $3.8 BILLION.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2011, A

1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED

FOR ABOUT 76 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE DECREASED OPEB EXPENSE BY

APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION. A 0.25 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE SAME PLAN, WHICH

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 81 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE DECREASED TOTAL OPEB

LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2011 BY APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION.

FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS

LIMITED TO 4 PERCENT PER YEAR. FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES UNDER AGE 65 WHOSE CLAIMS

EXPERIENCES ARE COMBINED FOR RATING PURPOSES, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES START WITH 8

PERCENT IN 2012 AND GRADUALLY DROP TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2023 AND BEYOND. AS AN INDICATION OF THE HEALTH

CARE COST-TREND RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2011, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE

IN THE RATES FOR THE MAIN U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 81 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB

LIABILITIES, WOULD HAVE INCREASED OPEB EXPENSE BY $8 MILLION.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE EXPENSE AND

THE FUNDED STATUS OF EACH PLAN AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN BENEFIT PLAN COSTS IN THE

YEAR THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. INSTEAD, THE DIFFERENCES ARE INCLUDED IN ACTUARIAL GAIN/LOSS AND

UNAMORTIZED AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. REFER TO NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-49, FOR INFORMATION ON THE $9.6

BILLION OF BEFORE-TAX ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED BY THE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011; A

DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD USED TO AMORTIZE THOSE COSTS; AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS TO BE

RECOGNIZED IN EXPENSE DURING 2012.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE

COMPANY ASSESSES ITS PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS

OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND,

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED PROVED

RESERVE QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES, AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL

MARKET SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED

PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS. REFER ALSO TO THE

DISCUSSION OF IMPAIRMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN NOTE 9 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34.

NO MAJOR INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E AND INVESTMENTS WERE RECORDED FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF

OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT

PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN

THE ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR

ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS, WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN

NUMBER OF OTHER ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE

EQUITY INVESTEES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE

COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE IS RECORDED TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING

VALUE AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME.

IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE.

DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT, AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES WHETHER ANY

WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN

SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD

OR CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET

REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY

PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE

ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED

OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A

DECISION IS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS. THAT IS, THE ASSETS WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THEY ARE CLASSIFIED

AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, LESS COSTS TO SELL, ARE LESS THAN THE

ASSETS ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO

AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR GOODWILL (ASC 350), THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH

GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF

AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING

LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN

FREQUENTLY VARY FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR

FS-18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES

BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS ON CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT

OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF

CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION, THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS GENERALLY RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES IF

MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY REPORTS

THESE LOSSES AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS HANDLING IS FOR INCOME TAX MATTERS, FOR

WHICH BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT (I.E., LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION. FOR

ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES, REFER TO NOTE 15 BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-43. REFER ALSO TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS SECTION FOR THE EFFECT ON

EARNINGS FROM LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX MATTERS

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN

USED IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT

MUST BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011,

AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE

THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON

OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM

THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED

IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST

BASIS,

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A

MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER

PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT

OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND

REGASIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG); TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR

INTERNATIONAL OIL EXPORT PIPELINES; PROCESSING, TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS;

AND A GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PROJECT. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS RELATE PRIMARILY TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL AND REFINED

PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR; AND MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING

OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND ADDITIVES FOR FUELS AND LUBRICANT

OILS.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND ANY VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN

WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT VENTURES AND

CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO

AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT TO

50 PERCENT, OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY

DECISIONS, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT RESULTS IN

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES EQUITY

CURRENTLY IN INCOME.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND

THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A

DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF

THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO

RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF

INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS NOT CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY

IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE.

WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY TO

REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED

TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY,

GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT

TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN

CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS COMMODITY TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS FROM

TIME TO TIME AS PART OF ITS OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. INTEREST

RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. WHERE CHEVRON IS A

PARTY TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, FAIR VALUE RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EXECUTED WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY ARE GENERALLY OFFSET ON THE BALANCE

SHEET.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE IN

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

BANK TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS ARE REPORTED AS TIME DEPOSITS. THE

BALANCE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND IS MARKED-TO-MARKET,

WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST,

USING A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET. MATERIALS,

SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

FS-28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE

CAPITALIZED PENDING DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT

ARE ASSIGNED PROVED RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE CAPITALIZED FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS

THAT HAVE FOUND CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED WHEN THE DRILLING IS COMPLETED, PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT

QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING

SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT.

ALL OTHER EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE 19, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-47, FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES,

ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED

UNDISCOUNTED, FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR

A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN

INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION,

DEVELOPMENT AREA OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN DOWNSTREAM, IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON

THE BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A MARKETING/LUBRICANTS AREA OR DISTRIBUTION AREA, AS APPROPRIATE.

IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE

EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE

LOWER VALUE. REFER TO NOTE 9, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34, RELATING TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS

A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE AMOUNT

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 25, ON PAGE FS-58, RELATING TO AROS.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD,

GENERALLY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD, AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES

FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION

PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IS GENERALLY USED TO DEPRECIATE

INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES, AND FROM SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE (INCLUDING THOSE FOR PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS),

REPAIRS AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED

AS INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL RESULTING FROM A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED

BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR GOODWILL (ASC 350), THE COMPANY TESTS SUCH GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT

LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT

BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS OR TO

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR

CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION

COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OR CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL

IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY THAT A FUTURE REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND MINERAL-PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A LIABILITY FOR AN ARO IS MADE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS. REFER TO

NOTE 25, ON PAGE FS-58, FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS AROS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY

RECORDS A LIABILITY FOR ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS AND PROBABLE

AMOUNTS FOR OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE

THE OTHER PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF

FUTURE COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE

COMPANYS OWN INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR

REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENT PERIOD INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL, PETROLEUM AND

CHEMICALS PRODUCTS, AND ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, NET OF

ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FROM

PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON THE

ENTITLEMENT METHOD. EXCISE, VALUE-ADDED AND SIMILAR TAXES ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY ON A

REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTION BETWEEN A SELLER AND A CUSTOMER ARE PRESENTED ON A GROSS BASIS. THE

ASSOCIATED AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN AS A FOOTNOTE TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, ON PAGE FS-23.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION

OF ONE ANOTHER (INCLUDING BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS) ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED ON A NET BASIS AND

REPORTED IN PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

STOCK

OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ISSUES STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND ACCOUNTS FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (ASC 718). FOR EQUITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS, TOTAL

COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE, AND FOR LIABILITY AWARDS, SUCH AS STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS, TOTAL COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON THE SETTLEMENT VALUE. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR

ALL AWARDS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD REQUIRED TO EARN THE AWARD, WHICH IS THE SHORTER OF THE VESTING

PERIOD OR THE TIME PERIOD AN EMPLOYEE BECOMES ELIGIBLE TO RETAIN THE AWARD AT RETIREMENT. STOCK

OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN HAVE

GRADED VESTING PROVISIONS BY WHICH ONE-THIRD OF EACH AWARD VESTS ON THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT. THE COMPANY AMORTIZES THESE GRADED AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS.

NOTE 2

ACQUISITION OF ATLAS ENERGY, INC.

ON FEBRUARY 17, 2011, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ATLAS ENERGY, INC. (ATLAS), WHICH HELD ONE OF THE

PREMIER ACREAGE POSITIONS IN THE MARCELLUS SHALE, CONCENTRATED IN SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. THE

AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF ATLAS WAS APPROXIMATELY $4,500, WHICH INCLUDED $3,009

CASH FOR ALL THE COMMON SHARES OF ATLAS, A $403  CASH ADVANCE TO FACILITATE ATLAS

PURCHASE OF A 49 PERCENT INTEREST IN LAUREL MOUNTAIN MIDSTREAM LLC AND ABOUT $1,100  OF

ASSUMED DEBT. SUBSEQUENT TO THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY PAID OFF THE ASSUMED DEBT AND

MADE PAYMENTS OF $184  IN CONNECTION WITH ATLAS EQUITY AWARDS. AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION,

CHEVRON ASSUMED THE TERMS OF A CARRY ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY RELIANCE MARCELLUS, LLC, FUNDS 75 PERCENT

OF CHEVRONS DRILLING COSTS, UP TO $1,300.

THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION (ASC 805) WHICH, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, REQUIRES ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED TO BE MEASURED AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE

FAIR VALUES. PROVISIONAL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE IN FIRST QUARTER 2011 FOR ACQUIRED

ASSETS AND ASSUMED LIABILITIES, AND THE MEASUREMENT PROCESS WAS FINALIZED IN FOURTH QUARTER 2011.

PROFORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS NOT PRESENTED AS IT WOULD NOT BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM

PROPERTIES WERE MEASURED PRIMARILY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE FAIR VALUES OF

THE ACQUIRED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES WERE BASED ON SIGNIFICANT INPUTS NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET

AND THUS REPRESENT LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS. REFER TO NOTE 9, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34 FOR A DEFINITION

OF FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVELS. SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INCLUDED ESTIMATED RESOURCE VOLUMES, ASSUMED

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (ASC 820) ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING

FAIR VALUE AND STIPULATE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARDS APPLY TO

RECURRING AND NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. AMONG THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IS THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE COMPANY USES

TO VALUE AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY. THE THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED AS

FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1: QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR

THE COMPANY, LEVEL 1 INPUTS INCLUDE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR WHICH THE PARTIES ARE

WILLING TO TRANSACT AT THE

EXCHANGE-QUOTED PRICE AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES THAT ARE ACTIVELY TRADED.

LEVEL 2: INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. FOR THE

COMPANY, LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, PRICES OBTAINED

THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES AND PRICES THAT CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OTHER OBSERVABLE

INPUTS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE COMPLETE TERM OF A CONTRACT.

LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE LEVEL 3 INPUTS FOR ANY OF ITS RECURRING

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. LEVEL 3 INPUTS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE

ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN NONRECURRING MEASUREMENTS OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

ON A RECURRING BASIS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 31, 2010.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES FAIR VALUE FOR ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES BASED ON

QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE CASH THAT

WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SOLD AT DECEMBER 31, 2011.

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY

RECORDS ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  OTHER THAN ANY COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE  ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE OFFSETTING AMOUNT TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVES

WITH IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR PROVISIONS AS CONTRACTS THAT ARE PUBLICLY TRADED ON A REGULAR BASIS, THE

COMPANY USES THE MARKET VALUES OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED INSTRUMENTS AS AN INPUT FOR FAIR VALUE

CALCULATIONS.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PRINCIPALLY INCLUDE FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS AND FORWARD

CONTRACTS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCTS. DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1

INCLUDE FUTURES, SWAPS AND OPTIONS CONTRACTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS SUCH AS THE NEW YORK

MERCANTILE EXCHANGE.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS - CONTINUED

DERIVATIVES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INCLUDE SWAPS, OPTIONS, AND FORWARD CONTRACTS

PRINCIPALLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES, THE FAIR VALUES OF WHICH

ARE OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES, INDUSTRY PRICING SERVICES AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY

OBTAINS MULTIPLE SOURCES OF PRICING INFORMATION FOR THE LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS. SINCE THIS PRICING

INFORMATION IS GENERATED FROM OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY CONSISTENT. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MATERIALLY ADJUST THIS INFORMATION. THE COMPANY INCORPORATES INTERNAL REVIEW,

EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES, INCLUDING A COMPARISON OF LEVEL 2 FAIR VALUES DERIVED FROM

THE COMPANYS INTERNALLY DEVELOPED FORWARD CURVES (ON A SAMPLE BASIS) WITH THE PRICING INFORMATION

TO DOCUMENT REASONABLE, LOGICAL AND SUPPORTABLE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS AND PROPER LEVEL OF

CLASSIFICATION.

IMPAIRMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL LONG-LIVED

ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS TO REPORT IN 2011 OR 2010.

IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES

THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL INVESTMENTS AND

ADVANCES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS TO REPORT IN 2011 OR 2010.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND BANK TIME DEPOSITS IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. PORTFOLIOS. THE INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS ARE PRIMARILY BANK TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS AND MONEY MARKET

FUNDS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HAD CARRYING/FAIR VALUES OF $15,864 AND $14,060 AT DECEMBER 31,

2011, AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE INSTRUMENTS HELD IN TIME DEPOSITS ARE BANK TIME

DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS, AND HAD CARRYING/FAIR VALUES OF $3,958 AND $2,855 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND BANK TIME DEPOSITS REFLECT THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE

SETTLED AT DECEMBER 31, 2011.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DO NOT INCLUDE INVESTMENTS WITH A CARRYING/FAIR VALUE

OF $1,240  AND $855  AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011, THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE RESTRICTED FUNDS RELATED TO VARIOUS CAPITAL-INVESTMENT

PROJECTS, ACQUISITIONS PENDING TAX DEFERRED EXCHANGES, AND UPSTREAM ABANDONMENT ACTIVITIES WHICH

ARE REPORTED IN DEFERRED CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. LONG-TERM DEBT OF $4,101 AND $5,636 AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND DECEMBER 31, 2010, HAD ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES OF $4,928 AND $6,311, RESPECTIVELY.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET

RISKS RELATED TO PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS,

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF

ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE, SALE AND

STORAGE OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND FEEDSTOCK FOR COMPANY

REFINERIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED

TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS PRINCIPALLY INCLUDE CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

REFINED PRODUCT FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS, AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. NONE OF THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS DESIGNATED AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS AFFILIATES

MAKE SUCH DESIGNATION. THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVES ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS NO MATERIAL MARKET OR

CREDIT RISKS TO ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF ITS COMMODITY

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY USES INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS TO GOVERN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE

OF THE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE

COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY

AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET MARK-TO-MARKET

EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND

IS A REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO USES OTHER NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS, TIME DEPOSITS, MARKETABLE

SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS.

COMPANY INVESTMENT POLICIES LIMIT THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT RISK. SIMILAR POLICIES ON DIVERSIFICATION AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE

COMPANYS COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE

DISPERSED AMONG THE COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF

ITS CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, REQUIRING

LETTERS OF CREDIT IS A PRINCIPAL METHOD USED TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 11

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ALTHOUGH EACH SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS

OWN AFFAIRS, CHEVRON CORPORATION MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR

AFFILIATES. THE INVESTMENTS ARE GROUPED INTO TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS, UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM,

REPRESENTING THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND OPERATING SEGMENTS AS DEFINED IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING (ASC 280). UPSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXPLORING FOR,

DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND REGASIFICATION

ASSOCIATED WITH LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG); TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL OIL

EXPORT PIPELINES; PROCESSING, TRANSPORTING, STORAGE AND MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS; AND A

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PROJECT. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REFINING OF CRUDE OIL INTO

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING OF CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS; TRANSPORTING OF CRUDE OIL AND

REFINED PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR; AND MANUFACTURING AND

MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT

ADDITIVES. ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE MINING OPERATIONS, POWER GENERATION

BUSINESSES, WORLDWIDE CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT FINANCING ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES, ENERGY SERVICES, ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND

TECHNOLOGY.

THE SEGMENTS ARE SEPARATELY MANAGED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES UNDER A STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES

SEGMENT MANAGERS WHO REPORT TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) (TERMS AS

DEFINED IN ASC 280). THE CODM IS THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (EXCOM), A COMMITTEE OF SENIOR

OFFICERS THAT INCLUDES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND EXCOM REPORTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

CHEVRON CORPORATION.

THE OPERATING SEGMENTS REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY, AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING (ASC 280), THAT ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES (A) FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE

EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM,

WHICH MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS AND ASSESSES THEIR

PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT MANAGERS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO AND MAINTAIN REGULAR

CONTACT WITH THE COMPANYS CODM TO DISCUSS THE SEGMENTS OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. THE CODM APPROVES ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS AT THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT

LEVEL, AS WELL AS REVIEWS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY FUNDING FOR MAJOR PROJECTS AND APPROVES MAJOR

CHANGES TO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS. HOWEVER, BUSINESS-UNIT MANAGERS WITHIN THE

OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND

ALL OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH DAILY OPERATIONS. COMPANY OFFICERS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE EXCOM

ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND PARTICIPATE IN OTHER COMMITTEES FOR PURPOSES

OTHER THAN ACTING AS THE CODM.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY COUNTRY OF OPERATION IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ITS COUNTRY

OF DOMICILE. OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED AS INTERNATIONAL

(OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES).

SEGMENT EARNINGS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ON AN AFTER-TAX

BASIS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF DEBT FINANCING INTEREST EXPENSE OR INVESTMENT INTEREST

INCOME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE COMPANY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS AND ASSETS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE

BILLED FOR THE DIRECT USE OF CORPORATE SERVICES. NONBILLABLE COSTS REMAIN AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL IN

DESCRIPTIONS OF MAJOR AFFILIATES,

INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS

AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF

THE AFFILIATES, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

TENGIZCHEVROIL

CHEVRON HAS A 50 PERCENT EQUITY

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO), A

JOINT VENTURE FORMED IN 1993 TO DEVELOP THE

TENGIZ AND KOROLEV CRUDE OIL FIELDS IN

KAZAKHSTAN OVER A 40-YEAR PERIOD. AT DECEMBER

31, 2011, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

INVESTMENT IN TCO WAS ABOUT $180 HIGHER THAN

THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN TCOS NET

ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE RESULTS FROM CHEVRON

ACQUIRING A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN TCO AT A

VALUE GREATER THAN THE UNDERLYING BOOK VALUE

FOR THAT PORTION OF TCOS NET ASSETS. SEE NOTE

7, ON PAGE FS-33, FOR SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL

INFORMATION FOR 100 PERCENT OF TCO.

INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES  - CONTINUED

PETROPIAR

CHEVRON HAS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST IN PETROPIAR, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2008 TO

OPERATE THE HAMACA HEAVY-OIL PRODUCTION AND UPGRADING PROJECT. THE PROJECT, LOCATED IN VENEZUELAS

ORINOCO BELT, HAS A 25-YEAR CONTRACT TERM. PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF PETROPIAR, CHEVRON HAD A 30

PERCENT INTEREST IN THE HAMACA PROJECT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

INVESTMENT IN PETROPIAR WAS APPROXIMATELY $180 LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

PETROPIARS NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF CHEVRONS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

PETROPIARS NET ASSETS OVER THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE VENTURE.

CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM

CHEVRON HAS A 15 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM, A

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY, WHICH PROVIDES THE CRITICAL EXPORT ROUTE FOR CRUDE OIL FROM BOTH TCO AND

KARACHAGANAK. THE COMPANY JOINED THE CONSORTIUM IN 1997 AND HAS INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES TOTALING

$1,094 WHICH INCLUDES LONG-TERM LOANS OF $L,111 AT YEAR-END 2011. THE LOANS WERE PROVIDED TO FUND

30 PERCENT OF THE INITIAL PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION. THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE

CONSORTIUM BECAUSE IT DOES NOT DIRECT ACTIVITIES OF THE CONSORTIUM AND ONLY RECEIVES ITS

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE FINANCIAL RETURNS.

PETROBOSCAN

CHEVRON HAS A 39 PERCENT INTEREST IN PETROBOSCAN, A JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORMED IN 2006

TO OPERATE THE BOSCAN FIELD IN VENEZUELA UNTIL 2026. CHEVRON PREVIOUSLY OPERATED THE FIELD UNDER AN

OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT

IN PETROBOSCAN WAS APPROXIMATELY $220 HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCANS

NET ASSETS. THE DIFFERENCE REFLECTS THE EXCESS OF THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY

CHEVRON OVER ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN PETROBOSCANS NET ASSETS.

ANGOLA LNG LTD.

CHEVRON HAS A 36 PERCENT INTEREST IN ANGOLA LNG LTD., WHICH WILL PROCESS AND

LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS PRODUCED IN ANGOLA FOR DELIVERY TO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

GS CALTEX CORPORATION

CHEVRON OWNS 50 PERCENT OF GS CALTEX CORPORATION, A JOINT VENTURE WITH GS

PREDOMINANTLY IN SOUTH KOREA.

CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC

LLC. THE OTHER HALF IS OWNED BY CONOCOPHILLIPS CORPORATION.

STAR PETROLEUM REFINING COMPANY LTD.

PETROLEUM REFINING COMPANY LTD. (SPRC), WHICH OWNS THE STAR REFINERY IN THAILAND. PTT PUBLIC

COMPANY LIMITED OWNS THE REMAINING 36 PERCENT OF SPRC.

LITIGATION

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO EIGHT PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS. RESOLUTION OF THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE

FUTURE. THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO PENDING LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT

DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY NO LONGER USES

MTBE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

ECUADOR

CHEVRON IS A DEFENDANT IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF NUEVA LOJA IN LAGO

AGRIO, ECUADOR, BROUGHT IN MAY 2003 BY PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF CERTAIN

RESIDENTS OF AN AREA WHERE AN OIL PRODUCTION CONSORTIUM FORMERLY HAD OPERATIONS. THE LAWSUIT

ALLEGES DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS AND SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES TO FUND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION OF THE ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL

HARM, PLUS A HEALTH MONITORING PROGRAM. UNTIL 1992, TEXACO PETROLEUM COMPANY (TEXPET), A SUBSIDIARY

OF

TEXACO INC., WAS A MINORITY MEMBER OF THIS CONSORTIUM WITH PETROECUADOR, THE ECUADORIAN STATE-OWNED

OIL COMPANY, AS THE MAJORITY PARTNER; SINCE 1990, THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED SOLELY BY

PETROECUADOR. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONSORTIUM AND FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY

ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF THE CONCESSION AREA, TEXPET ENTERED INTO A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR FOR TEXPET TO REMEDIATE SPECIFIC SITES ASSIGNED BY THE

GOVERNMENT IN PROPORTION TO TEXPETS OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE CONSORTIUM. PURSUANT TO THAT

AGREEMENT, TEXPET CONDUCTED A THREE-YEAR REMEDIATION PROGRAM AT A COST OF $40. AFTER

CERTIFYING THAT THE SITES WERE PROPERLY REMEDIATED, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED TEXPET AND ALL RELATED

CORPORATE ENTITIES A FULL RELEASE FROM ANY AND ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE

CONSORTIUM OPERATIONS.

BASED ON THE HISTORY DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT THIS LAWSUIT LACKS LEGAL OR

FACTUAL MERIT. AS TO MATTERS OF LAW, THE COMPANY BELIEVES FIRST, THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION

OVER CHEVRON; SECOND, THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS BRING THE ACTION, ENACTED IN 1999, CANNOT

BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY; THIRD, THAT THE CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN

ECUADOR; AND, FOURTH, THAT THE LAWSUIT IS ALSO BARRED BY THE RELEASES FROM LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY

GIVEN TO TEXPET BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND PETROECUADOR AND BY THE PERTINENT PROVINCIAL AND

MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. WITH REGARD TO THE FACTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS

THAT TEXPETS REMEDIATION WAS PROPERLY CONDUCTED AND THAT THE

LITIGATION - CONTINUED

REMAINING ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE REFLECTS PETROECUADORS FAILURE TO TIMELY FULFILL ITS LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS AND PETROECUADORS FURTHER CONDUCT SINCE ASSUMING FULL CONTROL OVER THE OPERATIONS.

IN 2008, A MINING ENGINEER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO IDENTIFY AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, AND TO SPECIFY STEPS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE IT, ISSUED A REPORT RECOMMENDING

THAT THE COURT ASSESS $18,900, WHICH WOULD, ACCORDING TO THE ENGINEER, PROVIDE FINANCIAL

COMPENSATION FOR PURPORTED DAMAGES, INCLUDING WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS, AND PAY FOR, AMONG OTHER

ITEMS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

PETROECUADOR. THE ENGINEERS REPORT ALSO ASSERTED THAT AN ADDITIONAL $8,400 COULD BE

ASSESSED AGAINST CHEVRON FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT. IN 2009, FOLLOWING THE DISCLOSURE BY CHEVRON OF

EVIDENCE THAT THE JUDGE PARTICIPATED IN MEETINGS IN WHICH BUSINESSPEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS HOLDING

THEMSELVES OUT AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE CASE AND ITS LIKELY OUTCOME, THE JUDGE

PRESIDING OVER THE CASE WAS RECUSED. IN 2010, CHEVRON MOVED TO STRIKE THE MINING ENGINEERS REPORT

AND TO DISMISS THE CASE BASED ON EVIDENCE OBTAINED THROUGH DISCOVERY IN THE UNITED STATES

INDICATING THAT THE REPORT WAS PREPARED BY CONSULTANTS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS BEFORE BEING PRESENTED AS

THE MINING ENGINEERS INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL WORK AND SHOWING FURTHER EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT.

IN AUGUST 2010, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER STATING THAT HE WAS NOT BOUND BY THE MINING ENGINEERS

REPORT AND REQUIRING THE PARTIES TO PROVIDE THEIR POSITIONS ON DAMAGES WITHIN 45 DAYS. CHEVRON

SUBSEQUENTLY PETITIONED FOR RECUSAL OF THE JUDGE, CLAIMING THAT HE HAD DISREGARDED EVIDENCE OF

FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT AND THAT HE HAD FAILED TO RULE ON A NUMBER OF MOTIONS WITHIN THE STATUTORY

TIME REQUIREMENT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2010, CHEVRON SUBMITTED ITS POSITION ON DAMAGES, ASSERTING THAT NO AMOUNT SHOULD

BE ASSESSED AGAINST IT. THE PLAINTIFFSSUBMISSION, WHICH RELIED IN PART ON THE MINING ENGINEERS

REPORT, TOOK THE POSITION THAT DAMAGES ARE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $16,000 AND $76,000 AND

THAT UNJUST ENRICHMENT SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN AN AMOUNT BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $5,000 AND $38,000. THE NEXT DAY, THE JUDGE ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND

NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE HAD REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT.

CHEVRON PETITIONED TO HAVE THAT ORDER DECLARED A NULLITY IN LIGHT OF CHEVRONS PRIOR RECUSAL

PETITION, AND BECAUSE PROCEDURAL AND EVIDENTIARY MATTERS REMAINED UNRESOLVED. IN OCTOBER 2010,

CHEVRONS MOTION TO RECUSE THE JUDGE WAS GRANTED. A NEW JUDGE TOOK CHARGE OF THE CASE AND REVOKED

THE PRIOR JUDGES ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE. ON DECEMBER 17, 2010, THE JUDGE

ISSUED AN ORDER CLOSING THE EVIDENTIARY PHASE OF THE CASE AND NOTIFYING THE PARTIES THAT HE HAD

REQUESTED THE CASE FILE SO THAT HE COULD PREPARE A JUDGMENT.

ON FEBRUARY 14,

2011, THE PROVINCIAL COURT IN LAGO AGRIO RENDERED AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IN THE

CASE. THE  COURT REJECTED CHEVRONS DEFENSES TO THE EXTENT THE COURT ADDRESSED THEM IN

ITS OPINION. THE JUDGMENT ASSESSED APPROXIMATELY $8,600 IN DAMAGES AND APPROXIMATELY $900

AS AN AWARD FOR THE PLAINTIFFS REPRESENTATIVES. IT ALSO ASSESSED AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF

APPROXIMATELY $8,600 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNLESS THE COMPANY ISSUED A PUBLIC APOLOGY WITHIN 15

DAYS OF THE JUDGMENT, WHICH CHEVRON DID NOT DO. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2011, THE PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE

JUDGMENT, SEEKING INCREASED DAMAGES, AND ON MARCH 11, 2011, CHEVRON APPEALED THE JUDGMENT SEEKING

TO HAVE THE JUDGMENT NULLIFIED. ON JANUARY 3, 2012, AN APPELLATE

PANEL IN THE PROVINCIAL

COURT AFFIRMED THE FEBRUARY 14, 2011 DECISION AND ORDERED THAT CHEVRON PAY ADDITIONAL ATTORNEYS FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF .10% OF

THE VALUES THAT ARE DERIVED FROM THE DECISIONAL ACT OF THIS JUDGMENT. THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A

PETITION TO CLARIFY AND AMPLIFY THE APPELLATE DECISION ON JANUARY 6, 2012, AND THE COURT ISSUED A

RULING IN RESPONSE ON JANUARY 13, 2012, PURPORTING TO CLARIFY AND AMPLIFY ITS JANUARY 3, 2012

RULING, WHICH INCLUDED CLARIFICATION THAT THE DEADLINE FOR THE COMPANY TO ISSUE A PUBLIC APOLOGY TO

AVOID THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8,600 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES  WAS WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF THE CLARIFICATION RULING, OR FEBRUARY 3, 2012.

CHEVRON DID NOT ISSUE AN APOLOGY BECAUSE DOING SO MIGHT BE MISCHARACTERIZED AS AN ADMISSION OF

LIABILITY AND WOULD BE CONTRARY TO FACTS AND EVIDENCE SUBMITTED AT

TRIAL. ON JANUARY 20, 2012,

CHEVRON APPEALED (CALLED A PETITION FOR CASSATION) THE APPELLATE  PANELS DECISION TO ECUADORS

NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE. AS PART OF THE APPEAL, CHEVRON  REQUESTED THE SUSPENSION OF

ANY REQUIREMENT THAT CHEVRON POST A BOND TO PREVENT ENFORCEMENT UNDER ECUADORIAN

LAW OF THE JUDGMENT DURING THE CASSATION APPEAL.

ON FEBRUARY 17, 2012, THE APPELLATE PANEL OF THE PROVINCIAL COURT ADMITTED CHEVRONS CASSATION APPEAL IN A

PROCEDURAL STEP NECESSARY FOR THE NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE TO HEAR THE APPEAL. THE PROVINCIAL COURT APPELLATE PANEL DENIED CHEVRONS

REQUEST FOR A SUSPENSION OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT CHEVRON POST A BOND AND STATED THAT IT WOULD NOT COMPLY WITH THE FIRST INTERIM

AWARD OF THE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL DISCUSSED BELOW.

CHEVRON CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THE PROVINCIAL COURTS JUDGMENT IS ILLEGITIMATE AND UNENFORCEABLE IN ECUADOR, THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THE

COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE JUDGMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF FRAUD, AND CONTRARY TO THE LEGITIMATE

SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. CHEVRON CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OR ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE APPEALS PROCESS

IN ECUADOR. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF ANY IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY.

CHEVRON HAS NO  ASSETS IN ECUADOR AND THE LAGO AGRIO  PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS HAVE STATED IN PRESS RELEASES

AND THROUGH OTHER MEDIA THAT THEY WILL SEEK TO  ENFORCE THE ECUADORIAN

JUDGEMENT   IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES

AND OTHERWISE DISRUPT CHEVRONS OPERATIONS. CHEVRON EXPECTS TO CONTEST AND DEFEND AGAINST ANY SUCH

ACTIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHEVRON AND TEXPET FILED AN ARBITRATION CLAIM IN SEPTEMBER 2009 AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF

ECUADOR BEFORE AN ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL PRESIDING IN THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION IN THE

HAGUE UNDER THE RULES OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW. THE CLAIM

ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADORS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE UNITED STATESECUADOR

BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT) AND BREACHES OF THE SETTLEMENT AND RELEASE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR AND TEXPET (DESCRIBED ABOVE), WHICH ARE INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS PROTECTED BY THE

BIT. THROUGH THE ARBITRATION, CHEVRON AND TEXPET ARE SEEKING RELIEF AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF

ECUADOR, INCLUDING A DECLARATION THAT ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION

CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION OF ECUADORS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BIT. ON FEBRUARY 9, 2011, THE TRIBUNAL

ISSUED AN ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES REQUIRING THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR TO TAKE ALL MEASURES AT ITS

DISPOSAL TO SUSPEND OR CAUSE TO BE SUSPENDED THE ENFORCEMENT OR RECOGNITION WITHIN AND WITHOUT

ECUADOR OF ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE

TRIBUNAL. ON JANUARY 25, 2012, THE TRIBUNAL CONVERTED THE ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES INTO AN

INTERIM AWARD. CHEVRON FILED A RENEWED APPLICATION FOR FURTHER INTERIM MEASURES ON JANUARY 4,

2012, AND THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR OPPOSED CHEVRONS APPLICATION AND REQUESTED THAT THE EXISTING

ORDER FOR INTERIM MEASURES BE VACATED ON JANUARY 9, 2012.

ON FEBRUARY 16, 2012, THE TRIBUNAL ISSUED A SECOND INTERIM AWARD MANDATING THAT THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR TAKE ALL

MEASURES NECESSARY (WHETHER BY ITS JUDICIAL, LEGISLATIVE OR EXECUTIVE BRANCHES) TO

SUSPEND OR CAUSE TO BE SUSPENDED THE ENFORCEMENT AND RECOGNITION WITHIN AND WITHOUT

ECUADOR OF THE JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON AND, IN PARTICULAR, TO PRECLUDE ANY CERTIFICATION

BY THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR THAT WOULD CAUSE THE JUDGMENT TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST

CHEVRON.

CHEVRON EXPECTS TO CONTINUE SEEKING

PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND MONETARY RELIEF BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL.

THROUGH A SERIES OF RECENT U.S. COURT PROCEEDINGS INITIATED BY CHEVRON TO OBTAIN DISCOVERY

RELATING TO THE LAGO AGRIO LITIGATION AND THE BIT ARBITRATION, CHEVRON HAS OBTAINED EVIDENCE THAT

IT BELIEVES SHOWS A PATTERN OF FRAUD, COLLUSION, CORRUPTION, AND OTHER MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF

SEVERAL LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND OTHERS ACTING FOR THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS. IN FEBRUARY 2011,

CHEVRON FILED A CIVIL LAWSUIT IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

AGAINST THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND SEVERAL OF THEIR LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND SUPPORTERS,

ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT AND OTHER STATE LAWS.

THROUGH THE CIVIL LAWSUIT, CHEVRON IS SEEKING RELIEF THAT INCLUDES AN AWARD OF DAMAGES AND A

DECLARATION THAT ANY JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO

LITIGATION IS THE RESULT OF FRAUD

AND OTHER UNLAWFUL CONDUCT AND IS THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE. ON MARCH 7, 2011, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT

COURT ISSUED A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE LAGO AGRIO PLAINTIFFS AND PERSONS ACTING IN

CONCERT WITH THEM FROM TAKING ANY ACTION IN FURTHERANCE OF RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY

JUDGMENT AGAINST CHEVRON IN THE LAGO AGRIO CASE PENDING RESOLUTION OF CHEVRONS CIVIL LAWSUIT BY

THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.

ON MAY 31, 2011, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT SEVERED CLAIMS ONE THROUGH EIGHT OF CHEVRONS COMPLAINT

FROM THE NINTH CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND IMPOSED A DISCOVERY STAY ON CLAIMS ONE THROUGH EIGHT PENDING

A  TRIAL ON THE NINTH CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF.

ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2011, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT VACATED THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, STAYED THE TRIAL ON

CHEVRONS NINTH CLAIM, A CLAIM FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF, THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR NOVEMBER 14, 2011, AND DENIED THE

DEFENDANTS MANDAMUS PETITION TO RECUSE THE JUDGE HEARING THE LAWSUIT. THE SECOND CIRCUIT

ISSUED ITS OPINION ON JANUARY 26, 2012 ORDERING THE DISMISSAL OF CHEVRONS NINTH CLAIM FOR

DECLARATORY RELIEF. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2012, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT LIFTED THE STAY ON CLAIMS ONE THROUGH EIGHT.

THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE FOREGOING MATTERS, INCLUDING ANY FINANCIAL EFFECT ON CHEVRON,

REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A

RANGE OF LOSS) CAN BE MADE IN THIS CASE. DUE TO THE DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ECUADORIAN

JUDGMENT, THE 2008 ENGINEERS REPORT ON ALLEGED DAMAGES AND THE SEPTEMBER 2010 PLAINTIFFSSUBMISSION ON ALLEGED DAMAGES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE ANY UTILITY IN

CALCULATING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS). MOREOVER, THE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN LEGAL

ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE CASE PROVIDES NO BASIS FOR MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE A REASONABLY POSSIBLE

LOSS (OR A RANGE OF LOSS).

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 40.3 PERCENT IN 2010 TO 43.3 PERCENT IN 2011.

THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES IN INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

JURISDICTIONS. THE HIGHER INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER

UTILIZATION OF NON-U.S. TAX CREDITS IN 2011 AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN INCOME TAX RATES BETWEEN

PERIODS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT IMPACTS BETWEEN PERIODS.

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AT THE END OF 2011 INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $3,600 FROM YEAR-END

2010. THE INCREASE WAS RELATED TO INCREASED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2,500 IN 2011. INCREASES PRIMARILY RELATED TO

ADDITIONAL FOREIGN TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM EARNINGS IN HIGH-TAX-RATE INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS

(WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY VALUATION ALLOWANCES) AND TO INCREASED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES

FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THESE EFFECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN DEFERRED CREDITS

RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE USAGE OF TAX BENEFITS IN INTERNATIONAL TAX JURISDICTIONS.

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS, TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES. IT REDUCES THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

TO AMOUNTS THAT ARE, IN MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. AT THE END

OF 2011, TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WERE APPROXIMATELY $2,160, PRIMARILY RELATED TO VARIOUS

INTERNATIONAL TAX JURISDICTIONS. WHEREAS SOME OF THESE TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS DO NOT HAVE AN

EXPIRATION DATE, OTHERS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES FROM 2012 THROUGH 2036. FOREIGN TAX CREDIT

UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(ASC 740-10), A COMPANY RECOGNIZES A TAX BENEFIT IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITION ONLY IF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (I.E., A

LIKELIHOOD GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT) TO BE ALLOWED BY THE TAX JURISDICTION BASED SOLELY ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TERM TAX POSITION IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR INCOME

TAXES REFERS TO A POSITION IN A PREVIOUSLY FILED TAX RETURN OR A POSITION EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A

FUTURE TAX RETURN THAT IS REFLECTED IN MEASURING CURRENT OR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIODS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE INDICATES THE CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009. THE TERM UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE

RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE OF THE TAX AUDITS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. HOWEVER, IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT DEVELOPMENTS ON TAX MATTERS IN CERTAIN TAX JURISDICTIONS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE COMPANYS TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT STILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER OF MATTERS BEING

EXAMINED IN THE VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME, THE COMPANY REPORTS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO

LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, ACCRUALS

OF $118 FOR ANTICIPATED INTEREST AND PENALTY OBLIGATIONS WERE INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET, COMPARED WITH ACCRUALS OF $225 AS OF YEAR-END 2010. INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) ASSOCIATED

WITH INTEREST AND PENALTIES WAS $(64), $40 AND $(20) IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, WERE 0.04 PERCENT AND 0.16

REDEEMABLE LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF TAX-EXEMPT VARIABLE-RATE PUT BONDS THAT

ARE INCLUDED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES BECAUSE THEY BECOME REDEEMABLE AT THE OPTION OF THE BONDHOLDERS

DURING THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. IN 2011, $374 OF TAX-EXEMPT BONDS RELATED TO

PROJECTS AT THE PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI, REFINERY WERE ISSUED.

THE COMPANY MAY PERIODICALLY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON A PORTION OF ITS SHORT-TERM

DEBT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON SHORT-TERM DEBT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD $6,000 IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR

BANKS, EXPIRING IN DECEMBER 2016, THAT ENABLE THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A

LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING AND CAN ALSO BE USED FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING

COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT

INTEREST RATES BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES

PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO

BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED $5,600 AND $5,400, RESPECTIVELY, OF

SHORT-TERM DEBT AS LONG-TERM. SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF

WORKING CAPITAL WITHIN ONE YEAR, AS THE COMPANY HAS BOTH THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED

BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY

WELLS (ASC 932) PROVIDE THAT EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS CONTINUE TO BE CAPITALIZED AFTER THE COMPLETION

OF DRILLING WHEN (A) THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY COMPLETION AS

A PRODUCING WELL AND (B) THE ENTITY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE

ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. IF EITHER CONDITION IS NOT MET OR IF AN ENTERPRISE

OBTAINS INFORMATION THAT RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OR OPERATIONAL VIABILITY OF

THE PROJECT, THE EXPLORATORY WELL WOULD BE ASSUMED TO BE IMPAIRED, AND ITS COSTS, NET OF ANY

SALVAGE VALUE, WOULD BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. (NOTE THAT AN ENTITY IS NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE

EXPLORATORY WELL AS A PRODUCING WELL.) THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PROVIDE A NUMBER OF INDICATORS THAT

CAN ASSIST AN ENTITY IN DEMONSTRATING THAT SUFFICIENT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN

ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT.

MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BEFORE PRODUCTION COULD BEGIN AND FOR WHICH ADDITIONAL DRILLING EFFORTS

WERE NOT UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. ADDITIONAL DRILLING WAS NOT DEEMED

$170 ($110 AFTER TAX) FOR 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. NO SIGNIFICANT STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION COST WAS CAPITALIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010.

CASH RECEIVED IN PAYMENT FOR OPTION EXERCISES UNDER ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR

2011, 2010 AND 2009 WAS $948, $385 AND $147, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS REALIZED FOR THE TAX

DEDUCTIONS FROM OPTION EXERCISES WERE $121, $66 AND $25 FOR 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH PAID TO SETTLE PERFORMANCE UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS WAS $151, $140 AND $89 FOR

2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

CHEVRON LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)

AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS,

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND NONSTOCK GRANTS. FROM APRIL 2004 THROUGH JANUARY 2014, NO MORE THAN 160

MILLION SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP, AND NO MORE THAN 64 MILLION OF THOSE SHARES MAY BE IN

A FORM OTHER THAN A STOCK OPTION, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT OR AWARD REQUIRING FULL PAYMENT FOR

SHARES BY THE AWARD RECIPIENT. FOR THE MAJOR TYPES OF AWARDS OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011,

THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS VARY BETWEEN THREE YEARS FOR THE PERFORMANCE UNITS AND 10 YEARS FOR THE STOCK

OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

TEXACO STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (TEXACO SIP)

ON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF TEXACO IN OCTOBER

2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRON OPTIONS. THESE

OPTIONS, WHICH HAD 10-YEAR CONTRACTUAL LIVES EXTENDING INTO 2011, RETAINED A PROVISION FOR BEING

RESTORED. THIS PROVISION ENABLED A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISED A STOCK OPTION TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS

EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WHO HAD SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING

OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE

RESTORED OPTIONS WERE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE

WAS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED OPTION WAS GRANTED. BEGINNING IN

2007, RESTORED OPTIONS WERE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP. NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE

FORMER TEXACO PLANS.

UNOCAL SHARE-BASED PLANS (UNOCAL PLANS)

WHEN CHEVRON ACQUIRED UNOCAL IN AUGUST 2005, OUTSTANDING

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS UNOCAL PLANS WERE EXCHANGED FOR

FULLY VESTED CHEVRON OPTIONS AND APPRECIATION RIGHTS. THESE AWARDS RETAINED THE SAME PROVISIONS AS

DURING THIS PERIOD, THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS PRACTICE OF ISSUING TREASURY SHARES UPON EXERCISE OF

PROCEEDS DISTRIBUTED TO RECIPIENTS AND 47,167 UNITS WERE FORFEITED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, UNITS

OUTSTANDING WERE 2,881,836, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS

$294. IN ADDITION, OUTSTANDING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND OTHER AWARDS THAT WERE GRANTED UNDER

VARIOUS LTIP AND FORMER TEXACO AND UNOCAL PROGRAMS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION EQUIVALENT

SHARES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. A LIABILITY OF $62 WAS RECORDED FOR THESE AWARDS.

NOTE 21

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY

PREFUNDS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS AS REQUIRED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS OR IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE

PREFUNDING PROVIDES ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES. IN THE UNITED STATES, ALL QUALIFIED PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING STANDARD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

TYPICALLY FUND U.S. NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER

LAWS AND REGULATIONS BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS ECONOMIC AND

INVESTMENT RETURNS MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT (OPEB) PLANS THAT PROVIDE MEDICAL AND DENTAL

BENEFITS, AS WELL AS LIFE INSURANCE FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES. THE PLANS ARE

UNFUNDED, AND THE COMPANY AND RETIREES SHARE THE COSTS. MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE

RETIREES IN THE COMPANYS MAIN U.S. MEDICAL PLAN IS SECONDARY TO MEDICARE (INCLUDING PART D) AND

THE INCREASE TO THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 4

PERCENT EACH YEAR. CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY THE COMPANY.

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (ASC 715), THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE

OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF EACH OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OPEB PLANS AS AN ASSET

OR LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011, FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB PLANS ARE BEING

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER APPROXIMATELY 10, 12 AND EIGHT YEARS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE

AMORTIZATION PERIODS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE OF EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO

RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLANS. THESE LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED 10 PERCENT

OF THE HIGHER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. THE

AMOUNT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION IS DETERMINED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS. DURING 2012, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $476, $142 AND $75 WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S. PENSION, INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

OPEB PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES AN ADDITIONAL $260 WILL BE RECOGNIZED

FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS DURING 2012 RELATED TO LUMP-SUM SETTLEMENT COSTS FROM

U.S. PENSION PLANS.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR RECOGNIZING PRIOR SERVICE COSTS (CREDITS)

RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, WAS APPROXIMATELY SIX AND

SEVEN YEARS FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND TWO YEARS FOR OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. DURING 2012, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES PRIOR SERVICE (CREDITS) COSTS OF

$(8), $21 AND $(72) WILL BE AMORTIZED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR U.S. PENSION,

INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OPEB PLANS, RESPECTIVELY.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS

ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE

PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET-CLASS

RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY

STUDIES, AND THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002

FOR U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2011, THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8 PERCENT.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF

PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE YEAR-END

MEASUREMENT DATE, AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING

RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF

DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR.

FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF YEAR-END IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 3.8

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS AND 4.0 PERCENT FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLAN. THIS RATE WAS BASED ON A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT MATCHED ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS TO THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT YIELD CURVE AS OF YEAR-END 2011. THE DISCOUNT RATES AT

THE END OF 2010 AND 2009 WERE 4.8 AND 5.3 PERCENT AND 5.0 AND 5.8 PERCENT FOR THE U.S. PENSION

PLANS AND THE U.S. OPEB PLAN, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER BENEFIT ASSUMPTIONS

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2011, FOR THE MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND RATES START WITH 8 PERCENT IN 2012 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2023 AND

BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES

STARTED WITH 8 PERCENT IN 2011 AND GRADUALLY DECLINED TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2018 AND BEYOND. IN BOTH

MEASUREMENTS, THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS WAS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED

FOR RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS. THE IMPACT IS MITIGATED BY THE 4 PERCENT CAP ON THE COMPANYS

MEDICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PLAN. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE IN THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

PLAN ASSETS AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF INPUTS THE COMPANY USES TO VALUE

THE PENSION ASSETS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE LEVELS.

LEVEL 1: FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS ARE MEASURED USING UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR THE

ASSETS OR THE PRICES OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS THAT THE PLANS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

ACCESS.

LEVEL 2: FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS ARE MEASURED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS

IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS IN INACTIVE MARKETS; INPUTS OTHER

THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET; AND INPUTS THAT ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM

OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA THROUGH CORRELATION OR OTHER MEANS. IF THE ASSET HAS A

CONTRACTUAL TERM, THE LEVEL 2 INPUT IS OBSERVABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSET.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR LEVEL 2 ASSETS ARE GENERALLY OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY BROKER QUOTES,

INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES AND EXCHANGES.

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE PENSION PLANS ARE TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST RATE

OF TOTAL RETURN WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS OF RISK AND LIQUIDITY, TO DIVERSIFY AND MITIGATE POTENTIAL

DOWNSIDE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTMENTS, AND TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR BENEFIT

PAYMENTS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANYS U.S. AND U.K. PENSION PLANS COMPRISE 86 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL PENSION ASSETS.

BOTH THE U.S. AND U.K. PLANS HAVE AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE THAT REGULARLY MEETS DURING THE YEAR TO

REVIEW THE ASSET HOLDINGS AND THEIR RETURNS. TO ASSESS THE PLANS INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, LONG-TERM

ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE CHEVRON BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED THE

FOLLOWING APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES 4070 PERCENT, FIXED INCOME AND CASH 2065

PERCENT, REAL ESTATE 015 PERCENT, AND OTHER 05 PERCENT. FOR THE U.K. PENSION PLAN, THE U.K. BOARD

OF TRUSTEES HAS ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING ASSET ALLOCATION GUIDELINES, WHICH ARE REVIEWED

REGULARLY: EQUITIES 6080 PERCENT AND FIXED INCOME AND CASH 2040 PERCENT. THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ALSO HAVE ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES THAT

VARY BY PLAN. ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION WITHIN APPROVED RANGES IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF CURRENT

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS RISK. TO MITIGATE

CONCENTRATION AND OTHER RISKS, ASSETS ARE INVESTED ACROSS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES WITH ACTIVE

INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND PASSIVE INDEX FUNDS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT PREFUND ITS OPEB OBLIGATIONS.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

IN 2011, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $1,147 AND $319 TO

ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2012, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $600 AND $300 TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RETURNS,

CHANGES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL

FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN

PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PAYING OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $223 IN

2012, COMPARED WITH $198 PAID IN 2011.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF CHEVRON AND CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP).

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE

FUNDED EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE

RELEASE OF COMMON STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (LESOP), WHICH IS

DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION THAT FOLLOWS. TOTAL COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS

WITHIN THE ESIP WERE $263, $253 AND $257 IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS

REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF SHARES RELEASED FROM THE

PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRON ESIP IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP).

IN 1989, CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LESOP AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES

PARTIAL PREFUNDING OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

AS PERMITTED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (ASC 718), THE DEBT OF THE

LESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS DEFERRED

COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLAN TRUST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE. INTEREST ACCRUED ON LESOP DEBT IS

RECORDED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF

RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL LESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE

COMPUTATIONS.

TOTAL CREDITS TO EXPENSE FOR THE LESOP WERE $1, $1 AND $3 IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY. THE NET CREDIT FOR THE RESPECTIVE YEARS WAS COMPOSED OF CREDITS TO COMPENSATION

EXPENSE OF $5, $6 AND $15 AND CHARGES TO INTEREST EXPENSE FOR LESOP DEBT OF $4, $5 AND $12.

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES, $18, $46 AND $110 WERE USED IN 2011, 2010 AND

2009, RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED IN 2011, 2010 OR 2009,

AS DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY THE LESOP WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE.

SHARES HELD IN THE LESOP ARE RELEASED AND ALLOCATED TO THE ACCOUNTS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS

BASED ON DEBT SERVICE DEEMED TO BE PAID IN THE YEAR IN PROPORTION TO THE TOTAL OF CURRENT-YEAR

AND REMAINING DEBT SERVICE. LESOP SHARES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, TEXACO ESTABLISHED A BENEFIT PLAN TRUST

FOR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS. AT YEAR-END 2011, THE TRUST CONTAINED

14.2 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRON TREASURY STOCK. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE SHARES OR USE THE

DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT PAY SUCH

BENEFITS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BENEFIT PLANS. THE

TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUSTS

BENEFICIARIES. THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE

PURPOSES UNTIL DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD BY THE TRUST IN PAYMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

PRIOR TO ITS ACQUISITION BY CHEVRON, UNOCAL ESTABLISHED VARIOUS GRANTOR TRUSTS TO FUND

OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS, INCLUDING THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL

RETIREMENT PLANS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010, TRUST ASSETS OF $51 AND $57, RESPECTIVELY, WERE

INVESTED PRIMARILY IN INTEREST-EARNING ACCOUNTS.

EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

THE CHEVRON INCENTIVE PLAN IS AN ANNUAL CASH BONUS PLAN FOR ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES THAT LINKS AWARDS TO CORPORATE, UNIT AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR CASH BONUSES WERE $1,217, $766 AND $561 IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY. CHEVRON ALSO HAS THE LTIP FOR OFFICERS AND OTHER REGULAR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK THAT WERE RESERVED FOR AWARDS UNDER THE CHEVRON CORPORATION NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS EQUITY COMPENSATION AND DEFERRAL PLAN.

NOTE 23

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2010, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED EMPLOYEE REDUCTION PROGRAMS RELATED TO THE

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION OF ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES AND CORPORATE STAFFS. TOTAL

TERMINATIONS UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2,700 EMPLOYEES. ABOUT 1,300 OF

THE AFFECTED EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. ABOUT 2,500 EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TERMINATED

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND THE PROGRAMS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2011.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING EMPLOYEES DESIGNATED FOR TERMINATION UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES QUARTERLY. THESE

LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE

BEEN CALCULATED. REFER TO NOTE 15, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-43, FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PERIODS FOR

WHICH TAX RETURNS HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A DISCUSSION

FOR ALL TAX JURISDICTIONS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT SETTLEMENT OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS TO

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY.

GUARANTEES

THE COMPANYS GUARANTEE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 IS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN PAYMENTS

UNDER A TERMINAL USE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY A COMPANY AFFILIATE. THE TERMINAL COMMENCED

OPERATIONS IN THIRD QUARTER 2011. OVER THE APPROXIMATE 16-YEAR TERM OF THE GUARANTEE, THE MAXIMUM

GUARANTEE AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED OVER TIME AS CERTAIN FEES ARE PAID BY THE AFFILIATE. THERE ARE

NUMEROUS CROSS-INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS WITH THE AFFILIATE AND THE OTHER PARTNERS TO PERMIT RECOVERY

OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE GUARANTEE. CHEVRON HAS RECORDED NO LIABILITY FOR ITS OBLIGATION UNDER

THIS GUARANTEE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF EQUILON

AND MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THROUGH THE END OF 2011, THE COMPANY PAID $48 UNDER

THESE INDEMNITIES AND CONTINUES TO BE OBLIGATED UP TO $250 FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL

INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

OF ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA, OR THAT

OCCURRED DURING THE

PERIOD OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE ENVIRONMENTAL

CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER 2001.

CLAIMS HAD TO BE ASSERTED BY FEBRUARY 2009 FOR EQUILON INDEMNITIES AND MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER

THAN FEBRUARY 2012 FOR MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. IN FEBRUARY 2012, MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC DELIVERED A

LETTER TO THE COMPANY PURPORTING TO PRESERVE UNMATURED CLAIMS FOR CERTAIN MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. THE

LETTER ITSELF PROVIDES NO ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE CLAIM AMOUNT. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS

LETTER OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDES A BASIS TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF A RANGE OF LOSS

OR POTENTIAL RANGE OF LOSS WITH RESPECT TO EITHER THE EQUILON OR THE

MOTIVA INDEMNITIES. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE

PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ARE TO BE NET OF

AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR

MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD IN 1997. THE ACQUIRER OF THOSE

ASSETS SHARED IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS UP TO A MAXIMUM OBLIGATION OF $200, WHICH

HAD BEEN REACHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. UNDER THE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT, AFTER REACHING THE $200

OBLIGATION, CHEVRON IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE UNTIL APRIL 2022, WHEN THE INDEMNIFICATION EXPIRES. THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

THE SALE OF THE ASSETS IN 1997.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY THAT ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT

TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING THROUGHPUT AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE AGREEMENTS

TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY, DRILLING RIGS,

UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE

2010 AND $8,100 IN 2009.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO LAWS, REGULATIONS, PRIVATE

CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS

OR THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS

ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE

COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL

FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND MINING OPERATIONS, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS

THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE

ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

CHEVRONS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WAS $1,404. INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE

WERE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT APPROXIMATELY 180 SITES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS

A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND

LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2011 WAS

$185. THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY

FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE

CHEVRON TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2011 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,219, $675 RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS

(I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS), CHEMICAL FACILITIES, AND PIPELINES. THE REMAINING $544 WAS

ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($95), UPSTREAM ($368) AND OTHER

BUSINESSES ($81). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION

OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL

EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF

PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND

MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE

AND LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2011 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT

WAS MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

REFER TO NOTE 25 ON PAGE FS-58 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

ON APRIL 26, 2010, A CALIFORNIA APPEALS COURT ISSUED A RULING RELATED TO THE

ADEQUACY OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (EIR) SUPPORTING THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN PERMITS BY THE

CITY OF RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA, TO REPLACE AND UPGRADE CERTAIN FACILITIES AT CHEVRONS REFINERY IN

RICHMOND. SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WITH PLAINTIFFS IN THE CASE ENDED LATE FOURTH QUARTER 2010, AND ON

MARCH 3, 2011, THE TRIAL COURT ENTERED A FINAL JUDGMENT AND PEREMPTORY WRIT ORDERING THE CITY TO

SET ASIDE THE PROJECT EIR AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS AND ENJOINING CHEVRON FROM ANY FURTHER WORK.

ON MAY 23, 2011, THE COMPANY FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE CITY PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOR A

CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT FOR A REVISED PROJECT TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HYDROGEN PLANT,

CERTAIN SULFUR REMOVAL FACILITIES AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. ON JUNE 10, 2011, THE CITY PUBLISHED

ITS NOTICE OF PREPARATION OF THE REVISED EIR FOR THE PROJECT. THE REVISED

FS-57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS - CONTINUED

AND RECIRCULATED EIR IS INTENDED TO COMPLY WITH THE APPEALS COURT DECISION. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT ARE UNCERTAIN. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE

COMPANYS FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION, OR POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF ANY ACTION OR COMBINATION OF ACTIONS,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE FINANCIAL EFFECTS, IF ANY, CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE FUTURE PERIOD.

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS; TRADING PARTNERS; U.S. FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES; GOVERNMENTS; CONTRACTORS; INSURERS; AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS

OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO

RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 25

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO) AS AN

ASSET AND LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE

LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM THE

ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL, EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY MAY EXIST ABOUT THE TIMING

AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT THAT MAY BE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL. THIS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT IS FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY WHEN

SUFFICIENT INFORMATION EXISTS TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE. RECOGNITION OF THE ARO INCLUDES.

(1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING ASSET, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT

LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION OF THE ASSET, AND (3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES

AND DISCOUNT RATES.

AROS ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED FOR THE COMPANYS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING ASSETS. NO

SIGNIFICANT AROS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE DOWNSTREAM LONG-LIVED ASSETS HAVE

BEEN RECOGNIZED, AS INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS OF ITS DOWNSTREAM

LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE

CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM

ENGINEERS, THE WORLD PETROLEUM CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS. THE

SYSTEM CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS AT THE TIME OF

REPORTING  THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND THREE POTENTIALLY RECOVERABLE. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL

CLASSIFICATION ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES OF UNPROVED: PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE

POTENTIALLY RECOVERABLE CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES

ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA

DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE IN THE FUTURE FROM KNOWN

RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. NET

PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

ARE THE QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND

ENGINEERS. AS PART OF THE

INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVES ADVISORY

COMMITTEE (RAC) THAT IS CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE RESERVES MANAGER, WHO IS A MEMBER OF A CORPORATE

DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE CORPORATE RESERVES MANAGER, WHO ACTS AS CHAIRMAN OF THE

RAC, HAS MORE THAN 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND A MASTER OF SCIENCE

IN PETROLEUM ENGINEERING DEGREE FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY. HIS EXPERIENCE INCLUDES MORE THAN

15 YEARS OF MANAGING OIL AND GAS RESERVES PROCESSES. HE WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SOCIETY OF

PETROLEUM ENGINEERS OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE, CURRENTLY SERVES ON THE UNITED NATIONS EXPERT

GROUP ON RESOURCES CLASSIFICATION, AND IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM EVALUATION

ENGINEERS. HE IS ALSO A PAST MEMBER OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON RESERVES EVALUATOR TRAINING AND THE

CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION COMMITTEE.

ALL RAC MEMBERS ARE DEGREED PROFESSIONALS, EACH WITH MORE THAN 15 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS

ASPECTS OF RESERVES ESTIMATION RELATING TO RESERVOIR ENGINEERING, PETROLEUM ENGINEERING, EARTH

SCIENCE, OR FINANCE. THE MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN SEC GUIDELINES FOR PROVED RESERVES

CLASSIFICATION AND RECEIVE ANNUAL TRAINING ON THE PREPARATION OF RESERVES ESTIMATES. THE RESERVES

ACTIVITIES ARE MANAGED BY TWO OPERATING COMPANY-LEVEL RESERVES MANAGERS. THESE TWO RESERVES

MANAGERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE RAC SO AS TO PRESERVE THE CORPORATE-LEVEL INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: ESTABLISH THE POLICIES AND PROCESSES USED

WITHIN THE OPERATING UNITS TO ESTIMATE RESERVES; PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS AND OVERSIGHT OF THE

BUSINESS UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVES

ESTIMATES AND CHANGES; CONFIRM THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES ARE CALCULATED USING CONSISTENT AND APPROPRIATE

STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH PROVIDES

STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON RESERVES.

DURING

THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM

BUSINESS UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR

CHANGES ARE ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND PLANNING COMMITTEE, WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANYS ANNUAL RESERVE ACTIVITY

IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IF MAJOR CHANGES TO RESERVES WERE TO OCCUR BETWEEN

THE ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE BOARD.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE

LARGE PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED-RESERVE

RECORDS AND DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL.

TECHNOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2011

IN 2011, ADDITIONS TO

CHEVRONS PROVED RESERVES WERE BASED ON A WIDE RANGE OF GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES.

INFORMATION GENERATED FROM WELLS, SUCH AS WELL LOGS, WIRE LINE SAMPLING, PRODUCTION AND PRESSURE

TESTING, FLUID ANALYSIS, AND CORE ANALYSIS, WAS INTEGRATED WITH SEISMIC, REGIONAL GEOLOGIC STUDIES,

AND INFORMATION FROM ANALOGOUS RESERVOIRS TO PROVIDE REASONABLY CERTAIN PROVED RESERVES

ESTIMATES. BOTH PROPRIETARY AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ANALYTIC TOOLS INCLUDING RESERVOIR

SIMULATION, GEOLOGIC MODELING, AND SEISMIC PROCESSING HAVE BEEN USED IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE

SUBSURFACE DATA. THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN UTILIZED EXTENSIVELY BY THE COMPANY IN THE PAST, AND

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THEY PROVIDE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN ESTABLISHING RELIABLE AND

CONSISTENT RESERVES ESTIMATES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT THE END OF 2011, PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES TOTALED 3.7 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT (BOE). APPROXIMATELY 68

PERCENT OF THESE RESERVES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO NATURAL GAS, OF WHICH ABOUT 60 PERCENT WERE LOCATED

IN AUSTRALIA. CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS

FS-68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

(NGLS) ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 29 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF

THESE RESERVES IN AFRICA, ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES. SYNTHETIC OIL ACCOUNTED FOR THE BALANCE OF

THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AND WAS LOCATED IN CANADA IN THE OTHER AMERICAS REGION.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES OF EQUITY AFFILIATES AMOUNTED TO 1.3 BILLION BOE. AT YEAR-END,

CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE AND NGLS REPRESENTED 61 PERCENT OF THESE RESERVES, WITH TCO ACCOUNTING FOR

THE MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT. NATURAL GAS REPRESENTED 25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH APPROXIMATELY 43

PERCENT OF THOSE RESERVES FROM TCO. THE REMAINING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO

SYNTHETIC OIL IN VENEZUELA.

IN 2011, A TOTAL OF 220 MILLION BOE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED

DEVELOPED FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 90 MILLION BOE WERE

TRANSFERRED, PRIMARILY DUE TO ONGOING DRILLING ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER LOCATIONS. IN

ASIA, 55 MILLION BOE WERE TRANSFERRED TO PROVED DEVELOPED PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE START-UP OF A GAS

PROJECT IN THAILAND. THE START UP OF SEVERAL SMALL PROJECTS IN AFRICA, EUROPE AND OTHER AMERICAS

ACCOUNTED FOR THE REMAINDER.

AFFILIATED COMPANIES HAD TRANSFERS OF 25 MILLION BOE FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED

DEVELOPED.

INVESTMENT TO CONVERT PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

DURING 2011, INVESTMENTS

TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $6.7 BILLION WERE MADE BY CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES TO

ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. IN AUSTRALIA, $2.1 BILLION WAS EXPENDED,

WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AT THE GORGON LNG PROJECT. IN AFRICA, $1.4

BILLION WAS EXPENDED ON VARIOUS PROJECTS, INCLUDING OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN NIGERIA AND

ANGOLA. IN NIGERIA, CONSTRUCTION PROGRESSED ON A DEEPWATER PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

CONTINUED AT A NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT. IN ANGOLA, OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT DRILLING WAS

PROGRESSED ALONG WITH SEVERAL GAS INJECTION PROJECTS. IN ASIA, EXPENDITURES DURING THE YEAR TOTALED

$1.0 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED CONSTRUCTION OF A GAS PROCESSING FACILITY IN THAILAND, A GAS

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN CHINA AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN INDONESIA. IN THE UNITED STATES,

EXPENDITURES TOTALED $0.9 BILLION FOR OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. IN OTHER

AMERICAS, DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOTALED $0.9 BILLION FOR A VARIETY OF PROJECTS, INCLUDING AN

OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN BRAZIL. IN EUROPE, $0.1 BILLION WAS EXPENDED ON VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS.

THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES EXPENDITURES WAS $0.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY ON

AN LNG PROJECT IN ANGOLA AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN KAZAKHSTAN.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE

RESERVES THAT REMAIN PROVED UNDEVELOPED FOR

FIVE OR MORE YEARS ARE A RESULT OF SEVERAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT OPTIMAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND

EXECUTION, SUCH AS THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

IN ADVERSE AND REMOTE LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS OF INFRASTRUCTURE OR PLANT CAPACITIES THAT

DICTATE PROJECT TIMING, COMPRESSION PROJECTS THAT ARE PENDING RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES, AND

CONTRACTUAL LIMITATIONS THAT DICTATE PRODUCTION LEVELS.

AT YEAR-END 2011, THE COMPANY HELD APPROXIMATELY 1.8 BILLION BOE OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES THAT HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE. THE RESERVES ARE HELD BY

CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE RESERVES ARE IN LOCATIONS WHERE THE

COMPANY HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF DEVELOPING MAJOR PROJECTS.

IN AFRICA, APPROXIMATELY 330 MILLION BOE IS RELATED TO DEEPWATER AND NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENTS

IN NIGERIA AND ANGOLA. MAJOR NIGERIAN DEEPWATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INCLUDE AGBAMI, WHICH STARTED

PRODUCTION IN 2008 AND HAS ONGOING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO MAINTAIN FULL UTILIZATION OF

INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY, AND THE USAN DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO START PRODUCTION IN 2012.

ALSO IN NIGERIA, VARIOUS FIELDS AND INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESCRAVOS GAS PROJECTS ARE

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

IN ASIA, APPROXIMATELY 240 MILLION BOE REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. THE MAJORITY

OF THE VOLUMES RELATE TO ONGOING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE PATTANI FIELD (THAILAND) AND THE

MALAMPAYA FIELD (PHILIPPINES) THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO MAINTAIN PRODUCTION WITHIN CONTRACTUAL AND

INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS. THE BALANCE RELATES TO INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS IN AZERBAIJAN.

IN AUSTRALIA, APPROXIMATELY 110 MILLION BOE REMAIN CLASSIFIED AS UNDEVELOPED DUE TO A

COMPRESSION PROJECT AT THE NORTH WEST SHELF VENTURE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR START-UP IN 2013.

IN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 70 MILLION BOE REMAIN PROVED UNDEVELOPED, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO A STEAMFLOOD EXPANSION AND DEEPWATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. IN OTHER AMERICAS AND EUROPE,

APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION BOE IS RELATED TO CONTRACTUAL CONSTRAINTS, INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS AND

FUTURE COMPRESSION PROJECTS.

AFFILIATED COMPANIES HAVE APPROXIMATELY 1.0 BILLION BOE OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES HELD

FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE. THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 880 MILLION BOE.

FIELD PRODUCTION IS CONSTRAINED BY PLANT CAPACITY LIMITATIONS. FURTHER FIELD DEVELOPMENT TO CONVERT

THE REMAINING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IS SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN LINE WITH RESERVOIR DEPLETION.

IN VENEZUELA, THE AFFILIATE THAT OPERATES THE HAMACA FIELDS SYNTHETIC HEAVY OIL UPGRADING

OPERATION ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 120 MILLION BOE OF THESE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. DEVELOPMENT

DRILLING CONTINUES AT HAMACA TO OPTIMIZE UTILIZATION OF UPGRADER CAPACITY.

ANNUALLY, THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER ANY CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES,

SUCH AS CHANGES TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS, REGULATIONS OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES, THAT WOULD WARRANT A

REVISION TO RESERVE ESTIMATES. FOR 2011, THIS ASSESSMENT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN

RESERVES CLASSIFIED AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS,

FS-69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

THE RATIO OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO TOTAL PROVED RESERVES HAS RANGED BETWEEN

37 PERCENT AND 44 PERCENT. THE CONSISTENT COMPLETION OF MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS HAS KEPT THE RATIO

IN A NARROW RANGE OVER THIS TIME PERIOD.

PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, PROVED RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

OPERATIONS WERE 8.5 BILLION BOE. (REFER TO THE TERM RESERVES ON PAGE E-11 FOR THE DEFINITION OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.) APPROXIMATELY 23 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN THE UNITED

STATES. FOR THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUITY AFFILIATES, PROVED RESERVES WERE 2.7 BILLION BOE, 78

PERCENT OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN TCO.

ASIDE FROM THE TENGIZ FIELD IN THE TCO AFFILIATE, NO SINGLE PROPERTY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. ABOUT 22 OTHER INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES

IN THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS EACH CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT AND 5 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR 47 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. THESE PROPERTIES WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED,

LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, SOUTH AMERICA, AFRICA, ASIA AND AUSTRALIA.

IN THE UNITED STATES, TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2011 WERE 1.9 BILLION BOE. CALIFORNIA

PROPERTIES ACCOUNTED FOR 35 PERCENT OF THE U.S. RESERVES, WITH MOST CLASSIFIED AS HEAVY OIL.

BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE NEED

TO EMPLOY ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, MOST OF THE COMPANYS HEAVY-OIL FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOY A

CONTINUOUS STEAMFLOODING PROCESS. THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION CONTAINS 24 PERCENT OF THE U.S.

RESERVES, WITH LIQUIDS REPRESENTING ABOUT 77 PERCENT OF RESERVES IN THE GULF. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS

ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE AND, AS A RESULT, ARE ALSO CAPITAL INTENSIVE. OTHER U.S. AREAS REPRESENT THE

REMAINING 41 PERCENT OF U.S. RESERVES, WITH LIQUIDS ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 42 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL.

FOR PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, INCLUDING WATERFLOOD

AND CO

2

INJECTION.

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN THE

FOLLOWING TABLES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EVENTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE COMPANYS CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT PERMITTING,

PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CHANGES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS,

GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL, CONDENSATE, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND

SYNTHETIC OIL AND CHANGES THERETO FOR THE YEARS 2009, 2010 AND 2011 ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLE ON THE

FOLLOWING PAGE. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES OF NATURAL GAS ARE SHOWN ON PAGE FS-73.

INCLUDED ARE YEAR-END RESERVE QUANTITIES RELATED TO PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS (PSC) (REFER TO PAGE E-11 FOR THE DEFINITION OF A PSC). PSC-RELATED RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE

22 PERCENT, 24 PERCENT AND 26 PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES FOR 2011, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF LIQUIDS PROVED RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2009

THROUGH 2011 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2009, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 355 MILLION BARRELS FOR WORLDWIDE

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND DECREASED RESERVES BY 187 MILLION BARRELS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS 460 MILLION BARRELS IN OTHER AMERICAS DUE TO THE

INCLUSION OF SYNTHETIC OIL RELATED TO CANADIAN OIL SANDS. IN THE UNITED STATES, RESERVES INCREASED

63 MILLION BARRELS AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND PERFORMANCE REVISIONS. THE INCREASES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES OF 121 MILLION BARRELS IN ASIA AND 46 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA.

IN ASIA, DECREASES IN INDONESIA AND AZERBAIJAN WERE DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER 12-MONTH AVERAGE

PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS AND THE EFFECT

OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE REVISIONS. IN AFRICA, RESERVES IN NIGERIA DECLINED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS AS WELL AS RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, TCO DECLINED BY 184 MILLION BARRELS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF

HIGHER 12-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION. FOR OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES, 266

MILLION BARRELS OF HEAVY CRUDE OIL WERE RECLASSIFIED TO SYNTHETIC OIL FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN

VENEZUELA.

IN 2010, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES 103 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

DECREASED RESERVES 21 MILLION BARRELS FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE 63 MILLION BARREL INCREASE IN THE

UNITED STATES. INCREASES IN THE OTHER REGIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASIA, WHICH DECREASED AS A

RESULT OF THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN KAZAKHSTAN. FOR AFFILIATED

COMPANIES, THE PRICE EFFECT ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AT TCO DECREASED RESERVES BY 33 MILLION

BARRELS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN

VENEZUELA.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

IN 2011, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES 197 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES AND INCREASED RESERVES 38 MILLION BARRELS FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE 63 MILLION BARREL

INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN AFRICA, IMPROVED FIELD PERFORMANCE DROVE THE 60 MILLION BARREL

INCREASE. IN ASIA, INCREASES FROM IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

EFFECTS OF HIGHER PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS. SYNTHETIC OIL RESERVES IN CANADA

INCREASED BY 32 MILLION BARRELS, PRIMARILY DUE TO GEOTECHNICAL REVISIONS. FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES,

IMPROVED FACILITY AND RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PRICE EFFECT ON ROYALTY

DETERMINATION AT TCO. CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT DRILLING INCREASED RESERVES IN VENEZUELA.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN 2009, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES BY 86 MILLION BARRELS

WORLDWIDE. CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR 50 MILLION BARRELS. THE LARGEST ADDITION WAS

RELATED TO IMPROVED SECONDARY RECOVERY IN NIGERIA. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 36

MILLION BARRELS DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS RELATED TO THE TCO SOUR GAS INJECTION/SECOND GENERATION PLANT

(SGI/SGP) FACILITIES.

IN 2010, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED VOLUMES BY 77 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, RESERVES IN AFRICA INCREASED 58 MILLION BARRELS DUE PRIMARILY TO SECONDARY RECOVERY

PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA. RESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED 11 MILLION, PRIMARILY IN

CALIFORNIA. AFFILIATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES 3 MILLION BARRELS.

IN 2011, IMPROVED RECOVERY INCREASED VOLUMES BY 58 MILLION BARRELS WORLDWIDE. FOR CONSOLIDATED

ARGENTINA. AFRICA AND THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR 10 MILLION BARRELS AND 6 MILLION BARRELS,

RESPECTIVELY.

IN 2010, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES RESERVES 63 MILLION

BARRELS WORLDWIDE. THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER AMERICAS EACH INCREASED RESERVES 19 MILLION BARRELS,

AND ASIA INCREASED RESERVES 16 MILLION BARRELS. NO SINGLE AREA IN THE UNITED STATES WAS

INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT. DRILLING ACTIVITY IN ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

THE INCREASE IN OTHER AMERICAS. IN ASIA, THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO ACTIVITY IN

AZERBAIJAN.

IN 2011, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES RESERVES 299 MILLION

BARRELS WORLDWIDE. IN THE UNITED STATES, ADDITIONS RELATED TO TWO GULF OF MEXICO PROJECTS RESULTED

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF NATURAL GAS PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR

2009 THROUGH 2011 ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2009, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES 569 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

DECREASED RESERVES 44 BCF FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NET INCREASES WERE

493 BCF IN ASIA, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF RESERVOIR STUDIES IN BANGLADESH AND DEVELOPMENT DRILLING

IN THAILAND. THESE RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DOWNWARD REVISION DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN MYANMAR. IN AUSTRALIA, THE 166 BCF INCREASE IN RESERVES

RESULTED FROM IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND COMPRESSION. IN OTHER AMERICAS, RESERVES DECREASED

126 BCF, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. IN THE UNITED STATES, A NET INCREASE OF 39 BCF WAS THE RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT

DRILLING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PERFORMANCE REVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA AND

MID-CONTINENT AREAS.

FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES, A DOWNWARD REVISION OF 237 BCF AT TCO WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER

PRICES ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND AN INCREASE IN GAS INJECTION FOR SGI/SGP FACILITIES. THIS

DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PERFORMANCE AND DRILLING OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO THE ANGOLA LNG

PROJECT.

IN 2010, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 197 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, WHICH WAS

MORE THAN OFFSET BY A 268 BCF DECREASE IN NET REVISIONS FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES, A NET INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES OF 220 BCF, PRIMARILY IN THE MID-CONTINENT AREA AND

THE GULF OF MEXICO, WAS THE RESULT OF A NUMBER OF SMALL UPWARD REVISIONS RELATED TO IMPROVED

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND DRILLING ACTIVITY, NONE OF WHICH WERE INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE

INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DOWNWARD REVISIONS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER PRICES ON

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN ASIA. FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES, A DOWNWARD REVISION OF 324 BCF AT TCO

WAS DUE TO THE PRICE EFFECT ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION AND A CHANGE IN THE VARIABLE-ROYALTY

CALCULATION. THIS DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL RESERVES RELATED TO

THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION - CONTINUED

IN 2011, NET REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES 415 BCF FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

INCREASED RESERVES 82 BCF FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, IMPROVED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE 217 BCF INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ASIA, A NET

INCREASE OF 196 BCF WAS DRIVEN BY DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND IMPROVED FIELD PERFORMANCE IN THAILAND,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER PRICES ON PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN KAZAKHSTAN. IN

OTHER AMERICAS, A NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE REVISION IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN COLOMBIA FROM DRILLING ACTIVITIES AND THE REACTIVATION OF AN EXISTING FIELD. FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES, ONGOING RESERVOIR ASSESSMENT RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL

RESERVES RELATED TO THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT. AT TCO, IMPROVED FACILITY AND RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE WAS

MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE PRICE EFFECT ON ROYALTY DETERMINATION.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2009, WORLDWIDE EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES OF 4,387 BCF WERE

ATTRIBUTED TO CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. IN AUSTRALIA, THE GORGON PROJECT ACCOUNTED FOR ALL OF THE

4,276 BCF ADDITIONS. IN ASIA, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING IN THAILAND ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE

INCREASE. IN THE UNITED STATES, DELINEATION DRILLING IN CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

THE INCREASE.

IN 2011, EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES RESERVES 4,680 BCF

WORLDWIDE. IN AUSTRALIA, THE WHEATSTONE PROJECT ACCOUNTED FOR THE 4,035 BCF IN ADDITIONS. IN

AFRICA, THE START OF A NEW NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN NIGERIA RESULTED IN THE 290 BCF

INCREASE. IN THE UNITED STATES, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE 287 BCF

INCREASE.

PURCHASES

IN 2011, PURCHASES INCREASED WORLDWIDE RESERVES 1,233 BCF. IN THE UNITED STATES,

ACQUISITIONS IN THE MARCELLUS SHALE INCREASED RESERVES 1,230 BCF.

SALES

IN 2009, WORLDWIDE SALES OF 117 BCF WERE RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. FOR OTHER

AMERICAS, THE SALE OF PROPERTIES IN ARGENTINA ACCOUNTED FOR 84 BCF. THE SALE OF PROPERTIES IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE 33 BCF DECREASE IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2011, SALES DECREASED CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES RESERVES 174 BCF WORLDWIDE. IN AUSTRALIA, THE

WHEATSTONE PROJECT UNITIZATION AND EQUITY SALES AGREEMENTS REDUCED RESERVES 77 BCF. IN THE UNITED

STATES, SALES IN ALASKA AND OTHER SMALLER FIELDS REDUCED RESERVES 95 BCF.

TABLE VI

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH

FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FASB.

ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING 12-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES FOR

OIL AND GAS TO YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE

LIMITED TO THOSE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING

YEAR. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO

DEVELOP AND PRODUCE YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END COST INDICES, ASSUMING

CONTINUATION OF YEAR-END ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS. ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END

STATUTORY TAX RATES. THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO

ESTIMATED FUTURE PRETAX NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET

CASH FLOWS ARE CALCULATED

USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN

FUTURE EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE QUANTITIES

ARE IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND

POSSIBLE RESERVES, WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE

VALUATION PRESCRIBED BY THE FASB REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND SHOULD

NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL AND GAS

RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED MEASURE NET CASH FLOWS REFERS TO THE STANDARDIZED
