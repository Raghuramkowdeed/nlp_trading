SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRON

CHEVRON

CORPORATION,

A DELAWARE CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND

MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE

IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS,

MINING OPERATIONS OF COAL AND OTHER MINERALS, POWER GENERATION

AND ENERGY SERVICES. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN

THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 180 OTHER COUNTRIES.

PETROLEUM OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO

FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS

AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE,

MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY AFFILIATES,

OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND THE

MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, OF FUEL

AND LUBRICATING OIL ADDITIVES.

IN THIS REPORT, EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL

GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

E&P OR UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

RM&T OR DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES. A

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, CHEVRON HAD MORE THAN 59,000 EMPLOYEES

(INCLUDING ABOUT 6,000 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES). APPROXIMATELY

27,000, OR 46 PERCENT, OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES WERE

EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS.

ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL CORPORATION

ON AUGUST 10, 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED UNOCAL CORPORATION

(UNOCAL), AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

COMPANY. THIS ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE RULES OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT

NO. 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

UNOCALS PRINCIPAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS ARE IN NORTH

AMERICA AND ASIA, INCLUDING THE CASPIAN REGION. OTHER ACTIVITIES

INCLUDE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN PROPRIETARY AND COMMON CARRIER

PIPELINES, NATURAL GAS STORAGE FACILITIES AND MINING OPERATIONS.

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION IS CONTAINED IN

NOTE 2 ON PAGE

OVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, AND INDIVIDUAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE

CONTROL OVER SOME OF THEM. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, PARTICULARLY

IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES, REGULATING WHERE AND

HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS AND FORMULATE THEIR

PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME CASES, LIMITING THEIR PROFITS DIRECTLY.

PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

PETROCHEMICALS ARE DETERMINED BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THESE

COMMODITIES. THE MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM

EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE TYPICALLY THE WORLDS

SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL, AND THEIR PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE A

MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WORLDWIDE SUPPLY. DEMAND FOR CRUDE

OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR NATURAL GAS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY

THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES,

ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND TAXATION RELATIVE TO OTHER ENERGY

SOURCES ALSO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART. VARIATIONS IN THE

COMPONENTS OF REFINED PRODUCTS SALES DUE TO SEASONALITY ARE NOT

PRIMARY DRIVERS OF CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS OVERALL ANNUAL

EARNINGS.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND

CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. CHEVRON

COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM COMPANIES AS WELL

AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM COMPANIES FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

INCORPORATED

IN DELAWARE IN 1926 AS STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE NAME CHEVRON CORPORATION IN 1984 AND

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION IN 2001. ON MAY 9, 2005,

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION CHANGED ITS NAME TO CHEVRON

CORPORATION. AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERM

CHEVRON AND SUCH TERMS AS THE COMPANY,

THE CORPORATION, OUR, WE AND

US MAY REFER TO CHEVRON CORPORATION, ONE OR MORE OF

ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, OR TO ALL OF THEM TAKEN AS A

WHOLE, BUT UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE, IT DOES NOT INCLUDE

AFFILIATES OF CHEVRON  I.E., THOSE

COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD (GENERALLY OWNED

50 PERCENT OR LESS) OR INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE

COST METHOD. ALL OF THESE TERMS ARE USED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY

AND ARE NOT INTENDED AS A PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF ANY OF THE

SEPARATE COMPANIES, EACH OF WHICH MANAGES ITS OWN AFFAIRS.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY ARE WIDELY

DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY, WITH OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA,

SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, CENTRAL AND FAR

EAST ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA. BESIDES THE LARGE UPSTREAM AND

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES, THE COMPANYS OTHER COMPARATIVELY

SMALLER BUSINESS SEGMENT IS CHEMICALS, WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY THE

COMPANYS 50 PERCENT-OWNED AFFILIATE 

CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM)  AND

THE WHOLLY OWNED CHEVRON ORONITE COMPANY (CHEVRON ORONITE).

CPCHEM HAS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO,

SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND

BELGIUM. CHEVRON ORONITE IS A FUEL AND LUBRICATING-OIL ADDITIVES

BUSINESS THAT OWNS AND OPERATES FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES,

FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE, JAPAN AND BRAZIL AND HAS

EQUITY INTERESTS IN FACILITIES IN INDIA AND MEXICO.

CHEVRON ALSO OWNS AN APPROXIMATE 24 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

EXCLUDING THE $17.3 BILLION ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL

CORPORATION, TOTAL REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2005 WERE

$11.1 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.7 BILLION FOR THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES, WHICH DID

NOT REQUIRE CASH OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. IN 2004 AND 2003,

EXPENDITURES WERE $8.3 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF

AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF $1.6 BILLION AND

$1.1 BILLION IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS.

OF THE $11.1 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2005, ABOUT

THREE-FOURTHS, OR $8.4 BILLION, RELATED TO UPSTREAM

ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED

FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2004 AND 2003. INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM

INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THE YEARS, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS

CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES WILL BE 33 PERCENT HIGHER AT

$14.8 BILLION, INCLUDING SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. ABOUT

THREE-FOURTHS, OR $11.3 BILLION, IS AGAIN TARGETED FOR

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $8 BILLION OF

THAT AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2005, CHEVRON CONDUCTED ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY 35 OTHER

COUNTRIES. WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY

2.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2005, INCLUDING VOLUMES

PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS IN CANADA AND PRODUCTION UNDER AN

OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT IN VENEZUELA, WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS

IN 2004. PRODUCTION IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS OF 2005 INCLUDED

VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTIES ACQUIRED FROM UNOCAL.

HOWEVER, PRODUCTION DURING THE YEAR FROM THE HERITAGE-CHEVRON

PROPERTIES DECLINED FROM THEIR LEVELS IN 2004, DUE MAINLY TO

OPERATIONS THAT WERE OFFLINE AS A RESULT OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER

HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, PROPERTY SALES BETWEEN

PERIODS, THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON VOLUMES REQUIRED UNDER

COST-RECOVERY AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN

CONTRACTS, AND NORMAL FIELD DECLINES. REFER TO THE RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-7 FOR A

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE

2003  2005 CHANGES IN PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS AVERAGE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

IN 2006 WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF 2.7 TO 2.8 MILLION BARRELS

PER DAY. THE ADDITIONAL VOLUMES OVER THE 2.5 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY PRODUCED IN 2005 ARE ATTRIBUTABLE MAINLY TO THE

PROPERTIES ACQUIRED FROM UNOCAL AND NEW PROJECT

START-UPS

THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO HELP OFFSET NORMAL FIELD DECLINES IN EXISTING

OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CAUTIONS THAT ANY FUTURE

ESTIMATE OF PRODUCTION IS SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES,

INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE PRICE EFFECT

ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND

VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, THE RATE OF

RECOVERY OF PRODUCTION BEING RESTORED IN THE GULF OF MEXICO

FOLLOWING THE 2005 HURRICANES, AND PRODUCTION THAT MAY HAVE TO

BE SHUT IN DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS, CIVIL UNREST, CHANGING

GEOPOLITICS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO DAILY OPERATIONS. EXPECTED

ADDITIONS TO PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN 2007 THROUGH 2009 MAY PERMIT

WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION LEVELS TO INCREASE FROM

LEVELS IN 2006. REFER TO THE REVIEW OF ONGOING EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN KEY AREAS, BEGINNING ON

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

A)

UNITED STATES

THE UNITED STATES UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO, LOUISIANA, TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, THE ROCKY

MOUNTAINS AND CALIFORNIA. AVERAGE DAILY NET PRODUCTION DURING

2005 WAS 455,000 BARRELS OF LIQUIDS AND 1.6 BILLION

CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS, OR 727,000 BARRELS PER DAY ON AN

OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL IN AUGUST

2005, THE COMPANY OBTAINED PROPERTIES THAT COMPLEMENTED AND

ENHANCED CHEVRONS ALREADY-STRONG POSITIONS IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO AND THE PERMIAN BASIN IN WEST TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO. REFER

TO TABLE V BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-70

FOR A DISCUSSION

OF THE RESERVES AND DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS FOR THE

COMPANYS MAJOR U.S. PRODUCING AREAS.

CALIFORNIA.

THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION

IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IN 2005, AVERAGE DAILY NET

PRODUCTION WAS 212,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL,

106 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS AND

5,000 BARRELS OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, OR

235,000 BARRELS OF DAILY PRODUCTION ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT

BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 83 PERCENT OF THE CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION

IS CONSIDERED HEAVY OIL (TYPICALLY WITH API GRAVITY LOWER THAN

22 DEGREES).

GULF OF MEXICO.

AVERAGE DAILY NET PRODUCTION RATES

DURING 2005 FOR THE COMPANYS COMBINED INTERESTS IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO SHELF AND DEEPWATER AREAS AND THE FIELDS ONSHORE

LOUISIANA WERE 101,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL,

579 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS AND

11,000 BARRELS OF NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, OR 208,000

OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS DAILY. PRIOR TO THE HURRICANES IN AUGUST

AND SEPTEMBER, OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO

AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 300,000 BARRELS PER DAY. BECAUSE OF

STORM DAMAGES, FOURTH QUARTER 2005 PRODUCTION AVERAGED ONLY

160,000 BARRELS PER DAY. THE EXPECTED PRODUCTION LEVEL FOR

THE FULL YEAR 2006 IS ABOUT 200,000 BARRELS PER DAY, WITH A

SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATE OCCURRING IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR.

APPROXIMATELY 20,000 NET OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS OF DAILY

PRODUCTION ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ECONOMIC TO

RESTORE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE DEEPWATER AREAS, THE COMPANY HAS AN INTEREST IN FOUR

PRODUCING FIELDS: GENESIS, PETRONIUS, K2 AND MAD DOG. K2 AND MAD

DOG WERE ADDED TO THE PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE UNOCAL

ACQUISITION.

THE 57 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED GENESIS FIELD AVERAGED

DAILY NET PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 9,000 BARRELS OF

CRUDE OIL AND 11 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS IN 2005,

OR 11,000 BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT.

PETRONIUS, WHICH IS 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED, HAD

DAILY NET PRODUCTION OF 14,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND

17 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS IN 2005, OR

17,000 BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT. PETRONIUS PRODUCTION WAS

SHUT IN FOR REPAIRS FOLLOWING HURRICANE DAMAGE IN SEPTEMBER 2004

AND RESUMED PRODUCTION IN MARCH 2005.

THE PERSEUS DISCOVERY, WHICH IS PART OF THE PETRONIUS

DEVELOPMENT, BEGAN PRODUCTION FROM ITS FIRST WELL IN THE SECOND

QUARTER 2005. FROM

START-UP

THROUGH

YEAR-END, AVERAGE DAILY NET PRODUCTION WAS 3,000 BARRELS OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT. A SECOND EXTENDED-REACH WELL IS EXPECTED TO

BEGIN PRODUCTION IN APRIL 2006, WITH ANTICIPATED DAILY

PRODUCTION RATES BETWEEN 3,000 AND 7,000 BARRELS OF NET

OIL-EQUIVALENT. THE PERSEUS PROJECT HAS AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION

LIFE OF SIX TO NINE YEARS, WITH MAXIMUM PRODUCTION ANTICIPATED

IN 2006. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE MAJORITY OF PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL BE CATEGORIZED AS PROVED DEVELOPED BY

THE END OF 2006.

CHEVRON HAS A 13 PERCENT NONOPERATED INTEREST IN THE FORMER

UNOCAL K2 FIELD, WHICH HAD INITIAL PRODUCTION FROM ITS FIRST

WELL IN MAY 2005 AND INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY

2,000 BARRELS OF NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION PER DAY BY

NOVEMBER.

CHEVRON HOLDS A 16 PERCENT NONOPERATED INTEREST IN THE MAD

DOG FIELD, WHICH COMMENCED PRODUCTION IN EARLY 2005 AND HAD

AVERAGE DAILY NET PRODUCTION OF 4,000 BARRELS OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT FOR THE FIVE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF

UNOCAL. DEVELOPMENT WORK CONTINUES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE

DAILY MAXIMUM TOTAL PRODUCTION TO THE DESIGN CAPACITY OF

80,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 40 MILLION CUBIC FEET

OF NATURAL GAS AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE IN 2008.

ADDITIONAL STUDIES ARE UNDER WAY TO EXPAND THE TOTAL CRUDE OIL

PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO MORE THAN 100,000 BARRELS PER DAY.

THE MAD DOG FIELD HAS AN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION LIFE OF

20 YEARS. ADDITIONAL RESERVE RECLASSIFICATION TO PROVED

DEVELOPED IS EXPECTED TO COINCIDE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

THROUGH 2008.

AT TYPHOON, THE TENSION LEG PLATFORM SUFFERED CATASTROPHIC

DAMAGE FROM HURRICANE RITA IN SEPTEMBER 2005. TEAMS WERE FORMED

TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT AND EVALUATE OPTIONS TO

POSSIBLY RESTORE OPERATIONS. AVERAGE DAILY NET PRODUCTION PRIOR

TO THE STORM FROM THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED TYPHOON

FIELD, ALONG WITH VOLUMES PROCESSED FROM THE NEARBY

25 PERCENT-OWNED AND NONOPERATED BORIS FIELD, AVERAGED

ABOUT 6,000 BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY. TYPHOON AND

BORIS PRODUCTION REMAINED SHUT-IN IN EARLY 2006 PENDING ONGOING

SALVAGE AND RESTORATION STUDIES.

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY CONTINUES ON THE 58 PERCENT-OWNED AND

OPERATED TAHITI FIELD, WHERE PRODUCTION

START-UP

IS EXPECTED IN

2008. MOST CONTRACTS FOR THE ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT,

FABRICATION AND INSTALLATION OF THE SPAR HULL, TOPSIDES AND

SUBSEA EQUIPMENT WERE AWARDED IN 2005. CONSTRUCTION OF THE

FLOATING PRODUCTION FACILITY BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

INITIAL BOOKING OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES OCCURRED IN 2003,

AND THE TRANSFER OF THESE RESERVES INTO THE PROVED DEVELOPED

CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED UPON PRODUCTION

START-UP.

WITH AN

EXPECTED PRODUCTION LIFE OF 30 YEARS, TAHITI IS ANTICIPATED

TO HAVE A MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION OF 125,000 BARRELS

OF CRUDE OIL AND 70 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS.

AT THE 63 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED BLIND FAITH DISCOVERY,

A SUBSEA DEVELOPMENT UTILIZING A SEMI-SUBMERSIBLE PRODUCTION

SYSTEM WAS APPROVED BY CHEVRON AND ITS PARTNER IN LATE 2005, AT

WHICH TIME THE COMPANY MADE ITS INITIAL BOOKING OF PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. RECLASSIFICATION OF THESE RESERVES TO THE

PROVED DEVELOPED CATEGORY IS ANTICIPATED IN THE FIRST HALF 2008,

WHEN FIRST PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED. INITIAL TOTAL DAILY OUTPUT IS

ESTIMATED AT 30,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND

30 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS.

CHEVRON ALSO CONTINUES TO EVALUATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

33 PERCENT-OWNED AND NONOPERATED GREAT WHITE DISCOVERY.

SUCCESSFUL APPRAISAL DRILLING WAS CONDUCTED IN 2004, AND THE

PARTNERS HAVE FORMED A PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM TO BEGIN

FRONT-END ENGINEERING AND DESIGN (FEED) IN MARCH 2006. NO

PROVED RESERVES HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THIS DISCOVERY AS OF

EARLY 2006.

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATED IN FIVE WELLS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO

DEEPWATER EXPLORATION PROGRAM DURING 2005. THE 2005 PROGRAM

RESULTED IN TWO ANNOUNCED DISCOVERIES AND ONE SUCCESSFUL

APPRAISAL WELL. THE DISCOVERIES WERE THE 25 PERCENT-OWNED

AND NONOPERATED KNOTTY HEAD DISCOVERY AND THE

60 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED BIG FOOT PROSPECT. ADDITIONAL

APPRAISAL ACTIVITY WAS ONGOING AT BOTH LOCATIONS IN EARLY 2006.

AT THE 30 PERCENT-OWNED AND NONOPERATED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TUBULAR BELLS PROSPECT THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN 2003, FURTHER

EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL ALSO CONTINUED, WITH

ADDITIONAL

FOLLOW-UP

DRILLING PLANNED FOR 2006. A SUCCESSFUL APPRAISAL WELL WAS

DRILLED IN 2005 AT THE 2004 JACK DISCOVERY. AN EXTENDED

PRODUCTION TEST IS EXPECTED TO BE UNDER WAY IN MARCH 2006.

EVALUATION CONTINUES AT NEARBY SAINT MALO, WHERE A SUCCESSFUL

FOLLOW-UP

APPRAISAL

WELL WAS DRILLED DURING 2004. THE FIRST APPRAISAL WELL ALSO

COMMENCED DRILLING AT THE NONOPERATED 2003 PUMA DISCOVERY;

HOWEVER, THE WELL WAS NOT COMPLETED AS OF EARLY 2006 DUE TO

EXTENSIVE WEATHER AND RIG-RELATED DELAYS. PROVED RESERVES WERE

NOT YET RECOGNIZED FOR ANY OF THESE PROSPECTS AS OF EARLY 2006.

BESIDES THE ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPLORATION PROJECTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AREA, CHEVRON ALSO

FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

COMMISSION IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2005 TO OWN, CONSTRUCT AND

OPERATE A NATURAL GAS IMPORT TERMINAL AT CASOTTE LANDING IN

JACKSON COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI. THE PROPOSED PROJECT, TO BE LOCATED

ADJACENT TO THE CHEVRON-OWNED PASCAGOULA REFINERY, WOULD BE

DESIGNED TO PROCESS IMPORTED LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS

(LNG) FOR DISTRIBUTION TO INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL AND

RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS IN MISSISSIPPI AND THE SOUTHEAST REGION,

INCLUDING THE GROWING FLORIDA MARKET. THE TERMINAL WOULD HAVE AN

INITIAL NATURAL-GAS PROCESSING CAPACITY OF 1.3 BILLION

CUBIC FEET PER DAY.

KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANY HOLDS A 50 PERCENT INTEREST

IN TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO), WHICH IS DEVELOPING THE TENGIZ AND

KOROLEV CRUDE OIL FIELDS LOCATED IN WESTERN KAZAKHSTAN UNDER A

40-YEAR

CONCESSION THAT

EXPIRES IN 2033. NET PRODUCTION IN 2005 AVERAGED

136,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS AND 216 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS.

TCO IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION COMPOSED OF

TWO INTEGRATED PROJECTS REFERRED TO AS THE SECOND GENERATION

PLANT (SGP) AND SOUR GAS INJECTION (SGI). AT A TOTAL

COST OF APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION, THESE PROJECTS ARE

DESIGNED TO INCREASE TCOS CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION CAPACITY BY

THE THIRD QUARTER 2007 FROM THE CURRENT 300,000 BARRELS PER

DAY TO BETWEEN 460,000 AND 550,000 BARRELS. THE ACTUAL

PRODUCTION LEVEL WITHIN THE ESTIMATED RANGE IS DEPENDENT

PARTIALLY ON THE EFFECTS OF THE SGI, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

SGP INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LARGE PROCESSING TRAIN FOR

TREATING CRUDE OIL AND THE ASSOCIATED SOUR (I.E., HIGH IN SULFUR

CONTENT) GAS. THE SGP DESIGN IS BASED ON THE SAME CONVENTIONAL

TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYED IN THE EXISTING PROCESSING TRAINS. IN

ADDITION TO NEW PROCESSING CAPACITY, SGP INVOLVES DRILLING

AND/OR COMPLETING 55 PRODUCTION WELLS IN THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV

RESERVOIRS TO GENERATE THE VOLUMES REQUIRED FOR THE NEW

PROCESSING TRAIN. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH

SGP WERE RECOGNIZED IN 2001. SOME OF THESE RESERVES WERE

RECLASSIFIED TO PROVED DEVELOPED IN

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2005, BASED UPON COMPLETION OF SPECIFIED PROJECT MILESTONES.

OVER THE NEXT DECADE, ONGOING FIELD DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED TO

RESULT IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES TO PROVED DEVELOPED.

SGI INVOLVES TAKING A PORTION OF THE RICH, SOUR GAS SEPARATED

FROM THE CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AT THE SGP PROCESSING TRAIN AND

RE-INJECTING IT INTO THE TENGIZ RESERVOIR. CHEVRON EXPECTS THAT

SGI WILL HAVE TWO KEY EFFECTS. FIRST, SGI WILL REDUCE THE SOUR

GAS PROCESSING CAPACITY REQUIRED AT SGP, THEREBY INCREASING

LIQUID PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND LOWERING THE QUANTITIES OF SULFUR

AND GAS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE GENERATED. SECOND, OVER TIME IT

IS EXPECTED THAT SGI WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND

RECOVERABLE VOLUMES DUE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF HIGHER RESERVOIR

PRESSURE FROM THE GAS RE-INJECTION. BETWEEN 2007 AND 2008, THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES RECOGNIZING ADDITIONAL PROVED RESERVES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SGI EXPANSION. THE PRIMARY SGI RISKS INCLUDE

UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT COMPRESSOR PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH

INJECTING HIGH-PRESSURE SOUR GAS AND SUBSURFACE RESPONSES TO

INJECTION.

ESSENTIALLY ALL OF TCOS PRODUCTION IS EXPORTED THROUGH THE

CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC) PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM

TENGIZ IN KAZAKHSTAN TO TANKER LOADING FACILITIES AT

NOVOROSSIYSK ON THE RUSSIAN COAST OF THE BLACK SEA. CPC IS

WORKING ON OBTAINING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL FOR AN EXPANSION TO

FULLY ACCOMMODATE INCREASED TCO VOLUMES BY 2009. DURING 2005,

TCO SANCTIONED THE CRUDE EXPORT PROJECT AND AWARDED COMMERCIAL

CONTRACTS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EXPORT ROUTES UTILIZING

RAIL TRANSPORTATION TO THE ODESSA UKRAINE MARINE TERMINAL AND TO

MARINE TERMINALS IN AKTAU, KAZAKHSTAN. IN CONJUNCTION WITH

EXISTING CPC CAPACITY, THE CRUDE EXPORT PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO

PROVIDE TCO WITH SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO EXPORT ALL TCO

PRODUCTION, INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED BY SGI/ SGP, PRIOR TO

EXPANSION OF THE CPC PIPELINE.

VENEZUELA.

CHEVRON HAS A 30 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE

PHASE-OUT, BY YEAR-END 2010, OF ALL SINGLE-HULL TANKERS TRADING

TO U.S. PORTS OR TRANSFERRING CARGO IN WATERS WITHIN THE

U.S. EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE. THIS HAS RAISED THE DEMAND

FOR DOUBLE-HULL TANKERS. BY THE END OF 2005, CHEVRON HAD A TOTAL

OF 20 COMPANY-OPERATED DOUBLE-HULL TANKERS IN OPERATION.

THE COMPANY IS A MEMBER OF MANY OIL-SPILL-RESPONSE COOPERATIVES

CHEVRONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE

$316 MILLION, $242 MILLION AND $228 MILLION FOR

THE YEARS 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

BECAUSE SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES IN THE AREAS

DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS

PROCESSES, ULTIMATE SUCCESS IS NOT CERTAIN. ALTHOUGH NOT ALL

INITIATIVES MAY PROVE TO BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE, THE

COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA IS NOT

SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL,

HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE

COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS.

CHEVRON EXPECTS MORE ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED REGULATIONS IN THE

COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS OPERATIONS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF

COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS

OPERATIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING

BUSINESS.

IN 2005, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES WERE $227 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES

$2 MILLION FOR UNOCAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS

OF 2005 AND WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS TOTAL CONSOLIDATED U.S. CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES. THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES, AS WELL

AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES ARE

PREDOMINANTLY IN THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM SEGMENTS AND RELATE

MOSTLY TO AIR- AND WATER-QUALITY PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE

COMPANYS REFINERIES, OIL AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND

MARKETING FACILITIES. FOR 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES

U.S. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL

FACILITIES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $452 MILLION. THE FUTURE

ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS OF FULFILLING THIS COMMITMENT ARE UNCERTAIN

AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE

CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

ITEM 1A.       RISK

FACTORS

CHEVRON IS A MAJOR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM COMPANY WITH A

DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, STRONG BALANCE SHEET, AND A

HISTORY OF GENERATING SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. NEVERTHELESS,

SOME INHERENT RISKS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITY

PRICES.

CHEVRON IS PRIMARILY IN A COMMODITIES BUSINESS WITH A HISTORY OF

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIABLE THAT AFFECTS THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS CRUDE OIL PRICES. EXCEPT

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF RUNNING AN INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

BUSINESS, CHEVRON DOES NOT SEEK TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

CHANGES. A SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT DECLINE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES

MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND ITS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PLANS.

THE SCOPE OF CHEVRONS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE IF THE

COMPANY DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP RESOURCES.

THE COMPANY IS IN AN EXTRACTIVE BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IF CHEVRON

IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN REPLACING THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IT

PRODUCES WITH GOOD PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS WILL DECLINE. CREATING AND MAINTAINING

AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OBTAINING RIGHTS TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS IN

PROMISING AREAS, DRILLING SUCCESS, ABILITY TO BRING LONG

LEAD-TIME, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON BUDGET

AND SCHEDULE, AND EFFICIENT AND PROFITABLE OPERATION OF MATURE

PROPERTIES.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY

NATURAL OR HUMAN FACTORS.

CHEVRON OPERATES IN BOTH URBAN AREAS AND REMOTE AND SOMETIMES

INHOSPITABLE REGIONS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

FACILITIES ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTION FROM EITHER

NATURAL OR HUMAN CAUSES, INCLUDING HURRICANES, EARTHQUAKES,

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLOODS AND OTHER FORMS OF SEVERE WEATHER, WAR, CIVIL UNREST AND

OTHER POLITICAL EVENTS, FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD

RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS, OR HARM TO PEOPLE OR THE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

CHEVRONS BUSINESS SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY

RISKS.

THE COMPANY PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, REFINES AND MARKETS MATERIALS

WITH POTENTIAL TOXICITY, AND IT PURCHASES, HANDLES AND DISPOSES

OF OTHER POTENTIALLY TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE COURSE OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS. CHEVRON OPERATIONS ALSO PRODUCE

BYPRODUCTS, WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED POLLUTANTS. ANY OF THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY, EITHER AS A RESULT OF AN

ACCIDENTAL, UNLAWFUL DISCHARGE OR AS A RESULT OF NEW CONCLUSIONS

ON THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH

OR THE ENVIRONMENT.

POLITICAL INSTABILITY COULD HARM CHEVRONS

BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY

HOST GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE

COMPANYS PARTIALLY- OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES, AND/OR TO

IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED

RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL

CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF

EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE

COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED

RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE

DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE

COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND RESULTS, AND ARE CAREFULLY

CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF CURRENT

AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, APPROXIMATELY 23 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PROVED

RESERVES WERE LOCATED IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS

SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING

COUNTRIES (OPEC)-MEMBER COUNTRIES INCLUDING INDONESIA, NIGERIA

AND VENEZUELA. APPROXIMATELY 22 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS NET PROVED RESERVES, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, WERE

LOCATED IN OPEC COUNTRIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

NET INCOME IN 2003 INCLUDED A $196 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. THE PRIMARY CHANGE RELATED TO THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH IS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. NET INCOME IN 2004 INCLUDED GAINS OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION RELATING TO THE SALE OF NONSTRATEGIC UPSTREAM PROPERTIES. REFER ALSO TO

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-7 FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL

RESULTS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FUTURE EARNINGS DEPEND LARGELY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE UPSTREAM

(EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION) AND DOWNSTREAM (REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION) BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOTH SEGMENTS IS

MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. IN THE DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CRUDE OIL IS THE LARGEST COST

COMPONENT OF REFINED PRODUCTS. OVERALL EARNINGS TRENDS ARE TYPICALLY LESS AFFECTED BY RESULTS FROM

THE COMPANYS CHEMICAL BUSINESS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENTS. EARNINGS FOR THE COMPANY IN

ANY PERIOD MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY EVENTS OR TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE INFREQUENT AND/OR UNUSUAL IN

NATURE.

THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE AND

COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY, IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO INVEST

IN PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RETURNS AND TO MANAGE OPERATING EXPENSES EFFECTIVELY.

CREATING AND MAINTAINING AN INVENTORY OF PROJECTS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OBTAINING

RIGHTS TO EXPLORE FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING HYDROCARBONS IN PROMISING

AREAS, DRILLING SUCCESSFULLY, BRINGING LONG-LEAD TIME CAPITAL-INTENSIVE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION ON

BUDGET AND ON SCHEDULE, AND OPERATING MATURE UPSTREAM PROPERTIES EFFICIENTLY AND PROFITABLY.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT KEY TO

PROVIDING LONG-TERM VALUE, OR TO ACQUIRE ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO ITS ASSET BASE TO

HELP AUGMENT THE COMPANYS GROWTH. ASSET-DISPOSITION AND RESTRUCTURING MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS

AND COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES.

IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED UNOCAL CORPORATION (UNOCAL), AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY. THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE WAS $17.3 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED

$7.5 BILLION CASH, APPROXIMATELY 169 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRON COMMON STOCK VALUED AT $9.6 BILLION,

AND $0.2 BILLION FOR STOCK OPTIONS ON APPROXIMATELY 5 MILLION SHARES AND MERGER-RELATED FEES. REFER

TO NOTE 2, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-36, FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION.

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH INDUSTRY PRICE

LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL

FACTORS OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF

PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED DAMAGE AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL

PRICES, AND REGIONAL SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST

OR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY.

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOREOVER, ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD ALSO INHIBIT THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN AN

AFFECTED REGION. THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES

AND HOLDS INVESTMENTS, AND ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE RISKS IN OPERATING ITS FACILITIES AND BUSINESS.

PRICE LEVELS FOR CAPITALIZED COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFICIENT

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS CAN ALSO BE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL FACTORS BEYOND THE

COMPANYS CONTROL. EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION BUT ALSO

PRICES CHARGED BY THE INDUSTRYS PRODUCT- AND SERVICE-PROVIDERS, WHICH CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE

VOLATILITY OF THE INDUSTRYS OWN SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE

OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY

WORLDWIDE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE INCREASES FOR THESE ITEMS DURING 2005 THAT ARE EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE INTO 2006. CAPITALIZED COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY UNINSURED

DAMAGES TO PRODUCTION FACILITIES CAUSED BY SEVERE WEATHER OR CIVIL UNREST.

INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL CONTINUED AN UPWARD TREND IN 2005. THE SPOT PRICE FOR WEST

TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) CRUDE OIL, ONE OF THE BENCHMARK CRUDES, AVERAGED $57 PER BARREL IN 2005,

AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $16 PER BARREL FROM THE 2004 AVERAGE PRICE. THE WTI SPOT PRICE FOR THE

FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 2006 AVERAGED ABOUT $64 PER BARREL. THE RISE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES REFLECTS,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASING DEMAND IN GROWING ECONOMIES, THE HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF GEOPOLITICAL

UNCERTAINTY IN SOME AREAS OF THE WORLD AND SUPPLY CONCERNS IN OTHER KEY PRODUCING REGIONS,

INCLUDING PRODUCTION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THAT PARTIALLY WAS SHUT IN FOLLOWING THE HURRICANES.

AS WAS THE CASE IN 2004, THE DIFFERENTIAL IN PRICES BETWEEN HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT-SWEET CRUDE

OILS, SUCH AS THE U.S. BENCHMARK WTI, AND HEAVIER CRUDES WAS UNUSUALLY WIDE IN 2005. CHEVRON

PRODUCES HEAVY CRUDE OIL IN CALIFORNIA, CHAD, INDONESIA, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE (BETWEEN

SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT), VENEZUELA (INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE

AGREEMENT) AND CERTAIN FIELDS IN ANGOLA, CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM NORTH SEA. THE PRICE FOR THE

HEAVIER CRUDES HAS BEEN DAMPENED BECAUSE OF

AMPLE SUPPLY, TOGETHER WITH LOWER RELATIVE DEMAND FROM THE NUMBER OF REFINERIES THAT ARE ABLE

TO PROCESS THIS LOWER-QUALITY FEEDSTOCK INTO LIGHT-PRODUCT FUELS (I.E., MOTOR GASOLINE, JET FUEL,

AVIATION GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL). THE DEMAND FOR HEAVY CRUDE WAS FURTHER REDUCED IN LATE 2005 AS

REFINING CAPACITY ALONG THE U.S. GULF COAST WAS INTERRUPTED BY HURRICANES. THE PRICE FOR

HIGHER-QUALITY LIGHT OIL, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS REMAINED HIGH, AS THE DEMAND FOR LIGHT PRODUCTS,

WHICH CAN BE MANUFACTURED BY ANY REFINERY FROM LIGHT OIL, HAS BEEN ROBUST WORLDWIDE.

NATURAL GAS PRICES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, ALSO TRENDED UPWARD IN 2005. FOR THE

FULL YEAR, U.S. BENCHMARK PRICES AT HENRY HUB AVERAGED ABOUT $8 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET (MCF),

COMPARED WITH ABOUT $6 IN 2004. HENRY HUB SPOT PRICES PEAKED IN DECEMBER 2005 ABOVE $14, AS

SUPPLIES EARLY IN THE WINTER HEATING SEASON WERE REDUCED BY PRODUCTION SHUT IN FOLLOWING HURRICANES

KATRINA AND RITA. BY MID-FEBRUARY 2006, PRICES HAD MOVED DOWNWARD TO ABOUT $8 PER MCF. FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE PRICE FOR NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUMES PRODUCED

IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE INVENTORY IN UNDERGROUND STORAGE TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND.

IN CONTRAST TO THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH THE COMPANY

OPERATES HAVE DIFFERENT SUPPLY, DEMAND AND REGULATORY CIRCUMSTANCES, TYPICALLY RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY

LOWER AVERAGE SALES PRICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS. (REFER TO PAGE FS-12

FOR THE COMPANYS AVERAGE NATURAL GAS PRICES FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL REGIONS.) ADDITIONALLY,

EXCESS SUPPLY CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD CANNOT EASILY SERVE TO MITIGATE THE

RELATIVELY HIGH-PRICE CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER MARKETS BECAUSE OF

LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSPORTING NATURAL GAS. TO HELP ADDRESS THIS

FS-3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

REGIONAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS, CHEVRON IS PLANNING INCREASED

INVESTMENTS IN LONG-TERM PROJECTS IN AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY TO INSTALL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PRODUCE

AND LIQUEFY NATURAL GAS FOR TRANSPORT BY TANKER, ALONG WITH INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO REGASIFY

THE PRODUCT IN MARKETS WHERE DEMAND IS STRONG AND SUPPLIES ARE NOT AS PLENTIFUL. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE

OF THE OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THESE LONG-TERM PROJECTS, THE NATURAL GAS SALES PRICES IN THE

AREAS OF EXCESS SUPPLY (BEFORE THE NATURAL GAS IS TRANSFERRED TO A COMPANY-OWNED OR THIRD-PARTY

PROCESSING FACILITY) ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN WELL BELOW SALES PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS THAT IS

PRODUCED MUCH NEARER TO AREAS OF HIGH DEMAND AND THAT CAN BE TRANSPORTED IN EXISTING NATURAL GAS

PIPELINE NETWORKS (AS IN THE UNITED STATES).

LONGER-TERM TRENDS IN EARNINGS FOR THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT ARE ALSO A FUNCTION OF OTHER FACTORS

BESIDES PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION LEVELS AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. MOST OF THE COMPANYS OVERALL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS IN ITS UPSTREAM

BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM PROJECTS GENERALLY ARE

MADE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION.

CHEVRONS WORLDWIDE NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY

IN 2005, INCLUDING VOLUMES PRODUCED FROM OIL SANDS AND PRODUCTION UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE

AGREEMENT, REMAINED ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2004. HOWEVER, PRODUCTION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2005

WAS NEARLY 2.7 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, REFLECTING THE BENEFIT OF VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

PROPERTIES ACQUIRED FROM UNOCAL, THE EFFECT OF WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRODUCTION SHUT IN AS

A RESULT OF THE HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. PRIOR TO THE HURRICANES IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER

2005, OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WAS APPROXIMATELY 300,000 BARRELS PER DAY. IN

2006, PRODUCTION IS PROJECTED TO AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 200,000 BARRELS PER DAY, AS NORMAL FIELD

DECLINES ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED THE PRODUCTION BEING RESTORED FROM WELLS THAT WERE SHUT IN OR

DAMAGED FROM THE HURRICANES AND THE PRODUCTION THAT WILL RESULT FROM THE DRILLING OF NEW WELLS IN

THE AREA. APPROXIMATELY 20,000 NET OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS OF DAILY PRODUCTION ARE NOT EXPECTED TO

BE SUFFICIENTLY ECONOMIC TO RESTORE. REFER ALSO TO PAGES 11 THROUGH 24 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

AND DETAIL OF PRODUCTION VOLUMES WORLDWIDE.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2006 WILL AVERAGE BETWEEN 2.7 MILLION

AND 2.8 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY. HOWEVER, FUTURE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES,

INCLUDING QUOTAS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY OPEC, THE PRICE EFFECT ON PRODUCTION VOLUMES CALCULATED

UNDER COST-RECOVERY AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, SEVERE WEATHER, AND THE

POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL CIVIL UNREST AND CHANGING GEOPOLITICS THAT COULD CAUSE PRODUCTION

DISRUPTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 26 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2005,

INCLUDING NET BARRELS FROM OIL SANDS AND PRODUCTION UNDER AN OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENT, OCCURRED

IN THE OPEC-MEMBER COUNTRIES OF INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL

ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION LEVEL DURING 2005 WAS NOT

CONSTRAINED IN THESE AREAS BY OPEC QUOTAS, FUTURE PRODUCTION COULD BE AFFECTED BY OPEC-IMPOSED

LIMITATIONS. FUTURE PRODUCTION LEVELS ALSO ARE AFFECTED BY THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF ECONOMIC

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND, FOR NEW LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS, THE TIME LAG BETWEEN INITIAL

EXPLORATION AND THE BEGINNING OF PRODUCTION. REFER TO PAGES FS-5 THROUGH FS-7 FOR DISCUSSION OF THE

COMPANYS MAJOR UPSTREAM PROJECTS.

IN CERTAIN ONSHORE AREAS OF NIGERIA, APPROXIMATELY 45,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF THE COMPANYS NET

PRODUCTION CAPACITY WAS SHUT IN DURING 2003 BECAUSE OF CIVIL UNREST AND DAMAGE TO PRODUCTION

FACILITIES. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A PHASED PLAN TO RESTORE THESE OPERATIONS, AND ABOUT ONE-THIRD

OF THE VOLUMES HAD BEEN RETURNED TO PRODUCTION AS OF EARLY 2006.

REFER TO PAGES FS-7 THROUGH FS-9 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS.

DOWNSTREAM

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION EARNINGS ARE CLOSELY TIED TO

GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED EFFECTS ON INDUSTRY

REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS. THE COMPANYS CORE MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WEST COAST OF NORTH

AMERICA, THE U.S. GULF COAST, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. IN 2005, INDUSTRY REFINING

MARGINS IMPROVED OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING STRONG DEMAND FOR REFINED PRODUCTS;

HOWEVER, MARKETING MARGINS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS, WERE MIXED.

MANY REGIONS EXPERIENCED STRONGER MARKETING MARGINS, BUT THESE MARGINS WERE GENERALLY LOWER IN THE

UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, AS RETAIL PRICES DID NOT KEEP PACE WITH RISING CRUDE OIL AND SPOT PRODUCT

PRICES. INDUSTRY MARGINS IN THE FUTURE MAY BE VOLATILE, DUE PRIMARILY TO CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF

CRUDE OIL USED FOR REFINERY FEEDSTOCK, DISRUPTIONS AT REFINERIES RESULTING FROM MAINTENANCE

PROGRAMS AND MISHAPS AND LEVELS OF INVENTORY AND DEMAND FOR REFINED PRODUCTS.

OTHER INFLUENCES ON THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY IN THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES

AND EXPENSES OF THE REFINERY NETWORK, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ANY DOWNTIME DUE TO

PLANNED AND UNPLANNED MAINTENANCE, REFINERY UPGRADE PROJECTS AND OPERATING INCIDENTS. THE LEVEL OF

OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE VOLATILITY OF CHARTER

EXPENSES FOR THE COMPANYS SHIPPING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVEN BY THE INDUSTRYS DEMAND FOR CRUDE

OIL AND PRODUCT TANKERS. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM PROFITABILITY THAT ARE

BEYOND THE

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANYS CONTROL INCLUDE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF INFLATION AND ENERGY COSTS TO OPERATE THE

REFINERY NETWORK.

REFER TO PAGES FS-9 THROUGH FS-10 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM

OPERATIONS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS IN THE PETROCHEMICALS BUSINESS ARE CLOSELY TIED TO GLOBAL

CHEMICAL DEMAND, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS AND PLANT CAPACITY UTILIZATION. ADDITIONALLY, FEEDSTOCK

AND FUEL COSTS, WHICH TEND TO FOLLOW CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE MOVEMENTS, INFLUENCE EARNINGS

IN THIS SEGMENT.

REFER TO PAGE FS-10 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF CHEMICAL EARNINGS FOR BOTH THE COMPANYS

ORONITE SUBSIDIARY AND THE 50 PERCENT-OWNED CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC.

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

KEY OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER EVENTS DURING 2005 AND EARLY 2006 INCLUDED.

UPSTREAM

WORLDWIDE PROVED RESERVES

AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES BY APPROXIMATELY 1.5 BILLION BARRELS. SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED VOLUMES OF OIL AND

GAS WERE ALSO ADDED TO THE COMPANYS RESOURCE BASE. (REFER TO PAGES FS-70 THROUGH FS-75 FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF PROVED RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2005 AND NOTE 2

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-36 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION.)

NORTH AMERICA

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY SOLD NORTHROCK RESOURCES LIMITED, A

WHOLLY OWNED CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY OF UNOCAL, FOR $1.7 BILLION. THE DISPOSITION WAS CONSISTENT WITH

CHEVRONS DIVESTITURE IN 2004 OF ITS CONVENTIONAL CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS BUSINESS IN WESTERN CANADA,

ENABLING THE COMPANYS CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE PROFITABLE GROWTH OF PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS IN STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT CORE AREAS OF OPERATION.

IN LATE 2005, THE COMPANY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF THE FLOATING PRODUCTION FACILITY TO BE

INSTALLED IN THE TAHITI FIELD, IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO. TAHITI IS ANTICIPATED TO HAVE A

MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION OF 125,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF CRUDE OIL AND 70 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS. CHEVRON IS THE OPERATOR AND HOLDS A 58 PERCENT WORKING INTEREST IN THE PROJECT THAT IS

BEING DEVELOPED IN PHASES AND EXPECTED TO COME ONTO PRODUCTION IN 2008.

IN THE SAME PERIOD, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO PROCEED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BLIND

FAITH FIELD, ALSO IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO. FIRST PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED IN 2008, WITH

INITIAL TOTAL DAILY OUTPUT ESTIMATED AT 30,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL AND 30 MILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS. CHEVRON IS THE OPERATOR AND HOLDS A 62.5 PERCENT WORKING INTEREST IN THE PROJECT.

IN LATE 2005, THE COMPANY DRILLED DEEPWATER CRUDE OIL DISCOVERIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AT THE

60 PERCENT-OWNED AND OPERATED BIG FOOT PROSPECT IN THE WALKER RIDGE BLOCK 29 AND THE 25

PERCENT-OWNED, NONOPERATED KNOTTY HEAD PROSPECT LOCATED IN GREEN CANYON BLOCK 512. ADDITIONAL

APPRAISAL ACTIVITY CONTINUED INTO 2006 AT BOTH LOCATIONS.

ANGOLA

IN EARLY 2006, FIRST OIL WAS PRODUCED FROM THE 31 PERCENT-INTEREST DEEPWATER

BELIZE FIELD IN BLOCK 14, OFFSHORE ANGOLA. THE BENGUELA, BELIZE, LOBITO AND TOMBOCO FIELDS FORM A

PROJECT THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED IN TWO PHASES. THE MAXIMUM TOTAL PRODUCTION FROM BOTH PHASES OF THE

PROJECT IS ANTICIPATED TO REACH 200,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL PER DAY IN 2008.

AUSTRALIA

IN MID-2005, THE COMPANY WON EXPLORATION RIGHTS TO FOUR DEEPWATER BLOCKS

IN THE NORTHERN CARNARVON BASIN OFFSHORE WESTERN AUSTRALIA. IN EARLY 2006, THE COMPANY WAS AWARDED

RIGHTS TO ANOTHER BLOCK IN THE CARNARVON BASIN. THE BLOCKS ARE LOCATED IN AN AREA OF SIGNIFICANT

NATURAL GAS POTENTIAL AND NEAR THE CHEVRON-LED GORGON PROJECT. CHEVRON HOLDS A 50 PERCENT OPERATED

INTEREST IN THE BLOCKS.

KAZAKHSTAN

IN LATE 2005, THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT-OWNED TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO) AFFILIATE AWARDED COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS TO ENABLE INCREASED CRUDE-OIL EXPORTS THROUGH A SOUTHERN ROUTE

ACROSS THE CASPIAN SEA. THE SOUTHERN ROUTE WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EXPORT CAPACITY FOR TCOS

INCREASED PRODUCTION UNTIL THE CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM PIPELINE IS EXPANDED. THE ADDITIONAL

CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION AT TCO WILL RESULT FROM MAJOR FACILITIES-EXPANSION PROJECTS BEING CONSTRUCTED

AT A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION. BY THE THIRD QUARTER 2007, TCOS CRUDE PRODUCTION

CAPACITY IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT CAPACITY OF 300,000 BARRELS PER DAY TO BETWEEN

460,000 AND 550,000.

NIGERIA

IN EARLY 2005, A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT WAS AWARDED FOR THE $1.1 BILLION FLOATING PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND OFFLOADING (FPSO) VESSEL TO BE USED AT THE AGBAMI FIELD. THE

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT WAS A KEY MILESTONE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 68 PERCENT-OWNED AGBAMI FIELD,

WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO COME ONLINE IN 2008 WITH AN ESTIMATED MAXIMUM TOTAL DAILY PRODUCTION OF

250,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL.

NIGERIA  SÃO TOMÉ E PRÍNCIPE JOINT DEVELOPMENT ZONE (JDZ)

IN EARLY 2005, THE

COMPANY SIGNED A PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT FOR BLOCK 1 IN THE NIGERIA - SÃO TOMÉ E PRÍNCIPE JDZ.

CHEVRON WILL BE THE OPERATOR AND HAS A 51 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE BLOCK. DRILLING OF THE FIRST

EXPLORATION WELL WAS UNDER WAY IN LATE-FEBRUARY 2006.

VENEZUELA

IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY DISCOVERED NATURAL GAS IN BLOCK 3 OF PLATAFORMA

DELTANA, OFFSHORE VENEZUELA. THE SITE IS IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE LORAN NATURAL GAS FIELD IN BLOCK

2 AND PROVIDES SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR A DETAILED EVALUATION OF VENEZUELAS FIRST LIQUEFIED

NATURAL GAS (LNG) TRAIN.

FS-5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2005, THE COMPANY WAS AWARDED AN EXPLORATION LICENSE FOR THE CARDON

III BLOCK, OFFSHORE WESTERN VENEZUELA. THE BLOCK IS IN A REGION WITH NATURAL GAS POTENTIAL TO THE

NORTH OF THE MARACAIBO PRODUCING AREA.

IN DECEMBER 2005, CHEVRON SIGNED A TRANSITION AGREEMENT WITH PETRÓLEOS DE VENEZUELA, S.A.

(PDVSA), THE VENEZUELAN STATE-OWNED PETROLEUM COMPANY, TO CONVERT CONTRACTS FOR THE BOSCAN AND

LL-652 OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS INTO AN EMPRESA MIXTA (EM). THE EM IS A JOINT-STOCK CONTRACTUAL

STRUCTURE WITH PDVSA AS THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER. NEGOTIATION OF THE OWNERSHIP AND FORMAT OF THE FINAL EM STRUCTURE WILL BE CONDUCTED DURING 2006. POSSIBLE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE EM

STRUCTURE ARE UNCERTAIN, BUT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

GLOBAL NATURAL GAS PROJECTS

IN ANGOLA, THE COMPANY AWARDED CONTRACTS IN APRIL 2005

FOR FRONT-END ENGINEERING AND DESIGN STUDIES FOR A MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR ONSHORE LNG PROJECT LOCATED

IN NORTHERN ANGOLA. THIS PROJECT WILL BE DESIGNED TO HELP REDUCE FLARING OF NATURAL GAS AND

REPRESENTS A MAJOR STEP TOWARD THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SOME OF ANGOLAS VAST NATURAL GAS

RESOURCES. THE COMPANY HAS A 36 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE ANGOLA LNG PROJECT AND WILL

CO-LEAD DEVELOPMENT WITH THE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENTS NATIONAL OIL COMPANY. CONSTRUCTION IS EXPECTED TO

BEGIN IN 2007.

IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH JOINT-VENTURE PARTICIPANTS IN THE GREATER

GORGON AREA, OFFSHORE WESTERN AUSTRALIA THAT WILL ENABLE THE COMBINED DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL

GAS AT GORGON AND NEARBY GAS FIELDS AS ONE PROJECT. THE COMPANY IS A SIGNIFICANT HOLDER OF GAS

RESOURCES IN THE AREA AND WILL HAVE AN APPROXIMATE 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST ACROSS MOST OF THE

GREATER GORGON AREA.

IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE DECISION TO MOVE THE AUSTRALIAN GREATER GORGON GAS

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT INTO THE FRONT-END ENGINEERING AND DESIGN PHASE FOR A TWO-TRAIN (10 MILLION

METRIC TONS PER YEAR) LNG FACILITY AND A POTENTIAL DOMESTIC GAS PLANT ON BARROW ISLAND, TARGETING

INITIAL PRODUCTION BY 2010. CHEVRON IS THE OPERATOR AND HAS A 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE

LICENSES FOR THE GREATER GORGON AREA.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2005, THE COMPANY SIGNED A HEADS OF AGREEMENT (HOA) FOR FIRST SALE OF

LNG FROM THE GORGON PROJECT INTO JAPAN, THE WORLDS LARGEST LNG MARKET. THE PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT

WAS SIGNED BY CHEVRON AUSTRALIA PTY LTD WITH TOKYO GAS CO. LTD, A MAJOR JAPANESE UTILITY COMPANY,

FOR THE PURCHASE OF 1.2 MILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR OF GORGON LNG OVER 25 YEARS. TWO ADDITIONAL

HOAS WERE LATER SIGNED BY CHEVRON AUSTRALIA PTY LTD WITH CHUBU ELECTRIC CO. INC AND OSAKA GAS CO.

LTD, BOTH COMPANIES FROM JAPAN. EACH PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT WAS FOR THE PURCHASE OF 1.5 MILLION

METRIC TONS PER YEAR OF GORGON LNG OVER 25 YEARS COMMENCING IN 2010 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY AND ITS PARTNERS IN THE NORTH WEST SHELF (NWS) VENTURE AGREED IN MID-2005 TO

EXPAND THE PROJECTS ONSHORE LNG FACILITIES IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. CHEVRON HOLDS A ONE-SIXTH

INTEREST IN THE NWS VENTURE. THE $1.5 BILLION PROJECT INCLUDES ADDING A FIFTH TRAIN THAT WILL

INCREASE LNG EXPORT CAPACITY BY MORE THAN 4 MILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR TO APPROXIMATELY 16

MILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR, WITH STARTUP EXPECTED IN 2008. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE NWS JOINT

VENTURE PARTICIPANTS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANGEL NATURAL GAS FIELD, WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE

U.S. UPSTREAM INCOME OF NEARLY $4.2 BILLION IN 2005 INCREASED $230 MILLION. THE AMOUNT IN

2004 INCLUDED NET SPECIAL-ITEM BENEFITS (DISCUSSED BELOW) OF MORE THAN $300 MILLION. HIGHER PRICES

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN 2005 AND EARNINGS FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS CONTRIBUTED

APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION TO THE INCREASE BETWEEN PERIODS. APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF THIS AMOUNT

RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER PRICES ON HERITAGE-CHEVRON PRODUCTION. THESE BENEFITS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF LOWER PRODUCTION (DISCUSSED BELOW), HIGHER OPERATING

EXPENSES AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH HERITAGE-CHEVRON PROPERTIES.

INCOME OF $3.9 BILLION IN 2004 WAS $1.1 BILLION HIGHER THAN THE $2.8 BILLION RECORDED IN 2003.

OF THIS INCREASE, $725 MILLION RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS IN THE

RESPECTIVE PERIODS FROM SPECIAL ITEMS AND THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT CHARGES RECORDED IN 2003 FOR THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD. (REFER TO NOTE 24, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-59, FOR A

DISCUSSION OF FAS 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

) THE BALANCE OF THE INCREASE FROM 2003 TO

2004 WAS COMPOSED OF ABOUT A $1 BILLION BENEFIT FROM HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

THAT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF LOWER PRODUCTION.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE REALIZATION FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IN 2005 WAS $46.97 PER

BARREL, COMPARED WITH $34.12 IN 2004 AND $26.66 IN 2003. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS

$7.43 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2005, COMPARED WITH $5.51 AND $5.01 IN 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2005 AVERAGED 727,000 BARRELS PER DAY, DOWN 11 PERCENT FROM

2004 AND 22 PERCENT FROM 2003. THE DECLINE BETWEEN 2004 AND 2005 WAS THE RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF

HURRICANES, PROPERTY SALES AND NORMAL FIELD DECLINES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT

OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FIVE MONTHS OF PRODUCTION IN 2005 FROM PROPERTIES ACQUIRED FROM UNOCAL. THE LOWER PRODUCTION

BETWEEN 2003 AND 2004 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTY SALES, THE EFFECTS OF STORMS AND NORMAL FIELD

DECLINES.

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FOR 2005 AVERAGED 455,000 BARRELS PER

DAY, A DECLINE OF 10 PERCENT FROM 2004 AND 19 PERCENT FROM 2003. ABSENT THE EFFECTS OF THE UNOCAL

VOLUMES IN 2005, PROPERTY SALES AND STORMS, NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION IN 2005 DECLINED 6 PERCENT AND

11 PERCENT FROM 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 1.6 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2005, DOWN 13 PERCENT

AND 27 PERCENT FROM 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. EXCLUDING THE UNOCAL VOLUMES IN 2005, THE EFFECTS

OF PROPERTY SALES AND SHUT-IN PRODUCTION RELATED TO STORMS, NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IN 2005

DECLINED 10 PERCENT FROM 2004 AND 20 PERCENT FROM 2003.

REFER TO THE SELECTED OPERATING DATA TABLE, ON PAGE FS-12, FOR THE THREE-YEAR COMPARATIVE

PRODUCTION VOLUMES IN THE UNITED STATES.

NO SPECIAL ITEMS WERE RECORDED IN 2005. SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2004 INCLUDED GAINS OF $366 MILLION

FROM PROPERTY SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES OF $55 MILLION DUE TO AN ADVERSE LITIGATION

MATTER. NET SPECIAL CHARGES OF $64 MILLION IN 2003 WERE COMPOSED OF CHARGES OF $103 MILLION FOR

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS IN ANTICIPATION OF SALE; CHARGES

OF $38 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION, MAINLY FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS; AND GAINS

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM INCOME OF MORE THAN $7.5 BILLION IN 2005 INCREASED

$1.7 BILLION FROM $5.8 BILLION IN 2004. HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

IN 2005 AND EARNINGS FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS INCREASED EARNINGS

APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION BETWEEN PERIODS. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THIS BENEFIT AROSE

FROM THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON HERITAGE-CHEVRON PRODUCTION. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THESE BENEFITS WERE HIGHER EXPENSES BETWEEN PERIODS FOR HERITAGE-CHEVRON

OPERATIONS FOR CERTAIN INCOME-TAX ITEMS, INCLUDING THE ABSENCE OF A $200 MILLION

BENEFIT IN 2004 RELATING TO CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS. THE CHANGE BETWEEN YEARS

ALSO REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF $851 MILLION OF SPECIAL-ITEM GAINS IN 2004, WHILE NO

SPECIAL ITEMS WERE RECORDED IN 2005. FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES IN 2004 WERE $129

MILLION. GAINS OF $14 MILLION WERE RECORDED IN 2005.

INCOME OF $5.8 BILLION IN 2004 WAS NEARLY $2.5 BILLION HIGHER THAN EARNINGS

RECORDED IN 2003. APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF THE INCREASE WAS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE EFFECTS IN EACH PERIOD FROM SPECIAL ITEMS (DISCUSSED BELOW) AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY LOSSES. APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION OF THE INCREASE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. ANOTHER $400 MILLION RESULTED FROM

LOWER INCOME-TAX EXPENSE BETWEEN PERIODS, INCLUDING A BENEFIT OF ABOUT $200 MILLION

IN 2004 AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INCOME TAX LAWS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE

EFFECTS WERE HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS IN 2006 OF ABOUT $200 MILLION. THE BALANCE

OF THE CHANGE BETWEEN PERIODS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A GAIN IN 2003 FROM THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD. (REFER TO NOTE 24, BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-59, FOR A DISCUSSION OF FAS 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.)

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION OF 1.8 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2005, INCLUDING 143,000 NET

THE NET LIQUIDS COMPONENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS 1.4 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN

2005, UNCHANGED FROM 2004 AND 2003. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF UNOCAL PRODUCTION, PROPERTY SALES AND

THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON COST-RECOVERY AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY VOLUMES, 2005 NET LIQUIDS

PRODUCTION WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS 2004 AND DECREASED 1 PERCENT FROM 2003.

NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 2.6 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2005 WAS UP 25 PERCENT AND 26

PERCENT FROM 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF PRODUCTION FROM THE UNOCAL

NO SPECIAL ITEMS WERE RECORDED IN 2005. SPECIAL-ITEM GAINS IN 2004 INCLUDED $585 MILLION FROM

THE SALE OF PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN WESTERN CANADA AND $266 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF OTHER

NONSTRATEGIC ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO AND

A CANADIAN NATURAL-GAS PROCESSING BUSINESS. IN 2003, NET SPECIAL-ITEM GAINS OF $98 MILLION INCLUDED

U.S. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF NEARLY $1 BILLION IN 2005 DECREASED ABOUT $300 MILLION FROM

2004 AND WERE UP $500 MILLION FROM 2003. RESULTS IN 2003 INCLUDED NET SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES

(DISCUSSED BELOW) OF $123 MILLION. AVERAGE REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS IN 2005 WERE HIGHER THAN IN

2004, AND MARGINS IN 2004 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IN 2003. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF

INCREASED DOWNTIME AT REFINERIES AND OTHER FACILITIES AND HIGHER FUEL COSTS DAMPENED EARNINGS IN

2005. A PORTION OF THE DOWNTIME IN 2005 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. AS A

RESULT OF THE STORMS, THE COMPANYS REFINERY IN PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI, WAS SHUT DOWN FOR MORE

THAN A MONTH, AND THE COMPANYS MARKETING AND PIPELINE OPERATIONS ALONG THE GULF COAST WERE ALSO

DISRUPTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD.

SALES VOLUMES OF REFINED PRODUCTS IN 2005 WERE APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY, OR

ABOUT 2 PERCENT LOWER THAN IN 2004. BRANDED GASOLINE SALES VOLUMES OF APPROXIMATELY 600,000 BARRELS

PER DAY INCREASED ABOUT 4 PERCENT FROM THE 2004 PERIOD. IN 2004, REFINED-PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES

INCREASED ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM 2003, PRIMARILY DUE

TO HIGHER SALES OF GASOLINE, DIESEL FUEL AND FUEL OIL. REFER TO THE SELECTED OPERATING DATA

TABLE, ON PAGE FS-12, FOR THE THREE-YEAR COMPARATIVE REFINED-PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES IN THE UNITED

STATES.

IN 2003, NET SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES OF $123 MILLION INCLUDED $132 MILLION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND $28 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL DOWNSTREAM

INCOME OF NEARLY $1.8 BILLION IN 2005 DECREASED 10 PERCENT FROM $2 BILLION IN 2004 BUT WAS UP

ABOUT $1.1 BILLION FROM 2003. THE DECREASE FROM THE 2004 PERIOD WAS DUE MAINLY TO LOWER SALES

VOLUMES, HIGHER COSTS FOR FUEL AND TRANSPORTATION, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE

AT A 40 PERCENT-OWNED, NONOPERATED TERMINAL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND TAX ADJUSTMENTS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. THESE ITEMS MORE THAN OFFSET AN IMPROVEMENT IN AVERAGE REFINED-PRODUCT

AND HIGHER EARNINGS FROM INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING OPERATIONS. EARNINGS IN 2003 ALSO INCLUDED

SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES (DISCUSSED BELOW) AND FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES THAT TOTALED MORE THAN $300

MILLION.

TOTAL INTERNATIONAL REFINED PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES WERE 2.3 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2005,

ABOUT 4 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2004. THE SALES DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER GASOLINE

TRADING ACTIVITY AND LOWER FUEL-OIL SALES. REFINED PRODUCT SALES VOLUME OF 2.4 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN 2004 WAS ABOUT 4

PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2.3 MILLION IN 2003. REFER TO THE SELECTED OPERATING DATA TABLE, ON PAGE

FS-12, FOR THE THREE-YEAR COMPARATIVE REFINED-PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREAS.

THE SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES OF $189 MILLION IN 2003 INCLUDED THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE BATANGAS REFINERY IN THE PHILIPPINES IN ADVANCE OF ITS CONVERSION TO A PRODUCT TERMINAL FACILITY, EMPLOYEE

SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL DOWNSTREAM RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION, THE

RECOGNITION OF THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS IN ANTICIPATION OF THEIR SALE AND THE COMPANYS

CORPORATE-LEVEL TAX ADJUSTMENTS. HIGHER CHARGES IN 2005 WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION OF PROPERTIES THAT HAD BEEN SOLD OR IDLED AND ONGOING UNOCAL CORPORATE-LEVEL

ACTIVITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE ALSO WAS HIGHER IN 2005 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES AND THE

DEBT ASSUMED WITH THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION.

THE IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN 2003 AND 2004 WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

IN DYNEGY, INCLUDING GAINS FROM THE REDEMPTION OF CERTAIN DYNEGY SECURITIES, HIGHER INTEREST

INCOME, LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AND THE FAVORABLE CORPORATE-LEVEL TAX ADJUSTMENTS.

NET SPECIAL-ITEM GAINS IN 2003 INCLUDED A DYNEGY-RELATED NET BENEFIT OF $325 MILLION, WHICH

WAS COMPOSED OF A GAIN OF $365 MILLION FROM THE EXCHANGE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY

SECURITIES THAT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $40 MILLION CHARGE FOR CHEVRONS SHARE OF AN ASSET

PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF BENEFITS IN 2004 FROM CHANGES IN THE INCOME TAX LAWS FOR CERTAIN

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER TAX RATES. AS

COMPARED WITH THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2003, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2004 BENEFITED FROM

CHANGES IN THE INCOME TAX LAWS FOR CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM EARNINGS OCCURRING IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT TAX RATES AND FAVORABLE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY INC.

AT YEAR-END 2005, CHEVRON OWNED AN APPROXIMATE 24 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COMMON STOCK

OF DYNEGY, A PROVIDER OF ELECTRICITY TO MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANY ALSO HELD AN INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK WAS APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT WAS ABOUT

$200 MILLION BELOW THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE INTEREST IN DYNEGYS UNDERLYING NET ASSETS. THIS

DIFFERENCE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF WRITE-DOWNS OF THE INVESTMENT IN 2002 FOR DECLINES IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY. THE DIFFERENCE HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC DYNEGY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BASED UPON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE DYNEGY SHARES. THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF DYNEGYS REPORTED EARNINGS

IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY WHEN APPROPRIATE TO RECOGNIZE A PORTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE

ALLOCATED VALUES AND DYNEGYS HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES. THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

IN DYNEGYS COMMON STOCK AT THE END OF 2005 WAS APPROXIMATELY $470 MILLION.

INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK

AT THE END OF 2005, THE COMPANY HELD $400

MILLION FACE VALUE OF DYNEGY SERIES C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WITH A STATED MATURITY OF 2033.

THE STOCK IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $360 MILLION AT YEAR-END

2005. TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK ARE REPORTED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, A CHARGE AGAINST INCOME IN THE PERIOD WOULD BE RECORDED. DIVIDENDS RECEIVED

FROM THE PREFERRED STOCK ARE RECORDED TO INCOME IN THE PERIOD RECEIVED.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

TOTAL BALANCES WERE $11.1 BILLION

AND $10.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN 2005 WAS $20.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $14.7 BILLION IN 2004 AND $12.3 BILLION IN

2003.

THE 2005 INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAINLY REFLECTED HIGHER EARNINGS

IN THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT, INCLUDING EARNINGS FROM THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS. CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS NET OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS OF $1.0 BILLION, $1.6

BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING

ACTIVITIES INCLUDED PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES OF $2.7 BILLION IN 2005, $3.7 BILLION IN 2004 AND

$1.1 BILLION IN 2003.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ASSET SALES DURING 2005 WAS SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE

COMPANYS $8.7 BILLION CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY PROGRAM, PAY $3.8 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS TO

STOCKHOLDERS, REPAY APPROXIMATELY $970 MILLION IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND REPURCHASE $3 BILLION OF

COMMON STOCK. PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL IN AUGUST

2005 ALSO INCLUDED $7.5 BILLION IN CASH. UNOCAL BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT THE ACQUISITION DATE TOTALED $1.6 BILLION.

DIVIDENDS

THE COMPANY PAID DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $3.8 BILLION IN 2005, $3.2

BILLION IN 2004 AND $3 BILLION IN 2003. IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS QUARTERLY COMMON

STOCK DIVIDEND BY 12.5 PERCENT TO 45 CENTS PER SHARE.

DEBT, CAPITAL LEASE AND MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS

TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE

BALANCES WERE $12.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, UP FROM $11.3 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2004. THE 2005

YEAR-END BALANCE INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION OF DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED

WITH THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS OF $200 MILLION,

UP FROM $172 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALED $5.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, UNCHANGED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004. OF THESE AMOUNTS, $4.9 BILLION AND $4.7 BILLION WERE

RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. AT YEAR-END 2005, SETTLEMENT OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2006, AS THE COMPANY

HAD THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE THEM ON

A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REFINANCE ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER,

MAINTAINING LEVELS IT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE AND ECONOMIC.

AT YEAR-END 2005, THE COMPANY HAD $4.9 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS

MAJOR BANKS, WHICH PERMITTED THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THESE

FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND ALSO CAN BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE EXPIRING COMMITMENTS WITH NEW COMMITMENTS ON

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS, MAINTAINING LEVELS MANAGEMENT

FS-13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BELIEVES APPROPRIATE. ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITIES WOULD BE UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AT

INTEREST RATES BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR AN AVERAGE OF BASE LENDING RATES

PUBLISHED BY SPECIFIED BANKS AND ON TERMS REFLECTING THE COMPANYS STRONG CREDIT RATING. NO

BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

HAS THREE EXISTING EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT TOGETHER WOULD PERMIT ADDITIONAL REGISTERED DEBT OFFERINGS UP TO AN

AGGREGATE $3.8 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES. FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY

WITHDREW UNOCALS SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS.

IN OCTOBER 2005, THE COMPANY FULLY REDEEMED THE UNOCAL SUBSIDIARY PURE RESOURCES 7.125

PERCENT SENIOR NOTES DUE 2011 FOR $395 MILLION. THE COMPANYS $150 MILLION OF TEXACO BRASIL ZERO

COUPON NOTES WERE PAID AT MATURITY IN NOVEMBER 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY EXERCISED A

PAR-CALL REDEMPTION OF $200 MILLION IN TEXACO CAPITAL INC. 5.7 PERCENT NOTES DUE 2008.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE COMPANY RETIRED UNION OIL BONDS AT MATURITY FOR APPROXIMATELY $185

MILLION.

TEXACO CAPITAL LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, ISSUED DEFERRED PREFERRED SHARES

SERIES C (SERIES C) IN DECEMBER 1995. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE COMPANY REDEEMED THE SERIES C SHARES

AND PAID ACCUMULATED DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION.

IN JANUARY 2005, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $98 MILLION TO ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

(ESOP) TO PERMIT THE ESOP TO MAKE A $144 MILLION DEBT SERVICE PAYMENT, WHICH INCLUDED A PRINCIPAL

PAYMENT OF $113 MILLION.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2004, CHEVRON ENTERED INTO $1 BILLION OF INTEREST RATE FIXED-TO-FLOATING

SWAP TRANSACTIONS, IN WHICH THE COMPANY RECEIVES A FIXED INTEREST RATE AND PAYS A FLOATING

RATE, BASED ON THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAP AGREEMENTS, OF WHICH

$250 MILLION AND $750 MILLION WILL TERMINATE IN SEPTEMBER 2007 AND FEBRUARY 2008, RESPECTIVELY, THE

NET CASH SETTLEMENT WILL BE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING RATE INTEREST

AMOUNTS.

CHEVRONS SENIOR DEBT IS RATED AA BY STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND AA2 BY MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANYS SENIOR DEBT OF TEXACO CAPITAL INC. IS RATED AA3, AND UNION OIL

COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA BONDS ARE RATED

A1 BY MOODYS. THESE COMPANIES ARE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF CHEVRON. THE COMPANYS U.S.

COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND P-1 BY MOODYS, AND THE COMPANYS

CANADIAN COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED R-1 (MIDDLE) BY DOMINION BOND RATING SERVICE. ALL OF THESE

RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE

CAPITAL-SPENDING PROGRAM AND CASH THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. FURTHER REDUCTIONS

FROM DEBT BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENTS

CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT OF DEBT AS AN APPROPRIATE COMPONENT OF THE COMPANYS OVERALL CAPITAL

STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH

REQUIREMENTS, AND DURING PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR

REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY CHEMICALS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO

INCREASE BORROWINGS AND/OR MODIFY CAPITAL-SPENDING PLANS TO CONTINUE PAYING THE COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE COMPANYS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

IN CONNECTION WITH A $5 BILLION STOCK- REPURCHASE

PROGRAM INITIATED IN APRIL 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 92.1 MILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES FOR $5

BILLION THROUGH NOVEMBER 2005. DURING 2005, ABOUT 49.8 MILLION OF COMMON SHARES WERE REPURCHASED

UNDER THIS PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL COST OF $2.9 BILLION.

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY AUTHORIZED THE ACQUISITION OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION OF

ITS COMMON SHARES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, AS PERMITTED BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE PROGRAM IS FOR A PERIOD

OF UP TO THREE YEARS AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR $100 MILLION DURING DECEMBER 2005.

PURCHASES THROUGH MID-FEBRUARY 2006 INCREASED THE TOTAL SHARES ACQUIRED TO 8.3 MILLION AT A COST OF

$481 MILLION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

EXCLUDING THE $17.3 BILLION ACQUISITION OF

UNOCAL CORPORATION, TOTAL REPORTED EXPENDITURES FOR 2005 WERE $11.1 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.7 BILLION

FOR THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES, WHICH DID NOT REQUIRE CASH OUTLAYS BY THE

COMPANYS SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES OF $1.6 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION IN THE CORRESPONDING

PERIODS.

OF THE $11.1 BILLION IN EXPENDITURES FOR 2005, ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS, OR $8.4 BILLION, RELATED TO UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES. APPROXIMATELY THE SAME

PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO EXPENDED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS IN 2004 AND 2003. INTERNATIONAL

UPSTREAM ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THE

YEARS, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WILL BE 33 PERCENT HIGHER

AT $14.8 BILLION, INCLUDING SPENDING BY AFFILIATES. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS, OR $11.3 BILLION,

IS AGAIN FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $8

BILLION OF THAT AMOUNT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SPENDING IS PRIMARILY TARGETED FOR EXPLORATORY

PROSPECTS IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO AND WESTERN AFRICA AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN

ANGOLA, NIGERIA, KAZAKHSTAN AND THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO. INCLUDED IN THE UPSTREAM EXPENDITURES

IS ABOUT $1 BILLION TO DEVELOP THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS RESOURCE BASE.

WORLDWIDE DOWNSTREAM SPENDING IN 2006 IS ESTIMATED AT $2.8 BILLION, WITH ABOUT $1.9 BILLION

FOR REFINING AND MARKETING AND $900 MILLION FOR SUPPLY AND TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS, INCLUDING

PIPELINES TO SUPPORT EXPANDED UPSTREAM PRODUCTION. APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL PROJECTED

SPENDING IS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

INVESTMENTS IN CHEMICALS BUSINESSES IN 2006 ARE BUDGETED AT $250 MILLION. ESTIMATES FOR ENERGY

TECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES, REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES, POWER-RELATED BUSINESSES

AND OTHER BUSINESSES TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $460 MILLION.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS

IN 2005, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, INCLUDING NEARLY $200 MILLION TO THE UNOCAL PLANS. APPROXIMATELY $800

MILLION OF THE TOTAL WAS CONTRIBUTED TO U.S. PLANS. IN 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES CONTRIBUTIONS

WILL BE $500 MILLION. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS. REFER ALSO TO THE

COMPANYS INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WAS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2005. THE INTEREST

LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES.

DEBT RATIO

 TOTAL DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEBT PLUS EQUITY. ALTHOUGH TOTAL

DEBT WAS HIGHER AT THE END OF 2005 THAN A YEAR EARLIER, THE DEBT RATIO DECLINED AS A RESULT OF

HIGHER STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY BALANCES FOR RETAINED EARNINGS AND THE CAPITAL STOCK THAT WAS ISSUED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION. THE DECLINE IN THE DEBT RATIO BETWEEN 2003 AND 2004 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DEBT LEVELS AND HIGHER RETAINED EARNINGS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED GUARANTEES, EITHER

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF $985 MILLION IN GUARANTEES FOR NOTES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND $294 MILLION FOR THIRD PARTIES AS DESCRIBED BY MAJOR CATEGORY BELOW.

THERE ARE NO MATERIAL AMOUNTS BEING CARRIED AS LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER

THESE GUARANTEES.

OF THE $985 MILLION IN GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO AFFILIATES, $806 MILLION RELATE TO BORROWINGS

FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THESE GUARANTEES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE

LOWER INTEREST RATES AND GENERALLY COVER THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. INCLUDED

IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE UNOCAL-RELATED GUARANTEES OF $230 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH A CONSTRUCTION

COMPLETION GUARANTEE FOR THE DEBT FINANCING OF UNOCALS EQUITY INTEREST IN THE BAKU-TBILISI-CEYHAN

(BTC) CRUDE OIL PIPELINE PROJECT. APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE

BETWEEN 2006 AND 2010 WITH THE REMAINING GUARANTEES EXPIRING BY THE END OF 2015. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THE GUARANTEE SHOULD AN AFFILIATE BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE

PROVISIONS, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE GUARANTEES. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF

$179 MILLION REPRESENTS OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH PRICING OF POWER-PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS COGENERATION AFFILIATES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY

MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IF THE AFFILIATES DO NOT PERFORM UNDER

THE AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE PROVISIONS TO THIRD PARTIES, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS

COLLATERAL FOR THESE PRICING GUARANTEES.

GUARANTEES OF $294 MILLION HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING GUARANTEES OF

APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO HOST GOVERNMENTS IN THE COMPANYS

INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. THE REMAINING GUARANTEES OF $144 MILLION WERE PROVIDED

PRINCIPALLY AS CON-

DITIONS OF SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY TO THE GUARANTEED PARTIES AND IN CONNECTION WITH COMPANY MARKETING PROGRAMS. NO AMOUNTS

OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES. ABOUT 85 PERCENT

OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE IN 2010, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPIRING AFTER 2010. THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN OR CONTRACT TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. APPROXIMATELY $85

MILLION OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE RECOURSE PROVISIONS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO RECOVER ANY

PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES FROM SECURITIES HELD OVER THE GUARANTEED PARTIES

ASSETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, CHEVRON ALSO HAD OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES FOR ABOUT $190 MILLION OF

EQUILON DEBT AND LEASES. FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 2002 DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN EQUILON, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED AN INDEMNIFICATION FROM SHELL OIL COMPANY (SHELL) FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE

GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES. APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT

OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THE 2006 THROUGH 2010 PERIOD, WITH THE GUARANTEES OF

THE REMAINING AMOUNTS EXPIRING BY 2019.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE

OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE INDEMNITIES COVER CERTAIN CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SHOULD THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME

ACTUAL LOSSES. SHOULD THAT OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300

MILLION. THROUGH THE END OF 2005, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $38 MILLION UNDER THESE

INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS IN

THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIODS OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS RELATING TO EQUILON INDEMNITIES MUST BE ASSERTED AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY 2007,

OR NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2009, AND CLAIMS RELATING TO MOTIVA MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN

FEBRUARY 2012. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED ANY LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER

THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE

INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED

FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001,

FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS OF UNOCALS 76 PRODUCTS COMPANY BUSINESS THAT

EXISTED PRIOR TO ITS SALE IN 1997. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT

ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY; HOWEVER, THE PURCHASER SHARES CERTAIN

COSTS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY UP TO AN AGGREGATE CAP OF $200 MILLION. CLAIMS RELATING TO THESE

INDEMNITIES MUST BE ASSERTED BY APRIL 2022. THROUGH THE END OF 2005, APPROXIMATELY $113 MILLION HAD

BEEN APPLIED TO THE CAP, WHICH INCLUDES PAYMENTS MADE BY EITHER UNOCAL OR CHEVRON TOTALING $80

MILLION.

SECURITIZATION

THE COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES). AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, REPRESENTING ABOUT 7 PERCENT OF CHEVRONS TOTAL

CURRENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED. CHEVRONS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL

EXPOSURE UNDER THESE SECURITIZATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT OF

ACCELERATING CHEVRONS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT OF THE SPES

EXPERIENCING MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE

NO LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATIONS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT

AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY,

UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS

ARE 2006  $2.2 BILLION; 2007 $1.9 BILLION; 2008  $1.8 BILLION; 2009  $1.8 BILLION; 2010 

$0.5 BILLION; 2011 AND AFTER  $3.8 BILLION. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE

APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION IN 2005, $1.6 BILLION IN 2004, AND $1.4 BILLION IN 2003. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 55,000 BARRELS

PER DAY OF REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY AFFILIATE REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS PURCHASE

AGREEMENT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCING OF A REFINERY OWNED BY THE AFFILIATE AND EXPIRES

IN 2009. THE FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT ARE: 2006  $1.3 BILLION; 2007 

$1.3 BILLION; 2008  $1.3 BILLION; AND 2009  $1.3 BILLION. IN 2005, UNDER THE TERMS OF AN

AGREEMENT ENTERED IN 2004, THE COMPANY EXERCISED ITS OPTION TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL REGASIFICATION

CAPACITY AT THE SABINE PASS LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS TERMINAL. PAYMENTS OF $2.5 BILLION OVER THE

20-YEAR PERIOD ARE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN 2009.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION RELATED

TO MINORITY INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO THE

PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND REFINERY

FEED-STOCK. THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A

PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE

OR SALE OF CRUDE OIL; FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR COMPANY REFINERIES; CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS

INVENTORIES; AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS TO SELL NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

CHEVRON ALSO

USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF THIS ACTIVITY WERE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS IN 2005.

THE COMPANYS POSITIONS ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN INTERNAL RISK CONTROL

GROUP TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE

AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES, OPTIONS, AND SWAP CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE

AND THE INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM EXCHANGE. IN ADDITION, CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCT

SWAP CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE ENTERED INTO PRINCIPALLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

AND OTHER OIL AND GAS COMPANIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

VIRTUALLY ALL DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM MARKET QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT

THIRD-PARTY QUOTES.

EACH HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS AND CRUDE OIL WOULD INCREASE

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NATURAL GAS PURCHASE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BY APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION AND

REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CRUDE OIL SALE

FS-17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BY ABOUT $11 MILLION. THE SAME HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN THE PRICES OF

THESE COMMODITIES WOULD RESULT IN THE SAME OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE CONTRACTS.

THE HYPOTHETICAL EFFECT ON THESE CONTRACTS WAS ESTIMATED BY CALCULATING THE CASH VALUE OF THE

CONTRACTS AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL AND CONTRACT DELIVERY PRICES MULTIPLIED BY THE

CONTRACT AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH

TERMS OF 180 DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES

INCLUDE REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASE

COMMITMENTS FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AT

YEAR-END 2005 WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION. THE EFFECT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE FOR A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT DECREASE

IN THE YEAR-END VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL

STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH

SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS

CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST

RATE SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON

THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

AT YEAR-END 2005, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS

APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS. THERE WERE NO RECEIVE FLOATING SWAPS OUTSTANDING AT YEAR END. A

HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE OF 10 BASIS POINTS IN FIXED INTEREST RATES WOULD REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE RECEIVE FIXED SWAPS BY APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION.

FOR THE FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THERE WAS NOT A MATERIAL CHANGE

IN MARKET RISK BETWEEN 2005 AND 2004.

THE HYPOTHETICAL VARIANCES USED IN THIS SECTION WERE SELECTED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY

AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATION OF MARKET CHANGES. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF FUTURE MARKET

CHANGES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THOSE

SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THE COMPANYS 2005 ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM 10-K.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRON ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY ITS

EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS. LONG-TERM

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE IN PLACE WITH THE COMPANYS REFINING AFFILIATE IN THAILAND. REFER TO PAGE

FS-17 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOREGOING AGREEMENTS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN

NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL

TERTIARY BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE.

CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO MORE THAN 70 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS

OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES

AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGE OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER. RESOLUTION OF THESE ACTIONS MAY ULTIMATELY

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR

RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE

OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY

DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE MTBE IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR

AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES,

INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, WHETHER

OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE DISPLAYS THE ANNUAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS BEFORE-TAX ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ING BUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO, FORMER REFINERIES, TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES

AND SERVICE STATIONS; FORMER CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS AND MINING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS

ACTIVE MINING OPERATIONS. OTHER LIABILITY ADDITIONS DURING 2005 FOR HERITAGE-CHEVRON RELATED

PRIMARILY TO REFINED-PRODUCT MARKETING SITES AND VARIOUS OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED FACILITIES

IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE OR

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2005 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, CHEVRON WAS INVOLVED WITH THE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OF 221 SITES FOR

WHICH IT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE BY THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND

LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2005 WAS

$139 MILLION. THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW AND ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS PROVIDE FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL

LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO REQUIRE CHEVRON TO

ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2005 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,330 MILLION, $855 MILLION

RELATED TO APPROXIMATELY 2,250 SITES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES

AND OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS) AND PIPELINES.

THE REMAINING $475 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN THE INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($101

MILLION), UPSTREAM ($257 MILLION), CHEMICALS ($50 MILLION) AND OTHER ($67 MILLION). LIABILITIES AT

ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS

PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO REMEDIATE SOIL AND/OR GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION OR BOTH. THESE AND OTHER

ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: SITE ASSESSMENT; SOIL EXCAVATION; OFFSITE DISPOSAL

OF CONTAMINANTS; ONSITE CONTAINMENT, REMEDIATION AND/OR EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LIQUID

AND VAPOR FROM SOIL; GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL

ATTENUATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE

RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT

FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE

UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS

ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD,

OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S.

OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL COMPANIES.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

(FAS 143). UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR VALUE OF

A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THE LIABILITY BALANCE OF $4.3 BILLION FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2005 RELATED

PRIMARILY TO UPSTREAM AND COAL PROPERTIES.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND CHEMICALS

FACILITIES, NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS

REACH THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS

BEEN MADE, AS THE INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION OF

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY CALCULATES ITS INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES

QUARTERLY. THESE LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE NOT FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING AUTHORITIES

UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED.

THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1996 FOR CHEVRON CORPORATION

(FORMERLY CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION) AND 1997 FOR CHEVRON GLOBAL ENERGY INC. (FORMERLY CALTEX

CORPORATION), UNOCAL CORPORATION (UNOCAL), AND TEXACO INC. (TEXACO). THE COMPANYS CALIFORNIA

FRANCHISE TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1991 FOR CHEVRON, 1998 FOR UNOCAL AND THROUGH

1987 FOR TEXACO. SETTLEMENT OF OPEN TAX YEARS, AS WELL AS TAX ISSUES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE

COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

CHEVRON AND ITS AFFILIATES CONDUCT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN

APPROXIMATELY 180 COUNTRIES. AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT

OPERATIONS OR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS INCLUDE THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM,

NORWAY, DENMARK, FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND SAUDI

ARABIA, REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, CHAD, SOUTH AFRICA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE

CONGO, INDONESIA, BANGLADESH, THE PHILIPPINES, MYANMAR, SINGAPORE, CHINA, THAILAND, VIETNAM,

CAMBODIA, AZERBAIJAN, KAZAKHSTAN, VENEZUELA, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO AND

SOUTH KOREA. THE COMPANYS CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC) AFFILIATE OPERATES IN RUSSIA AND

KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS TENGIZCHEVROIL AFFILIATE OPERATES IN KAZAKHSTAN. THROUGH AN AFFILIATE,

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BAKU-TBILISI-CEYHAN (BTC) PIPELINE THROUGH

AZERBAIJAN, GEORGIA AND TURKEY. ALSO THROUGH AN AFFILIATE, THE COMPANY HAS AN INTEREST IN THE

CHAD/CAMEROON PIPELINE. THE COMPANYS PETROLERA AMERIVEN AFFILIATE OPERATES THE HAMACA PROJECT IN

VENEZUELA. THE COMPANYS CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM) AFFILIATE MANUFACTURES AND

MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF PETROCHEMICALS ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE

UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND BELGIUM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY HOST

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR

ASSETS OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR BOTH.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN

OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED

RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS, AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF

CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES. REFER TO PAGE FS-6 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS

TRANSITION AGREEMENT WITH PETRÓLEOS DE VENEZUELA, S.A. (PDVSA), THE VENEZUELAN STATE-OWNED

PETROLEUM COMPANY, TO CONVERT CONTRACTS FOR THE BOSCAN AND LL-652 OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS INTO

AN EMPRESA MIXTA.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS PENDING A FINAL

DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

FIELDS. THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF FUTURE

DRILLING ACTIVITY, OR DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS OR BOTH. IF THE COMPANY DECIDES NOT TO CONTINUE

DEVELOPMENT, THE COSTS OF THESE WELLS ARE EXPENSED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION OF SUSPENDED

EXPLORATORY WELLS INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN $400

MILLION FROM 2004 AND AN INCREASE OF LESS THAN $600 MILLION FROM 2003. OF THE INCREASE IN 2005,

ABOUT $300 MILLION WAS THE YEAR-END SUSPENDED WELL BALANCE FOR THE FORMER-UNOCAL OPERATIONS. THE

YEAR-END 2005 BALANCE PRIMARILY REFLECTS DRILLING ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, NIGERIA AND

INDONESIA.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE COMPANYS EXPLORATION EXPENSES CAN BE AFFECTED BY AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED

WITH WELL WRITE-OFFS, INCLUDING WELLS THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED PENDING DETERMINATION AS

TO WHETHER THE WELL HAD FOUND RESERVES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED. THE EFFECT ON

EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE $1.1 BILLION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END 2005 IS

UNCERTAIN PENDING FUTURE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NORMAL PROJECT EVALUATION AND ADDITIONAL DRILLING.

REFER TO NOTE 20, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-49, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SUSPENDED WELLS.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES

THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS

HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL

PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE

ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET

SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES. CHEVRON CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET

BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. AT THE SAME TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT

THAT COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRON WAS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $50 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND

THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN.

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2005, THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED COMMENT LETTERS TO CHEVRON AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE OIL AND GAS

INDUSTRY REQUESTING DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS.

UNDER A BUY/SELL CONTRACT, A COMPANY AGREES TO BUY A SPECIFIC QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY

TO BE DELIVERED AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY AGREEING TO SELL A SPECIFIED QUANTITY

AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION TO THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. PHYSICAL DELIVERY

OCCURS FOR EACH SIDE OF THE TRANSACTION, AND THE RISK AND REWARD OF OWNERSHIP ARE EVIDENCED BY

TITLE TRANSFER, ASSUMPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK, TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULING, CREDIT RISK AND RISK

OF NONPERFOR-

FS-20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY. BOTH PARTIES SETTLE EACH SIDE OF THE BUY/SELL THROUGH SEPARATE

INVOICING.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO BUY/SELL CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, ASSOCIATED WITH CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS. FOR CRUDE OIL, THESE

CONTRACTS ARE USED TO FACILITATE THE COMPANYS CRUDE OIL MARKETING ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDES THE

PURCHASE AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION, FULFILLMENT OF THE COMPANYS SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AS TO

PHYSICAL DELIVERY LOCATION AND CRUDE OIL SPECIFICATIONS, AND PURCHASE OF CRUDE OIL TO SUPPLY THE

COMPANYS REFINING SYSTEM. FOR REFINED PRODUCTS, BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS ARE USED TO HELP FULFILL

THE COMPANYS SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME THE SAME AS FOR A MONETARY TRANSACTION  PURCHASES ARE REPORTED AS PURCHASED CRUDE OIL

AND PRODUCTS; SALES ARE REPORTED AS SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES. THE SEC RAISED THE

SEPTEMBER 2005 MEETING, THE EITF REACHED CONSENSUS THAT TWO OR MORE LEGALLY SEPARATE EXCHANGE

TRANSACTIONS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY, INCLUDING BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS, SHOULD BE COMBINED AND

CONSIDERED AS A SINGLE ARRANGEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING APB 29 WHEN THE TRANSACTIONS WERE

ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER. EITF 04-13 WAS RATIFIED BY THE FASB IN SEPTEMBER

2005 AND IS EFFECTIVE FOR NEW ARRANGEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS OR RENEWALS OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS,

ENTERED INTO BEGINNING ON OR AFTER APRIL 1, 2006, WHICH WILL BE THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE

COMPANYS ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY WILL REPORT THE NET EFFECT OF

BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS ON ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS

INSTEAD OF REPORTING THE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ARRANGEMENTS AS SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES AND THE COSTS AS PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS.

WHILE THIS ISSUE WAS UNDER

DELIBERATION BY THE EITF, THE SEC STAFF DIRECTED CHEVRON AND OTHER COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE ON THE

FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT THE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUY/SELL CONTRACTS AND TO DISCUSS IN A

FOOTNOTE TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE BASIS FOR THE UNDERLYING ACCOUNTING. THE AMOUNTS FOR

BUY/SELL CONTRACTS SHOWN ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME SALES AND OTHER

OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, WERE $23,822, $18,650 AND

$14,246, RESPECTIVELY. THESE REVENUE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUY/SELL CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 12

PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003. NEARLY ALL OF THESE

REVENUE AMOUNTS IN EACH PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH BUY/SELL CONTRACTS PERTAIN TO THE COMPANYS

DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

BUY/SELL REVENUE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED IN PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN EACH PERIOD.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM, AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO, CUSTOMERS,

TRADING PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES, HOST GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS,

INSURERS AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE

SIGNIFICANT AND MAY TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS. MOST OF THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS ARE

EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS,

THE COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY OWNED

FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY. AN OBLIGATION MAY

ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CLOSED OR SOLD OR AT NON-CHEVRON SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO FACILITIES

AND SITES WHERE PAST OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE

AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL WORK OR BOTH TO MEET CURRENT STANDARDS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, CHEVRON

ESTIMATED ITS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2005 AT APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION FOR ITS

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE EXPENDITURES WERE $341 MILLION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES AND $979 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVENTION, CONTROL, ABATEMENT OR

ELIMINATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED SITES, AND

THE ABANDONMENT AND RESTORATION OF SITES, WHICH INCLUDES $14 MILLION AND $66 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

FOR UNOCAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS OF 2005.

FOR 2006, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $1.1 BILLION.

THESE CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS AND THE COSTS TO REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR

EXISTING FACILITIES OR AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FUTURE TO: PREVENT, CONTROL, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INTO THE

ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY WITH EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND

RESTORE AREAS DAMAGED BY PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER

DIFFERENT REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE

PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING

TO THE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY

AND JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY

OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE;

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THESE CRITICAL CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH

NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

REVISION AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING

RULES THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC RULES THAT REQUIRE

...GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA (THAT) DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY (RESERVES) TO BE

RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS,

I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. REFER TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY

INFORMATION, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-70, FOR THE CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND TO TABLE VII,

CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FROM PROVED RESERVES

ON PAGE FS-78 FOR ESTIMATES OF PROVED-RESERVE VALUES FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER

31, 2003 THROUGH 2005, WHICH WERE BASED ON YEAR-END PRICES AT THE TIME. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34, INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE ESTIMATES OF CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE TIMING OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES, ON PAGE FS-23, INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS UNDER

WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES. THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO ESTIMATES,

UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34. THE

DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED

CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY MANAGEMENT

WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE

COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION PLAN

EXPENSE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND

LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING OPEB EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND

THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES USED IN THE CALCULATION OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

NOTE 21, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-50, INCLUDES INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2005, ON THE COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE AND ON THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL AS ON

THE FUNDED STATUS FOR THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS AT THE END OF 2005 AND 2004.

TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A RIGOROUS

PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE

PERFORMANCE AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS FACTORS. ASSET

ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/ LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE

FS-22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STUDIES. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON UNITED STATES PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WHICH

ACCOUNT FOR 72 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS, HAS REMAINED AT 7.8 PERCENT SINCE

2002.

THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE IN THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS AS

OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY

MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET

VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING THE PENSION EXPENSE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES AVAILABLE ON

HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY SELECTED A 5.5

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE BASED ON MOODYS AA CORPORATE BOND INDEX AND A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING THE

CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT CURVE FOR THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. THE

DISCOUNT RATES AT THE END OF 2004 AND 2003 WERE 5.8 PERCENT AND 6 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE

PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2005 WAS APPROXIMATELY $600

MILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF THE SENSITIVITY OF PENSION EXPENSE TO THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

ASSUMPTION, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

U.S. PENSION PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 53 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION,

WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR 2005 BY APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION. A 1 PERCENT

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THIS SAME PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE FOR

2005 BY APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION. THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES

MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLDS FINANCIAL

MARKETS.

IN 2005, THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS WERE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION (NEARLY $800

MILLION TO THE U.S. PLANS). IN 2006, THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $500

MILLION. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RESULTS, CHANGES IN PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

PENSION EXPENSE IS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DEPENDING UPON

THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE DIFFERENT PLANS, EITHER A LONG-TERM PREPAID ASSET OR A LONG-TERM

LIABILITY IS RECORDED. ANY UNFUNDED ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN EXCESS OF RECORDED

LIABILITIES IS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SEE NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-50, FOR THE PENSION-RELATED BALANCE SHEET EFFECTS AT THE END OF

2005 AND 2004.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE FOR 2005 WAS ABOUT $200 MILLION AND WAS ALSO

RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS MAIN U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN TO

LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTION. FOR CURRENT RETIREES, THE INCREASE IN COMPANY

CONTRIBUTION IS CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT EACH YEAR. FOR FUTURE RETIREES, THE 4 PERCENT CAP WILL BE

EFFECTIVE AT RETIREMENT. FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES BELOW AGE 65 WHOSE CLAIMS EXPERIENCES

ARE COMBINED FOR RATING PURPOSES, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES START WITH 10 PERCENT IN

2006 AND GRADUALLY DROP TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2011 AND BEYOND.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB EXPENSE IN 2005, A

1 PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED

FOR ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYWIDE OPEB OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE DECREASED OPEB EXPENSE BY

APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE

COMPANY ASSESSES ITS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS

OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS, CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND,

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED PROVED

RESERVE QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON

HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION PROFILES AND THE OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL

MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED

PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

THE AMOUNT AND INCOME STATEMENT CLASSIFICATION OF MAJOR IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E FOR THE THREE

YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMMENTARY ON THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ELSEWHERE

IN THIS DISCUSSION. AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS IS NOT PRACTICABLE,

GIVEN THE BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE

ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED TO IMPAIR ANY

ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS, WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN NUMBER

OF OTHER ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AS

WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES, ARE

FS-23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECORDED TO THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE

INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT

FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS

MARKET VALUE. DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD OR

THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES THAT NO WRITE-DOWN

IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SIGNIFICANT

DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR ANY SINGLE FIELD OR

CONCESSION, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET

REMAINS RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN ANY

PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND IF THE

ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

IS REQUIRED. SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS DISPOSED

OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY BECOME IMPAIRED IF A

DECISION WAS MADE TO SELL SUCH ASSETS, THAT IS, THE ASSET IS HELD FOR SALE, AND THE ESTIMATED

PROCEEDS LESS COSTS TO SELL WERE LESS THAN THE ASSOCIATED CARRYING VALUES.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  PURCHASE-PRICE ALLOCATION

ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS REQUIRES THE ALLOCATION OF THE COMPANYS PURCHASE PRICE TO THE VARIOUS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES. THE COMPANY USES ALL

AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO MAKE THESE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATIONS, AND FOR MAJOR ACQUISITIONS, MAY HIRE

AN INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL FIRM TO ASSIST IN MAKING FAIR-VALUE ESTIMATES. IN SOME INSTANCES,

ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH

AN ASSET MIGHT HAVE TO BE USED IN DETERMINING ITS FAIR VALUE. ACTUAL TIMING AND AMOUNT OF NET CASH

FLOWS FROM REVENUES AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THAT ASSET OVER TIME MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE

INITIAL ESTIMATES, AND IF THE TIMING IS DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY OR IF THE NET CASH FLOWS DECLINE

SIGNIFICANTLY, THE ASSET COULD BECOME IMPAIRED.

GOODWILL

WHEN ACQUIRED AS PART OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION, GOODWILL IS NOT SUBJECT TO

AMORTIZATION. AS REQUIRED BY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

THE COMPANY WILL TEST SUCH GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT

LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE

GOODWILL ARISING FROM THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2, BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-36.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING

LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. ACTUAL COSTS CAN

FREQUENTLY VARY FROM ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF

CLAIMS AND LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS, OPINIONS

ON CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY, LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION;

THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE CONTAMINATION; AND

IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A LIABILITY IS RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES IF

MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECORDS

THESE LOSSES AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. REFER TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS DISCUSSION FOR THE EFFECT

ON EARNINGS FROM LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND TAX

MATTERS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN

USED IN RECORDING THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT

MUST BE ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE

OUTCOMES, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF CHEVRON CORPORATIONS 2005 AND 2004 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

AND AN AUDIT OF ITS 2003 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE

PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER

ITEM 15(A)(1) OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL

POSITION OF CHEVRON CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, AND THE

RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX

APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH

THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE

BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-59 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE

COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO

OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT RECEIPTS

AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT

AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

CONDITIONS OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

CHEVRON MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL

AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY

INTEGRATED PETROLEUM AND CHEMICALS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CHEVRON HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES

INVOLVING POWER GENERATION, GEOTHERMAL PRODUCTION, AND THE MINING OF COAL AND OTHER MINERALS.

COLLECTIVELY, THESE COMPANIES CONDUCT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN APPROXIMATELY 180 COUNTRIES.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND ALSO MARKETING NATURAL GAS. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

(DOWNSTREAM) OPERATIONS RELATE TO REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND THE MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR.

CHEMICAL OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR

INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT OIL ADDITIVES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES SUBJECT THE

COMPANY TO CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT

IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM SEVERE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY CONCENTRATION OF ITS

ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OWNED AND VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS JOINT

VENTURES AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON A PROPORTIONATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS IN AND

ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY

20 PERCENT TO 50 PERCENT OR FOR WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT CONTROL

OVER POLICY DECISIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT

RESULTS IN CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE AFFILIATES

EQUITY CURRENTLY IN INCOME. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR THESE GAINS AND LOSSES.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE INVESTMENT MAY BE BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND

THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A

DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE DURATION AND EXTENT OF

THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO

RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY

IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE. THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS

NOT CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF

OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE

ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE

COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE

AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED QUARTERLY WHEN APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS ACTIVITY IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS

INTENDED TO MANAGE THE FINANCIAL RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITY, GENERALLY LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY

MAY ELECT TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, GENERALLY BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED

IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR THE COMPANYS TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES, GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. INTEREST RATE SWAPS  HEDGING A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT  ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE

AND ARE IN HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH

MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO AND HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS. THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND

ARE MARKED-TO-MARKET, WITH

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED

ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST,

USING A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW MARKET.

MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND OTHER INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS, RELATED PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT,

PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS IN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AND RELATED ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION (ARO) ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED PENDING

DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED PROVED

RESERVES REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ARE ALSO CAPITALIZED FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT HAVE FOUND CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES EVEN IF THE RESERVES CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED WHEN THE DRILLING

IS COMPLETED, PROVIDED THE EXPLORATORY WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY

ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND THE COMPANY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE

RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. ALL OTHER EXPLORATORY WELLS AND

COSTS ARE EXPENSED. REFER TO NOTE 20, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-49, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF

ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, INCLUDING PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES,

ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE OF OR

A PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A LONG-LIVED ASSET OR

ASSET GROUP WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER THAN THE END OF ITS

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW ON AN

INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION

OR FIELD BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IN THE REFINING, MARKETING, TRANSPORTATION AND CHEMICAL AREAS,

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS ARE GENERALLY DONE ON THE BASIS OF A REFINERY, A PLANT, A MARKETING AREA OR

MARKETING ASSETS BY COUNTRY. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSET WITH ITS FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET BOOK VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE

LESS COST TO SELL, THE ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND ADJUSTED TO THE LOWER VALUE.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143),

IN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A

LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS

A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 24, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-59, RELATING TO ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FAS 143.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY

INDIVIDUAL FIELD AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR CAPITALIZED

COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL

FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF

CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR COAL ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD AS THE PROVED RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS OF ALL OTHER

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE

DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES; THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO

AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS

ARE RECORDED AS EXPENSES AND FROM SALES AS OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE, REPAIRS

AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AS

REQUIRED BY FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

THE COMPANY WILL TEST SUCH GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL FOR IMPAIRMENT

ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD

MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE

GOODWILL ARISING FROM THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2, BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-36.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS

OR TO CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS

OR CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL

ASSESSMENTS OR CLEANUPS OR BOTH ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE

COMPANYS U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE ACCRUAL IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY

THAT A FUTURE REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL BE REQUIRED. FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND COAL

PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS MADE, FOLLOWING FAS 143.

REFER TO NOTE 24, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-59, FOR A DISCUSSION OF FAS 143.

FOR FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A

LIABILITY FOR ITS DESIGNATED SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER

PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE GROSS AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF

FUTURE COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS AND THE

COMPANYS OWN INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR

REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES, BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR

ARE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL,

PETROLEUM AND CHEMICALS PRODUCTS AND ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE

CUSTOMER, NET OF ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION FROM PROPERTIES IN WHICH CHEVRON HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY

RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE COMPANYS NET WORKING INTEREST (ENTITLEMENT METHOD). REFER TO NOTE

15, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-46, FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT,

(FAS 123R) FOR ITS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY

ACCOUNTED FOR THESE PLANS UNDER THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25, 

NOTE 2.

ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL CORPORATION

ON AUGUST 10, 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED UNOCAL CORPORATION (UNOCAL), AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND

GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY. UNOCALS PRINCIPAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS ARE IN NORTH AMERICA

AND ASIA, INCLUDING THE CASPIAN REGION. ALSO LOCATED IN ASIA ARE UNOCALS GEOTHERMAL ENERGY AND

ELECTRICAL POWER BUSINESSES. OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN PROPRIETARY AND COMMON

CARRIER PIPELINES, NATURAL GAS STORAGE FACILITIES AND MINING OPERATIONS.

THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF UNOCAL WAS APPROXIMATELY $17,300, WHICH INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY

$7,500 CASH, 169 MILLION SHARES OF CHEVRON COMMON STOCK VALUED AT OR ABOUT $9,600, AND $200 FOR

STOCK OPTIONS ON APPROXIMATELY 5 MILLION SHARES AND MERGER-RELATED FEES. THE VALUE OF THE COMMON

SHARES WAS BASED ON THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE FOR A 5-DAY PERIOD BEGINNING TWO DAYS BEFORE THE TERMS

OF THE ACQUISITION WERE FINALIZED AND ANNOUNCED ON JULY 19, 2005. THE ISSUED SHARES REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 7.5 PERCENT OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AUGUST 10

CLOSE. THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS AT THE ACQUISITION DATE WAS DETERMINED USING THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL.

A THIRD-PARTY APPRAISAL FIRM HAS BEEN ENGAGED TO ASSIST THE COMPANY IN THE PROCESS OF

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES

ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL CORPORATION  CONTINUED

OF UNOCALS TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS. INITIAL FAIR-VALUE ESTIMATES WERE MADE IN THE

THIRD QUARTER 2005, AND ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE INITIAL ESTIMATES WERE MADE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THE VALUATION PROCESS WILL BE FINALIZED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2006. ONCE

COMPLETED, THE ASSOCIATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WILL ALSO BE ADJUSTED. NO SIGNIFICANT

INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE

PRICE IN THE TABLE BELOW. NO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS WERE ACQUIRED.

THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE RULES OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

THE $4,700 OF GOODWILL IS ASSIGNED TO THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT. NONE OF THE GOODWILL IS

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE GOODWILL REPRESENTS BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION THAT ARE

ADDITIONAL TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OTHER NET ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE

ACQUISITION AND THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO A UNOCAL PURCHASE PRICE THAT RESULTED IN

THE RECOGNITION OF GOODWILL WERE AS FOLLOWS.



THE GOING CONCERN ELEMENT OF THE UNOCAL BUSINESSES, WHICH PRESENTS THE OPPORTUNITY

TO EARN A HIGHER RATE OF RETURN ON THE ASSEMBLED COLLECTION OF NET ASSETS THAN WOULD BE

EXPECTED IF THOSE ASSETS WERE ACQUIRED SEPARATELY. THESE BENEFITS INCLUDE UPSTREAM GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC, GULF OF MEXICO AND CASPIAN REGIONS. SOME OF THESE

AREAS CONTAIN OPERATIONS THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO CHEVRONS, AND THE ACQUISITION IS

CONSISTENT WITH CHEVRONS LONG-TERM STRATEGIES TO GROW PROFITABILITY IN ITS CORE UPSTREAM

AREAS, BUILD NEW LEGACY POSITIONS AND COMMERCIALIZE THE COMPANYS LARGE UNDEVELOPED

NATURAL GAS RESOURCE BASE.



COST SAVINGS THAT CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE CAPTURE OF OPERATIONAL SYNERGIES. THE

OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST SAVINGS INCLUDE THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATE FACILITIES AND

SERVICES, HIGH-GRADING OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COMBINED PORTFOLIO AND THE

SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES OF THE TWO COMPANIES.

GOODWILL RECORDED IN THE ACQUISITION IS NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION, BUT WILL BE TESTED

PERIODICALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AS REQUIRED BY FASB STATEMENT NO. 142,

ASSETS.

NOTE 7.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRON IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS RELATED TO PRICE

VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND REFINERY

FEEDSTOCKS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ON A PORTION OF

ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING: FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF

CRUDE OIL; FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR COMPANY REFINERIES; CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS

INVENTORIES; AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS TO SELL NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS. THE COMPANY

ALSO USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY USES INTERNATIONAL SWAPS DEALERS ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS TO GOVERN DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK. DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE COMPANY IS

ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTION WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY AND

ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET MARKED-TO-MARKET

EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND

IS A REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY ALSO USES OTHER NETTING

AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES  NET AND DEFERRED

CREDITS AND OTHER NONCURRENT OBLIGATIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED AS EITHER SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES OR PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND

PRODUCTS, WHEREAS TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS OTHER INCOME. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE

REPORTED UNDER OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY WITH TERMS

OF 180 DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE

REVENUE AND ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND

LEASE COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED AS OTHER

INCOME. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED UNDER OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF CASH FLOWS.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL

STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET CASH

SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS

CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST

RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON

THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED DIRECTLY IN

INCOME AS PART OF INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE REPORTED UNDER OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED EITHER FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR, IF NOT AVAILABLE,

THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE FAIR VALUES REFLECT THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE

BEEN RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE SETTLED AT YEAR-END.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS  CONTINUED

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $7,424 AND $5,815 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $7,945 AND $6,444 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF $1,400 AND $1,665 HAD ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES OF $(10) AND $36 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND U.S. DOLLAR MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN DOMESTIC AND

OFFSHORE PORTFOLIOS. EURODOLLAR BONDS, FLOATING-RATE NOTES, TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE

THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS HELD. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD FAIR VALUES OF $8,995

AND $8,789 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE BALANCES, $7,894 AND $7,338 AT THE

RESPECTIVE YEAR-ENDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES UNDER 90

DAYS. THE REMAINDER, CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES, HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY

2 YEARS.

FOR THE FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THERE WAS NOT A MATERIAL CHANGE

IN MARKET RISK FROM THAT PRESENTED IN 2004.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE

PLACED WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED

INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

RISK. SIMILAR STANDARDS OF DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

COUNTERPARTIES IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE

DISPERSED AMONG THE COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS.

WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT, REQUIRING LETTERS OF

CREDIT IS A PRINCIPAL METHOD USED TO SUPPORT SALES TO CUSTOMERS.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HELD AN INVESTMENT

IN $400 FACE VALUE OF DYNEGY SERIES C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, WITH A STATED MATURITY DATE OF

2033. THE STOCK WAS RECORDED AT ITS FAIR VALUE, WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $360 AT THE END OF 2005.

TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PREFERRED STOCK ARE REPORTED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, IF ANY FUTURE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, A CHARGE AGAINST INCOME IN THE PERIOD WOULD BE RECORDED. DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON THE

PREFERRED STOCK ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME EACH PERIOD.

NOTE 8.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ALTHOUGH EACH SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN AFFAIRS, CHEVRON CORPORATION

MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES AND THEIR AFFILIATES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE

INVESTMENTS ARE GROUPED AS FOLLOWS: UPSTREAM  EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION; DOWNSTREAM  REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION; CHEMICALS; AND ALL OTHER. THE FIRST THREE OF THESE GROUPINGS

REPRESENT THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND OPERATING SEGMENTS AS DEFINED IN FAS 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION.

THE SEGMENTS ARE SEPARATELY MANAGED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES UNDER A STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES

SEGMENT MANAGERS WHO REPORT TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) (TERMS AS

DEFINED IN FAS 131). THE CODM IS THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, A COMMITTEE OF SENIOR OFFICERS THAT INCLUDES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THAT IN TURN REPORTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OF CHEVRON CORPORATION.

THE OPERATING SEGMENTS REPRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN FAS 131 TERMS THAT

ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES (A) FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE

OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM, WHICH MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE

ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENTS AND TO ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL

INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

SEGMENT MANAGERS FOR THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO AND MAINTAIN REGULAR

CONTACT WITH THE COMPANYS CODM TO DISCUSS THE SEGMENTS OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. THE CODM APPROVES ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS AT THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT

LEVEL, AS WELL AS REVIEWS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY FUNDING FOR MAJOR PROJECTS AND APPROVES MAJOR

CHANGES TO THE ANNUAL CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY BUDGETS. HOWEVER, BUSINESS-UNIT MANAGERS WITHIN THE

OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECISIONS RELATING TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND

ALL OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH DAILY OPERATIONS. COMPANY OFFICERS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUAL MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND PARTICIPATE IN OTHER

COMMITTEES FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN ACTING AS THE CODM.

ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN DYNEGY, MINING OPERATIONS OF COAL AND

OTHER MINERALS, POWER GENERATION BUSINESSES, WORLDWIDE CASH MANAGEMENT AND DEBT FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS, INSURANCE OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES AND

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY COUNTRY OF OPERATION IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ITS COUNTRY OF

DOMICILE. OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED AS INTERNATIONAL (OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES).

SEGMENT EARNINGS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ON AN

AFTER-TAX BASIS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF DEBT FINANCING INTEREST EXPENSE OR INVESTMENT

INTEREST INCOME, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THE COMPANY ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. CORPORATE

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND ASSETS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING

SEGMENTS ARE BILLED FOR THE DIRECT USE OF CORPORATE SERVICES. NONBILLABLE COSTS REMAIN AT THE

CORPORATE LEVEL IN

LITIGATION

CHEVRON AND MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY HAVE USED METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL

ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE ADDITIVE. CHEVRON IS A PARTY TO MORE THAN 70 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH INVOLVE NUMEROUS OTHER PETROLEUM MARKETERS AND REFINERS, RELATED TO THE USE OF

MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES AND THE ALLEGED SEEPAGE OF MTBE INTO GROUNDWATER. RESOLUTION

OF THESE ACTIONS MAY ULTIMATELY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON

THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY

DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE MTBE

IN THE MANUFACTURE OF GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES.

NOTE 10.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

CERTAIN NONCANCELABLE LEASES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CAPITAL LEASES, AND THE LEASED ASSETS ARE

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION COSTS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A RESTRUCTURING AND

REORGANIZATION PROGRAM AS PART OF THE EFFORT TO CAPTURE THE SYNERGIES OF THE COMBINED COMPANIES.

THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2006 AND IS AIMED AT

ELIMINATING REDUNDANT OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATING OFFICES AND FACILITIES, AND SHARING COMMON

SERVICES AND FUNCTIONS.

AS PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION, APPROXIMATELY 700 POSITIONS HAVE BEEN

PRELIMINARILY IDENTIFIED FOR ELIMINATION. MOST OF THE POSITIONS ARE IN THE UNITED STATES AND

RELATE PRIMARILY TO CORPORATE AND UPSTREAM EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. BY YEAR-END

2005, APPROXIMATELY 250 OF THESE EMPLOYEES HAD BEEN TERMINATED.

AN ACCRUAL OF $106 WAS ESTABLISHED AS PART OF THE PURCHASE-PRICE ALLOCATION FOR UNOCAL.

PAYMENTS AGAINST THE ACCRUAL IN 2005 WERE $62. THE BALANCE AT YEAR-END 2005 WAS CLASSIFIED AS A

CURRENT LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACCRUAL MAY OCCUR IN FUTURE

PERIODS AS THE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE FINALIZED AND ESTIMATES ARE REFINED.

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2005, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED COMMENT

LETTERS TO CHEVRON AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY REQUESTING DISCLOSURE OF

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS. UNDER A BUY/SELL CONTRACT, A COMPANY

AGREES TO BUY A SPECIFIC QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY TO BE DELIVERED AT A SPECIFIC

LOCATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY AGREEING TO SELL A SPECIFIED QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF A COMMODITY AT

A DIFFERENT LOCATION TO THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. PHYSICAL DELIVERY OCCURS FOR EACH SIDE OF THE

TRANSACTION, AND THE RISK AND REWARD OF OWNERSHIP ARE EVIDENCED BY TITLE TRANSFER, ASSUMPTION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL RISK, TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULING, CREDIT RISK AND RISK OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THE

COUNTERPARTY. BOTH PARTIES SETTLE EACH SIDE OF THE BUY/SELL THROUGH SEPARATE INVOICING.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ENTERS INTO BUY/SELL CONTRACTS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, ASSOCIATED WITH CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS. FOR CRUDE OIL, THESE

CONTRACTS ARE USED TO FACILITATE THE COMPANYS CRUDE OIL MARKETING ACTIVITY, WHICH INCLUDES THE

PURCHASE AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION, FULFILLMENT OF THE COMPANYS SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AS TO

PHYSICAL DELIVERY LOCATION AND CRUDE OIL SPECIFICATIONS, AND PURCHASE OF CRUDE OIL TO SUPPLY THE

COMPANYS REFINING

SYSTEM. FOR REFINED PRODUCTS, BUY/SELL ARRANGEMENTS ARE USED TO HELP FULFILL THE COMPANYS

SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME THE SAME AS FOR A MONETARY TRANSACTION  PURCHASES ARE REPORTED AS PURCHASED CRUDE OIL

AND PRODUCTS; SALES ARE REPORTED AS SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES. THE SEC RAISED THE ISSUE

AS TO WHETHER THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS SHOULD BE SHOWN NET ON THE INCOME STATEMENT AND

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 29,

ACCOUNTING

FOR NONMONETARY TRANSACTIONS

(APB 29). THE COMPANY UNDERSTANDS THAT OTHERS IN THE OIL AND GAS

INDUSTRY MAY REPORT BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS ON A NET BASIS IN THE INCOME STATEMENT RATHER THAN GROSS.

THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) OF THE FASB DELIBERATED THIS TOPIC AS ISSUE NO. 04-13,

ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY.

AT ITS SEPTEMBER 2005

MEETING, THE EITF REACHED CONSENSUS THAT TWO OR MORE LEGALLY SEPARATE EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS WITH

THE SAME COUNTERPARTY, INCLUDING BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS, SHOULD BE COMBINED AND CONSIDERED AS A

SINGLE ARRANGEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING APB 29 WHEN THE TRANSACTIONS WERE ENTERED INTO IN

CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER. EITF 04-13 WAS RATIFIED BY THE FASB IN SEPTEMBER 2005 AND IS

EFFECTIVE

FOR NEW ARRANGEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS OR RENEWALS OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS, ENTERED INTO

BEGINNING ON OR AFTER APRIL 1, 2006, WHICH WILL BE THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF

THIS STANDARD. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY WILL REPORT THE NET EFFECT OF BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS INSTEAD OF REPORTING THE

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ARRANGEMENTS AS SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES AND THE COSTS

AS PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS.

WHILE THIS ISSUE WAS UNDER DELIBERATION BY THE EITF, THE SEC

STAFF DIRECTED CHEVRON AND OTHER COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT THE

AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUY/SELL CONTRACTS AND TO DISCUSS IN A FOOTNOTE TO THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS THE BASIS FOR THE UNDERLYING ACCOUNTING. THE AMOUNTS FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS SHOWN ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2005, WERE $23,822, $18,650 AND $14,246, RESPECTIVELY. THESE REVENUE AMOUNTS

ASSOCIATED WITH BUY/SELL CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 12 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003. NEARLY ALL OF THESE REVENUE AMOUNTS IN EACH PERIOD ASSOCIATED

WITH BUY/SELL CONTRACTS PERTAIN TO THE COMPANYS DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THESE BUY/SELL REVENUE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED IN PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN EACH PERIOD.

$170 ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF FAS 143 IN 2003 AND THE RELATED CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING METHOD IN 2003.

IN 2005, THE BEFORE-TAX INCOME FOR U.S. OPERATIONS, INCLUDING RELATED CORPORATE AND OTHER

CHARGES, WAS $6,733, COMPARED WITH A BEFORE-TAX INCOME OF $7,776 AND $5,664 IN 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, BEFORE-TAX INCOME WAS $18,464, $12,775 AND $7,012 IN 2005, 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY. U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX

EXPENSE WAS REDUCED BY $289, $176 AND $196 IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, FOR BUSINESS

TAX CREDITS.

IN 2005, THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF NET TOTAL DEFERRED TAXES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

$5,000 FROM THE AMOUNT REPORTED IN 2004. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET DEFERRED

TAXES ARISING THROUGH THE UNOCAL ACQUISITION.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATED TO FOREIGN TAX CREDITS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $1,000 BETWEEN 2004

AND 2005. THE ASSOCIATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE ALSO INCREASED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AMOUNT. THE

CHANGE IN BOTH CATEGORIES REFLECTED THE ADDITION OF UNOCAL AMOUNTS AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF THE

COMPANYS TAX ELECTION IN 2005 FOR CERTAIN HERITAGE-CHEVRON INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS.

THE OVERALL VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, TAX LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS EXIST IN MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WHEREAS SOME OF THESE TAX LOSS CARRY FORWARDS DO

NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE, OTHERS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES FROM 2006 THROUGH 2013. FOREIGN TAX

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY FOR SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE U.S. CONSOLIDATED

TAX RETURN TO RECORD INCOME TAX EXPENSE AS THOUGH THEY FILE SEPARATELY, WITH THE PARENT RECORDING

THE ADJUSTMENT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE EFFECTS OF CONSOLIDATION.

INCOME TAXES ARE NOT ACCRUED FOR UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS THAT HAVE

BEEN OR ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES FOR WHICH NO DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE

FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE REMITTANCES TOTALED $14,317 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF

THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS EARNINGS REINVESTED AS PART OF THE COMPANYS ONGOING INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS.

IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT MIGHT BE PAYABLE ON THE EVENTUAL

REMITTANCE OF SUCH EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL

TAXES ON REMITTANCES OF EARNINGS THAT ARE NOT INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

IN OCTOBER 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF

2004 WAS PASSED INTO LAW. THE ACT PROVIDES A DEDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM QUALIFIED DOMESTIC REFINING AND UPSTREAM PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL BE PHASED IN FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010. FOR THAT

INCOME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NET EFFECT OF THIS PROVISION OF THE ACT TO RESULT IN A DECREASE IN

THE FEDERAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2006 TO APPROXIMATELY 34 PERCENT, BASED ON CURRENT EARNINGS

LEVELS. IN THE LONG TERM, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE NEW DEDUCTION WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE OF

THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO ABOUT 32 PERCENT FOR THAT CATEGORY OF INCOME, BASED ON CURRENT

EARNINGS LEVELS.

FASB STATEMENT NO. 151, INVENTORY COSTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43, CHAPTER 4 (FAS 151)

IN

NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 151, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2006. THE STANDARD AMENDS THE GUIDANCE IN ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 43,

CHAPTER 4,

INVENTORY PRICING,

TO CLARIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR ABNORMAL AMOUNTS OF IDLE FACILITY

EXPENSE, FREIGHT, HANDLING COSTS AND SPOILAGE. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALLOCATION

OF FIXED PRODUCTION OVERHEADS TO THE COSTS OF CONVERSION BE BASED ON THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF THE

PRODUCTION FACILITIES. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

EITF ISSUE NO. 04-6, ACCOUNTING FOR STRIPPING COSTS INCURRED DURING PRODUCTION IN THE MINING

INDUSTRY (ISSUE 04-6)

IN MARCH 2005, THE FASB RATIFIED THE EARLIER EITF CONSENSUS ON ISSUE

04-6, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2006. STRIPPING COSTS ARE COSTS OF REMOVING

OVERBURDEN AND OTHER WASTE MATERIALS TO ACCESS MINERAL DEPOSITS. THE CONSENSUS CALLS FOR STRIPPING

COSTS INCURRED ONCE A MINE GOES INTO PRODUCTION TO BE TREATED AS VARIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS THAT

SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A COMPONENT OF MINERAL INVENTORY COST SUBJECT TO ARB NO. 43,

RESTATEMENT AND

REFER TO NOTE 1, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34, IN THE SECTION PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR

A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR THE COST OF EXPLORATORY WELLS. THE COMPANYS

WHICH AMENDED FAS 19,

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

COMPANIES.

THE COMPANY ELECTED EARLY APPLICATION OF THIS GUIDANCE WITH THE FIRST QUARTER 2005 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FSP FAS 19-1, EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS CONTINUE TO BE CAPITALIZED AFTER

THE COMPLETION OF DRILLING WHEN (A) THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO

JUSTIFY COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND (B) THE ENTERPRISE IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS

INCREASE REFLECT THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE UNOCAL BENEFIT PLANS AT JULY 31, 2005, DUE TO THE

ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL.

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A RIGOROUS PROCESS TO DETERMINE

ESTIMATES OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN

BY ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS, AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE, ADVICE FROM

EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS AND THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET-CLASS RISK FACTORS. ASSET

ALLOCATIONS ARE PERIODICALLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE

STUDIES.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SINCE 2002

FOR U.S. PLANS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR 72 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.8 PERCENT.

THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS OF THE MAJOR U.S. PENSION PLAN USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE

YEAR-END MEASUREMENT DATE, AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S.

ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE

EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF

THE YEAR. FOR OTHER PLANS, MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED IN CALCULATING

THE PENSION EXPENSE.

DISCOUNT RATE

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE REFLECT THE PREVAILING RATES

AVAILABLE ON HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY

FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

CARE COST TREND RATES START WITH 10 PERCENT IN 2006 AND GRADUALLY DECLINE TO 5 PERCENT FOR 2011 AND

BEYOND. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES STARTED

WITH 9.5 PERCENT IN 2005 AND GRADUALLY DECLINED TO 4.8 PERCENT FOR 2010 AND BEYOND. IN BOTH

MEASUREMENTS, INCREASES IN THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CAPPED AT 4 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AT

RETIREMENT.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR

THE PENSION PLANS INVEST PRIMARILY IN ASSET CATEGORIES WITH SUFFICIENT SIZE, LIQUIDITY

AND COST EFFICIENCY TO PERMIT INVESTMENTS OF REASONABLE SIZE. THE PENSION PLANS INVEST IN ASSET

CATEGORIES THAT PROVIDE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS AND ARE EASILY MEASURED. TO ASSESS THE PLANS

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE CHEVRON BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED THE

FOLLOWING APPROVED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES: EQUITIES 4070 PERCENT, FIXED INCOME 2060 PERCENT,

REAL ESTATE 015 PERCENT AND OTHER 05 PERCENT. THE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ALSO

HAVE ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES THAT VARY BY EACH PLAN. ACTUAL ASSET

ALLOCATION WITHIN APPROVED RANGES IS BASED ON A VARIETY OF CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

AND CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC ASSET CATEGORY RISK.

EQUITIES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNT OF $13 AND $8 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE OTHER ASSET CATEGORY INCLUDES MINIMAL INVESTMENTS

IN PRIVATE-EQUITY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS

IN 2005, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $794 AND $228

TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2006, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $300 AND $200 TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS,

RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PLAN-INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN

PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY

ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN

OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PAYING OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $220 IN 2006,

AS COMPARED WITH $226 PAID IN 2005.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF CHEVRON AND CERTAIN OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP).

CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR THE ESIP REPRESENT THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN, WHICH ARE

FUNDED EITHER THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH THE

RELEASE OF COMMON STOCK HELD IN THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (LESOP), WHICH IS

DISCUSSED BELOW. TOTAL COMPANY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE ESIP WERE

$145, $139 AND $136 IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COST WAS REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF

SHARES RELEASED FROM THE LESOP TOTALING $(4), $(138) AND $(23) IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING AMOUNTS, TOTALING $141, $1 AND $113 IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENT OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

WITHIN THE CHEVRON EMPLOYEE SAVINGS INVESTMENT PLAN (ESIP) IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). IN 1989,

CHEVRON ESTABLISHED A LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (LESOP) AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE

ESOP. THE LESOP PROVIDES PARTIAL PREFUNDING OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE COMMITMENTS TO THE ESIP.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE COMPANY REPORTS COMPENSATION EXPENSE EQUAL TO LESOP DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS LESS

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED AND USED BY THE LESOP FOR DEBT SERVICE. INTEREST ACCRUED ON LESOP DEBT IS

RECORDED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. DIVIDENDS PAID ON LESOP SHARES ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF

RETAINED EARNINGS. ALL LESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE COMPUTATIONS.

TOTAL EXPENSES (CREDITS) RECORDED FOR THE LESOP WERE $94, $(29) AND $24 IN 2005, 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING $18, $23 AND $28 OF INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO LESOP DEBT AND A

CHARGE (CREDIT) TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $76, $(52) AND $(4).

OF THE DIVIDENDS PAID ON THE LESOP SHARES, $55, $52 AND $61 WERE USED IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY, TO SERVICE LESOP DEBT. INCLUDED IN THE 2004 AMOUNT WAS A REPAYMENT OF DEBT ENTERED

INTO IN 1999 TO PAY INTEREST ON THE ESOP DEBT. INTEREST EXPENSE ON THIS DEBT WAS RECOGNIZED AND

REPORTED AS LESOP INTEREST EXPENSE IN 1999. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2005 AND

2003 OF $98 AND $26, RESPECTIVELY, TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE IN EXCESS OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY

THE LESOP. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED IN 2004 AS DIVIDENDS RECEIVED BY THE LESOP WERE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY LESOP DEBT SERVICE.

SHARES HELD IN THE LESOP ARE RELEASED AND ALLOCATED TO THE ACCOUNTS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS BASED

ON DEBT SERVICE DEEMED TO BE PAID IN THE YEAR IN PROPORTION TO THE TOTAL OF CURRENT-YEAR AND

BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS

TEXACO ESTABLISHED A BENEFIT PLAN TRUST FOR FUNDING

OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT PLANS. AT YEAR-END 2005, THE TRUST CONTAINED 14.2 MILLION

SHARES OF CHEVRON TREASURY STOCK. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

BENEFIT PLANS. THE TRUST WILL SELL THE SHARES OR USE THE DIVIDENDS FROM THE SHARES TO PAY BENEFITS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT PAY SUCH BENEFITS. THE TRUSTEE WILL VOTE THE

SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TRUSTS BENEFICIARIES. THE SHARES HELD IN THE TRUST

ARE NOT CONSIDERED OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS-PER-SHARE PURPOSES UNTIL DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD BY THE

TRUST IN PAYMENT OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

UNOCAL ESTABLISHED VARIOUS GRANTOR TRUSTS TO FUND OBLIGATIONS UNDER SOME OF ITS BENEFIT

PLANS, INCLUDING THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLANS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, TRUST ASSETS TOTALED $130 AND WERE INVESTED PRIMARILY IN INTEREST-EARNING

ACCOUNTS.

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLANS

CHEVRON HAS TWO INCENTIVE PLANS, THE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN

(MIP) AND THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), FOR OFFICERS AND OTHER REGULAR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WHO HOLD POSITIONS OF SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY. THE MIP IS AN

ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PLAN THAT LINKS AWARDS TO PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CASH

AWARDS MAY BE DEFERRED BY THE RECIPIENTS BY CONVERSION TO STOCK UNITS OR OTHER INVESTMENT FUND

ALTERNATIVES.

AGGREGATE CHARGES TO EXPENSE FOR MIP WERE $155, $147 AND $125 IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP CONSIST OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

WHICH ARE DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 22 BELOW.

OTHER INCENTIVE PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, OTHER

THAN THOSE COVERED BY MIP AND LTIP, WITH AN ANNUAL CASH BONUS IF THE COMPANY ACHIEVES CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND SAFETY GOALS. ADDITIONALLY, IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

REMAINING PRO-RATED CASH BONUSES UNDER THE UNOCAL ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN. CHARGES FOR THE PROGRAMS

WERE $324, $339 AND $151 IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 22.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) STATEMENT NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT,

(FAS 123R) FOR ITS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

PLANS. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR THESE PLANS UNDER THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES,

(APB 25) AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY FAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD AND, ACCORDINGLY, RESULTS

FOR PRIOR PERIODS HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED. REFER TO NOTE 1, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34, FOR THE PRO

FORMA EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR-VALUE

RECOGNITION OF FAS 123 FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF FAS 123R AND THE ACTUAL EFFECT ON NET

INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR PERIODS AFTER ADOPTION OF FAS 123R.

FOR 2005, COMPENSATION EXPENSE CHARGED AGAINST INCOME FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR STOCK OPTIONS

WAS $65 ($42 AFTER TAX). IN ADDITION, COMPENSATION EXPENSE CHARGED AGAINST INCOME FOR STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS, PERFORMANCE UNITS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WAS $59 ($39 AFTER TAX), $65 ($42

AFTER TAX) AND $25 ($16 AFTER TAX) FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CAPITALIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

CASH RECEIVED FROM OPTION EXERCISES UNDER ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR 2005, 2004

AND 2003 WAS $297, $385 AND $32, RESPECTIVELY. ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTIONS

FROM OPTION EXERCISES WAS $71, $49 AND $6 FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION  CONTINUED

CASH PAID TO SETTLE PERFORMANCE UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS WAS $110, $23 AND $11

FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PAID IN 2005 INCLUDED $73 MILLION FOR UNOCAL AWARDS

PAID UNDER CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PLAN PROVISIONS.

AT ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THE IMPACT OF MEASURING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AT FAIR VALUE

INSTEAD OF INTRINSIC VALUE RESULTED IN AN INSIGNIFICANT CHARGE AGAINST INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER

2005. FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, FAS 123R REQUIRED THAT UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION AMOUNTS

PRESENTED IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLAN TRUST ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET BE

RECLASSIFIED AGAINST THE APPROPRIATE EQUITY ACCOUNTS. THIS RESULTED IN A RECLASSIFICATION OF $7

TO CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF PAR VALUE.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THE COMPANY PRESENTED ALL

TAX BENEFITS OF DEDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. FAS 123R REQUIRES THE CASH FLOW RESULTING FROM THE

TAX DEDUCTIONS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED FOR THOSE OPTIONS (EXCESS TAX BENEFITS) TO BE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING CASH FLOWS. REFER TO NOTE 3, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-37, FOR

INFORMATION ON EXCESS TAX BENEFITS.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE FASB ISSUED A STAFF POSITION FAS 123R-3 (FSP FAS 123R-3),

TRANSITION

ELECTION RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS,

WHICH PROVIDES A

ONE-TIME TRANSITION ELECTION FOR COMPANIES TO FOLLOW IN CALCULATING THE BEGINNING BALANCE OF THE

POOL OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND A SIMPLIFIED METHOD TO DETERMINE

THE SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON THE POOL OF EMPLOYEE AWARDS THAT ARE FULLY VESTED AND OUTSTANDING UPON THE

ADOPTION OF FAS 123R. UNDER THE FSP, THE COMPANY MUST DECIDE BY NOVEMBER 2006 WHETHER TO MAKE THIS

ONE-TIME TRANSITION ELECTION, WHICH MAY PROVIDE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF IN CALCULATING THE

FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF STOCK OPTION ISSUANCES. WHETHER OR NOT THE ONE-TIME ELECTION IS MADE, THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

IN THE DISCUSSION BELOW, THE REFERENCES TO SHARE PRICE AND NUMBER OF SHARES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED

FOR THE TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT IN SEPTEMBER 2004.

CHEVRON LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)

AWARDS UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION

RIGHTS, PERFORMANCE UNITS AND NON-STOCK GRANTS. FOR A 10-YEAR PERIOD AFTER APRIL 2004, NO MORE THAN

160 MILLION SHARES MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE LTIP, AND NO MORE THAN 64 MILLION OF THOSE SHARES MAY BE

IN A FORM OTHER THAN A STOCK OPTION, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT OR AWARD REQUIRING FULL PAYMENT FOR

SHARES BY THE AWARD RECIPIENT.

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP EXTEND FOR 10 YEARS FROM

GRANT DATE. EFFECTIVE WITH OPTIONS GRANTED IN JUNE 2002, ONE-THIRD OF EACH AWARD VESTS ON THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE

OF GRANT. PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE, OPTIONS GRANTED BY CHEVRON VESTED ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF

GRANT. PERFORMANCE UNITS GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP EXTEND FOR 3 YEARS FROM GRANT DATE AND ARE SETTLED

IN CASH AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE

TARGETS RELATIVE TO MAJOR COMPETITORS OVER THE PERIOD, AND PAYMENTS ARE INDEXED TO THE COMPANYS

STOCK PRICE.

TEXACO STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (TEXACO SIP)

ON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF TEXACO IN

OCTOBER 2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO CHEVRON OPTIONS.

THESE OPTIONS RETAINED A PROVISION FOR BEING RESTORED, WHICH ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO EXERCISES A

STOCK OPTION TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES EXCHANGED OR WHO HAS SHARES

WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF

SHARES EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE RESTORED OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE

OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE DAY THE RESTORED

OPTION IS GRANTED. APART FROM THE RESTORED OPTIONS, NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE

FORMER TEXACO PLANS.

UNOCAL SHARE-BASED PLANS (UNOCAL PLANS)

ON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL IN

AUGUST 2005, OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER VARIOUS UNOCAL

DURING 2005, 2004 AND 2003 WAS $258, $129 AND $17, RESPECTIVELY.

AT ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO AMORTIZE NEWLY ISSUED GRADED AWARDS ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 123R IMPLEMENTATION

GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, THE COMPANY ACCELERATES THE

VESTING PERIOD FOR RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH VESTING PROVISIONS OF THE

COMPANYS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS FOR AWARDS ISSUED AFTER ADOPTION OF FAS 123R. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THERE WAS $89 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED BEFORE-TAX COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO

NONVESTED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS GRANTED OR RESTORED UNDER THE PLANS. THAT COST IS

EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 2.3 YEARS.

AT JANUARY 1, 2005, THE NUMBER OF LTIP PERFORMANCE UNITS OUTSTANDING WAS EQUIVALENT TO

2,673,482 SHARES. DURING 2005, 709,900 UNITS WERE GRANTED, 1,012,932 UNITS VESTED WITH CASH

PROCEEDS DISTRIBUTED TO RECIPIENTS, AND 24,434 UNITS WERE FORFEITED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, UNITS

OUTSTANDING WERE 2,346,016, AND THE VALUE OF THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS $83.

IN ADDITION, OUTSTANDING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS THAT WERE AWARDED UNDER VARIOUS LTIP AND FORMER

TEXACO AND UNOCAL PROGRAMS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY 800,000 EQUIVALENT SHARES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

A LIABILITY OF $16 WAS RECORDED FOR THESE AWARDS.

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN ADDITION TO THE PLANS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CHEVRON

GRANTED ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTIONS OR EQUIVALENTS IN 1998. THE OPTIONS VESTED AFTER TWO

YEARS, IN FEBRUARY 2000, AND EXPIRE AFTER 10 YEARS, IN FEBRUARY 2008. A TOTAL OF 9,641,000 OPTIONS

WERE AWARDED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $38.15625 PER SHARE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION ON THE DATE OF GRANT WAS ESTIMATED AT $9.54 USING THE

BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL FOR THE PRECEDING 10 YEARS. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE MODEL, BASED ON A

10-YEAR AVERAGE, WERE: A RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 7 PERCENT, A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 4.2 PERCENT, AN

EXPECTED LIFE OF 7 YEARS AND A VOLATILITY OF 24.7 PERCENT.

AT JANUARY 1, 2005, THE NUMBER OF BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING WAS

2,109,504. DURING 2005, EXERCISES OF 397,500 SHARES AND FORFEITURES OF 29,100 SHARES REDUCED

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS TO 1,682,904. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THESE INSTRUMENTS HAD AN AGGREGATE

INTRINSIC VALUE OF $31 AND THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THESE OPTIONS WAS 2.1 YEARS. THE TOTAL

INTRINSIC VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2005 AND 2004 WAS $9 AND $16, RESPECTIVELY.

EXERCISES IN 2003 WERE INSIGNIFICANT.

(TEXACO). CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1991 FOR CHEVRON, 1998 FOR

UNOCAL AND THROUGH 1987 FOR TEXACO. SETTLEMENT OF OPEN TAX YEARS, AS WELL AS TAX ISSUES IN OTHER

COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY, AND IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT,

ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME AND FRANCHISE TAXES FOR ALL YEARS UNDER EXAMINATION OR

SUBJECT TO FUTURE EXAMINATION.

GUARANTEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED, EITHER

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, GUARANTEES OF $985 FOR NOTES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND $294 FOR THIRD PARTIES, AS DESCRIBED BY MAJOR CATEGORY BELOW. THERE ARE NO

MATERIAL AMOUNTS BEING CARRIED AS LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

OF THE $985 GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO AFFILIATES, $806 RELATED TO BORROWINGS FOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THESE GUARANTEES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE LOWER INTEREST

RATES AND GENERALLY COVER THE CONSTRUCTION PERIODS OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. INCLUDED IN THESE

AMOUNTS ARE UNOCAL-RELATED GUARANTEES OF APPROXIMATELY $230 ASSOCIATED WITH A CONSTRUCTION

COMPLETION GUARANTEE FOR THE DEBT FINANCING OF UNOCALS EQUITY INTEREST IN THE BAKU-TBILISI-CEYHAN

(BTC) CRUDE OIL PIPELINE PROJECT. APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THE $806 GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE

BETWEEN 2006 AND 2010, WITH THE REMAINING GUARANTEES EXPIRING BY THE END OF 2015. UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THE GUARANTEE SHOULD AN AFFILIATE BE

IN DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE

PROVISIONS, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE GUARANTEES. THE OTHER GUARANTEES OF $179

REPRESENT OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH PRICING OF POWER-PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANYS COGENERATION AFFILIATES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY MAY BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IF THE AFFILIATES DO NOT PERFORM UNDER THE

AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS FOR RECOURSE TO THIRD PARTIES, AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS

COLLATERAL FOR THESE PRICING GUARANTEES.

OF THE $294 IN GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTIES, APPROXIMATELY $150 RELATED TO

CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO HOST GOVERNMENTS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS. THE REMAINING GUARANTEES OF $144 WERE PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY AS CONDITIONS OF SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INTEREST IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY TO THE GUARANTEED

PARTIES AND IN CONNECTION WITH COMPANY MARKETING PROGRAMS. NO AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THESE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES. ABOUT 85 PERCENT OF THE $294 IN GUARANTEES

EXPIRE BY 2010, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPIRING AFTER 2010. THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS

LOAN OR CONTRACT TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. APPROXIMATELY $85 OF THE

GUARANTEES HAVE RECOURSE PROVISIONS, WHICH ENABLE THE COMPANY TO RECOVER ANY PAYMENTS MADE UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES FROM SECURITIES HELD OVER THE GUARANTEED PARTIES ASSETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, CHEVRON ALSO HAD OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES FOR ABOUT $190 OF EQUILON DEBT

AND LEASES. FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 2002 DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN EQUILON, THE COMPANY

RECEIVED AN INDEMNIFICATION FROM SHELL OIL COMPANY (SHELL) FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE

GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES. APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT

OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THE 2006 THROUGH 2010 PERIOD, WITH THE GUARANTEES OF THE REMAINING AMOUNTS

EXPIRING BY 2019.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF

EQUILON AND MOTIVA TO SHELL AND SAUDI REFINING, INC., IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF

THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IF THE

INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES. WERE THAT TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED

TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UP TO $300. THROUGH THE END OF 2005, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $38

UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INDEMNIFICATION

PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED

DURING THE PERIODS OF TEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO

DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS RELATING TO EQUILON INDEMNITIES MUST BE ASSERTED EITHER AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY

2007, OR NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2009, AND CLAIMS RELATING TO MOTIVA MUST BE ASSERTED NO LATER THAN

FEBRUARY 2012. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF

POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED ANY LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER

THESE INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY POSTS NO ASSETS AS COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER THE

INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED

FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY APPLICABLE INCIDENT.

IN THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, THE COMPANY ASSUMED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS OF UNOCALS 76 PRODUCTS COMPANY BUSINESS THAT

EXISTED PRIOR TO ITS SALE IN 1997. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM LIMIT

ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY; HOWEVER, THE PURCHASER SHARES CERTAIN

COSTS UNDER THIS INDEMNITY UP TO AN AGGREGATE CAP OF $200. CLAIMS RELATING TO THESE INDEMNITIES

MUST BE ASSERTED BY APRIL 2022. THROUGH THE END OF 2005,

APPROXIMATELY $113 HAD BEEN APPLIED TO THE CAP, WHICH INCLUDES PAYMENTS MADE BY EITHER UNOCAL

OR CHEVRON TOTALING $80.

SECURITIZATION

THE COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN

ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES). AT DECEMBER

31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY $1,200, REPRESENTING ABOUT 7 PERCENT OF CHEVRONS TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLES BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED. CHEVRONS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THESE

SECURITIZATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS APPROXIMATELY $60. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT OF

ACCELERATING CHEVRONS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SPES EXPERIENCE

MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES, CHEVRON BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO LOSS

EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATIONS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT

AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

THE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE CAPACITY,

UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS

ARE 2006  $2,200; 2007  $1,900; 2008  $1,800; 2009

 $1,800; 2010  $500; 2011 AND AFTER 

$3,800. TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $2,100 IN 2005, $1,600 IN 2004 AND

$1,400 IN 2003.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY

55,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY AFFILIATE REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS

PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCING OF A REFINERY OWNED BY THE AFFILIATE AND

EXPIRES IN 2009. THE FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT ARE: 2006  $1,300; 2007 

$1,300; 2008  $1,300; AND 2009  $1,300. UNDER THE TERMS OF A 2004 AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY

EXERCISED ITS OPTION IN 2005 TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL REGASIFICATION CAPACITY AT THE SABINE PASS

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS TERMINAL. PAYMENTS OF $2.5 BILLION OVER THE 20-YEAR PERIOD ARE EXPECTED TO

COMMENCE IN 2009.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $200 RELATED TO MINORITY

INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR

AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM

SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR

VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES AND ANALOGOUS SITES UNDER

STATE LAWS, REFINERIES, CRUDE OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS, AND LAND DEVELOPMENT

AREAS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR DIVESTED. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT FULLY DETERMINABLE DUE TO

SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION,

THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF

THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH

COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD OR WILL HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR CHEMICAL

COMPANIES.

CHEVRONS ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS $1,469. INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE

WERE LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL, WHICH RELATE PRIMARILY TO

SITES THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DIVESTED OR CLOSED BY UNOCAL. THE SITES INCLUDED, BUT WERE NOT

LIMITED TO, FORMER REFINERIES, TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND SERVICE STATIONS,

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS AND MINING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS ACTIVE MINING OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES UNDER SPECIFIC SETS OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS,

WHICH IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDE THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT AND VARIOUS STATE AND

LOCAL REGULATIONS. NO SINGLE REMEDIATION SITE AT YEAR-END 2005 HAD A RECORDED LIABILITY THAT WAS

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

INCLUDED IN THE YEAR-END 2005 BALANCE WAS $139 RELATED TO SITES FOR WHICH CHEVRON HAD BEEN

IDENTIFIED BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SUPERFUND LAW OR ANALOGOUS STATE LAWS AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE REMEDIATION.

OF THE REMAINING YEAR-END 2005 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES BALANCE OF $1,330, $855 RELATED TO

APPROXIMATELY 2,250 SITES FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REFINERIES AND

OTHER PLANTS, MARKETING LOCATIONS (I.E., SERVICE STATIONS AND TERMINALS) AND PIPELINES. THE

REMAINING $475 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SITES IN THE INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM ($101), UPSTREAM

($257), CHEMICALS ($50) AND OTHER ($67). LIABILITIES AT ALL SITES, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR

DIVESTED, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TO

GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION AND TREATMENT; AND MONITORING OF THE NATURAL ATTENUATION OF THE

CONTAMINANTS.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

CHEVRON AND ITS AFFILIATES CONDUCT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN

APPROXIMATELY 180 COUNTRIES. AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT

OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY, DENMARK,

FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA, REPUBLIC OF

THE CONGO, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, CHAD, SOUTH AFRICA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, INDONESIA,

BANGLADESH, THE PHILIPPINES, MYANMAR, SINGAPORE, CHINA, THAILAND, VIETNAM, CAMBODIA, AZERBAIJAN,

KAZAKHSTAN, VENEZUELA, ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, AND SOUTH KOREA. THE

COMPANYS CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC) AFFILIATE OPERATES IN RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN. THE

COMPANYS TENGIZCHEVROIL (TCO) AFFILIATE OPERATES IN KAZAKHSTAN. THROUGH AN AFFILIATE, THE COMPANY

PARTICIPATES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BAKU-TBILISI-CEYHAN (BTC) PIPELINE THROUGH AZERBAIJAN,

GEORGIA AND TURKEY. ALSO THROUGH AN AFFILIATE, THE COMPANY HAS AN INTEREST IN THE CHAD/CAMEROON

PIPELINE. THE COMPANYS PETROLERA AMERIVEN AFFILIATE OPERATES THE HAMACA PROJECT IN VENEZUELA. THE

COMPANYS CPCHEM AFFILIATE MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF PETROCHEMICALS ON A WORLDWIDE

BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH

KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND BELGIUM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY HOST

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES OR

ASSETS OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS OR BOTH.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES, AND IN

OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST, ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR STRAINED

RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE AT TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF

CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

MAY PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER

WAY SINCE 1996 FOR CHEVRONS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT

ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR

ZONES. CHEVRON ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY $200. AT

THE SAME TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRON IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT

$50. THE TIMING OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES ARE

UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRON RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO CUSTOMERS, TRADING

PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES, HOST GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS,

AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT

AND TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAY

CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 24.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT (FASB) NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING

FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS,

(FAS 143), EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD

APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION THAT IS RECORDED WHEN

THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE

LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THESE ASSETS

REQUIRE RECOGNITION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) THE PRESENT VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING

ASSET FOR AN ARO, (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION OF THE ASSET, AND

(3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND DISCOUNT RATES. FAS 143 PRIMARILY

AFFECTS THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCING ASSETS AND DIFFERS IN

SEVERAL RESPECTS FROM PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING UNDER FAS 19,

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL

AND GAS PRODUCING COMPANIES.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $200 FOR THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF FAS 143, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT ALSO INCREASED THE FOLLOWING BALANCE SHEET

CATEGORIES: PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, $2,568; ACCRUED LIABILITIES, $115; AND DEFERRED

CREDITS AND OTHER NONCURRENT

OBLIGATIONS, $2,674. NONCURRENT DEFERRED INCOME TAXES DECREASED BY $21.

UPON ADOPTION, NO SIGNIFICANT ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM) AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED

ASSETS GENERALLY WERE RECOGNIZED, AS INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS

PREVENTED ESTIMATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS

OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

OTHER THAN THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT NET CHARGE, THE EFFECT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON NET

INCOME IN 2003 WAS NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FAS 19

ACCOUNTING. INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION WERE $52 RELATED TO THE

DEPRECIATION OF THE ARO ASSET AND $132 RELATED TO THE ACCRETION OF THE ARO LIABILITY.

IN MARCH 2005, THE FASB ISSUED

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 143,

(FIN 47), WHICH WAS

EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. FIN 47 CLARIFIES THAT THE PHRASE CONDITIONAL

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION, AS USED IN FAS 143, REFERS TO A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM AN ASSET

RETIREMENT ACTIVITY FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT ARE CONDITIONAL ON A FUTURE

EVENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. THE OBLIGATION TO PERFORM THE ASSET

RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IS UNCONDITIONAL EVEN THOUGH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD

OF SETTLEMENT. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING AND/OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF A CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION SHOULD BE FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY WHEN SUFFICIENT

INFORMATION EXISTS. FAS 143 ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN SOME CASES, SUFFICIENT INFORMATION MAY NOT BE

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

RESERVES GOVERNANCE

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A

COMPREHENSIVE RESERVES AND RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION

SYSTEM MODELED AFTER A SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY

THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS, THE WORLD PETROLEUM

CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM

GEOLOGISTS. THE SYSTEM CLASSIFIES RECOVERABLE

HYDROCARBONS INTO SIX CATEGORIES BASED ON THEIR STATUS

AT THE TIME OF REPORTING  THREE DEEMED COMMERCIAL AND

THREE NONCOMMERCIAL. WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL

CLASSIFICATION ARE PROVED RESERVES AND TWO CATEGORIES

OF UNPROVED, PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE. THE NONCOMMERCIAL

CATEGORIES ARE ALSO REFERRED TO AS CONTINGENT

RESOURCES. FOR RESERVES ESTIMATES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS

PROVED, THEY MUST MEET ALL SEC AND COMPANY STANDARDS.

PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES THAT

GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS

FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING CONDITIONS. NET PROVED RESERVES EXCLUDE

ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS IN

EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER DEVELOPED

OR UNDEVELOPED. PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THE

QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING

WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS.

DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED

NATURE OF RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF UNDERGROUND

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES ARE

ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH

SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS. AS PART OF THE INTERNAL

CONTROL PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES ESTIMATION, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE (RAC)

THAT IS CHAIRED BY THE CORPORATE RESERVES MANAGER, WHO

IS A MEMBER OF A CORPORATE DEPARTMENT THAT REPORTS

DIRECTLY TO THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES. ALL OF THE RAC MEMBERS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN

SEC GUIDELINES FOR PROVED RESERVES CLASSIFICATION. THE

RAC COORDINATES ITS ACTIVITIES THROUGH TWO OPERATING

COMPANY-LEVEL RESERVES MANAGERS. THESE TWO RESERVES

MANAGERS ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE RAC SO AS TO PRESERVE

THE CORPORATE-LEVEL INDEPENDENCE.

THE RAC HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES: PROVIDE

INDEPENDENT REVIEWS OF THE BUSINESS UNITS RECOMMENDED RESERVE

CHANGES; CONFIRM THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SEC GUIDELINES; DETERMINE THAT RESERVE VOLUMES ARE CALCULATED

USING CONSISTENT AND APPROPRIATE STANDARDS, PROCEDURES AND

TECHNOLOGY; AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATE RESERVES MANUAL,

WHICH

PROVIDES STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES USED CORPORATEWIDE FOR

CLASSIFYING AND REPORTING HYDROCARBON RESERVES.

FS-70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION  CONTINUED

DURING THE YEAR, THE RAC IS REPRESENTED IN

MEETINGS WITH EACH OF THE COMPANYS UPSTREAM BUSINESS

UNITS TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS RESERVE CHANGES RECOMMENDED

BY THE VARIOUS ASSET TEAMS. MAJOR CHANGES ARE ALSO

REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY AND PLANNING

COMMITTEE AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHOSE MEMBERS

INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMPANYS ANNUAL RESERVE

ACTIVITY IS ALSO REVIEWED WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

IF MAJOR CHANGES TO RESERVES WERE TO OCCUR BETWEEN THE

ANNUAL REVIEWS, THOSE MATTERS WOULD ALSO BE DISCUSSED

WITH THE BOARD.

RAC SUBTEAMS ALSO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH REVIEWS DURING

THE YEAR OF MANY OF THE FIELDS THAT HAVE THE LARGEST

PROVED RESERVES QUANTITIES. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE AN

EXAMINATION OF THE PROVED RESERVE RECORDS AND

DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH THE

CORPORATE

RESERVES MANUAL.

RESERVE QUANTITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES FOR THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

OPERATIONS TOTALED 9.0 BILLION BARRELS. (REFER TO PAGE

E-11 FOR THE DEFINITION OF OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES.)

NEARLY 22 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL WAS IN THE UNITED

STATES. YEAR-END RESERVES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.4 BILLION

BARRELS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTIES OBTAINED

AS PART OF THE AUGUST 2005 ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL. FOR

THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUITY AFFILIATES,

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES TOTALED 2.9 BILLION BARRELS,

84 PERCENT OF WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS

50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN TCO.

ASIDE FROM THE TCO OPERATIONS, NO SINGLE PROPERTY

ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED RESERVES. FEWER THAN 20

INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES EACH CONTAINED BETWEEN 1 PERCENT

AND 5 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE

PROPERTIES ACCOUNTED FOR 35 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS

TOTAL PROVED OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES. THESE OTHER

PROPERTIES WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED, LOCATED IN

THE UNITED STATES, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, WEST AFRICA,

THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

IN THE

UNITED STATES, TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES AT

YEAR-END 2005 WERE 2.6 BILLION BARRELS. OF THIS AMOUNT,

39 PERCENT, 21 PERCENT AND 40 PERCENT WERE LOCATED IN

CALIFORNIA, THE GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER U.S. AREAS,

RESPECTIVELY.

IN CALIFORNIA, LIQUIDS RESERVES REPRESENTED 95

PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, WITH MOST CLASSIFIED AS HEAVY

OIL. BECAUSE OF HEAVY OILS HIGH VISCOSITY AND THE

NEED TO EMPLOY ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS, THE

PRODUCING OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE IN NATURE.

MOST OF THE COMPANYS HEAVY-OIL FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA

EMPLOY A CONTINUOUS STEAMFLOODING PROCESS.

IN THE GULF OF MEXICO REGION, LIQUIDS REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT OF TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT

RESERVES. PRODUCTION OPERATIONS ARE MOSTLY OFFSHORE

AND, AS A RESULT,

ARE ALSO CAPITAL INTENSIVE. COSTS INCLUDE

INVESTMENTS IN WELLS, PRODUCTION PLATFORMS AND OTHER

FACILITIES, SUCH AS GATHERING LINES AND STORAGE

FACILITIES.

IN OTHER U.S. AREAS, THE RESERVES WERE SPLIT

ABOUT EQUALLY BETWEEN LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS. FOR

PRODUCTION OF CRUDE OIL, SOME FIELDS UTILIZE ENHANCED

RECOVERY METHODS, INCLUDING WATER-FLOOD AND CO

2

INJECTION.

THE PATTERN OF NET RESERVE CHANGES SHOWN IN

THE FOLLOWING TABLES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2005, IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF

FUTURE TRENDS. APART FROM ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO ADD PROVED RESERVES IS AFFECTED BY, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, MATTERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE COMPANYS

CONTROL, SUCH AS DELAYS IN GOVERNMENT PERMITTING,

PARTNER APPROVALS OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, DECLINES IN OIL

AND GAS PRICES, OPEC CONSTRAINTS, GEOPOLITICAL

UNCERTAINTIES AND CIVIL UNREST.

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED UNDERGROUND OIL

AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND CHANGES THERETO FOR THE

YEARS 2003, 2004 AND 2005 ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLES ON

PAGES FS-72 AND FS-74.

(178) MILLION BARRELS OF DEVELOPED RESERVES AND (154) MILLION BARRELS OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR

AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

DURING 2005, THE PERCENTAGES OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004,

TRANSFERRED TO DEVELOPED RESERVES WERE 11 PERCENT AND 20 PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

AFFILIATED COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES, CHEVRON HAS SIGNIFICANT

INTERESTS IN PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATHABASCA PROJECT. FOR

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, CHEVRON VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SEC REGULATIONS DEFINE THESE RESERVES AS

MINING-RELATED AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES. NET PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES

WERE 146 MILLION BARRELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE OIL SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES,

WHICH IS FOUND ON PAGE FS-76.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF

PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2003 THROUGH 2005 IN THE

TABLE ABOVE ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2003, NET

REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES BY 57 MILLION BARRELS FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. WHEREAS NET U.S. RESERVE

CHANGES WERE MINIMAL, INTERNATIONAL VOLUMES INCREASED

66 MILLION BARRELS. THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS IN

KAZAKHSTAN IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC AREA BASED ON AN UPDATED

GEOLOGIC MODEL FOR ONE FIELD. THE 200-MILLION-BARREL

INCREASE FOR TCO WAS BASED ON AN UPDATED MODEL OF

RESERVOIR AND WELL PERFORMANCE.

IN 2004, NET REVISIONS DECREASED RESERVES 218

MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND

INCREASED RESERVES

FOR AFFILIATES BY 204 MILLION

BARRELS. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, THE DECREASE

WAS COMPOSED OF 161 MILLION BARRELS FOR

INTERNATIONAL AREAS AND 57 MILLION BARRELS FOR THE

UNITED STATES. THE LARGEST DOWNWARD REVISION

INTERNATIONALLY WAS 70 MILLION BARRELS IN AFRICA.

ONE FIELD IN ANGOLA ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

THE NET DECLINE AS CHANGES WERE MADE TO

OIL-IN-PLACE ESTIMATES BASED ON RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE DATA. ONE FIELD IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC

AREA ESSENTIALLY ACCOUNTED FOR THE

43-MILLION-BARREL DOWNWARD REVISION FOR THAT

REGION. THE REVISION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED

WELL PERFORMANCE. PART OF THE 36-MILLION-BARREL NET

DOWNWARD REVISION FOR INDONESIA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE

CALCULATION OF RESERVES FOR COST-OIL RECOVERY UNDER

A

FS-72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION  CONTINUED

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 68-MILLION-BARREL NET DOWNWARD REVISION

IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AREA WAS ACROSS SEVERAL FIELDS AND BASED MAINLY ON RESERVOIR ANALYSES AND

ASSESSMENTS OF WELL PERFORMANCE. FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES, THE 206-MILLION-BARREL INCREASE FOR TCO

WAS BASED ON AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE FOR THE TENGIZ FIELD. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THIS INCREASE WAS A DOWNWARD EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON THE VARIABLE

ROYALTY-RATE CALCULATION. DOWNWARD REVISIONS ALSO OCCURRED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS BECAUSE OF THE

EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES ON VARIOUS PRODUCTION-SHARING TERMS AND VARIABLE ROYALTY

CALCULATIONS.

IN 2005, NET REVISIONS REDUCED RESERVES BY 239 MILLION AND 24 MILLION BARRELS FOR

WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES, RESPECTIVELY. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES,

THE NET DECREASE WAS 199 MILLION BARRELS IN THE INTERNATIONAL AREAS AND 40 MILLION BARRELS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE LARGEST DOWNWARD NET REVISIONS INTERNATIONALLY WERE 108 MILLION BARRELS IN

INDONESIA AND 53 MILLION BARRELS IN KAZAKHSTAN, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END

PRICES ON THE CALCULATION OF RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-SHARING AND VARIABLE-ROYALTY

CONTRACTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 40-MILLION-BARREL REDUCTION WAS ACROSS MANY FIELDS IN EACH OF

THE GEOGRAPHIC SECTIONS. MOST OF THE DOWNWARD REVISION FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES WAS A

19-MILLION-BARREL REDUCTION IN HAMACA, ATTRIBUTABLE TO REVISED GOVERNMENT ROYALTY PROVISIONS. FOR

TCO, THE DOWNWARD EFFECT OF HIGHER YEAR-END PRICES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE.

IMPROVED RECOVERY

IN 2005, IMPROVED RECOVERY

INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES WORLDWIDE BY 203 MILLION

BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INTERNATIONAL AREAS

ACCOUNTED FOR 142 MILLION BARRELS OF THE INCREASE.

INDONESIA ADDED 42 MILLION BARRELS DUE TO IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE. RESERVE ADDITIONS OF 67 MILLION BARRELS IN

AFRICA OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN ANGOLA AND RESULTED FROM

INFILL DRILLING, WELLS WORKOVERS AND SECONDARY RECOVERY

FROM GAS INJECTION. ADDITIONS OF 29 MILLION BARRELS IN

THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREA WERE MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE

TO IMPROVED WATERFLOOD PERFORMANCE OFFSHORE EASTERN

CANADA. AN INCREASE OF 61 MILLION BARRELS OCCURRED IN

THE UNITED STATES, PRIMARILY IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON A LARGE HEAVY OIL FIELD UNDER

THERMAL RECOVERY.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2005,

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES INCREASED LIQUIDS VOLUMES

WORLDWIDE BY 184 MILLION BARRELS FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES. THE LARGEST INCREASE WAS 49 MILLION BARRELS

IN NIGERIA, REFLECTING NEW DEVELOPMENT DRILLING,

INCLUDING IN THE AGBAMI FIELD, AMONG OTHERS. NEW FIELD

DEVELOPMENTS IN BRAZIL CONTRIBUTED ANOTHER 41 MILLION

BARRELS OF DISCOVERIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

44-MILLION-BARREL ADDITION WAS ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH

THE INITIAL BOOKING OF RESERVES FOR THE BLIND FAITH

FIELD IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO.

PURCHASES

IN 2005, THE ACQUISITION OF 572

MILLION BARRELS OF LIQUIDS RELATED SOLELY TO THE

ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL IN AUGUST. ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS

OF THE 376 MILLION BARRELS ACQUIRED IN THE

INTERNATIONAL AREAS WERE REPRESENTED BY VOL-

UMES IN

AZERBAIJAN AND THAILAND. MOST VOLUMES ACQUIRED IN

THE UNITED STATES WERE IN TEXAS AND ALASKA.

SALES

IN 2004, SALES OF LIQUIDS VOLUMES REDUCED

RESERVES OF CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY 179 MILLION

BARRELS. SALES TOTALED 130 MILLION BARRELS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND 33 MILLION BARRELS IN THE OTHER

INTERNATIONAL REGION. SALES IN THE OTHER REGION OF

THE UNITED STATES TOTALED 103 MILLIONS BARRELS, WITH

TWO FIELDS ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE-

HALF OF THE VOLUME. THE 27 MILLION BARRELS SOLD IN

THE GULF OF MEXICO REFLECT THE SALE OF A NUMBER OF

SHELF PROPERTIES. THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL SALES

INCLUDE THE DISPOSAL OF WESTERN CANADA PROPERTIES AND

SEVERAL FIELDS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. ALL THE SALES

WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS PROGRAM TO DISPOSE

OF ASSETS DEEMED NONSTRATEGIC TO THE PORTFOLIO OF

PRODUCING PROPERTIES.

IN 2005, SALES OF 58 MILLION BARRELS IN THE

OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREA RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION

OF THE FORMER UNOCAL OPERATIONS ONSHORE IN CANADA.

NET RESERVE CHANGES (EXCLUDING PRODUCTION) IN 2005 CONSIST OF 5,141 BILLION CUBIC

FEET OF DEVELOPED RESERVES AND 669 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES AND (672) BILLION CUBIC FEET OF DEVELOPED RESERVES AND 174 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES.

4

DURING 2005, THE PERCENTAGES OF

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, TRANSFERRED TO DEVELOPED RESERVES WERE 12 PERCENT AND 19

PERCENT FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTEWORTHY AMOUNTS IN THE CATEGORIES OF

PROVED-RESERVE CHANGES FOR 2003 THROUGH 2005 IN THE

TABLE ABOVE ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

REVISIONS

IN 2003,

REVISIONS ACCOUNTED FOR A NET INCREASE OF 1,627 BCF FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, AS NET INCREASES OF 2,233 BCF

INTERNATIONALLY WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET DOWNWARD

REVISIONS OF 606 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES.

INTERNATIONALLY, THE NET 879 BCF INCREASE IN THE

ASIA-PACIFIC REGION RELATED PRIMARILY TO AUSTRALIA AND

KAZAKHSTAN. IN AUSTRALIA, THE INCREASE WAS ASSOCIATED

MAINLY WITH A CHANGE TO THE PROBABILISTIC METHOD OF

AGGREGATING THE RESERVES FOR MULTIPLE FIELDS PRODUCED

THROUGH COMMON OFFSHORE INFRASTRUCTURE INTO A SINGLE

LNG PLANT. THE INCREASE IN KAZAKHSTAN RELATED TO AN

UPDATED

GEOLOGIC MODEL FOR ONE

FIELD AND HIGHER GAS SALES TO A THIRD-PARTY PROCESSING

PLANT. THE NET 976 BCF INCREASE IN THE OTHER

INTERNATIONAL AREA WAS MAINLY THE RESULT OF OPERATING

CONTRACT EXTENSIONS FOR TWO FIELDS IN SOUTH AMERICA. IN

THE UNITED STATES, ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE NET 606 BCF

NEGATIVE REVISION RELATED TO TWO COAL BED METHANE

FIELDS IN THE MID-CONTINENT REGION, BASED ON

PERFORMANCE DATA FOR PRODUCING WELLS. DOWNWARD

REVISIONS FOR THE BALANCE OF THE WRITE-DOWN WERE

ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL FIELDS, BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF

WELL PERFORMANCE AND OTHER DATA.

IN 2004, REVISIONS INCREASED RESERVES FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES BY A NET 248 BCF, COMPOSED OF

INCREASES OF 928 BCF INTERNATIONALLY AND DECREASES

OF 680 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES. INTERNATIONALLY,

ABOUT HALF OF THE 346 BCF

FS-74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION  CONTINUED

INCREASE IN AFRICA RELATED TO PROPERTIES IN NIGERIA, FOR WHICH CHANGES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

WELL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS, DEVELOPMENT DRILLING AND LEASE FUEL CALCULATIONS. THE 236 BCF ADDITION IN

THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION WAS RELATED PRIMARILY TO RESERVOIR ANALYSIS FOR A SINGLE FIELD. MOST OF THE

325 BCF IN THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREA IS RELATED TO A NEW GAS SALES CONTRACT IN TRINIDAD AND

TOBAGO. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE NET 391 BCF DOWNWARD REVISION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WAS RELATED

TO WELL-PERFORMANCE REVIEWS AND TECHNICAL ANALYSES IN SEVERAL FIELDS. MOST OF THE NET 316 BCF

NEGATIVE REVISION IN THE OTHER U.S. AREA RELATED TO TWO COAL BED METHANE FIELDS IN THE

MID-CONTINENT REGION AND THEIR ASSOCIATED WELLS PERFORMANCE. THE 963 BCF INCREASE FOR TCO WAS

CONNECTED WITH UPDATED ANALYSES OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND PROCESSING PLANT YIELDS.

IN 2005, RESERVES WERE REVISED DOWNWARD BY 14 BCF

FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES AND 498 BCF FOR EQUITY

AFFILIATES. FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, NEGATIVE

REVISIONS WERE 428 BCF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. MOST

OF THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE FIELD IN

KAZAKHSTAN, DUE MAINLY TO THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER

YEAR-END PRICES ON VARIABLE-ROYALTY PROVISIONS OF THE

PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT. RESERVES ADDITIONS FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES TOTALED 211 BCF AND 243 BCF IN

AFRICA AND OTHER, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF THE

AFRICAN REGION CHANGES WERE IN ANGOLA, DUE TO A REVISED

FORECAST OF FUEL GAS USAGE, AND IN NIGERIA FROM

IMPROVED RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE. THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY COMPRESSION IN COLOMBIA ACCOUNTED FOR MOST

OF THE INCREASE IN THE OTHER REGION. REVISIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES DECREASED RESERVES BY 9 BCF, AS NOMINAL

INCREASES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WERE MORE THAN

OFFSET BY DECREASES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER

REGION. FOR THE TCO AFFILIATE IN KAZAKHSTAN, A

REDUCTION OF 547 BCF REFLECTS THE UPDATED FORECAST OF

FUTURE ROYALTIES PAYABLE AND YEAR-END PRICE EFFECTS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VOLUMES ADDED AS A RESULT OF AN

UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE.

EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES

IN 2003, EXTENSIONS AND

DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF 526 BCF FOR

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES, REFLECTING A 388 BCF INCREASE

IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH 270 BCF ADDED IN THE GULF OF

MEXICO AND 118 BCF IN THE OTHER REGION. THE GULF OF

MEXICO INCREASE INCLUDES DISCOVERIES IN SEVERAL

OFFSHORE LOUISIANA FIELDS, WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF

FIELDS IN TEXAS, LOUISIANA AND OTHER STATES ACCOUNTING

FOR THE INCREASE IN OTHER.

IN 2004, EXTENSIONS AND

DISCOVERIES ACCOUNTED FOR AN INCREASE OF 214 BCF,

REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE UNITED STATES OF 144 BCF,

WITH 89 BCF ADDED IN THE OTHER REGION AND 54 BCF

ADDED IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH DRILLING ACTIVITIES

IN A LARGE NUMBER OF FIELDS.

IN 2005, CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES INCREASED RESERVES

BY 370 BCF, INCLUDING 167 BCF IN THE UNITED STATES AND

118 BCF IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, 99 BCF WAS ADDED IN THE OTHER REGION AND 68

BCF IN THE GULF OF MEXICO, PRIMARILY DUE TO DRILLING

ACTIVITIES. THE ADDITION IN ASIA-PACIFIC RESULTED

PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED DRILLING IN KAZAKHSTAN.

PURCHASES

IN 2005, ALL EXCEPT 7 BCF OF THE 5,656

BCF TOTAL PURCHASES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNOCAL

ACQUISITION. INTERNATIONAL RESERVE ACQUISITIONS WERE

4,488 BCF, WITH THAILAND ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT HALF THE

VOLUMES. OTHER SIGNIFICANT VOLUMES WERE ADDED IN

BANGLADESH AND MYANMAR.

SALES

IN 2004, SALES FOR CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES

TOTALED 547 BCF. OF THIS TOTAL, 436 BCF WAS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND 111 BCF IN THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL

REGION. IN THE UNITED STATES, OTHER REGION SALES

ACCOUNTED FOR 289 BCF, REFLECTING THE DISPOSAL OF A

LARGE NUMBER OF SMALLER PROPERTIES, INCLUDING A COAL

BED METHANE FIELD. GULF OF MEXICO SALES OF 147 BCF

REFLECTED THE SALE OF SHELF PROPERTIES, WITH FOUR

FIELDS ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE TOTAL

SALES. SALES IN THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGION

REFLECTED THE DISPOSITION OF THE PROPERTIES IN WESTERN

CANADA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

IN 2005, SALES OF 248 BCF IN THE OTHER

INTERNATIONAL REGION RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF

FORMER-UNOCALS ONSHORE PROPERTIES IN CANADA.

TABLE VI  STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET

CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE PRECEDING PROVED OIL AND GAS

RESERVES, IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 69. ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH INFLOWS

FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END

PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF

ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE

LIMITED TO THOSE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED

FUTURE EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND PRODUCE

YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES BASED ON YEAR-END

COST INDICES, ASSUMING CONTINUATION OF YEAR-END

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME

TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END

STATUTORY TAX RATES. THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE

DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED TO ESTIMATED

FUTURE PRETAX NET CASH FLOWS, LESS THE TAX BASIS OF

RELATED ASSETS. DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE

CALCULATED

USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD DISCOUNT

FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE

OF WHEN FUTURE EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN

RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT REPRESENT

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

ESTIMATES OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE IMPRECISE

AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES,

WHICH MAY BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED

FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE ARBITRARY VALUATION

PRESCRIBED UNDER FAS 69 REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION

COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF DECEMBER 31 EACH

YEAR AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF

THE COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS OIL AND

GAS RESERVES. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, STANDARDIZED

MEASURE NET CASH FLOWS REFERS TO THE STANDARDIZED
