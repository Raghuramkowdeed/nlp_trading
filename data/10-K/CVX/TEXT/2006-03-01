general development of business
summary description of chevron
chevron
corporation,1
a delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
and affiliates and provides administrative, financial and
management support to u.s. and foreign subsidiaries that engage
in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations,
mining operations of coal and other minerals, power generation
and energy services. the company conducts business activities in
the united states and approximately 180 other countries.
petroleum operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas; refining crude oil into
finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil, natural gas
and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting
crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline,
marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car. chemicals
operations include the manufacture and marketing, by affiliates,
of commodity petrochemicals for industrial uses, and the
manufacture and marketing, by a consolidated subsidiary, of fuel
and lubricating oil additives.
in this report, exploration and production of crude oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas may be referred to as
e&p or upstream activities.
refining, marketing and transportation may be referred to as
rm&t or downstream activities. a
list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pages e-4 and
e-5 of this annual
report on
form10-k. as of
december31, 2005, chevron had more than 59,000 employees
(including about 6,000 service station employees). approximately
27,000, or 46percent, of the companys employees were
employed in u.s.operations.
acquisition of unocal corporation
on august10, 2005, the company acquired unocal corporation
(unocal), an independent oil and gas exploration and production
company. this acquisition was accounted for under the rules of
financial accounting standards board (fasb)statement
no.141, business combinations.
unocals principal upstream operations are in north
america and asia, including the caspian region. other activities
include ownership interests in proprietary and common carrier
pipelines, natural gas storage facilities and mining operations.
further discussion of the unocal acquisition is contained in
note2 on page
fs-36 of this annual
report on form10-k.
overview of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
control over some of them. governmental policies, particularly
in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating where and
how companies conduct their operations and formulate their
products and, in some cases, limiting their profits directly.
prices for crude oil and natural gas, petroleum products and
petrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these
commodities. the members of the organization of petroleum
exporting countries (opec)are typically the worlds
swing producers of crude oil, and their production levels are a
major factor in determining worldwide supply. demand for crude
oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by
the conditions of local, national and worldwide economies,
although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy
sources also play a significant part. variations in the
components of refined products sales due to seasonality are not
primary drivers of changes in the companys overall annual
earnings.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron
competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well
as independent and national petroleum companies for the
acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
1incorporated
in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the
company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and
chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. on may9, 2005,
chevrontexaco corporation changed its name to chevron
corporation. as used in this report, the term
chevron and such terms as the company,
the corporation, our, we and
us may refer to chevron corporation, one or more of
its consolidated subsidiaries, or to all of them taken as a
whole, but unless stated otherwise, it does not include
affiliates of chevron i.e., those
companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned
50percent or less) or investments accounted for by the
cost method. all of these terms are used for convenience only
and are not intended as a precise description of any of the
separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.
table of contents
leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor
required to develop and operate those properties. in its
downstream business, chevron also competes with fully integrated
major petroleum companies and other independent refining,
marketing and transportation entities in the sale or acquisition
of various goods or services in many national and international
markets.
operating environment
refer to
pagesfs-2 through
fs-11 of this annual
report on
form10-k in
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations for a discussion on the companys
current business environment and outlook.
chevron strategic direction
chevrons primary objective is to create value and achieve
sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable
it to outperform its competitors. as a foundation for achieving
this objective, the company had established the following
strategies, which continue into 2006:
strategies for major businesses
upstream grow profitability in core
areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
companys natural gas equity resource base by targeting
north american and asian markets
downstream improve returns by focusing
on areas of market and supply strength
enabling strategies companywide
invest in people to achieve the companys
strategies
leverage technology to deliver superior
performance and growth
build organizational capability to deliver
world-class performance in operational excellence, cost
reduction, capital stewardship and profitable growth
(b)
description of business and properties
the upstream and downstream activities of the company are widely
dispersed geographically, with operations in north america,
south america, europe, africa, the middle east, central and far
east asia, and australia. besides the large upstream and
downstream businesses, the companys other comparatively
smaller business segment is chemicals, which is conducted by the
companys 50percent-owned affiliate
chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) and
the wholly owned chevron oronite company (chevron oronite).
cpchem has operations in the united states, puerto rico,
singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and
belgium. chevron oronite is a fuel and lubricating-oil additives
business that owns and operates facilities in the united states,
france, the netherlands, singapore, japan and brazil and has
equity interests in facilities in india and mexico.
chevron also owns an approximate 24percent equity interest
in the common stock of dynegy inc. (dynegy), a provider of
electricity to markets and customers throughout the united
states. the company holds an additional investment in dynegy
preferred stock. refer to page
fs-13 for further
information relating to the companys investment in dynegy.
tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues,
earnings and income taxes for the three years ending
december31, 2005, and assets as of the end of each
year for the united states and the companys
major international geographic areas may be found in

table of contents
capital and exploratory expenditures
excluding the $17.3billion acquisition of unocal
corporation, total reported expenditures for 2005 were
$11.1billion, including $1.7billion for the
companys share of affiliates expenditures, which did
not require cash outlays by the company. in 2004 and 2003,
expenditures were $8.3billion and $7.4billion,
respectively, including the companys share of
affiliates expenditures of $1.6billion and
$1.1billion in the corresponding periods.
of the $11.1billion in expenditures for 2005, about
three-fourths, or $8.4billion, related to upstream
activities. approximately the same percentage was also expended
for upstream operations in 2004 and 2003. international upstream
accounted for about 70percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in each of the years, reflecting the companys
continuing focus on opportunities that are available outside the
united states.
in 2006, the company estimates capital and exploratory
expenditures will be 33percent higher at
$14.8billion, including spending by affiliates. about
three-fourths, or $11.3billion, is again targeted for
exploration and production activities, with $8billion of
that amount outside the united states.
refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and
exploratory expenditures on pages
fs-14 and
fs-15 of this annual
report on form10-k.
petroleum exploration and production
the table on the following page summarizes the companys
and affiliates net production of liquids and natural gas
for 2005 and 2004. as part of the unocal acquisition in august
2005, chevron acquired interests in producing operations in
azerbaijan, bangladesh, canada, the democratic republic of the
congo, indonesia, myanmar, the netherlands, thailand and the
united states. in september 2005, the producing operations in
canada were sold.

table of contents
in 2005, chevron conducted its exploration and production
operations in the united states and approximately 35 other
countries. worldwide oil-equivalent production of approximately
2.5million barrels per day in 2005, including volumes
produced from oil sands in canada and production under an
operating service agreement in venezuela, was about the same as
in 2004. production in the last five months of 2005 included
volumes associated with the properties acquired from unocal.
however, production during the year from the heritage-chevron
properties declined from their levels in 2004, due mainly to
operations that were offline as a result of august and september
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico, property sales between
periods, the effect of higher prices on volumes required under
cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions of certain
contracts, and normal field declines. refer to the results
of operations section beginning on page fs-7 for a
detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
2003 2005 changes in production for crude oil and
natural gas liquids and natural gas.
the company estimates that its average oil-equivalent production
in 2006 will be in the range of 2.7 to 2.8million barrels
per day. the additional volumes over the 2.5million
barrels per day produced in 2005 are attributable mainly to the
properties acquired from unocal and new project
start-ups that are
expected to help offset normal field declines in existing
operations. however, the company cautions that any future
estimate of production is subject to many uncertainties,
including quotas that may be imposed by opec, the price effect
on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, the rate of
recovery of production being restored in the gulf of mexico
following the 2005 hurricanes, and production that may have to
be shut in due to weather conditions, civil unrest, changing
geopolitics or other disruptions to daily operations. expected
additions to production capacity in 2007 through 2009 may permit
worldwide oil-equivalent production levels to increase from
levels in 2006. refer to the review of ongoing exploration
and production activities in key areas, beginning on
page10, for a discussion of the companys major oil
and gas development projects.
average sales prices and production costs per unit of
production
refer to tableiv on page fs-70 of this annual report on

gross acreage includes the total number of acres in all tracts
in which the company has an interest. net acreage is the sum of
the companys fractional interests in gross acreage.
developed acreage is spaced or assignable to productive wells.
undeveloped acreage is acreage where wells have not been drilled
or completed to permit commercial production and that may
contain undeveloped proved reserves. the gross undeveloped acres
that will expire in 2006, 2007 and 2008 if production is not
established by certain required dates are 5,130, 9,774 and
7,681, respectively.
contract obligations
the company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
operations under a variety of contractual arrangements. most
contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
on production from specified properties, but certain natural gas
sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
quantities.
in the united states, the company is contractually committed to
deliver to third parties and affiliates approximately
195billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2008 from
united states reserves. the company believes it can satisfy
these contracts from quantities available from production of the
companys proved developed u.s.reserves. these
contracts include variable-pricing terms.
table of contents
outside the united states, the company is contractually
committed to deliver to third parties a total of approximately
780billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2006 through
2008 from australia, canada, colombia and the philippines. the
sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
delivery and in some cases consider inflation or other factors.
the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from
quantities available from production of the companys
proved developed reserves in australia, colombia and the
philippines. the company plans to meet its canadian contractual
delivery commitments through third-party purchases.
development activities
details of the companys development expenditures and costs
of proved property acquisitions for 2005, 2004 and 2003 are
presented in tablei on
pagefs-65 of this
annual report on
form10-k.
the table below summarizes the companys net interest in
productive and dry development wells completed in each of the
past three years and the status of the companys
development wells drilling at december31, 2005. a
development well is a well drilled within the proved
area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a
stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. wells

consolidated operations
a)
united states
the united states upstream activities are concentrated in the
gulf of mexico, louisiana, texas, new mexico, the rocky
mountains and california. average daily net production during
2005 was 455,000barrels of liquids and 1.6billion
cubic feet of natural gas, or 727,000barrels per day on an
oil-equivalent basis. with the acquisition of unocal in august
2005, the company obtained properties that complemented and
enhanced chevrons already-strong positions in the gulf of
mexico and the permian basin in west texas and new mexico. refer
to table v beginning on page
fs-70 for a discussion
of the reserves and different characteristics for the
companys major u.s.producing areas.
california:the company has significant production
in the sanjoaquin valley. in 2005, average daily net
production was 212,000barrels of crude oil,
106million cubic feet of natural gas and
5,000barrels of natural gas liquids, or
235,000barrels of daily production on an oil-equivalent
basis. approximately 83percent of the crude oil production
is considered heavy oil (typically with api gravity lower than
22 degrees).
gulf of mexico:average daily net production rates
during 2005 for the companys combined interests in the
gulf of mexico shelf and deepwater areas and the fields onshore
louisiana were 101,000barrels of crude oil,
579million cubic feet of natural gas and
11,000barrels of natural gas liquids, or 208,000
oil-equivalent barrels daily. prior to the hurricanes in august
and september, oil-equivalent production in the gulf of mexico
averaged approximately 300,000barrels per day. because of
storm damages, fourth quarter 2005 production averaged only
160,000barrels per day. the expected production level for
the full year 2006 is about 200,000barrels per day, with a
slightly higher rate occurring in the first half of the year.
approximately 20,000net oil-equivalent barrels of daily
production are not expected to be sufficiently economic to
restore.
table of contents
in the deepwater areas, the company has an interest in four
producing fields: genesis, petronius, k2 and mad dog. k2 and mad
dog were added to the portfolio as a result of the unocal
acquisition.
the 57percent-owned and operated genesis field averaged
daily net production of approximately 9,000barrels of
crude oil and 11million cubic feet of natural gas in 2005,
or 11,000barrels of oil-equivalent.
petronius, which is 50percent-owned and operated, had
daily net production of 14,000barrels of crude oil and
17million cubic feet of natural gas in 2005, or
17,000barrels of oil-equivalent. petronius production was
shut in for repairs following hurricane damage in september 2004
and resumed production in march 2005.
the perseus discovery, which is part of the petronius
development, began production from its first well in the second
quarter 2005. from
start-up through
year-end, average daily net production was 3,000barrels of
oil-equivalent. a second extended-reach well is expected to
begin production in april 2006, with anticipated daily
production rates between 3,000 and 7,000barrels of net
oil-equivalent. the perseus project has an estimated production
life of six to nine years, with maximum production anticipated
in 2006. the company anticipates the majority of proved
undeveloped reserves will be categorized as proved developed by
the end of 2006.
chevron has a 13percent nonoperated interest in the former
unocal k2 field, which had initial production from its first
well in may 2005 and increased to approximately
2,000barrels of net oil-equivalent production per day by
november.
chevron holds a 16percent nonoperated interest in the mad
dog field, which commenced production in early 2005 and had
average daily net production of 4,000barrels of
oil-equivalent for the five months following the acquisition of
unocal. development work continues in order to increase the
daily maximum total production to the design capacity of
80,000barrels of crude oil and 40million cubic feet
of natural gas and is expected to be complete in 2008.
additional studies are under way to expand the total crude oil
production capacity to more than 100,000barrels per day.
the mad dog field has an estimated production life of
20years. additional reserve reclassification to proved
developed is expected to coincide with the development program
through 2008.
at typhoon, the tension leg platform suffered catastrophic
damage from hurricane rita in september 2005. teams were formed
to investigate the cause of the incident and evaluate options to
possibly restore operations. average daily net production prior
to the storm from the 50percent-owned and operated typhoon
field, along with volumes processed from the nearby
25percent-owned and nonoperated boris field, averaged
about 6,000barrels of oil-equivalent per day. typhoon and
boris production remained shut-in in early 2006 pending ongoing
salvage and restoration studies.
development activity continues on the 58percent-owned and
operated tahiti field, where production
start-up is expected in
2008. most contracts for the engineering, procurement,
fabrication and installation of the spar hull, topsides and
subsea equipment were awarded in 2005. construction of the
floating production facility began in the fourth quarter.
initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in 2003,
and the transfer of these reserves into the proved developed
category is anticipated upon production
start-up. with an
expected production life of 30years, tahiti is anticipated
to have a maximum total daily production of 125,000barrels
of crude oil and 70million cubic feet of natural gas.
at the 63percent-owned and operated blind faith discovery,
a subsea development utilizing a semi-submersible production
system was approved by chevron and its partner in late 2005, at
which time the company made its initial booking of proved
undeveloped reserves. reclassification of these reserves to the
proved developed category is anticipated in the first half 2008,
when first production is expected. initial total daily output is
estimated at 30,000barrels of crude oil and
30million cubic feet of natural gas.
chevron also continues to evaluate development of the
33percent-owned and nonoperated great white discovery.
successful appraisal drilling was conducted in 2004, and the
partners have formed a project management team to begin
front-end engineering and design (feed)in march 2006. no
proved reserves had been recognized for this discovery as of
early 2006.
the company participated in five wells in the gulf of mexico
deepwater exploration program during 2005. the 2005 program
resulted in two announced discoveries and one successful
appraisal well. the discoveries were the 25percent-owned
and nonoperated knotty head discovery and the
60percent-owned and operated big foot prospect. additional
appraisal activity was ongoing at both locations in early 2006.
at the 30percent-owned and nonoperated
table of contents
tubular bells prospect that was discovered in 2003, further
evaluation of commercial potential also continued, with
additional follow-up
drilling planned for 2006. a successful appraisal well was
drilled in 2005 at the 2004 jack discovery. an extended
production test is expected to be under way in march 2006.
evaluation continues at nearby saint malo, where a successful
follow-up appraisal
well was drilled during 2004. the first appraisal well also
commenced drilling at the nonoperated 2003 puma discovery;
however, the well was not completed as of early 2006 due to
extensive weather and rig-related delays. proved reserves were
not yet recognized for any of these prospects as of early 2006.
besides the activities connected with the development and
exploration projects in the gulf of mexico area, chevron also
filed an application with the federal energy regulatory
commission in the third quarter 2005 to own, construct and
operate a natural gas import terminal at casotte landing in
jackson county, mississippi. the proposed project, to be located
adjacent to the chevron-owned pascagoula refinery, would be
designed to process imported liquefied natural gas
(lng)for distribution to industrial, commercial and
residential customers in mississippi and the southeast region,
including the growing florida market. the terminal would have an
initial natural-gas processing capacity of 1.3billion
cubic feet per day.
the company also exercised an option to increase its capacity at
the sabine pass lng terminal to 1billion cubic feet per
day. additionally in the sabine pass area, the company signed an
agreement in mid-2005 to secure 1billion cubic feet per
day of pipeline capacity in a new pipeline that will be
connected to the sabine pass lng terminal. interconnect capacity
of 600million cubic feet per day was also secured to an
existing pipeline. the new pipeline is planned to be in service
in 2009, coinciding with the companys sabine pass terminal
commitments. the new pipeline system will provide access to
chevrons sabine and bridgeline pipelines, which connect to
the henry hub. the henry hub is the pricing point for natural
gas futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange
(nymex)and is located on the natural gas pipeline system
in louisiana. henry hub interconnects to nine interstate and
four intrastate pipelines.
other u.s.areas: outside california and the gulf of
mexico, the company manages operations in areas of the
midcontinent united states that extend from the rockies to
southern texas. the acquisition of unocal in 2005 added to
production operations in the permian basin of western texas and
southeastern new mexico, the sanjuan basin area of new
mexico and colorado, and in east texas. also as a result of the
unocal acquisition, chevron operates 10 offshore platforms in
alaska and five producing natural gas fields in the cook inlet
and owns nonoperated production on the north slope. during 2005,
the companys operations outside california and the gulf of
mexico averaged daily net production of 126,000barrels of
crude oil and natural gas liquids and 949million cubic
feet of natural gas (284,000barrels of oil-equivalent).

in block14, net production from the kuito field,
angolas first deepwater producing area, averaged
15,000net barrels of crude oil per day in 2005. first oil
was produced from the belize field in january 2006. this was the
initial production from phase1 of the $2.3billion
integrated drilling and production project for the benguela,
belize, lobito and tomboco fields. proved undeveloped reserves
for both benguela and belize were recognized in 1998, and
certain volumes for belize were transferred to proved developed
in 2005. the concession period for these fields expires in 2027.
phase2 of the block14 development involves the
installation of subsea production systems, pipelines and wells
for lobito and tomboco. proved undeveloped reserves for these
fields were recognized in 2000. phase2 is under
construction, with first oil planned in late 2006. after both
phases are completed, maximum total production in 2008 is
estimated at approximately 200,000barrels per day of crude
oil. proved developed reserves are expected to be recognized
near the time of first oil once certain project milestones have
been met. the concession period for these fields expires in 2027.
the tombua and landana fields in block14 were discovered
in 1997 and 2001, respectively, and appraisal drilling was
conducted from 1998 through 2002. proved undeveloped reserves
for tombua and landana were recognized in 2001 and 2002,
respectively. the tombua-landana development is targeted as the
next major capital project for block14, with feed having
begun in 2005. estimated capital expenditures for the
development exceed $2billion. the concession period
expires in 2028.
chevron also has two other concessions in angola
block2, 20percent-owned and operated, and the joint
venture fst area, in which the company has a 16percent

122,000barrels of crude oil, 3,000barrels of lpg and
68million cubic feet of natural gas.
onshore operations in the niger delta with a net production
capacity of approximately 45,000barrels of crude oil per
day, including the olero creek development, were suspended in
2003 as a result of the ongoing civil unrest. the abiteye field,
closest to the escravos terminal, was returned to production in
2004. repairs to the makaraba flow station were completed in
mid-2005, allowing for the resumption of production of
6,000net barrels per day from the abiteye, makaraba and
utonana fields and the eastern region. further restoration of
select dibi wells and flowlines in late 2005 contributed to an
additional 6,500net barrels per day from the dibi field.
as of year-end 2005, approximately 13,000 of the
45,000barrels per day had been returned to production.
restoration activities in the remaining fields will continue at
least through 2006.
during 2005, the company continued development activities for
the deepwater agbami project. the companys share of
capital investment for the full project is estimated at
$3.4billion. in early 2005, the project achieved the
following major milestones: conversion of oil prospecting
license (opl)216 and opl 217 to oil mining lease
(oml)127 and oml 128; approval of the field development

4million metric tons per year to approximately
16million, was approved in 2005, with commissioning
expected in 2008. in december 2005, the venture participants
approved development of the angel natural gas field, which will
supply the fifth lng train. nws reserves are recorded according
to existing sales agreements. start-up of the fifth lng train
will accelerate reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves
to proved developed. the end of the concession period for the

on barrow and thevenard islands, chevron operates crude oil
producing facilities that had combined net production of
6,000barrels per day in 2005. chevrons equity
interest in this operation is 57percent for barrow island
and 51percent for thevenard island.
chevron also is the operator of the gorgon-area fields and has
interests in other greater gorgon fields off the northwest coast
of australia. twelve discovered natural gas fields straddle 17
lease blocks in the greater gorgon area. chevron and its two
joint-venture participants signed a framework agreement in april
2005 that will enable the combined development of gorgon and the
nearby natural gas fields as one world-scale project. chevron
has a 50percent ownership interest across most of the
greater gorgon area. the gorgon project awarded upstream and
downstream feed and engineering, procurement and construction
contracts in june 2005 for a two-train (10million metric
tons per year) lng facility and a possible domestic natural gas
plant on barrow island, targeting initial production by 2010.
proved reserves have not been recognized for any of the
gorgon-area fields. recognition is contingent on securing
sufficient lng sales agreements and other key project milestones.
in the fourth quarter 2005, the company signed separate
nonbinding heads of agreements with three companies in japan to
supply lng from the gorgon project. negotiations are under way
to finalize binding sales agreements. purchases will range from
1.2million metric tons per year to 1.5million metric
tons per year of lng over 25years, commencing in 2010 and
2011.
during 2005 and early 2006, the company was awarded exploration
rights to five deepwater blocks in the carnarvon basin offshore
western australia. chevron holds a 50percent, operated
interest in the blocks. two-dimensional
(2-d) seismic survey
was acquired over four of the blocks.
also in 2005, 3-d
seismic survey was acquired for the wholly owned
wheatstone-1 2004
natural gas discovery offshore western australia. two appraisal
wells were also completed in the browse basin, located offshore
northwest australia.
interests ranging from 25percent to 50percent in
three blocks offshore southern australia and two blocks in
northwest australia were added to chevrons portfolio
through the unocal acquisition. the company is working with
partners on a detailed technical evaluation of the blocks in
southern australia. the blocks in the northwest have well
commitments that are targeted for drilling in the next three
years.

azerbaijan: chevron acquired unocals
10percent working interest in the azerbaijan international
operating company (aioc), which holds offshore crude oil
reserves in the caspian sea from the azeri-chirag-gunashli
(acg)project. also as a result of acquiring unocal, the
company has a 9percent equity interest in
baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc)pipeline, which will transport
aioc production from baku, azerbaijan through georgia to
deepwater port facilities in ceyhan, turkey. the pipeline is
planned to have a crude capacity of 1million barrels per
day. the first tanker-loading of crude oil at the ceyhan marine
terminal is expected to occur in the spring of 2006.
in the five months of 2005 following the companys
acquisition of unocal, aiocs daily net crude oil
production averaged 31,000barrels. first oil production
from phasei development of the acg crude oil project began
in early 2005, and production from the first of two additional
platforms in phaseii began at the end of 2005, at which
time a portion of proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified
to proved developed. production from the second platform is
expected in late 2006. phaseiii, which is the deepwater
portion of the project and the final phase of development, was
approved in 2004.production start-up for phaseiii is
targeted for 2008. proved undeveloped reserves will be
reclassified to proved developed reserves as new wells are
drilled and completed. the aioc operations are conducted under a
30-year production-sharing contract that expires at the end of
2024.
kazakhstan: chevron holds a 20percent nonoperated
interest in the karachaganak project that is being developed in
phases. phase2 of the field development was completed in
2004, and phase3 was under evaluation as of early 2006.
access for karachaganak production to the caspian pipeline
consortium (cpc)pipeline allows sales of approximately
150,000barrels per day of processed liquids
(28,000net barrels) at prices available in world markets.
during 2005, karachaganak daily net production averaged
37,000barrels of liquids and 142million cubic feet
of natural gas. proved developed reserves associated with
phase2 were added in 2002 through 2005. the karachaganak
operations are conducted under a
40-year concession
agreement that expires in 2038. timing for the recognition of
phase3 reserves and an increase in production are
uncertain and depend on achieving a natural gas sales agreement.

was brought online in 2005. daily net production in 2005 from
these two blocks was 105million cubic feet of natural gas
and 25,000barrels of crude oil. also in 2005, the company
completed the development study for the block8/32 central
belt area, with first production anticipated in 2007.
two appraisal wells were drilled in block g4/43 in early 2005
and resulted in the successful extension of the similan and
lanta oil trends. in addition,
3-d seismic data
acquisition and processing relating to other prospects were
completed in august 2005. first crude oil production is
anticipated in early 2007.
in the acquired unocal operations, three platforms were
installed in the pailin and kaphong areas and 90wells were
drilled post-merger. de-bottlenecking of several central
processing platforms was nearly completed in 2005, which is

offshore licensing round. four blocks are located adjacent to
the rosebank/ lochnagar offshore discovery. chevron will be the
operator with a 40percent interest.
chevron also holds a 19percent interest in clair, a
nonoperated development. initial production began in february
2005 and is expected to attain an average daily net production
of 12,000barrels of crude oil and 3million cubic
feet of natural gas in late 2006. initial recognition of proved
reserves was in 2001. some reserves were reclassified from
proved undeveloped to proved developed in late 2004. further
reclassifications are expected to occur through 2008 related to
planned development drilling. clair has an expected field life
of more than 20years.
joint development activities continued at the britannia
satellite fields, callanish and brodgar, where chevron holds
17percent and 25percent interests, respectively.
four development wells were completed in 2005. first production
is expected in early 2007, building to planned daily net
production of 10,000barrels of crude oil and
50million cubic feet of natural gas several months after
start-up. proved
undeveloped reserves were initially recognized in 2000.
in 2006, proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be
reclassified to proved developed ahead of planned commencement
of production in early 2007. this development has an expected
production life of approximately 15years.
design and construction work progressed on the captain
areac project to develop the eastern portion of the
captain field, with first oil planned for mid-2006.
the alder discovery, west of the britannia field, is being
evaluated as a tie-back to existing infrastructure. production
start-up is anticipated
in 2009. initial reserves are planned to be booked in 2008.
mexico: in early 2005, the company executed the
concession title that would allow construction of the proposed
baja lng terminal based in offshore mexican territorial waters.
if approved by the company and various government agencies, the
terminal would be constructed using a gravity-based structure
design with an initial processing capacity of approximately
700million cubic feet per day.
f)affiliate operations
kazakhstan: the company holds a 50percent interest
in tengizchevroil (tco), which is developing the tengiz and
korolev crude oil fields located in western kazakhstan under a
40-year concession that
expires in 2033. net production in 2005 averaged
136,000barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas
liquids and 216million cubic feet of natural gas.
tco is currently undertaking a significant expansion composed of
two integrated projects referred to as the second generation
plant (sgp)and sour gas injection(sgi). at a total
cost of approximately $5.5billion, these projects are
designed to increase tcos crude oil production capacity by
the third quarter 2007 from the current 300,000barrels per
day to between 460,000 and 550,000barrels. the actual
production level within the estimated range is dependent
partially on the effects of the sgi, which are discussed below.
sgp involves the construction of a large processing train for
treating crude oil and the associated sour (i.e., high in sulfur
content) gas. the sgp design is based on the same conventional
technology employed in the existing processing trains. in
addition to new processing capacity, sgp involves drilling
and/or completing 55 production wells in the tengiz and korolev
reservoirs to generate the volumes required for the new
processing train. proved undeveloped reserves associated with
sgp were recognized in 2001. some of these reserves were
reclassified to proved developed in
table of contents
2005, based upon completion of specified project milestones.
over the next decade, ongoing field development is expected to
result in the reclassification of additional proved undeveloped
reserves to proved developed.
sgi involves taking a portion of the rich, sour gas separated
from the crude oil production at the sgp processing train and
re-injecting it into the tengiz reservoir. chevron expects that
sgi will have two key effects. first, sgi will reduce the sour
gas processing capacity required at sgp, thereby increasing
liquid production capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur
and gas that would otherwise be generated. second, over time it
is expected that sgi will increase production efficiency and
recoverable volumes due to the maintenance of higher reservoir
pressure from the gas re-injection. between 2007 and 2008, the
company anticipates recognizing additional proved reserves
associated with the sgi expansion. the primary sgi risks include
uncertainties about compressor performance associated with
injecting high-pressure sour gas and subsurface responses to
injection.
essentially all of tcos production is exported through the
caspian pipeline consortium (cpc)pipeline that runs from
tengiz in kazakhstan to tanker loading facilities at
novorossiysk on the russian coast of the black sea. cpc is
working on obtaining shareholder approval for an expansion to
fully accommodate increased tco volumes by 2009. during 2005,
tco sanctioned the crude export project and awarded commercial
contracts, which will provide additional export routes utilizing
rail transportation to the odessa ukraine marine terminal and to
marine terminals in aktau, kazakhstan. in conjunction with
existing cpc capacity, the crude export project is expected to
provide tco with sufficient capacity to export all tco
production, including volumes produced by sgi/ sgp, prior to
expansion of the cpc pipeline.
venezuela: chevron has a 30percent interest in the
hamaca heavy oil production and upgrading project located in
venezuelas orinoco belt. the crude oil upgrading began in
october 2004. in the first quarter 2005, the facility reached
total design capacity of processing and upgrading
190,000barrels per day of heavy crude oil (8.5 api)
into 180,000barrels of lighter, higher-value crude oil
(26 api). in 2005, net production averaged
41,000barrels of oil-equivalent per day.
petroleum sale of natural gas and natural gas
liquids
the company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its
producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. outside the united states, the majority of the
companys natural gas sales occur in thailand, the united
kingdom, australia, and latin america, and in the companys
affiliate operations in kazakhstan. international natural gas
liquids sales take place in africa, australia and europe. refer
to selected operating data, on page
fs-12 in
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations, for further information on the
companys natural gas and natural gas liquids sales volumes.
petroleum refining operations
at the end of 2005, the companys refining system consisted
of 19 fuel refineries and an asphalt plant. the company operated
nine of these facilities, and 11 were operated by affiliated
companies. for these 20 facilities, crude oil distillation
capacity utilization averaged 86percent in 2005, compared
with 89percent in 2004. in general, this decrease resulted
from planned and unplanned downtime as well as the impact of two
hurricanes in the third quarter 2005. at the u.s.fuel
refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged
90percent in 2005, compared with 96percent in 2004,
and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged
76percent and 88percent in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. cracking and coking units, including fluid
catalytic cracking units, are the primary facilities used in
fuel refineries to convert heavier products to gasoline and
other light products.
in 2005, the company began an expansion of the pascagoula,
mississippi, refinerys fluid catalytic cracking unit to
increase its production of gasoline and other light products.
additionally, gs caltex, the companys
50percent-owned affiliate, approved an upgrade project at
the
650,000-barrel-per-day
yeosu refining complex in south korea. at a total estimated cost
of $1.5billion, this project is designed to increase the
yield of high-value refined products and reduce feedstock costs
through the processing of heavy crude oil.
start-up of these two
projects is expected in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

federal law requires that cargo transported between
u.s.ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
united states, owned and operated by u.s.entities and
manned by u.s.crews. at year-end 2005, the companys
u.s.flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting
refined products between the gulf coast and the east coast, and
from california refineries to terminals on the west coast and in
alaska and hawaii.
the international flag vessels were engaged primarily in
transporting crude oil from the middle east, indonesia, mexico
and west africa to ports in the united states, europe and asia.
refined products were also transported by tanker worldwide.
in addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural
gas(lng) tankers transporting cargoes for the north west
shelf(nws) project in australia. additionally, the nws
project has two lng tankers under long-term time charter. in
2005, the company placed orders for two additional lng tankers
to support planned growth in the companys lng business.
these carriers are planned to be delivered in 2009.
the federal oil pollution act of 1990 requires the scheduled
phase-out, by year-end 2010, of all single-hull tankers trading
to u.s.ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
u.s.exclusive economic zone. this has raised the demand
for double-hull tankers. by the end of 2005, chevron had a total
of 20company-operated double-hull tankers in operation.
the company is a member of many oil-spill-response cooperatives
in areas around the world in which it operates.
chemicals
chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) is equally owned
with conocophillips corporation. cpchem owns or has joint

coal and other minerals
the companys coal mining and marketing subsidiary, the
pittsburg& midway coal mining co.(p&m),
owned and operated two surface mines, mckinley, in new mexico,
and kemmerer, in wyoming, and one underground mine, north river,
in alabama, at year-end 2005. final reclamation activities were
completed at the york canyon surface mine located in new mexico,
and reclamation activities continued in 2006 at the farco
surface mine in texas. chevron sold its 30percent interest
in inter-american coal holding n.v. in late 2005. sales of coal
from p&ms wholly owned mines and from its affiliates
were 14.1million tons, relatively unchanged from 2004.
at year-end 2005, p&m controlled approximately
235million tons of developed and undeveloped coal reserves
in the united states, including reserves of environmentally
desirable low-sulfur coal. the company is contractually

chicago carbon company that operates a
250,000-ton-per-year
petroleum coke calciner facility in illinois.
synthetic crude oil
in canada, chevron holds a 20percent nonoperated interest
in the athabasca oil sands project(aosp). bitumen is
extracted from oil sands and upgraded into synthetic crude oil
using hydroprocessing technology. the integrated operation at
aosp commenced in 2003 with
ramp-up of production
substantially completed in 2005. total 2005 bitumen production
averaged 158,000barrels per day (about 32,000net
barrels). net proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2005 were
146million barrels.
in early 2006, the company was evaluating feasibility of a
proposed aosp expansion. the expansion would be designed to
produce approximately 100,000barrels of bitumen per day
(20,000net barrels) and upgrade it into synthetic crude
oil. if the aosp expansion project proceeds, first production is
expected in late 2009. no proved oil sands reserves have been
recorded in association with this expansion.

global power generation
chevrons global power generation(gpg) business has
more than 20years experience in developing and operating
commercial power projects and owns 16 power assets located in
the united states and asia. gpg manages the production of more
than 3,500 megawatts of electricity at 13 facilities it owns
through joint ventures. the company operates gas-fired
cogeneration facilities that use waste heat recovery to produce
additional electricity or to support industrial thermal hosts. a
number of the facilities produce steam for use in upstream
operations to facilitate production of heavy oil.
in 2005, the company acquired an additional 13percent in
the tri energy company, a 700-megawatt independent power
producer located in ratchaburi province, thailand, increasing
chevrons total ownership to 50percent.
gas-to-liquids
the sasol chevron global 50-50 joint venture was established in
october 2000 to develop a worldwide
gas-to-liquids(gtl)
business. through this venture, the company is engaged in
discussions with qatar petroleum(qp) on a number of
projects, which include the design, construction and operation
of a base oils production facility downstream of the sasol and
qp oryx gtl plant in qatar, and evaluation of an expansion of
the oryx gtl foundation plant from 34,000 to
100,000barrels per day.
in nigeria, the chevron nigeria limited and the nigerian
national petroleum corporation are developing a
34,000-barrel-per-day gtl facility at escravos that will process
natural gas supplied from the output of the phase3
expansion of the escravos gas plant (egp). the $1.7billion
engineering, procurement and construction contract was awarded
in april 2005. plant construction began in 2005, including major
equipment fabrication and site preparation. refer also to
page16 for a discussion on the egp phase3 expansion.
chevron energy solutions
chevron energy solutions(ces) is a wholly owned subsidiary
that provides public institutions and businesses with projects
that are designed to increase energy efficiency, reduce energy
costs and ensure reliable, high-quality power for critical
operations. ces has offices in the united states and has
energy-saving projects installed in more than a thousand
buildings nationwide.
research and technology
the companys energy technology company delivers integrated
technologies and services to the upstream, downstream and
gas-based businesses. these activities include exploration and
production systems, reservoir management and optimization, heavy
oil recovery and upgrading,
gas-to-liquids
processing, improved refining processes, safe, incident-free
plant operations, and technical computing. the information
technology company provides a standardized digital
infrastructure as well as information management and security
for the companys global operations.
chevrons technology ventures company(ctv)
identifies, grows and commercializes emerging technologies that
have the potential to transform how energy is produced or
consumed. ctvs activities range from early-stage investing
of venture capital in emerging technologies to developing joint
venture companies in new energy systems, such as hydrogen
infrastructure, advanced batteries, nano-materials and renewable
energy applications.
chevrons research and development expenses were
$316million, $242million and $228million for
the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
because some of the investments the company makes in the areas
described above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, ultimate success is not certain. although not all
initiatives may prove to be economically viable, the
companys overall investment in this area is not
significant to the companys consolidated financial
position.
environmental protection
virtually all aspects of the companys businesses are
subject to various federal, state and local environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to change and increase in both number
table of contents
and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the
company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.
chevron expects more environmental-related regulations in the
countries where it has operations. most of the costs of
complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its
operations are embedded in the normal costs of conducting
business.
in 2005, the companys u.s.capitalized environmental
expenditures were $227million, which includes
$2million for unocal activities for the last five months
of 2005 and which represents approximately 6percent of the
companys total consolidated u.s.capital and
exploratory expenditures. these environmental expenditures
include capital outlays to retrofit existing facilities, as well
as those associated with new facilities. the expenditures are
predominantly in the upstream and downstream segments and relate
mostly to air- and water-quality projects and activities at the
companys refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and
marketing facilities. for 2006, the company estimates
u.s.capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities will be approximately $452million. the future
annual capital costs of fulfilling this commitment are uncertain
and will be governed by several factors, including future
changes to regulatory requirements.

chevron and on the companys 2005 environmental
expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
reserves are contained in managements discussion and

item1a.risk
factors
chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a
diversified business portfolio, strong balance sheet, and a
history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. nevertheless,
some inherent risks could materially impact the companys
financial results of operations or financial condition.
chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
prices.
chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the
companys results of operations is crude oil prices. except
in the ordinary course of running an integrated petroleum
business, chevron does not seek to hedge its exposure to price
changes. a significant, persistent decline in crude oil prices
may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
and its capital and exploratory expenditure plans.
the scope of chevrons business will decline if the
company does not successfully develop resources.
the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron
is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
produces with good prospects for future production, the
companys business will decline. creating and maintaining
an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including
obtaining rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons in
promising areas, drilling success, ability to bring long
lead-time, capital intensive projects to completion on budget
and schedule, and efficient and profitable operation of mature
properties.
the companys operations could be disrupted by
natural or human factors.
chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
inhospitable regions. the companys operations and
facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes, including hurricanes, earthquakes,
table of contents
floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and
other political events, fires and explosions, any of which could
result in suspension of operations, or harm to people or the
natural environment.
chevrons business subjects the company to liability
risks.
the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
companys business. chevron operations also produce
byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. any of these
activities could result in liability, either as a result of an
accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
on the effects of the companys operations on human health
or the environment.
political instability could harm chevrons
business.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
host governments to increase public ownership of the
companys partially- or wholly owned businesses, and/or to
impose additional taxes or royalties.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed
restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others, political
conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of
employees and the companys continued presence in those
countries. internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other
governments may affect the companys operations. those
developments have, at times, significantly affected the
companys related operations and results, and are carefully
considered by management when evaluating the level of current
and future activity in such countries. at december31,
2005, approximately 23percent of the companys proved
reserves were located in kazakhstan. the company also has
significant interests in organization of petroleum exporting
countries (opec)-member countries including indonesia, nigeria
and venezuela. approximately 22percent of the
companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were
located in opec countries at december31, 2005.

legal proceedings
the south coast air quality management district(aqmd) has
issued several notices of violation to the chevron products
company, a division of chevron u.s.a., inc, alleging more than
160 violations of the aqmds rule463, which regulates
emissions from floating roof tanks, at the companys el
segundo, california, refinery, as previously reported in the
companys quarterly report on
form10-q for the
period ended september30, 2005. it was also noted that in
august 2005, the aqmd contacted the company to ask that these
violations be consolidated with a newly discovered matter
involving alleged violations of the aqmds rule1173
concerning leak detection and repair of components that emit
volatile organic compounds. the company has settled these
matters by agreeing to pay a civil penalty of $5million
and $1.5million in emission fees.

net income in 2003 included a $196million charge for the cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principle. the primary change related to the companys adoption of financial accounting
standards board statement no.143, accounting for asset retirement obligations, which is
discussed in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements. net income in 2004 included gains of
approximately $1.2billion relating to the sale of nonstrategic upstream properties. refer also to
the results of operations section beginning on page fs-7 for a detailed discussion of financial
results by major operating area for the three years ending december31, 2005.
business environment and outlook
the companys current and future earnings depend largely on the profitability of the upstream
(exploration and production) and downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) business
segments. the single biggest factor that affects the results of operations for both segments is
movement in the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost
component of refined products. overall earnings trends are typically less affected by results from
the companys chemical business and other activities and investments. earnings for the company in
any period may also be affected by events or transactions that are infrequent and/or unusual in
nature.
the companys long-term competitive position, particularly given the capital-intensive and
commodity-based nature of the industry, is closely associated with the companys ability to invest
in projects that provide adequate financial returns and to manage operating expenses effectively.
creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining
rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas, developing and producing hydrocarbons in promising
areas, drilling successfully, bringing long-lead time capital-intensive projects to completion on
budget and on schedule, and operating mature upstream properties efficiently and profitably.
the company also continuously evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not key to
providing long-term value, or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to
help augment the companys growth. asset-disposition and restructuring may occur in future periods
and could result in significant gains or losses.
in august2005, the company acquired unocal corporation (unocal), an independent oil and gas
exploration and production company. the aggregate purchase price was $17.3billion, which included
$7.5billion cash, approximately 169million shares of chevron common stock valued at $9.6billion,
and $0.2billion for stock options on approximately 5million shares and merger-related fees. refer
to note 2, beginning on page fs-36, for a discussion of the unocal acquisition.
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:
upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price
levels for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external
factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global
economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of
petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel
prices, and regional supply interruptions that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest
or political uncertainty.
fs-2
table of contents
moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit the companys production capacity in an
affected region. the company monitors developments closely in the countries in which it operates
and holds investments, and attempts to manage risks in operating its facilities and business.
price levels for capitalized costs and operating expenses associated with the efficient
production of crude oil and natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the
companys control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation but also
prices charged by the industrys product- and service-providers, which can be affected by the
volatility of the industrys own supply and demand conditions for such products and services. the
oil and gas industry
worldwide experienced significant price increases for these items during 2005 that are expected to
continue into 2006. capitalized costs and operating expenses can also be affected by uninsured
damages to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.
industry price levels for crude oil continued an upward trend in 2005. the spot price for west
texas intermediate (wti)crude oil, one of the benchmark crudes, averaged $57 per barrel in 2005,
an increase of approximately $16 per barrel from the 2004 average price. the wti spot price for the
first two months of 2006 averaged about $64 per barrel. the rise in crude oil prices reflects,
among other things, increasing demand in growing economies, the heightened level of geopolitical
uncertainty in some areas of the world and supply concerns in other key producing regions,
including production in the gulf of mexico that partially was shut in following the hurricanes.
as was the case in 2004, the differential in prices between high-quality, light-sweet crude
oils, such as the u.s. benchmark wti, and heavier crudes was unusually wide in 2005. chevron
produces heavy crude oil in california, chad, indonesia, the partitioned neutral zone (between
saudi arabia and kuwait), venezuela (including volumes produced under an operating service
agreement) and certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom north sea. the price for the
heavier crudes has been dampened because of
ample supply, together with lower relative demand from the number of refineries that are able
to process this lower-quality feedstock into light-product fuels (i.e., motor gasoline, jet fuel,
aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the demand for heavy crude was further reduced in late 2005 as
refining capacity along the u.s. gulf coast was interrupted by hurricanes. the price for
higher-quality light oil, on the other hand, has remained high, as the demand for light products,
which can be manufactured by any refinery from light oil, has been robust worldwide.
natural gas prices, particularly in the united states, also trended upward in 2005. for the
full year, u.s. benchmark prices at henry hub averaged about $8 per thousand cubic feet (mcf),
compared with about $6 in 2004. henry hub spot prices peaked in december2005 above $14, as
supplies early in the winter heating season were reduced by production shut in following hurricanes
katrina and rita. by mid-february2006, prices had moved downward to about $8 per mcf. fluctuations
in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with the volumes produced
in north america and the inventory in underground storage to meet customer demand.
in contrast to the united states, certain other regions of the world in which the company
operates have different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances, typically resulting in significantly
lower average sales prices for the companys production of natural gas. (refer to page fs-12
for the companys average natural gas prices for the u.s. and international regions.) additionally,
excess supply conditions that exist in certain parts of the world cannot easily serve to mitigate the
relatively high-price conditions in the united states and other markets because of
lack of infrastructure and the difficulties in transporting natural gas. to help address this
fs-3
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
regional imbalance between supply and demand for natural gas, chevron is planning increased
investments in long-term projects in areas of excess supply to install infrastructure to produce
and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker, along with investments and commitments to regasify
the product in markets where demand is strong and supplies are not as plentiful. due to the significance
of the overall investment in these long-term projects, the natural gas sales prices in the
areas of excess supply (before the natural gas is transferred to a company-owned or third-party
processing facility) are expected to remain well below sales prices for natural gas that is
produced much nearer to areas of high demand and that can be transported in existing natural gas
pipeline networks (as in the united states).
longer-term trends in earnings for the upstream segment are also a function of other factors
besides price fluctuations, including changes in the companys crude oil and natural gas
production levels and the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil
and natural gas reserves. most of the companys overall capital investment is in its upstream
businesses, particularly outside the united states. investments in upstream projects generally are
made well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production.
chevrons worldwide net oil-equivalent production of approximately 2.5million barrels per day
in 2005, including volumes produced from oil sands and production under an operating service
agreement, remained essentially unchanged from 2004. however, production in the fourth quarter 2005
was nearly 2.7million barrels per day, reflecting the benefit of volumes associated with the
properties acquired from unocal, the effect of which was partially offset by production shut in as
a result of the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico. prior to the hurricanes in august and september
2005, oil-equivalent production in the gulf of mexico was approximately 300,000 barrels per day. in
2006, production is projected to average approximately 200,000 barrels per day, as normal field
declines are expected to exceed the production being restored from wells that were shut in or
damaged from the hurricanes and the production that will result from the drilling of new wells in
the area. approximately 20,000 net oil-equivalent barrels of daily production are not expected to
be sufficiently economic to restore. refer also to pages 11 through 24 for additional discussion
and detail of production volumes worldwide.
the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2006 will average between 2.7million
and 2.8million barrels per day. however, future estimates are subject to many uncertainties,
including quotas that may be imposed by opec, the price effect on production volumes calculated
under cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, severe weather, and the
potential for local civil unrest and changing geopolitics that could cause production
disruptions. approximately 26percent of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2005,
including net barrels from oil sands and production under an operating service agreement, occurred
in the opec-member countries of indonesia, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned neutral
zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. although the companys production level during 2005 was not
constrained in these areas by opec quotas, future production could be affected by opec-imposed
limitations. future production levels also are affected by the size and number of economic
investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial
exploration and the beginning of production. refer to pages fs-5 through fs-7 for discussion of the
companys major upstream projects.
in certain onshore areas of nigeria, approximately 45,000 barrels per day of the companys net
production capacity was shut in during 2003 because of civil unrest and damage to production
facilities. the company has adopted a phased plan to restore these operations, and about one-third
of the volumes had been returned to production as of early 2006.
refer to pages fs-7 through fs-9 for additional discussion of the companys upstream
operations.
downstream refining, marketing and transportation earnings are closely tied to
global and regional supply and demand for refined products and the associated effects on industry
refining and marketing margins. the companys core marketing areas are the west coast of north
america, the u.s. gulf coast, latin america, asia and sub-saharan africa. in 2005, industry refining
margins improved over the prior year, reflecting strong demand for refined products;
however, marketing margins, which are highly influenced by regional market conditions, were mixed.
many regions experienced stronger marketing margins, but these margins were generally lower in the
united states and europe, as retail prices did not keep pace with rising crude oil and spot product
prices. industry margins in the future may be volatile, due primarily to changes in the price of
crude oil used for refinery feedstock, disruptions at refineries resulting from maintenance
programs and mishaps and levels of inventory and demand for refined products.
other influences on the companys profitability in this segment include the operating efficiencies
and expenses of the refinery network, including the effects of any downtime due to
planned and unplanned maintenance, refinery upgrade projects and operating incidents. the level of
operating expenses for the downstream segment can also be affected by the volatility of charter
expenses for the companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude
oil and product tankers. other factors affecting the companys downstream profitability that are
beyond the
fs-4
table of contents
companys control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the
refinery network.
refer to pages fs-9 through fs-10 for additional discussion of the companys downstream
operations.
chemicals earnings in the petrochemicals business are closely tied to global
chemical demand, industry inventory levels and plant capacity utilization. additionally, feedstock
and fuel costs, which tend to follow crude oil and natural gas price movements, influence earnings
in this segment.
refer to page fs-10 for additional discussion of chemical earnings for both the companys
oronite subsidiary and the 50percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc.
operating developments
key operating developments and other events during 2005 and early 2006 included:
upstream
worldwide proved reserves as a result of the acquisition of unocal in august2005, the company increased its net oil-equivalent proved reserves by approximately 1.5billion barrels. significant unproved volumes of oil and
gas were also added to the companys resource base. (refer to pages fs-70 through fs-75 for a detailed discussion of proved reserve changes for 2005 and note 2
beginning on page fs-36 for a discussion of the unocal acquisition.)
north america in september2005, the company sold northrock resources limited, a
wholly owned canadian subsidiary of unocal, for $1.7billion. the disposition was consistent with
chevrons divestiture in 2004 of its conventional crude oil and natural gas business in western canada,
enabling the companys continued focus on the profitable growth of production of crude oil and
natural gas in strategically important core areas of operation.
in late 2005, the company began construction of the floating production facility to be
installed in the tahiti field, in the deepwater gulf of mexico. tahiti is anticipated to have a
maximum total daily production of 125,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 70million cubic feet of
natural gas. chevron is the operator and holds a 58percent working interest in the project that is
being developed in phases and expected to come onto production in 2008.
in the same period, the decision was made to proceed with the development of the blind
faith field, also in the deepwater gulf of mexico. first production is expected in 2008, with
initial total daily output estimated at 30,000 barrels of crude oil and 30million cubic feet of
natural gas. chevron is the operator and holds a 62.5percent working interest in the project.
in late 2005, the company drilled deepwater crude oil discoveries in the gulf of mexico at the
60percent-owned and operated big foot prospect in the walker ridge block 29 and the 25
percent-owned, nonoperated knotty head prospect located in green canyon block 512. additional
appraisal activity continued into 2006 at both locations.
angola in early 2006, first oil was produced from the 31percent-interest deepwater
belize field in block 14, offshore angola. the benguela, belize, lobito and tomboco fields form a
project that is being developed in two phases. the maximum total production from both phases of the
project is anticipated to reach 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2008.
australia in mid-2005, the company won exploration rights to four deepwater blocks
in the northern carnarvon basin offshore western australia. in early 2006, the company was awarded
rights to another block in the carnarvon basin. the blocks are located in an area of significant
natural gas potential and near the chevron-led gorgon project. chevron holds a 50percent operated
interest in the blocks.
kazakhstan in late 2005, the companys 50percent-owned tengizchevroil (tco)affiliate awarded commercial contracts to enable increased crude-oil exports through a southern route
across the caspian sea. the southern route will provide additional export capacity for tcos
increased production until the caspian pipeline consortium pipeline is expanded. the additional
crude oil production at tco will result from major facilities-expansion projects being constructed
at a total cost of approximately $5.5billion. by the third quarter 2007, tcos crude production
capacity is projected to increase from the current capacity of 300,000 barrels per day to between
460,000 and 550,000.
nigeria in early 2005, a construction contract was awarded for the $1.1billion floating production, storage and offloading (fpso)vessel to be used at the agbami field. the
construction contract was a key milestone in the development of the 68percent-owned agbami field,
which is scheduled to come online in 2008 with an estimated maximum total daily production of
250,000 barrels of crude oil.
nigeria  so tom e prncipe joint development zone (jdz) in early 2005, the
company signed a production-sharing contract for block 1 in the nigeria-so tom e prncipe jdz.
chevron will be the operator and has a 51percent interest in the block. drilling of the first
exploration well was under way in late-february2006.
venezuela in june2005, the company discovered natural gas in block 3 of plataforma
deltana, offshore venezuela. the site is in the proximity of the loran natural gas field in block
2 and provides sufficient resources for a detailed evaluation of venezuelas first liquefied
natural gas (lng)train.
fs-5
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
in the third quarter 2005, the company was awarded an exploration license for the cardon
iii block, offshore western venezuela. the block is in a region with natural gas potential to the
north of the maracaibo producing area.
in december2005, chevron signed a transition agreement with petrleos de venezuela, s.a.
(pdvsa), the venezuelan state-owned petroleum company, to convert contracts for the boscan and
ll-652 operating service agreements into an empresa mixta (em). the em is a joint-stock contractual
structure with pdvsa as the majority shareholder. negotiation of the ownership and format of the final em structure will be conducted during 2006. possible financial implications of the em
structure are uncertain, but are not expected to have a material effect on the companys
consolidated financial position or liquidity.
global natural gas projects in angola, the company awarded contracts in april2005
for front-end engineering and design studies for a multi-billion-dollar onshore lng project located
in northern angola. this project will be designed to help reduce flaring of natural gas and
represents a major step toward the commercialization of some of angolas vast natural gas
resources. the company has a 36percent ownership interest in the angola lng project and will
co-lead development with the angolan governments national oil company. construction is expected to
begin in 2007.
in april2005, the company reached an agreement with joint-venture participants in the greater
gorgon area, offshore western australia that will enable the combined development of natural
gas at gorgon and nearby gas fields as one project. the company is a significant holder of gas
resources in the area and will have an approximate 50percent ownership interest across most of the
greater gorgon area.
in june2005, the company announced the decision to move the australian greater gorgon gas
development project into the front-end engineering and design phase for a two-train (10million
metric tons per year) lng facility and a potential domestic gas plant on barrow island, targeting
initial production by 2010. chevron is the operator and has a 50percent ownership interest in the
licenses for the greater gorgon area.
in the fourth quarter 2005, the company signed a heads of agreement (hoa)for first sale of
lng from the gorgon project into japan, the worlds largest lng market. the preliminary agreement
was signed by chevron australia pty ltd with tokyo gas co. ltd, a major japanese utility company,
for the purchase of 1.2million metric tons per year of gorgon lng over 25years. two additional
hoas were later signed by chevron australia pty ltd with chubu electric co. inc and osaka gas co.
ltd, both companies from japan. each preliminary agreement was for the purchase of 1.5million
metric tons per year of gorgon lng over 25years commencing in 2010 and 2011, respectively.
the company and its partners in the north west shelf (nws)venture agreed in mid-2005 to
expand the projects onshore lng facilities in western australia. chevron holds a one-sixth
interest in the nws venture. the $1.5billion project includes adding a fifth train that will
increase lng export capacity by more than 4million metric tons per year to approximately 16
million metric tons per year, with startup expected in 2008. in december2005, the nws joint
venture participants approved development of the angel natural gas field, which will provide the
natural gas supply for the train 5 expansion.
in nigeria, the company awarded a $1.7billion contract in april2005 for the engineering,
procurement and construction of the escravos gas-to-liquids project. plant construction began in
2005 including major equipment fabrication and site preparation.
in the third quarter 2005, installation began on a 350-mile main offshore segment of the west
african gas pipeline that will provide natural gas to markets in ghana, togo and benin by
connecting to an existing onshore pipeline in nigeria. the pipeline will have a capacity of
approximately 475million cubic feet per day and will help in the reduction of the flaring of
natural gas in the companys areas of operation.
in russia, oao gazprom has included chevron on a list of companies that could continue further
commercial and technical discussions concerning the development and related commercial activities
of the shtokmanovskoye field. discussions were under way in early 2006, but the timing of gazproms
selection of the company or companies that will participate in the field development was
uncertain. shtokmanovskoye is a very large natural gas field offshore russia in the barents sea.
oao gazprom is russias largest natural gas producer.
in the united states, chevron completed the acquisition of the remaining 40percent interest
of bridgeline holdings, l.p. in august2005. bridgeline manages and operates more than 1,000 miles
of pipeline and 12billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity in southern louisiana.
in the third quarter 2005, the company filed an application with the federal energy
regulatory commission to own, construct and operate a natural gas import terminal at the casotte
landing site adjacent to chevrons refinery in pascagoula, mississippi. the terminal will be
designed to initially process 1.3billion cubic feet of natural gas per day from imported lng.
in the fourth quarter 2005, the company committed to pipeline and additional lng terminal
capacity in the sabine pass area of louisiana. the first commitment was for 1billion cubic feet
per day of pipeline capacity in a new pipeline and additional interconnect capacity to an existing
pipeline. the company also exercised its option to increase capacity at
fs-6
table of contents
a sabine pass lng terminal from 700million to 1billion cubic feet per day.
downstream
united states the company initiated a project to increase the capacity of the
pascagoula, mississippi, refinerys fluid catalytic cracking unit by approximately 25percent,
from a current capacity of 63,000 barrels per day. this project is designed to enable the refinery
to increase its production of gasoline and other light products and is expected to be completed by
late 2006.
south korea the companys 50percent-owned gs caltex affiliate announced a major
upgrade project at its 650,000-barrel-per-day yeosu refining complex. at an estimated total cost
of $1.5billion, the facilities will increase the yield of high-value refined products and reduce
feedstock costs through the processing of heavy crude oil. start-up is expected by the end of 2007.
chemicals
qatar the companys 50percent-owned affiliate, chevron phillips chemical company
llc (cpchem), has obtained approvals and completed the financial closing for the q-chem ii complex
to be located next to the existing q-chem i complex in mesaieed, qatar. the q-chem ii complex will
include a 350,000-metric-ton-per-year polyethylene plant and a 345,000-metric-ton-per-year normal
alpha olefins plant. the project also includes a separate joint venture to develop a
1,300,000-metric-ton-per-year ethylene cracker at qatars ras laffan industrial city. cpchem and
its partners expect to start-up the cracker and derivatives plants in late 2008. cpchem owns a 49
percent interest of q-chem ii.
other
common stock dividends and stock repurchase program in april2005, the company
increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 12.5percent to $0.45 per share. the company
completed an authorized $5billion of stock buybacks in november2005 under a repurchase program
initiated in april2004. upon completion of this program, the company then authorized the
acquisition of up to $5billion of additional shares over a period of up to three years. purchases
under this authorization totaled $481million through mid-february2006.
results of operations
major operating areas the following section presents the results of operations for
the companys business segments  upstream, downstream and chemicals  as well as for all other,
which includes mining operations of coal and other minerals, power generation businesses, and the
various companies and departments that are managed at the corporate level. income is also presented
for the u.s. and international geographic areas of the upstream and downstream business segments.
(refer to note 8, beginning on page fs-40, for a discussion of the companys reportable segments,
as defined in fas 131, disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.)
to aid in the understanding of changes in income between periods, the discussion, when
applicable, is in two parts  first on underlying trends, and second on special-item gains and
charges. the special items are identified separately because of their nature and amount and also
to help discern the underlying trends for the companys businesses. this section should also be

u.s. upstream income of nearly $4.2billion in 2005 increased $230million. the amount in
2004 included net special-item benefits (discussed below) of more than $300million. higher prices
for crude oil and natural gas in 2005 and earnings from the former unocal operations contributed
approximately $2billion to the increase between periods. approximately 90percent of this amount
related to the effects of higher prices on heritage-chevron production. these benefits were
partially offset by the adverse effects of lower production (discussed below), higher operating
expenses and higher depreciation expense associated with heritage-chevron properties.
income of $3.9billion in 2004 was $1.1billion higher than the $2.8billion recorded in 2003.
of this increase, $725million resulted from the difference in the effect on earnings in the
respective periods from special items and the cumulative-effect charges recorded in 2003 for the
implementation of a new accounting standard. (refer to note 24, beginning on page fs-59, for a
discussion of fas 143, accounting for asset retirement obligations.) the balance of the increase from 2003 to
2004 was composed of about a $1billion benefit from higher prices for crude oil and natural gas
that was partially offset by the effect of lower production.
the companys average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2005 was $46.97 per
barrel, compared with $34.12 in 2004 and $26.66 in 2003. the average natural gas realization was
$7.43 per thousand cubic feet in 2005, compared with $5.51 and $5.01 in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
net oil-equivalent production in 2005 averaged 727,000 barrels per day, down 11percent from
2004 and 22percent from 2003. the decline between 2004 and 2005 was the result of the effects of
hurricanes, property sales and normal field declines, which were partially offset by the benefit
of
fs-7

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
five months of production in 2005 from properties acquired from unocal. the lower production
between 2003 and 2004 was associated with property sales, the effects of storms and normal field
declines.
the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2005 averaged 455,000 barrels per
day, a decline of 10percent from 2004 and 19percent from 2003. absent the effects of the unocal
volumes in 2005, property sales and storms, net liquids production in 2005 declined 6percent and
11percent from 2004 and 2003, respectively.
net natural gas production averaged 1.6billion cubic feet per day in 2005, down 13percent
and 27percent from 2004 and 2003, respectively. excluding the unocal volumes in 2005, the effects
of property sales and shut-in production related to storms, net natural gas production in 2005
declined 10percent from 2004 and 20percent from 2003.
refer to the selected operating data table, on page fs-12, for the three-year comparative
production volumes in the united states.
no special items were recorded in 2005. special items in 2004 included gains of $366million
from property sales, partially offset by charges of $55million due to an adverse litigation
matter. net special charges of $64million in 2003 were composed of charges of $103million for
asset impairments, associated mainly with the write-down of assets in anticipation of sale; charges
of $38million for restructuring and reorganization, mainly for employee severance costs; and gains
of $77million from property sales.

international upstream income of more than $7.5billion in 2005 increased
$1.7billion from $5.8billion in 2004. higher prices for crude oil and natural gas
in 2005 and earnings from the former unocal operations increased earnings
approximately $2.9billion between periods. about 80percent of this benefit arose
from the effect of higher prices on heritage-chevron production. partially
offsetting these benefits were higher expenses between periods for heritage-chevron
operations for certain income-tax items, including the absence of a $200million
benefit in 2004 relating to changes in income tax laws. the change between years
also reflected the impact of $851million of special-item gains in 2004, while no
special items were recorded in 2005. foreign currency losses in 2004 were $129
million. gains of $14million were recorded in 2005.
income of $5.8billion in 2004 was nearly $2.5billion higher than earnings
recorded in 2003. approximately $900million of the increase was the difference
between the effects in each period from special items (discussed below) and foreign
currency losses. approximately $1.1billion of the increase was associated with
higher prices for crude oil and natural gas. another $400million resulted from
lower income-tax expense between periods, including a benefit of about $200million
in 2004 as a result of changes in income tax laws. partially offsetting these
effects were higher transportation costs in 2006 of about $200million. the balance
of the change between periods was associated with a gain in 2003 from the
implementation of a new accounting standard. (refer to note 24, beginning on page
fs-59, for a discussion of fas 143, accounting for asset retirement obligations.)
net oil-equivalent production of 1.8million barrels per day in 2005, including 143,000 net
barrels per day from oil sands in canada and production under an operating service agreement in
venezuela, increased about 6percent from 2004 and 5percent from 2003. absent the net effect
of increased volumes in 2005 from five months of production from the former unocal
operations, the effect of property

sales and the effect of higher prices on cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions of
certain contracts, oil-equivalent production in 2005 was essentially the same as 2004 and 2003.
the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production was 1.4million barrels per day in
2005, unchanged from 2004 and 2003. excluding the effects of unocal production, property sales and
the effect of higher prices on cost-recovery and variable-royalty volumes, 2005 net liquids
production was essentially the same as 2004 and decreased 1percent from 2003.
net natural gas production of 2.6billion cubic feet per day in 2005 was up 25percent and 26
percent from 2004 and 2003, respectively. excluding the effect of production from the unocal
properties, production increased 2percent and 3percent from 2004 and 2003, respectively.
refer to the selected operating data table, on page fs-12, for the three-year comparative of
international production volumes.
no special items were recorded in 2005. special-item gains in 2004 included $585million from
the sale of producing properties in western canada and $266million from the sale of other
nonstrategic assets, including the companys operations in the democratic republic of the congo and
a canadian natural-gas processing business. in 2003, net special-item gains of $98million included
benefits of $150million related to income taxes and property sales, partially offset by asset
impairments and charges for employee termination costs.

u.s. downstream earnings of nearly $1billion in 2005 decreased about $300million from
2004 and were up $500million from 2003. results in 2003 included net special-item charges
(discussed below) of $123million. average refined-product margins in 2005 were higher than in
2004, and margins in 2004 were significantly higher than in 2003. however, the effects of
increased downtime at refineries and other facilities and higher fuel costs dampened earnings in
2005. a portion of the downtime in 2005 was associated with hurricanes in the gulf of mexico. as a
result of the storms, the companys refinery in pascagoula, mississippi, was shut down for more
than a month, and the companys marketing and pipeline operations along the gulf coast were also
disrupted for an extended period.
sales volumes of refined products in 2005 were approximately 1.5million barrels per day, or
about 2percent lower than in 2004. branded gasoline sales volumes of approximately 600,000 barrels
per day increased about 4percent from the 2004 period. in 2004, refined-product sales volumes
increased about 5percent from 2003, primarily due
to higher sales of gasoline, diesel fuel and fuel oil. refer to the selected operating data
table, on page fs-12, for the three-year comparative refined-product sales volumes in the united
states.
in 2003, net special-item charges of $123million included $132million for environmental
remediation and $28million for employee severance costs associated with the global downstream
restructuring and reorganization. these charges were partially offset by net gains of $37million
from asset sales.

the international downstream includes the companys consolidated refining and marketing
businesses, non-u.s. shipping operations, non-u.s. supply and trading activities, and equity
earnings of affiliates, primarily in the asia-pacific region.
income of nearly $1.8billion in 2005 decreased 10percent from $2billion in 2004 but was up
about $1.1billion from 2003. the decrease from the 2004 period was due mainly to lower sales
volumes, higher costs for fuel and transportation, expenses associated with an explosion and fire
at a 40percent-owned, nonoperated terminal in the united kingdom, and tax adjustments in various
countries. these items more than offset an improvement in average refined-product

margins between periods. the $1.3billion increase in income from 2003 to 2004 reflected
significantly higher average refined-product margins in most of the companys operating areas
and higher earnings from international shipping operations. earnings in 2003 also included
special-item charges (discussed below) and foreign currency losses that totaled more than $300
million.
total international refined products sales volumes were 2.3million barrels per day in 2005,
about 4percent lower than 2004. the sales decline was primarily the result of lower gasoline
trading activity and lower fuel-oil sales. refined product sales volume of 2.4million barrels per day in 2004 was about 4
percent higher than 2.3million in 2003. refer to the selected operating data table, on page
fs-12, for the three-year comparative refined-product sales volumes in the international areas.
the special-item charges of $189million in 2003 included the write-down of the batangas refinery in the philippines in advance of its conversion to a product terminal facility, employee
severance costs associated with the global downstream restructuring and reorganization, the
recognition of the impairment of certain assets in anticipation of their sale and the companys
share of losses from an asset sale and asset impairment by an equity affiliate.

the chemicals segment includes the companys oronite subsidiary and the companys 50

results for the companys oronite subsidiary were down due to significantly higher costs for
feedstocks and adverse effects from the shut-down of operations in the u.s. gulf coast due to
hurricanes. earnings in 2005 for cpchem were higher than 2004 on improved margins for commodity
chemicals. results for both businesses in 2005 were dampened by the effects of the u.s. hurricanes. significantly lower earnings in 2003 reflected weak demand for commodity chemicals and industry oversupply conditions in the period.

corporate-level tax adjustments. higher charges in 2005 were associated with environmental
remediation of properties that had been sold or idled and ongoing unocal corporate-level
activities. interest expense also was higher in 2005 due to an increase in interest rates and the
debt assumed with the unocal acquisition.
the improvement between 2003 and 2004 was primarily associated with the companys investment
in dynegy, including gains from the redemption of certain dynegy securities, higher interest
income, lower interest expense and the favorable corporate-level tax adjustments.
net special-item gains in 2003 included a dynegy-related net benefit of $325million, which
was composed of a gain of $365million from the exchange of the companys investment in dynegy
securities that was partially offset by a $40million charge for chevrons share of an asset
impairment by dynegy. other special-item charges were for asset write-downs of $84million,
primarily in chevrons gasification business, and employee severance costs of $16million.

effective income tax rates were 44percent in 2005, 37percent in 2004 and 43percent in
2003, after excluding the effect of net special items. rates were higher in 2005 compared with the
prior year due to the absence of benefits in 2004 from changes in the income tax laws for certain
international operations and an increase in earnings in countries with higher tax rates. as
compared with the effective tax rate in 2003, the effective tax rate in 2004 benefited from
changes in the income tax laws for certain international operations, a change in the mix of
international upstream earnings occurring in countries with different tax rates and favorable
corporate consolidated tax effects. refer also to the discussion of income taxes in note 16 to the

information related to investment in dynegy inc.
at year-end 2005, chevron owned an approximate 24percent equity interest in the common stock
of dynegy, a provider of electricity to markets and customers throughout the united states. the
company also held an investment in dynegy preferred stock.
investment in dynegy common stock at december31, 2005, the carrying value of the
companys investment in dynegy common stock was approximately $300million. this amount was about
$200million below the companys proportionate interest in dynegys underlying net assets. this
difference is primarily the result of write-downs of the investment in 2002 for declines in the
market value of the common shares below the companys carrying value that were deemed to be other
than temporary. the difference had been assigned to the extent practicable to specific dynegy
assets and liabilities, based upon the companys analysis of the various factors associated with
the decline in value of the dynegy shares. the companys equity share of dynegys reported earnings
is adjusted quarterly when appropriate to recognize a portion of the difference between these
allocated values and dynegys historical book values. the market value of the companys investment
in dynegys common stock at the end of 2005 was approximately $470million.
investments in dynegy preferred stock at the end of 2005, the company held $400
million face value of dynegy seriesc convertible preferred stock with a stated maturity of 2033.
the stock is accounted for at its fair value, which was estimated to be $360million at year-end
2005. temporary changes in the estimated fair value of the preferred stock are reported in other
comprehensive income. however, if in any future period a decline in fair value is deemed to be
other than temporary, a charge against income in the period would be recorded. dividends received
from the preferred stock are recorded to income in the period received.
liquidity and capital resources
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total balances were $11.1billion
and $10.7billion at december31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. cash provided by operating
activities in 2005 was $20.1billion, compared with $14.7billion in 2004 and $12.3billion in
2003.
the 2005 increase in cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected higher earnings
in the upstream segment, including earnings from the former unocal operations. cash provided by
operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of $1.0billion, $1.6
billion and $1.4billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. cash provided by investing
activities included proceeds from asset sales of $2.7billion in 2005, $3.7billion in 2004 and
$1.1billion in 2003.
cash provided by operating activities and asset sales during 2005 was sufficient to fund the
companys $8.7billion capital and exploratory program, pay $3.8billion of dividends to
stockholders, repay approximately $970million in long-term debt and repurchase $3billion of
common stock. partial consideration for the acquisition of unocal in august
2005 also included $7.5billion in cash. unocal balances of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities at the acquisition date totaled $1.6billion.
dividends the company paid dividends of approximately $3.8billion in 2005, $3.2
billion in 2004 and $3billion in 2003. in april2005, the company increased its quarterly common
stock dividend by 12.5percent to 45 cents per share.
debt, capital lease and minority interest obligations total debt and capital lease
balances were $12.9billion at december31, 2005, up from $11.3billion at year-end 2004. the 2005
year-end balance included approximately $2.2billion of debt and capital lease obligations assumed
with the acquisition of unocal. the company also had minority interest obligations of $200million,
up from $172million at december31, 2004.
the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of
commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $5.6billion at december31,
2005, unchanged from december31, 2004. of these amounts, $4.9billion and $4.7billion were
reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. at year-end 2005, settlement of
these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2006, as the company
had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on
a long-term basis. the companys practice has been to continually refinance its commercial paper,
maintaining levels it believes appropriate and economic.
at year-end 2005, the company had $4.9billion in committed credit facilities with various
major banks, which permitted the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these
facilities support commercial paper borrowings and also can be used for general corporate purposes.
the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on
substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management
fs-13
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at
interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates
published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no
borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2005. in addition, the company
has three existing effective shelf registration statements on file with the securities and
exchange commission that together would permit additional registered debt offerings up to an
aggregate $3.8billion of debt securities. following the acquisition of unocal, the company
withdrew unocals shelf registration statements.
in october2005, the company fully redeemed the unocal subsidiary pure resources 7.125
percent senior notes due 2011 for $395million. the companys $150million of texaco brasil zero
coupon notes were paid at maturity in november2005. in december2005, the company exercised a
par-call redemption of $200million in texaco capital inc. 5.7percent notes due 2008.
in february2006, the company retired union oil bonds at maturity for approximately $185
million.
texaco capital llc, a wholly owned finance subsidiary, issued deferred preferred shares
seriesc (seriesc) in december1995. in february2005, the company redeemed the seriesc shares
and paid accumulated dividends of approximately $140million.
in january2005, the company contributed $98million to its employee stock ownership plan
(esop)to permit the esop to make a $144million debt service payment, which included a principal
payment of $113million.
in the second quarter 2004, chevron entered into $1billion of interest rate fixed-to-floating
swap transactions, in which the company receives a fixed interest rate and pays a floating
rate, based on the notional principal amounts. under the terms of the swap agreements, of which
$250million and $750million will terminate in september2007 and february2008, respectively, the
net cash settlement will be based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating rate interest
amounts.
chevrons senior debt is rated aa by standard and poors corporation and aa2 by moodys
investors service. the companys senior debt of texaco capital inc. is rated aa3, and union oil
company of california bonds are rated
a1 by moodys. these companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of chevron. the companys u.s.
commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poors and p-1 by moodys, and the companys
canadian commercial paper is rated r-1 (middle)by dominion bond rating service. all of these
ratings denote high-quality investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. further reductions
from debt balances at december31, 2005, are dependent upon many factors, including managements
continuous assessment of debt as an appropriate component of the companys overall capital
structure. the company believes it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash
requirements, and during periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for
refined products and commodity chemicals, the company believes that it has the flexibility to
increase borrowings and/or modify capital-spending plans to continue paying the common stock
dividend and maintain the companys high-quality debt ratings.
common stock repurchase program in connection with a $5billion stock- repurchase
program initiated in april2004, the company acquired 92.1million of its common shares for $5
billion through november2005. during 2005, about 49.8million of common shares were repurchased
under this program for a total cost of $2.9billion.
in december2005, the company authorized the acquisition of up to an additional $5billion of
its common shares from time to time at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other
legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. the program is for a period
of up to three years and may be discontinued at any time. under this program, the company acquired
approximately 1.7million shares in the open market for $100million during december2005.
purchases through mid-february2006 increased the total shares acquired to 8.3million at a cost of
$481million.
capital and exploratory expenditures excluding the $17.3billion acquisition of
unocal corporation, total reported expenditures for 2005 were $11.1billion, including $1.7billion

and 2003, expenditures were $8.3billion and $7.4billion, respectively, including the
companys share of affiliates expenditures of $1.6billion and $1.1billion in the corresponding
periods.
of the $11.1billion in expenditures for 2005, about three-fourths, or $8.4billion, related to upstream activities. approximately the same
percentage was also expended for upstream operations in 2004 and 2003. international
upstream accounted for about 70percent of the worldwide upstream investment in each of the
years, reflecting the companys continuing focus on opportunities that are available outside
the united states.
in 2006, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 33percent higher
at $14.8billion, including spending by affiliates. about three-fourths, or $11.3billion,
is again for exploration and production activities, with $8
billion of that amount outside the united states. spending is primarily targeted for exploratory
prospects in the deepwater gulf of mexico and western africa and major development projects in
angola, nigeria, kazakhstan and the deepwater gulf of mexico. included in the upstream expenditures
is about $1billion to develop the companys international natural gas resource base.
worldwide downstream spending in 2006 is estimated at $2.8billion, with about $1.9billion
for refining and marketing and $900million for supply and transportation projects, including
pipelines to support expanded upstream production. approximately two-thirds of the total projected
spending is outside the united states.
investments in chemicals businesses in 2006 are budgeted at $250million. estimates for energy
technology, information technology and facilities, real estate activities, power-related businesses
and other businesses total approximately $460million.
pension obligations in 2005, the companys pension plan contributions totaled
approximately $1billion, including nearly $200million to the unocal plans. approximately $800
million of the total was contributed to u.s. plans. in 2006, the company estimates contributions
will be $500million. actual amounts are dependent upon plan-investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. refer also to the

debt was higher at the end of 2005 than a year earlier, the debt ratio declined as a result of
higher stockholders equity balances for retained earnings and the capital stock that was issued in
connection with the unocal acquisition. the decline in the debt ratio between 2003 and 2004 was
primarily due to lower debt levels and higher retained earnings.

the amounts exclude indemnifications of contingencies associated with the sale of the

on page fs-16 through fs-17.
at december31, 2005, the company and its subsidiaries provided guarantees, either
directly or indirectly, of $985million in guarantees for notes and other contractual obligations
of affiliated companies and $294million for third parties as described by major category below.
there are no material amounts being carried as liabilities for the companys obligations under
these guarantees.
of the $985million in guarantees provided to affiliates, $806million relate to borrowings
for capital projects or general corporate purposes. these guarantees were undertaken to achieve
lower interest rates and generally cover the construction period of the capital projects. included
in these amounts are unocal-related guarantees of $230million associated with a construction
completion guarantee for the debt financing of unocals equity interest in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan
(btc)crude oil pipeline project. approximately 95percent of the amounts guaranteed will expire
between 2006 and 2010 with the remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. under the terms of
the guarantees, the company would be required to fulfill the guarantee should an affiliate be in
default of its loan terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. there are no recourse
provisions, and no assets are held as collateral for these guarantees. the remaining balance of
$179million represents obligations in connection with pricing of power-purchase agreements for
certain of the companys cogeneration affiliates. under the terms of these guarantees, the company
may be required to make payments under certain conditions if the affiliates do not perform under
the agreements. there are no recourse provisions to third parties, and no assets are held as
collateral for these pricing guarantees.
guarantees of $294million have been provided to third parties, including guarantees of
approximately $150million related to construction loans to host governments in the companys
international upstream operations. the remaining guarantees of $144million were provided
principally as con-
ditions of sale of the companys interest in certain operations, to provide a source of
liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with company marketing programs. no amounts
of the companys obligations under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities. about 85percent
of the total amounts guaranteed will expire in 2010, with the remainder expiring after 2010. the
company would be required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in
default of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. approximately $85
million of the guarantees have recourse provisions, which enable the company to recover any
payments made under the terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties
assets.
at december31, 2005, chevron also had outstanding guarantees for about $190million of
equilon debt and leases. following the february2002 disposition of its interest in equilon, the
company received an indemnification from shell oil company (shell) for any claims arising from the
guarantees. the company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees. approximately 50percent
of the amounts guaranteed will expire within the 2006 through 2010 period, with the guarantees of
the remaining amounts expiring by 2019.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities
of equilon and motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc. in connection with the february2002 sale
of the companys interests in those investments. the indemnities cover certain contingent
liabilities. the company would be required to perform should the indemnified liabilities become
actual losses. should that occur, the company could be required to make future payments up to $300
million. through the end of 2005, the company paid approximately $38million under these
indemnities. the company expects to receive additional requests for indemnification payments in
the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the periods of texacos ownership interests in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims relating to equilon indemnities must be asserted as early as february2007,
or no later than february2009, and claims relating to motiva must be asserted no later than
february2012. under the terms of the indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of
potential future payments. the company has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims under
these indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the
indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts recovered
from insurance carriers
fs-16

and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or motiva prior to september30, 2001,
for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets of unocals 76 products company business that
existed prior to its sale in 1997. under the terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum limit
on the amount of potential future payments by the company; however, the purchaser shares certain
costs under this indemnity up to an aggregate cap of $200million. claims relating to these
indemnities must be asserted by april2022. through the end of 2005, approximately $113million had
been applied to the cap, which includes payments made by either unocal or chevron totaling $80
million.
securitization the company securitizes certain retail and trade accounts receivable
in its downstream business through the use of qualifying special purpose entities (spes). at
december31, 2005, approximately $1.2billion, representing about 7percent of chevrons total
current accounts receivable balance, were securitized. chevrons total estimated financial
exposure under these securitizations at december31, 2005, was approximately $60million. these arrangements have the effect of
accelerating chevrons collection of the securitized amounts. in the event of the spes
experiencing major defaults in the collection of receivables, chevron believes that it would have
no loss exposure connected with third-party investments in these securitizations.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements and
take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent
liabilities relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput
agreements, and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements.
the agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity,
utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys
business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments
are 2006  $2.2billion; 2007 $1.9billion; 2008  $1.8billion; 2009  $1.8billion; 2010
$0.5billion; 2011 and after  $3.8billion. total payments under the agreements were
approximately $2.1billion in 2005, $1.6billion in 2004, and $1.4billion in 2003. the most
significant take-or-pay agreement calls for the company to purchase approximately 55,000 barrels
per day of refined products from an equity affiliate refiner in thailand. this purchase
agreement is in conjunction with the financing of a refinery owned by the affiliate and expires
in 2009. the future estimated commitments under this contract are: 2006  $1.3billion; 2007
$1.3billion; 2008  $1.3billion; and 2009  $1.3billion. in 2005, under the terms of an
agreement entered in 2004, the company exercised its option to acquire additional regasification
capacity at the sabine pass liquefied natural gas terminal. payments of $2.5billion over the
20-year period are expected to commence in 2009.
minority interests the company has commitments of approximately $200million related
to minority interests in subsidiary companies.

financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the
price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refinery
feed-stock. the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a
portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase
or sale of crude oil; feedstock purchases for company refineries; crude oil and refined products
inventories; and fixed-price contracts to sell natural gas and natural gas liquids.
chevron also
uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes. the results of this activity were not
material to the companys financial position, net income or cash flows in 2005.
the companys positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an internal risk control
group to ensure compliance with the companys risk management policy that has been approved by the
audit committee of the companys board of directors.
the derivative instruments used in the companys risk management and trading activities
consist mainly of futures, options, and swap contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange
and the international petroleum exchange. in addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product
swap contracts and option contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions
and other oil and gas companies in the over-the-counter markets.
virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. fair values are derived principally from market quotes and other independent
third-party quotes.
each hypothetical 10percent increase in the price of natural gas and crude oil would increase
the fair value of the natural gas purchase derivative contracts by approximately $33million and
reduce the fair value of the crude oil sale
fs-17
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
derivative contracts by about $11million. the same hypothetical decrease in the prices of
these commodities would result in the same opposite effects on the fair values of the contracts.
the hypothetical effect on these contracts was estimated by calculating the cash value of the
contracts as the difference between the hypothetical and contract delivery prices multiplied by the
contract amounts.
foreign currency the company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with
terms of 180days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures
include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange contracts are recorded
at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical 10percent increase in the value of the u.s. dollar at
year-end 2005 would be a reduction in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts of
approximately $70million. the effect would be the opposite for a hypothetical 10percent decrease
in the year-end value of the u.s. dollar.
interest rates the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall
strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net cash
settlements are based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts
calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest
rate swaps relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on
the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
at year-end 2005, the weighted average maturity of receive fixed interest rate swaps was
approximately 2years. there were no receive floating swaps outstanding at year end. a
hypothetical increase of 10 basis points in fixed interest rates would reduce the fair value of
the receive fixed swaps by approximately $3million.
for the financial and derivative instruments discussed above, there was not a material change
in market risk between 2005 and 2004.
the hypothetical variances used in this section were selected for illustrative purposes only
and do not represent the companys estimation of market changes. the actual impact of future market
changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those
set forth under the heading risk factors in parti, item1a of the companys 2005 annual report
on form 10-k.
transactions with related parties
chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. these arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements. long-term
purchase agreements are in place with the companys refining affiliate in thailand. refer to page
fs-17 for further discussion. management believes the foregoing agreements and others have been
negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.
litigation and other contingencies
mtbe chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl
tertiary butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive.
chevron is a party to more than 70 lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous
other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines
and the alleged seepage of mtbe into groundwater. resolution of these actions may ultimately
require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior
release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and claims related to the use
of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future.
the companys ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently
determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. the company does not use mtbe in the
manufacture of gasoline in the united states.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental
laws and regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or
ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances,
including mtbe, by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites
including, but not limited to federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, and land development areas, whether
operating, closed or divested.
the following table displays the annual changes to the companys before-tax environmental
remediation reserves, including those for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state
laws.

table of contents
ing but were not limited to, former refineries, transportation and distribution facilities
and service stations; former crude oil and natural gas fields and mining operations, as well as
active mining operations. other liability additions during 2005 for heritage-chevron related
primarily to refined-product marketing sites and various operating, closed or divested facilities
in the united states.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state or
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2005 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
as of december31, 2005, chevron was involved with the remediation activities of 221 sites for
which it had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise by the u.s.
environmental protection
agency (epa) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund
law or analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2005 was
$139million. the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several
liability for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron to
assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or liquidity.
of the remaining year-end 2005 environmental reserves balance of $1,330million, $855million
related to approximately 2,250 sites for the companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries
and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and pipelines.
the remaining $475million was associated with various sites in the international downstream ($101
million), upstream ($257million), chemicals ($50million) and other ($67million). liabilities at
all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the companys
plans and activities to remediate soil and/or groundwater contamination or both. these and other
activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal
of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid
and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural
attenuation of the contaminants.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties. although the amount of future costs may be material to the
companys results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, the company does not
expect these costs will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had,
or will have, any significant impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s.
or international petroleum or chemical companies.
effective january1, 2003, the company implemented financial accounting standards board
statement no.143, accounting for asset retirement
obligations (fas 143). under fas 143, the fair value of
a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when there is a legal obligation
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
the liability balance of $4.3billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2005 related
primarily to upstream and coal properties.
for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals
facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets
reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has
been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of
the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

in 2005 of fin 47, fasb interpretation no.47, accounting for conditional asset retirement
obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no.143 (fin 47), and the discussion of
environmental matters on page fs-21.
income taxes the company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities
quarterly. these liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities
until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated.
the u.s. federal income tax liabilities have been settled through 1996 for chevron corporation
(formerly chevrontexaco corporation) and 1997 for chevron global energy inc. (formerly caltex
corporation), unocal corporation (unocal), and texaco inc. (texaco). the companys california
franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for chevron, 1998 for unocal and through
1987 for texaco. settlement of open tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries where the
company conducts its businesses, is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision
has been made for income and franchise

taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination.
global operations chevron and its affiliates conduct business activities in
approximately 180 countries. areas in which the company and its affiliates have significant
operations or ownership interests include the united states, canada, australia, the united kingdom,
norway, denmark, france, the netherlands, the partitioned neutral zone between kuwait and saudi
arabia, republic of the congo, angola, nigeria, chad, south africa, the democratic republic of the
congo, indonesia, bangladesh, the philippines, myanmar, singapore, china, thailand, vietnam,
cambodia, azerbaijan, kazakhstan, venezuela, argentina, brazil, colombia, trinidad and tobago and
south korea. the companys caspian pipeline consortium (cpc)affiliate operates in russia and
kazakhstan. the companys tengizchevroil affiliate operates in kazakhstan. through an affiliate,
the company participates in the development of the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc)pipeline through
azerbaijan, georgia and turkey. also through an affiliate, the company has an interest in the
chad/cameroon pipeline. the companys petrolera ameriven affiliate operates the hamaca project in
venezuela. the companys chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) affiliate manufactures and
markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a worldwide basis, with manufacturing facilities in the
united states, puerto rico, singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and belgium.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing
economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates,
including the united states. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by host
governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or
assets or to impose additional taxes or royalties on the companys operations or both.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in
others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other governments may affect the companys
operations. those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related
operations and results, and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of
current and future activity in such countries. refer to page fs-6 for a discussion of the companys
transition agreement with petrleos de venezuela, s.a. (pdvsa), the venezuelan state-owned
petroleum company, to convert contracts for the boscan and ll-652 operating service agreements into
an empresa mixta.
suspended wells the company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude oil and natural gas
fields. the ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future
drilling activity, or development decisions or both. if the company decides not to continue
development, the costs of these wells are expensed. at december31, 2005, the company had approximately $1.1billion of suspended
exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of more than $400
million from 2004 and an increase of less than $600million from 2003. of the increase in 2005,
about $300million was the year-end suspended well balance for the former-unocal operations. the
year-end 2005 balance primarily reflects drilling activities in the united states, nigeria and
indonesia.
the future trend of the companys exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. the effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $1.1billion of suspended wells at year-end 2005 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.
refer to note 20, beginning on page fs-49, for additional discussion of suspended wells.
equity redetermination for crude oil and natural gas producing operations, ownership
agreements may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and
natural gas reserves. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses
that could be material to earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process
has been under way since 1996 for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval
petroleum reserve at elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in these
zones were owned by the u.s. department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net
settlement amount for the four zones. chevron currently estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200million. at the same time, a possible maximum net amount
that could be owed to chevron was estimated at about $50million. the timing of the settlement and
the exact amount within this range of estimates are uncertain.
accounting for buy/sell contracts in the first quarter 2005, the securities and
exchange commission (sec)issued comment letters to chevron and other companies in the oil and gas
industry requesting disclosure of information related to the accounting for buy/sell contracts.
under a buy/sell contract, a company agrees to buy a specific quantity and quality of a commodity
to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity
and quality of a commodity at a different location to the same counterparty. physical delivery
occurs for each side of the transaction, and the risk and reward of ownership are evidenced by
title transfer, assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling, credit risk and risk
of nonperfor-
fs-20
table of contents
mance by the counterparty. both parties settle each side of the buy/sell through separate
invoicing.
the company routinely enters into buy/sell contracts, primarily in the united states
downstream business, associated with crude oil and refined products. for crude oil, these
contracts are used to facilitate the companys crude oil marketing activity, which includes the
purchase and sale of crude oil production, fulfillment of the companys supply arrangements as to
physical delivery location and crude oil specifications, and purchase of crude oil to supply the
companys refining system. for refined products, buy/sell arrangements are used to help fulfill
the companys supply agreements to customer locations and specifications.
the company has historically accounted for buy/sell transactions in the consolidated statement
of income the same as for a monetary transaction  purchases are reported as purchased crude oil
and products; sales are reported as sales and other operating revenues. the sec raised the
issue as to whether the accounting for buy/sell contracts should be shown net on the income
statement and accounted for under the provisions of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.
29, accounting for nonmonetary transactions (apb 29). the company understands that
others in the oil and gas industry may report buy/sell transactions on a net basis in the income
statement rather than gross.
the emerging issues task force (eitf)of the fasb deliberated this topic as issue no.04-13,
accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty (eitf 04-13). at its
september2005 meeting, the eitf reached consensus that two or more legally separate exchange
transactions with the same counterparty, including buy/sell transactions, should be combined and
considered as a single arrangement for purposes of applying apb 29 when the transactions were
entered into in contemplation of one another. eitf 04-13 was ratified by the fasb in september
2005 and is effective for new arrangements, or modifications or renewals of existing arrangements,
entered into beginning on or after april1, 2006, which will be the effective date for the
companys adoption of this standard. upon adoption, the company will report the net effect of
buy/sell transactions on its consolidated statement of income as purchased crude oil and products
instead of reporting the revenues associated with these arrangements as sales and other operating
revenues and the costs as purchased crude oil and products.
while this issue was under
deliberation by the eitf, the sec staff directed chevron and other companies to disclose on the
face of the income statement the amounts associated with buy/sell contracts and to discuss in a
footnote to the financial statements the basis for the underlying accounting. the amounts for
buy/sell contracts shown on the companys consolidated statement of income sales and other
operating revenues for the three years ending december31, 2005, were $23,822, $18,650 and
$14,246, respectively. these revenue amounts associated with buy/sell contracts represented 12
percent of total sales and other operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003. nearly all of these
revenue amounts in each period associated with buy/sell contracts pertain to the companys
downstream segment. the costs associated with these
buy/sell revenue amounts are included in purchased crude oil and products on the
consolidated statement of income in each period.
other contingencies chevron receives claims from, and submits claims to, customers,
trading partners, u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies, host governments, contractors,
insurers and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be
significant and may take lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.
accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products,
the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned
facilities and at third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. an obligation may
arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have been
handled or disposed of. most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities
and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable
at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2005 at approximately $1.3billion for its
consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were $341million of environmental capital
expenditures and $979million of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or
elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and
the abandonment and restoration of sites, which includes $14million and $66million, respectively,
for unocal activities for the last five months of 2005.
for 2006, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.1billion.
these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental
regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the

future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the
environment; comply with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and
restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a
material effect on the companys liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted
accounting principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over
different reporting periods. all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates or assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity
and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility
of such matters to change;
2.
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or
operating performance is material.
besides those meeting these critical criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. although
not associated with highly uncertain matters, these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.
for example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be more likely than not.
another example is the estimation of oil and gas reserves under sec rules that require
...geological and engineering data (that)demonstrate with reasonable certainty (reserves)to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions,
i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. refer to table v, reserve quantity
information, beginning on page fs-70, for the changes in these estimates for the three years
ending december31, 2005, and to table vii,
changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves
on page fs-78 for estimates of proved-reserve values for each of the three years ending december
31, 2003 through 2005, which were based on year-end prices at the time. note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, beginning on page fs-34, includes a description of the successful efforts
method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities. the estimates of crude
oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical accounting policy for impairment of property, plant and
equipment and investments in affiliates, on page fs-23, includes reference to conditions under
which downward revisions of proved reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and gas
properties. this commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. significant accounting policies are
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-34. the
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the audit committee of the board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension plan
expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations.
for other postretirement employee benefit (opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care and
life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining opeb expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations and
the assumed health care cost-trend rates used in the calculation of benefit obligations.
note 21, beginning on page fs-50, includes information for the three years ending december31,
2005, on the components of pension and opeb expense and on the underlying assumptions as well as on
the funded status for the companys pension plans at the end of 2005 and 2004.
to estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company employs a rigorous
process that incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future
performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. asset
allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/ liability studies, and the
determination of the companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these
fs-22
table of contents
studies. the expected long-term rate of return on united states pension plan assets, which
account for 72percent of the companys pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8percent since
2002.
the year-end market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market
value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.
the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2005, the company selected a 5.5
percent discount rate based on moodys aa corporate bond index and a cash flow analysis using the
citigroup pension discount curve for the major u.s. pension and postretirement benefit plans. the
discount rates at the end of 2004 and 2003 were 5.8percent and 6percent, respectively.
an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2005 was approximately $600
million. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return
assumption, a 1percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the companys primary
u.s. pension plan, which accounted for about 53percent of the companywide pension obligation,
would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2005 by approximately $50million. a 1percent
increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced total benefit plan expense for
2005 by approximately $130million. the actual rates of return on plan assets and discount rates
may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial
markets.
in 2005, the companys pension plan contributions were approximately $1billion (nearly $800
million to the u.s. plans). in 2006, the company expects contributions to be approximately $500
million. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.
pension expense is recorded on the consolidated statement of income in operating expenses or
selling, general and administrative expenses and applies to all business segments. depending upon
the funding status of the different plans, either a long-term prepaid asset or a long-term
liability is recorded. any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation in excess of recorded
liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income. see note 21 to the consolidated financial
statements, beginning on page fs-50, for the pension-related balance sheet effects at the end of
2005 and 2004.
for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2005 was about $200million and was also
recorded as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses in all business
segments.
effective january1, 2005, the company amended its main u.s. postretirement medical plan to
limit future increases in the company contribution. for current retirees, the increase in company
contribution is capped at 4percent each year. for future retirees, the 4percent cap will be
effective at retirement. for active employees and retirees below age 65 whose claims experiences
are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost trend rates start with 10percent in
2006 and gradually drop to 5percent for 2011 and beyond.
as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2005, a
1percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary u.s. opeb plan, which accounted
for about 80percent of the companywide opeb obligation, would have decreased opeb expense by
approximately $20million.
impairment of property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the
company assesses its property, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
such indicators include changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved
reserve quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the
asset over its fair value.
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles and the outlook for global or regional
market supply and demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions.
the amount and income statement classification of major impairments of pp&e for the three
years ending december31, 2005, are included in the commentary on the business segments elsewhere
in this discussion. an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other
assumptions had been used in the impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable,
given the broad range of the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in the
estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any
assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number
of other assets to become impaired.
investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as
well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are
fs-23
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys
carrying value. when such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is
recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investments carrying value and its
estimated fair value at the time. in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than
temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the
investees financial performance and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment
for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments
market value. differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or
the amount of the impairment and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.
from time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines that no write-down
in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when significant
downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or
concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision was made to sell such assets, that is, the asset is held for sale, and the estimated
proceeds less costs to sell were less than the associated carrying values.
business combinations  purchase-price allocation accounting for business
combinations requires the allocation of the companys purchase price to the various assets and
liabilities of the acquired business at their respective fair values. the company uses all
available information to make these fair value determinations, and for major acquisitions, may hire
an independent appraisal firm to assist in making fair-value estimates. in some instances,
assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with
an asset might have to be used in determining its fair value. actual timing and amount of net cash
flows from revenues and expenses related to that asset over time may differ materially from those
initial estimates, and if the timing is delayed significantly or if the net cash flows decline
significantly, the asset could become impaired.
goodwill when acquired as part of a business combination, goodwill is not subject to
amortization. as required by financial accounting standards board (fasb)statement no.142,
goodwill and other intangible assets, the company will test such goodwill at the reporting unit
level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the
goodwill arising from the unocal acquisition is described in more detail in note 2, beginning on
page fs-36.
contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording
liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can
frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. for example, the costs from settlement of
claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions
on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation;
the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and
improvements in technology.
under the accounting rules, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if
management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally records
these losses as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of income. refer to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this discussion for the effect
on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation and environmental remediation and tax
matters for the three years ended december31, 2005.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

new accounting standards
fasb statement no.151, inventory costs, an amendment of arb no.43, chapter4 (fas 151) in november
2004, the fasb issued fas 151, which became effective for the company on
january1, 2006. the standard amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin (arb)no.43,
chapter4, inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. in addition, the standard requires that allocation
of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the companys
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
eitf issue no.04-6, accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the
mining industry (issue 04-6) in march2005, the fasb ratified the earlier eitf consensus on
issue 04-6, which is effective for the company on january1, 2006. stripping costs are costs of
removing overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits. the consensus calls for
stripping costs incurred once a mine goes into production to be treated as variable production
costs that should be considered a component of mineral inventory cost subject to arb no.43,
restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins. adoption of this accounting for its
coal, oil sands and other mining operations will not have a significant effect on the companys
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevron corporation:
we have completed integrated audits of chevron corporations 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2005,
and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
public company accounting oversight board (united states). our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under
item15(a)(1) of the annual report on form 10-k present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of chevron corporation and its subsidiaries at december31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
december31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. these financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the companys
management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
as discussed in note 24 beginning on page fs-59 to the consolidated financial statements, the
company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations as of january1, 2003.
internal control over financial reporting
also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in the accompanying managements
report on internal control over financial reporting, that the company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of december31, 2005, based on criteria established in
internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the
treadway commission (coso), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
furthermore, in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of december31, 2005, based on criteria established in
internal control  integrated framework issued by the coso. the companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility
is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit of internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting
oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. an audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. we
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

note 1.summary of significant accounting policies
general chevron manages its investments in and provides administrative, financial
and management support to u.s. and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates that engage in fully
integrated petroleum and chemicals operations. in addition, chevron holds investments in businesses
involving power generation, geothermal production, and the mining of coal and other minerals.
collectively, these companies conduct business activities in approximately 180 countries.
exploration and production (upstream)operations consist of exploring for, developing and producing
crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural gas. refining, marketing and transportation
(downstream)operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum products; marketing
crude oil, natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude oil,
natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car.
chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.
the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial
statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.
the nature of the companys operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. the company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent owned and variable interest
entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint
ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and
advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately
20percent to 50percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control
over policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the
company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that
results in changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates
equity currently in income. deferred income taxes are provided for these gains and losses.
investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value
of the investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to
retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
in the investments market value. the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is
not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. subsequent recoveries in the carrying value of
other investments are reported in other comprehensive income.
differences between the companys
carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the
companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. the companys share of the
affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly when appropriate to reflect the difference
between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values.
derivatives the majority of the companys activity in commodity derivative instruments is
intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative
activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company
may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative
instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the
company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected
in current income. for the companys trading activity, gains and losses from the derivative
instruments are reported in current income. for derivative instruments relating to foreign currency
exposures, gains and losses are reported in current income. interest rate swaps  hedging a
portion of the companys fixed-rate debt  are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas
interest rate swaps relating to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair
value on the consolidated balance sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale
and are in highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash
management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash
equivalents. the balance of the short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and
are marked-to-market, with

any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income.
inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost,
using a last-in, first-out (lifo)method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market.
materials, supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost.
properties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and
natural gas exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant
and equipment,
proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement
obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned proved
reserves remain capitalized. costs are also capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude
oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling
is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify
its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. all other exploratory wells and
costs are expensed. refer to note 20, beginning on page fs-49, for additional discussion of
accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.
long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties,
are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the united states, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession
or field basis, as appropriate. in the refining, marketing, transportation and chemical areas,
impairment reviews are generally done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing area or
marketing assets by country. impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the
asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value exceeds the fair value
less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value.
effective january1, 2003, the company implemented financial accounting standards board
statement no.143, accounting for asset retirement obligations (fas 143), in which the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is
a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. refer also to note 24, beginning on page fs-59, relating to asset retirement
obligations, which includes additional information on the companys adoption of fas 143.
depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas
producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method by
individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced. depletion expenses for capitalized
costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual
field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation provisions for impairment of
capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses for coal assets are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. the capitalized costs of all other
plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the
straight-line method generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as other income.
expenditures for maintenance, repairs
and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as
incurred. major replacements and renewals are capitalized.
goodwill goodwill acquired in a business combination is not subject to amortization. as
required by financial accounting standards board (fasb)statement no.142, goodwill and other
intangible assets, the company will test such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment
on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the
goodwill arising from the unocal acquisition is described in more detail in note 2, beginning on
page fs-36.
environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations
or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits
or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.

liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental
assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. for the
companys u.s. and canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability
that a future remediation commitment will be required. for crude oil, natural gas and coal
producing properties, a liability for an asset retirement obligation is made, following fas 143.
refer to note 24, beginning on page fs-59, for a discussion of fas 143.
for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a
liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for
other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other
parties are not able to pay their respective shares.
the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of
future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
companys own internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of
the companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all
gains and losses from currency translations are currently included in income. the cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the u.s. dollar
are included in the currency translation adjustment in stockholders equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal,
petroleum and chemicals products and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the
customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas
production from properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers are generally
recognized on the basis of the companys net working interest (entitlement method). refer to note
15, beginning on page fs-46, for a discussion of the accounting for buy/sell arrangements.
stock options and other share-based compensation effective july1, 2005, the company
adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board (fasb)statement no.123r,
share-based payment, (fas 123r) for its share-based compensation plans. the company previously
accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles
board (apb)opinion no.25, accounting for stock issued to employees, (apb 25) and related interpretations and
disclosure requirements established by fas 123, accounting for stock-based compensation.
refer to note 22, beginning on page fs-54, for a description of the companys share-based

note 2.acquisition of unocal corporation
on august10, 2005, the company acquired unocal corporation (unocal), an independent oil and
gas exploration and production company. unocals principal upstream operations are in north america
and asia, including the caspian region. also located in asia are unocals geothermal energy and
electrical power businesses. other activities include ownership interests in proprietary and common
carrier pipelines, natural gas storage facilities and mining operations.
the aggregate purchase price of unocal was approximately $17,300, which included approximately
$7,500 cash, 169million shares of chevron common stock valued at or about $9,600, and $200 for
stock options on approximately 5million shares and merger-related fees. the value of the common
shares was based on the average market price for a 5-day period beginning two days before the terms
of the acquisition were finalized and announced on july19, 2005. the issued shares represented
approximately 7.5percent of the number of shares outstanding immediately after the august10
close. the value of the stock options at the acquisition date was determined using the
black-scholes option-pricing model.
a third-party appraisal firm has been engaged to assist the company in the process of
determining the fair values

note 2.
acquisition of unocal corporation  continued
of unocals tangible and intangible assets. initial fair-value estimates were made in the
third quarter 2005, and adjustments to those initial estimates were made in the fourth quarter. the
company expects the valuation process will be finalized in the first half of 2006. once
completed, the associated deferred tax liabilities will also be adjusted. no significant
intangible assets other than goodwill are included in the preliminary allocation of the purchase
price in the table below. no in-process research and development assets were acquired.
the acquisition was accounted for under the rules of financial accounting standards board
(fasb)statement no.141, business combinations. the following table summarizes the preliminary
allocation of the purchase price to unocals assets and liabilities:

the $4,700 of goodwill is assigned to the upstream segment. none of the goodwill is
deductible for tax purposes. the goodwill represents benefits of the acquisition that are
additional to the fair values of the other net assets acquired. the primary reasons for the
acquisition and the principal factors that contributed to a unocal purchase price that resulted in
the recognition of goodwill were as follows:
the going concern element of the unocal businesses, which presents the opportunity
to earn a higher rate of return on the assembled collection of net assets than would be
expected if those assets were acquired separately. these benefits include upstream growth
opportunities in the asia-pacific, gulf of mexico and caspian regions. some of these
areas contain operations that are complementary to chevrons, and the acquisition is
consistent with chevrons long-term strategies to grow profitability in its core upstream
areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys large undeveloped
natural gas resource base.
cost savings that can be obtained through the capture of operational synergies. the
opportunities for cost savings include the elimination of duplicate facilities and
services, high-grading of investment opportunities in the combined portfolio and the
sharing of best practices of the two companies.
goodwill recorded in the acquisition is not subject to amortization, but will be tested
periodically for impairment as required by fasb statement no.142, goodwill and other intangible
assets.

acquisition of unocal had occurred at the beginning of each period:

note 7.
financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refinery
feedstocks.
the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including: firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase or sale of
crude oil; feedstock purchases for company refineries; crude oil and refined products
inventories; and fixed-price contracts to sell natural gas and natural gas liquids. the company
also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.
the company uses international swaps dealers association agreements to govern derivative
contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. depending on the nature of the
derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. when the company is
engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and
also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net marked-to-market
exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and
is a reasonable measure of the companys credit risk exposure. the company also uses other netting
agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate
credit risk.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, long-term receivables  net and deferred
credits and other noncurrent obligations. gains and losses on the companys risk management
activities are reported as either sales and other operating revenues or purchased crude oil and
products, whereas trading gains and losses are reported as other income. these activities are
reported under operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
foreign currency the company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms
of 180days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. these exposures include
revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and
lease commitments, forecasted to occur within 180days. the forward exchange contracts are recorded
at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
the fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable or accounts payable, with gains and losses reported as other
income. these activities are reported under operating activities in the consolidated statement
of cash flows.
interest rates the company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall
strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net cash
settlements are based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts
calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts. interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest
rate swaps related to a portion of the companys floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on
the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.
fair values of the interest rate swaps are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as
accounts and notes receivable or accounts payable, with gains and losses reported directly in
income as part of interest and debt expense. these activities are reported under operating
activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
fair value fair values are derived either from quoted market prices or, if not available,
the present value of the expected cash flows. the fair values reflect the cash that would have
been received or paid if the instruments were settled at year-end.

financial and derivativeinstruments  continued
long-term debt of $7,424 and $5,815 had estimated fair values of $7,945 and $6,444 at
december31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
for interest rate swaps, the notional principal amounts of $1,400 and $1,665 had estimated
fair values of $(10) and $36 at december31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
the company holds cash equivalents and u.s. dollar marketable securities in domestic and
offshore portfolios. eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes, time deposits and commercial paper are
the primary instruments held. cash equivalents and marketable securities had fair values of $8,995
and $8,789 at december31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. of these balances, $7,894 and $7,338 at the
respective year-ends were classified as cash equivalents that had average maturities under 90
days. the remainder, classified as marketable securities, had average maturities of approximately
2years.
for the financial and derivative instruments discussed above, there was not a material change
in market risk from that presented in 2004.
concentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the companys short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. this diversified
investment policy limits the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit
risk. similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the companys
counterparties in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. as a consequence, concentrations of
credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers.
when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring letters of
credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.
investment in dynegy preferred stock at december31, 2005, the company held an investment
in $400 face value of dynegy seriesc convertible preferred stock, with a stated maturity date of
2033. the stock was recorded at its fair value, which was estimated to be $360 at the end of 2005.
temporary changes in the estimated fair value of the preferred stock are reported in other
comprehensive income. however, if any future decline in fair value is deemed to be other than
temporary, a charge against income in the period would be recorded. dividends payable on the
preferred stock are recognized in income each period.
note 8.
operating segments and geographic data
although each subsidiary of chevron is responsible for its own affairs, chevron corporation
manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. for this purpose, the
investments are grouped as follows: upstream  exploration and production; downstream  refining, marketing and transportation; chemicals; and all other. the first three of these groupings
represent the companys reportable segments and operating segments as defined in fas 131,
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
the segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
segment managers who report to the companys chief operating decision maker (codm) (terms as
defined in fas 131). the codm is the companys executive committee, a committee of senior officers that includes the chief executive officer and that in turn reports to the board of directors
of chevron corporation.
the operating segments represent components of the company as described in fas 131 terms that
engage in activities (a)from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b)whose
operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm, which makes decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segments and to assess their performance; and (c)for which discrete financial
information is available.
segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the companys codm to discuss the segments operating activities and financial
performance. the codm approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and exploratory budgets. however, business-unit managers within the
operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and
all other matters connected with daily operations. company officers who are members of the
executive committee also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other
committees for purposes other than acting as the codm.
all other activities include the companys interest in dynegy, mining operations of coal and
other minerals, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing
activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and
technology companies.
the companys primary country of operation is the united states of america, its country of
domicile. other components of the companys operations are reported as international (outside the
united states).
segment earnings the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an
after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment
interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. corporate
administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. however, operating
segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. nonbillable costs remain at the
corporate level in

segment sales and other operating revenues operating segment sales and other
operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 are presented
in the following table. products are transferred between operating segments at internal product
values that approximate market prices.
revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude
oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. revenues for the
downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products, such as
gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, kerosene, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived
from crude oil. this segment also generates revenues from the transportation and trading of crude
oil and refined products. revenues for the chemicals segment are derived primarily from the
manufacture and sale of additives for lubricants and fuel. all other activities include revenues
from mining operations of coal and other minerals, power generation businesses, insurance
operations, real estate activities and technology companies.
other than the united states, the only country in which chevron recorded significant revenues
was the united kingdom, with revenues of $15,296, $13,985 and $12,121 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,

litigation
chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. chevron is a party to more than 70 lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of
mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepage of mtbe into groundwater. resolution
of these actions may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on
the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and
claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future.
the companys ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently
determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. the company does not use mtbe
in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states.

restructuring and reorganization costs
in connection with the unocal acquisition, the company implemented a restructuring and
reorganization program as part of the effort to capture the synergies of the combined companies.
the program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2006 and is aimed at
eliminating redundant operations, consolidating offices and facilities, and sharing common
services and functions.
as part of the restructuring and reorganization, approximately 700 positions have been
preliminarily identified for elimination. most of the positions are in the united states and
relate primarily to corporate and upstream executive and administrative functions. by year-end
2005, approximately 250 of these employees had been terminated.
an accrual of $106 was established as part of the purchase-price allocation for unocal.
payments against the accrual in 2005 were $62. the balance at year-end 2005 was classified as a
current liability on the consolidated balance sheet. adjustments to the accrual may occur in future
periods as the implementation plans are finalized and estimates are refined.

2003 for estimated termination benefits for approximately 4,500 employees. nearly half of the
liability related to the global downstream segment. substantially all of the employee reductions
had occurred by early 2006.

ta phut, thailand. the petroleum authority of thailand owns the remaining 36percent of sprc.
caltex australia ltd. chevron has a 50percent equity ownership interest in caltex
australia limited (cal). the remaining 50percent of cal is publicly owned. at december31, 2005,

carrying value of the companys investment in cal was approximately $70 lower than the amount of
underlying equity in cal net assets.
colonial pipeline company chevron owns an approximate 23percent equity interest as a
result of the unocal acquisition. the colonial pipeline system runs from texas to new jersey and
transports petroleum products in a 13-state market.
chevron phillips chemical company llc chevron owns 50percent of cpchem, formed in 2000
when chevron merged most of its petrochemicals businesses with those of phillips petroleum company
(now conocophillips corporation). at december31, 2005, the companys carrying value of its
investment in cpchem was approximately $100 lower than the amount of underlying equity in cpchems

investment in dynegy common stock at december31, 2005, the carrying value of the
companys investment in dynegy common stock was approximately $300. this amount was about $200
below the companys proportionate interest in dynegys underlying net assets. this difference is
primarily the result of write-downs of the investment in 2002 for declines in the market value of
the common shares below the companys carrying value that were deemed to be other than temporary.
this difference has been assigned to the extent practicable to specific dynegy assets and
liabilities, based upon the companys analysis of the various factors contributing to the decline
in value of the dynegy shares. the companys equity share of dynegys reported earnings is adjusted
quarterly when appropriate to reflect the difference between these allocated values and dynegys
historical book values. the market value of the companys investment in dynegys common stock at
december31, 2005, was approximately $470.

accounting for buy/sell contracts
in the first quarter 2005, the securities and exchange commission (sec)issued comment
letters to chevron and other companies in the oil and gas industry requesting disclosure of
information related to the accounting for buy/sell contracts. under a buy/sell contract, a company
agrees to buy a specific quantity and quality of a commodity to be delivered at a specific
location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of a commodity at
a different location to the same counterparty. physical delivery occurs for each side of the
transaction, and the risk and reward of ownership are evidenced by title transfer, assumption of
environmental risk, transportation scheduling, credit risk and risk of nonperformance by the
counterparty. both parties settle each side of the buy/sell through separate invoicing.
the company routinely enters into buy/sell contracts, primarily in the united states
downstream business, associated with crude oil and refined products. for crude oil, these
contracts are used to facilitate the companys crude oil marketing activity, which includes the
purchase and sale of crude oil production, fulfillment of the companys supply arrangements as to
physical delivery location and crude oil specifications, and purchase of crude oil to supply the
companys refining
system. for refined products, buy/sell arrangements are used to help fulfill the companys
supply agreements to customer locations and specifications.
the company has historically accounted for buy/sell transactions in the consolidated statement
of income the same as for a monetary transaction  purchases are reported as purchased crude oil
and products; sales are reported as sales and other operating revenues. the sec raised the issue
as to whether the accounting for buy/sell contracts should be shown net on the income statement and
accounted for under the provisions of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.29, accounting
for nonmonetary transactions (apb 29). the company understands that others in the oil and gas
industry may report buy/sell transactions on a net basis in the income statement rather than gross.
the emerging issues task force (eitf)of the fasb deliberated this topic as issue no.04-13,
accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty. at its september2005
meeting, the eitf reached consensus that two or more legally separate exchange transactions with
the same counterparty, including buy/sell transactions, should be combined and considered as a
single arrangement for purposes of applying apb 29 when the transactions were entered into in
contemplation of one another. eitf 04-13 was ratified by the fasb in september2005 and is
effective
fs-46

note 15.
accounting for
buy/sell contracts  continued
for new arrangements, or modifications or renewals of existing arrangements, entered into
beginning on or after april1, 2006, which will be the effective date for the companys adoption of
this standard. upon adoption, the company will report the net effect of buy/sell transactions on
its consolidated statement of income as purchased crude oil and products instead of reporting the
revenues associated with these arrangements as sales and other operating revenues and the costs
as purchased crude oil and products.
while this issue was under deliberation by the eitf, the sec
staff directed chevron and other companies to disclose on the face of the income statement the
amounts associated with buy/sell contracts and to discuss in a footnote to the financial
statements the basis for the underlying accounting. the amounts for buy/sell contracts shown on the
companys consolidated statement of income sales and other operating revenues for the three years
ending december31, 2005, were $23,822, $18,650 and $14,246, respectively. these revenue amounts
associated with buy/sell contracts represented 12percent of total sales and other operating
revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003. nearly all of these revenue amounts in each period associated
with buy/sell contracts pertain to the companys downstream segment. the costs associated with
these buy/sell revenue amounts are included in purchased crude oil and products on the
consolidated statement of income in each period.

in 2005, the reported amount of net total deferred taxes increased by approximately
$5,000 from the amount reported in 2004. the increase was largely attributable to net deferred
taxes arising through the unocal acquisition.
deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits increased approximately $1,000 between 2004
and 2005. the associated valuation allowance also increased approximately the same amount. the
change in both categories reflected the addition of unocal amounts as well as the effect of the
companys tax election in 2005 for certain heritage-chevron international upstream operations.

taxes  continued
the overall valuation allowance relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss
carryforwards and temporary differences for which no benefit is expected to be realized. tax loss
carryforwards exist in many foreign jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss carry forwards do
not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2006 through 2013. foreign tax
credit carryforwards of $1,145 will expire in 2015.

it is the companys policy for subsidiaries that are included in the u.s. consolidated
tax return to record income tax expense as though they file separately, with the parent recording
the adjustment to income tax expense for the effects of consolidation.
income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have
been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. undistributed earnings of international
consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made
for possible future remittances totaled $14,317 at december31, 2005. a significant majority of
this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business.
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual
remittance of such earnings. the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional
taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.
american jobs creation act of 2004 in october2004, the american jobs creation act of
2004 was passed into law. the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic refining and upstream production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. for that
income, the company expects the net effect of this provision of the act to result in a decrease in
the federal effective tax rate for 2006 to approximately 34percent, based on current earnings
levels. in the long term, the company expects that the new deduction will result in a decrease of
the annual effective tax rate to about 32percent for that category of income, based on current
earnings levels.

at december31, 2005, the company had $4,850 of committed credit facilities with banks
worldwide, which permit the company to refinance short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the
facilities support the companys commercial paper borrowings. interest on borrowings under the

new accounting standards
fasb statement no.151, inventory costs, an amendment of arb no.43, chapter4 (fas 151) in
november2004, the fasb issued fas 151, which became effective for the company on
january1, 2006. the standard amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin (arb)no.43,
chapter4, inventory pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. in addition, the standard requires that allocation
of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the companys
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
eitf issue no.04-6, accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining
industry (issue 04-6) in march2005, the fasb ratified the earlier eitf consensus on issue
04-6, which is effective for the company on january1, 2006. stripping costs are costs of removing
overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits. the consensus calls for stripping
costs incurred once a mine goes into production to be treated as variable production costs that
should be considered a component of mineral inventory cost subject to arb no.43, restatement and
revision of accounting research bulletins. adoption of this accounting for its coal, oil sands and other mining operations will
not have a significant effect on the companys results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.

accounting for suspended exploratory wells
refer to note 1, beginning on page fs-34, in the section properties, plant and equipment for
a discussion of the companys accounting policy for the cost of exploratory wells. the companys
suspended wells are reviewed in this context on a quarterly basis.
in april2005, the fasb issued fasb staff position (fsp)fas 19-1, accounting for suspended
well costs, which amended fas 19, financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing
companies. the company elected early application of this guidance with the first quarter 2005 financial statements.
under the provisions of fsp fas 19-1, exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized after
the completion of drilling when (a)the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify completion as a producing well and (b)the enterprise is making sufficient progress
assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.

accounting for suspended

if either condition is not met, or if an enterprise obtains information that raises
substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well
would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to
expense. the fsp provides a number of indicators that can assist an entity to demonstrate sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.
the following table indicates the changes to the companys suspended exploratory-well costs
for the three years ended december31, 2005. no capitalized exploratory well costs were charged to
expense upon the adoption of fsp fas 19-1. amounts may differ from those previously disclosed due
to the requirements of fsp fas 19-1 to exclude costs suspended and expensed in the same annual
period.

of the $850 of exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year at
december31, 2005, approximately $313 (20 projects) related to projects that had drilling
activities under way or firmly planned for the near future. an additional $63 (four projects) had
drilling activity dur-
ing 2005. the $474 balance related to 16 projects in areas requiring a major capital
expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under
way or firmly planned for the near future. additional drilling was not deemed necessary because
the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to
enable a future decision on project development.
the projects for the $474 referenced above had the following activities associated with
assessing the reserves and the projects economic viability: (a) $141  additional seismic
interpretation planned, with front-end engineering and design (feed)expected to commence in 2007
(two projects); (b) $82  evaluation of drilling results and pre-feed studies on-going with feed
expected to commence in 2006 (one project); (c) $74  finalization of pre-unit agreement with
operator of adjacent field and the progression of joint subsurface and joint concept selection
studies, with feed expected to begin in 2006 (one project); (d) $63  feed contracts executed in
2005 and continued marketing of equity natural gas (two projects); (e) $114  miscellaneous
activities for 10 projects with smaller amounts suspended. while progress was being made on all the
projects in this category, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in
some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations
connected with the projects. the majority of these decisions are expected to occur in the next
three years.
the $850 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of december
31, 2005, represents 105 exploratory wells in 40 projects. the tables below contain the aging of

employee benefit plans
the company has defined-benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically
pre-funds defined-benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where
pre-funding provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified tax-exempt plans are
subject to the employee retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the
company does not typically fund domestic nonqualified tax-exempt pension plans that are not
subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension
plans may be

investment alternatives.
the company also sponsors other postretirement plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees.
the plans are unfunded, and the company and the retirees share the costs. for retiree medical
coverage in the companys main u.s. plan, the increase to the company contributions for retiree
medical coverage is limited to no more than 4percent each year, effective at retirement, beginning
in 2005. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company and annual contributions are
based on actual plan experience.

discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets were reviewed and
updated as needed on a quarterly basis for the main u.s. pension plan.
the 2005 discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation
increase reflect the remeasurement of the unocal benefit plans at july31, 2005, due to the
acquisition of unocal.
expected return on plan assets the company employs a rigorous process to determine
estimates of the long-term rate of return on pension assets. these estimates are primarily driven
by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from
external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. asset
allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the
determination of the companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these
studies.
there have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for u.s. plans, which account for 72percent of the companys pension plan assets. at december31,
2005, the estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.8percent.
the market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the
year-end measurement date, as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under u.s.
accounting rules. management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the
effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of
the year. for other plans, market value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating
the pension expense.
discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine u.s. and international
pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates
available on high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. at december31, 2005, the company
selected a
fs-52
table of contents
note 21.
employee benefit plans  continued
5.5percent discount rate (shown in the table on page fs-52) based on moodys aa corporate
bond index and a cash flow analysis using the citigroup pension discount curve. the discount rates
at the end of 2004 and 2003 were 5.8percent and 6percent, respectively.
other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at december31, 2005, for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health
care cost trend rates start with 10percent in 2006 and gradually decline to 5percent for 2011 and
beyond. for this measurement at december31, 2004, the assumed health care cost trend rates started
with 9.5percent in 2005 and gradually declined to 4.8percent for 2010 and beyond. in both
measurements, increases in the companys contributions are capped at 4percent effective at
retirement.
assumed health care cost-trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend
rates would have the following effects:

the pension plans invest primarily in asset categories with sufficient size, liquidity
and cost efficiency to permit investments of reasonable size. the pension plans invest in asset
categories that provide diversification benefits and are easily measured. to assess the plans
investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.
for the primary u.s. pension plan, the chevron board of directors has established the
following approved asset allocation ranges: equities 4070percent, fixed income 2060percent,
real estate 015percent and other 05percent. the significant international pension plans also
have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by each plan. actual asset
allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions
and consideration of specific asset category risk.
equities include investments in the companys common stock in the amount of $13 and $8 at
december31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the other asset category includes minimal investments
in private-equity limited partnerships.
cash contributions and benefit payments in 2005, the company contributed $794 and $228
to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. in 2006, the company expects
contributions to be approximately $300 and $200 to its u.s. and international pension plans,
respectively. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment returns, changes in
pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may
ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan
obligations.
the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $220 in 2006,
as compared with $226 paid in 2005.

employee savings investment plan eligible employees of chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the chevron employee savings investment plan (esip).
charges to expense for the esip represent the companys contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop), which is
discussed below. total company matching contributions to employee accounts within the esip were
$145, $139 and $136 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. this cost was reduced by the value of
shares released from the lesop totaling $(4), $(138) and $(23) in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. the remaining amounts, totaling $141, $1 and $113 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, represent open market purchases.
employee stock ownership plan within the chevron employee savings investment plan (esip)is an employee stock ownership plan (esop). in 1989,
chevron established a leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop)as a constituent part of the
esop. the lesop provides partial prefunding of the companys future commitments to the esip.
as permitted by american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa)statement of
position 93-6, employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans, the company has elected
to continue its practices, which are based on aicpa statement of position 76-3, accounting
practices for certain employee stock ownership plans, and subsequent consensus of the eitf of the

is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of
stockholders equity.
the company reports compensation expense equal to lesop debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the lesop for debt service. interest accrued on lesop debt is
recorded as interest expense. dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. all lesop shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.
total expenses (credits)recorded for the lesop were $94, $(29) and $24 in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, including $18, $23 and $28 of interest expense related to lesop debt and a
charge (credit)to compensation expense of $76, $(52) and $(4).
of the dividends paid on the lesop shares, $55, $52 and $61 were used in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, to service lesop debt. included in the 2004 amount was a repayment of debt entered
into in 1999 to pay interest on the esop debt. interest expense on this debt was recognized and
reported as lesop interest expense in 1999. in addition, the company made contributions in 2005 and
2003 of $98 and $26, respectively, to satisfy lesop debt service in excess of dividends received by
the lesop. no contributions were required in 2004 as dividends received by the lesop were sufficient to satisfy lesop debt service.
shares held in the lesop are released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants based
on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of current-year and
remaining debt service. lesop shares as of december31, 2005 and 2004, were as follows:

benefit plan trusts texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding
obligations under some of its benefit plans. at year-end 2005, the trust contained 14.2million
shares of chevron treasury stock. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the
benefit plans. the trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. the trustee will vote the
shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust
are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the
trust in payment of benefit obligations.
unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit
plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans.
at december 31, 2005, trust assets totaled $130 and were invested primarily in interest-earning
accounts.
management incentive plans chevron has two incentive plans, the management incentive plan
(mip)and the long-term incentive plan (ltip), for officers and other regular salaried employees of
the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. the mip is an
annual cash incentive plan that links awards to performance results of the prior year. the cash
awards may be deferred by the recipients by conversion to stock units or other investment fund
alternatives. aggregate charges to expense for mip were $155, $147 and $125 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. awards under the ltip consist of stock options and other share-based compensation
which are described more fully in note 22 below.
other incentive plans the company has a program that provides eligible employees, other
than those covered by mip and ltip, with an annual cash bonus if the company achieves certain financial and safety goals. additionally, in august2005, the company assumed responsibility for the
remaining pro-rated cash bonuses under the unocal annual incentive plan. charges for the programs
were $324, $339 and $151 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
note 22.
stock options and other share-based compensation
effective july1, 2005, the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards
board (fasb)statement no.123r, share-based payment, (fas 123r) for its share-based compensation
plans. the company previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of accounting principles board (apb)opinion no.25,
accounting for stock issued to employees, (apb 25) and related interpretations and
disclosure requirements established by fas 123, accounting for stock-based compensation.
the company adopted fas 123r using the modified prospective method and, accordingly, results
for prior periods have not been restated. refer to note 1, beginning on page fs-34, for the pro
forma effect on net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair-value
recognition of fas 123 for periods prior to adoption of fas 123r and the actual effect on net
income and earnings per share for periods after adoption of fas 123r.
for 2005, compensation expense charged against income for the first time for stock options
was $65 ($42 after tax). in addition, compensation expense charged against income for stock
appreciation rights, performance units and restricted stock units was $59 ($39 after tax), $65 ($42
after tax) and $25 ($16 after tax) for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. there were no significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs at december31, 2005.
cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2005, 2004
and 2003 was $297, $385 and $32, respectively. actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions
from option exercises was $71, $49 and $6 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
fs-54

note 22.
stock options and other share-based
compensation  continued
cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $110, $23 and $11
for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. cash paid in 2005 included $73million for unocal awards
paid under change-in-control plan provisions.
at adoption of fas 123r, the impact of measuring stock appreciation rights at fair value
instead of intrinsic value resulted in an insignificant charge against income in the third quarter
2005. for restricted stock units, fas 123r required that unrecognized compensation amounts
presented in deferred compensation and benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet be
reclassified against the appropriate equity accounts. this resulted in a reclassification of $7
to capital in excess of par value.
prior to the adoption of fas 123r, the company presented all
tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows
in the consolidated statement of cash flows. fas 123r requires the cash flow resulting from the
tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. refer to note 3, beginning on page fs-37, for
information on excess tax benefits.
in november2005, the fasb issued a staff position fas 123r-3 (fsp fas 123r-3), transition
election related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based payment awards, which provides a
one-time transition election for companies to follow in calculating the beginning balance of the
pool of excess tax benefits related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine
the subsequent impact on the pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the
adoption of fas 123r. under the fsp, the company must decide by november2006 whether to make this
one-time transition election, which may provide some administrative relief in calculating the
future tax effects of stock option issuances. whether or not the one-time election is made, the
company anticipates no significant difference in the amount of tax expense recorded in future
periods.
in the discussion below, the references to share price and number of shares have been adjusted
for the two-for-one stock split in september2004.
chevron long-term incentive plan (ltip) awards under the ltip may take the form of, but
are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation
rights, performance units and non-stock grants. for a 10-year period after april2004, no more than
160million shares may be issued under the ltip, and no more than 64million of those shares may be
in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient.
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the ltip extend for 10years from
grant date. effective with options granted in june2002, one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date
of grant. prior to this change, options granted by chevron vested one year after the date of
grant. performance units granted under the ltip extend for 3years from grant date and are settled
in cash at the end of the period. settlement amounts are based on achievement of performance
targets relative to major competitors over the period, and payments are indexed to the companys
stock price.
texaco stock incentive plan (texaco sip) on the closing of the acquisition of texaco in
october2001, outstanding options granted under the texaco sip were converted to chevron options.
these options retained a provision for being restored, which enables a participant who exercises a
stock option to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares
withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations to receive new options equal to the number of
shares exchanged or withheld. the restored options are fully exercisable six months after the date
of grant, and the exercise price is the market value of the common stock on the day the restored
option is granted. apart from the restored options, no further awards may be granted under the
former texaco plans.
unocal share-based plans (unocal plans) on the closing of the acquisition of unocal in
august2005, outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various unocal
plans were exchanged for fully vested chevron options at a conversion ratio of 1.07 chevron shares
for each unocal share. these awards retained the same provisions as the original unocal plans.
awards issued prior to 2004 generally may be exercised for up to 3years after termination of
employment (depending upon the terms of the individual award agreements), or the original
expiration date, whichever is earlier. awards issued since 2004 generally remain exercisable until
the end of the normal option term if termination of employment occurs prior to august10, 2007.
other awards issued under the unocal plans, including restricted stock, stock units, restricted
stock units and performance shares, became vested at the acquisition date, and shares or cash were
issued to recipients in accordance with change-in-control provisions of the plans.

the total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market
price) of options exercised
during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $258, $129 and $17, respectively.
at adoption of fas 123r, the company elected to amortize newly issued graded awards on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. in accordance with fas 123r implementation
guidance issued by the staff of the securities and exchange commission, the company accelerates the
vesting period for retirement-eligible employees in accordance with vesting provisions of the
companys share-based compensation programs for awards issued after adoption of fas 123r. as of
december31, 2005, there was $89 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to
nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans. that cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3years.
at january1, 2005, the number of ltip performance units outstanding was equivalent to
2,673,482 shares. during 2005, 709,900 units were granted, 1,012,932 units vested with cash
proceeds distributed to recipients, and 24,434 units were forfeited. at december31, 2005, units
outstanding were 2,346,016, and the value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $83.
in addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were awarded under various ltip and former
texaco and unocal programs totaled approximately 800,000 equivalent shares as of december31, 2005.
a liability of $16 was recorded for these awards.
broad-based employee stock options in addition to the plans described above, chevron
granted all eligible employees stock options or equivalents in 1998. the options vested after two
years, in february2000, and expire after 10years, in february2008. a total of 9,641,000 options
were awarded with an exercise price of $38.15625 per share.
the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated at $9.54 using the
black-scholes model for the preceding 10years. the assumptions used in the model, based on a
10-year average, were: a risk-free interest rate of 7percent, a dividend yield of 4.2percent, an
expected life of 7years and a volatility of 24.7percent.
at january1, 2005, the number of broad-based employee stock options outstanding was
2,109,504. during 2005, exercises of 397,500 shares and forfeitures of 29,100 shares reduced
outstanding options to 1,682,904. as of december31, 2005, these instruments had an aggregate
intrinsic value of $31 and the remaining contractual term of these options was 2.1years. the total
intrinsic value of these options exercised during 2005 and 2004 was $9 and $16, respectively.
exercises in 2003 were insignificant.

quarterly. these liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities
until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated.

commitments  continued
energy inc. (formerly caltex corporation), unocal corporation (unocal) and texaco inc.
(texaco). california franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for chevron, 1998 for
unocal and through 1987 for texaco. settlement of open tax years, as well as tax issues in other
countries where the company conducts its businesses, is not expected to have a material effect on
the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company, and in the opinion of management,
adequate provision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or
subject to future examination.
guarantees at december31, 2005, the company and its subsidiaries provided, either
directly or indirectly, guarantees of $985 for notes and other contractual obligations of affiliated companies and $294 for third parties, as described by major category below. there are no
material amounts being carried as liabilities for the companys obligations under these guarantees.
of the $985 guarantees provided to affiliates, $806 related to borrowings for capital
projects or general corporate purposes. these guarantees were undertaken to achieve lower interest
rates and generally cover the construction periods of the capital projects. included in these
amounts are unocal-related guarantees of approximately $230 associated with a construction
completion guarantee for the debt financing of unocals equity interest in the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan
(btc)crude oil pipeline project. approximately 95percent of the $806 guaranteed will expire
between 2006 and 2010, with the remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. under the terms
of the guarantees, the company would be required to fulfill the guarantee should an affiliate be
in default of its loan terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. there are no recourse
provisions, and no assets are held as collateral for these guarantees. the other guarantees of $179
represent obligations in connection with pricing of power-purchase agreements for certain of the
companys cogeneration affiliates. under the terms of these guarantees, the company may be
required to make payments under certain conditions if the affiliates do not perform under the
agreements. there are no provisions for recourse to third parties, and no assets are held as
collateral for these pricing guarantees.
of the $294 in guarantees provided to third parties, approximately $150 related to
construction loans to host governments of certain of the companys international upstream
operations. the remaining guarantees of $144 were provided principally as conditions of sale of the
companys interest in certain operations, to provide a source of liquidity to the guaranteed
parties and in connection with company marketing programs. no amounts of the companys obligations
under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities. about 85percent of the $294 in guarantees
expire by 2010, with the remainder expiring after 2010. the company would be
required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in default of its
loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. approximately $85 of the
guarantees have recourse provisions, which enable the company to recover any payments made under
the terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties assets.
at december31, 2005, chevron also had outstanding guarantees for about $190 of equilon debt
and leases. following the february2002 disposition of its interest in equilon, the company
received an indemnification from shell oil company (shell) for any claims arising from the
guarantees. the company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees. approximately 50percent
of the amounts guaranteed will expire within the 2006 through 2010 period, with the guarantees of the remaining amounts
expiring by 2019.
indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of
equilon and motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of
the companys interests in those investments. the company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. were that to occur, the company could be required
to make future payments up to $300. through the end of 2005, the company paid approximately $38
under these indemnities. the company expects to receive additional requests for indemnification
payments in the future.
the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred
during the periods of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
december2001. claims relating to equilon indemnities must be asserted either as early as february
2007, or no later than february2009, and claims relating to motiva must be asserted no later than
february2012. under the terms of the indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of
potential future payments. the company has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims under
these indemnities. the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the
indemnities.
the amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts recovered
from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by equilon or motiva prior to
september30, 2001, for any applicable incident.
in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets of unocals 76 products company business that
existed prior to its sale in 1997. under the terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum limit
on the amount of potential future payments by the company; however, the purchaser shares certain
costs under this indemnity up to an aggregate cap of $200. claims relating to these indemnities
must be asserted by april2022. through the end of 2005,

other contingencies andcommitments  continued
approximately $113 had been applied to the cap, which includes payments made by either unocal
or chevron totaling $80.
securitization the company securitizes certain retail and trade accounts receivable in
its downstream business through the use of qualifying special purpose entities (spes). at december
31, 2005, approximately $1,200, representing about 7percent of chevrons total current accounts
receivables balance, were securitized. chevrons total estimated financial exposure under these
securitizations at december31, 2005, was approximately $60. these arrangements have the effect of
accelerating chevrons collection of the securitized amounts. in the event that the spes experience
major defaults in the collection of receivables, chevron believes that it would have no loss
exposure connected with third-party investments in these securitizations.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements, and
take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent
liabilities relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput
agreements, and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements.
the agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity,
utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys
business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments
are 2006  $2,200; 2007  $1,900; 2008  $1,800; 2009
$1,800; 2010  $500; 2011 and after
$3,800. total payments under the agreements were approximately $2,100 in 2005, $1,600 in 2004 and
$1,400 in 2003.
the most significant take-or-pay agreement calls for the company to purchase approximately
55,000 barrels per day of refined products from an equity affiliate refiner in thailand. this
purchase agreement is in conjunction with the financing of a refinery owned by the affiliate and
expires in 2009. the future estimated commitments under this contract are: 2006  $1,300; 2007
$1,300; 2008  $1,300; and 2009  $1,300. under the terms of a 2004 agreement, the company
exercised its option in 2005 to acquire additional regasification capacity at the sabine pass
liquefied natural gas terminal. payments of $2.5billion over the 20-year period are expected to
commence in 2009.
minority interests the company has commitments of approximately $200 related to minority
interests in subsidiary companies.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws
and regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or
ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemical or petroleum
substances, including mtbe, by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for
various sites, including, but not limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under
state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, and land development
areas, whether operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to
such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination,
the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of
the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such
costs are recoverable from third parties.
although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had or will have any significant impact
on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or chemical
companies.
chevrons environmental reserve as of december31, 2005, was $1,469. included in this balance
were liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of unocal, which relate primarily to
sites that had been previously divested or closed by unocal. the sites included, but were not
limited to, former refineries, transportation and distribution facilities and service stations,
crude oil and natural gas fields and mining operations, as well as active mining operations.
the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and
local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2005 had a recorded liability that was
material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
included in the year-end 2005 balance was $139 related to sites for which chevron had been
identified by the u.s. environmental protection agency or other regulatory agencies under the
provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws as a potentially responsible

other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and pipelines. the
remaining $475 was associated with various sites in the international downstream ($101), upstream

remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities include one or
more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite
containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil;
groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the
contaminants.
global operations chevron and its affiliates conduct business activities in
approximately 180 countries. areas in which the company and its affiliates have significant
operations include the united states, canada, australia, the united kingdom, norway, denmark,
france, the netherlands, the partitioned neutral zone between kuwait and saudi arabia, republic of
the congo, angola, nigeria, chad, south africa, the democratic republic of the congo, indonesia,
bangladesh, the philippines, myanmar, singapore, china, thailand, vietnam, cambodia, azerbaijan,
kazakhstan, venezuela, argentina, brazil, colombia, trinidad and tobago, and south korea. the
companys caspian pipeline consortium (cpc)affiliate operates in russia and kazakhstan. the
companys tengizchevroil (tco)affiliate operates in kazakhstan. through an affiliate, the company
participates in the development of the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan (btc)pipeline through azerbaijan,
georgia and turkey. also through an affiliate, the company has an interest in the chad/cameroon
pipeline. the companys petrolera ameriven affiliate operates the hamaca project in venezuela. the
companys cpchem affiliate manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a worldwide
basis, with manufacturing facilities in the united states, puerto rico, singapore, china, south
korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and belgium.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing
economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates,
including the united states. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by host
governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or
assets or to impose additional taxes or royalties on the companys operations or both.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in
others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
companys continued presence in those countries. internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other governments may affect the companys
operations. those developments have at times significantly affected the companys related
operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of
current and future activity in such countries.
equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements
may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas
reserves. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be
material to earnings in any given period. one such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for chevrons interests in four producing zones at the naval petroleum reserve at
elk hills, california, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the
u.s. department of energy. a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four
zones. chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at approximately $200. at
the same time, a possible maximum net amount that could be owed to chevron is estimated at about
$50. the timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this range of estimates are
uncertain.
other contingencies chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers, trading
partners, u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers,
and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant
and take lengthy periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.
note 24.
asset retirement obligations
the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement (fasb)no.143, accounting
for asset retirement obligations, (fas 143), effective january1, 2003. this accounting standard
applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation that is recorded when
there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. obligations associated with the retirement of these assets
require recognition in certain circumstances: (1)the present value of a liability and offsetting
asset for an aro, (2)the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and
(3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates. fas 143 primarily
affects the companys accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing assets and differs in
several respects from previous accounting under fas 19, financial accounting and reporting by oil
and gas producing companies.
in the first quarter 2003, the company recorded a net after-tax charge of $200 for the
cumulative effect of the adoption of fas 143, including the companys share of amounts attributable
to equity affiliates. the cumulative-effect adjustment also increased the following balance sheet
categories: properties, plant and equipment, $2,568; accrued liabilities, $115; and deferred
credits and other noncurrent

asset retirement obligations  continued
obligations, $2,674. noncurrent deferred income taxes decreased by $21.
upon adoption, no significant asset retirement obligations associated with any legal
obligations to retire refining, marketing and transportation (downstream)and chemical long-lived
assets generally were recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements
prevented estimation of the fair value of the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews
of its downstream and chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that
might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
other than the cumulative-effect net charge, the effect of the new accounting standard on net
income in 2003 was not materially different from what the result would have been under fas 19
accounting. included in depreciation, depletion and amortization were $52 related to the
depreciation of the aro asset and $132 related to the accretion of the aro liability.
in march2005, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no.47, accounting for conditional asset
retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no.143, (fin 47), which was
effective for the company on december31, 2005. fin 47 clarifies that the phrase conditional
asset retirement obligation, as used in fas 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset
retirement activity for which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future
event that may or may not be within the control of the company. the obligation to perform the asset
retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method
of settlement. uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement of a conditional asset
retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient
information exists. fas 143 acknowledges that in some cases, sufficient information may not be
available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. fin 47 also
clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value
of an asset retirement obligation. in adopting fin 47, the company did not recognize any additional
liabilities for conditional retirement obligations due to an inability to reasonably estimate the
fair value of those obligations because of their indeterminate settlement dates.

obligations in 2005, 2004 and 2003:

table v  reserve quantity information
reserves governance the company has adopted a
comprehensive reserves and resource classification
system modeled after a system developed and approved by
the society of petroleum engineers, the world petroleum
congress and the american association of petroleum
geologists. the system classifies recoverable
hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status
at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and
three noncommercial. within the commercial
classification are proved reserves and two categories
of unproved, probable and possible. the noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent
resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all sec and company standards.
proved reserves are the estimated quantities that
geologic and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions. net proved reserves exclude
royalties and interests owned by others and reflect
contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in
effect at the time of the estimate.
proved reserves are classified as either developed
or undeveloped. proved developed reserves are the
quantities expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited
nature of reservoir data, estimates of underground
reserves are subject to change as additional
information becomes available.
proved reserves are
estimated by company asset teams composed of earth
scientists and engineers. as part of the internal
control process related to reserves estimation, the
company maintains a reserves advisory committee (rac)
that is chaired by the corporate reserves manager, who
is a member of a corporate department that reports
directly to the executive vice president responsible
for the companys worldwide exploration and production
activities. all of the rac members are knowledgeable in
sec guidelines for proved reserves classification. the
rac coordinates its activities through two operating
company-level reserves managers. these two reserves
managers are not members of the rac so as to preserve
the corporate-level independence.
the rac has the following primary responsibilities: provide
independent reviews of the business units recommended reserve
changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance
with sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated
using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and
technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for
classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.
fs-70
table of contents
table v  reserve quantity information  continued
during the year, the rac is represented in
meetings with each of the companys upstream business
units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended
by the various asset teams. major changes are also
reviewed with the companys strategy and planning
committee and the executive committee, whose members
include the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer. the companys annual reserve
activity is also reviewed with the board of directors.
if major changes to reserves were to occur between the
annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed
with the board.
rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during
the year of many of the fields that have the largest
proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an
examination of the proved reserve records and
documentation of their alignment with the corporate
reserves manual.

oil-equivalent reserves for the companys consolidated
operations totaled 9.0billion barrels. (refer to page
e-11 for the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.)
nearly 22percent of the total was in the united
states. year-end reserves of approximately 1.4billion
barrels were associated with the properties obtained
as part of the august2005 acquisition of unocal. for
the companys interests in equity affiliates,
oil-equivalent reserves totaled 2.9billion barrels,
84percent of which was associated with the companys
50percent ownership in tco.
aside from the tco operations, no single property
accounted for more than 5percent of the companys
total oil-equivalent proved reserves. fewer than 20
individual properties each contained between 1percent
and 5percent of the total. in the aggregate, these
properties accounted for 35percent of the companys
total proved oil-equivalent reserves. these other
properties were geographically dispersed, located in
the united states, south america, europe, west africa,
the middle east and the asia-pacific region.
in the
united states, total oil-equivalent reserves at
year-end 2005 were 2.6billion barrels. of this amount,
39percent, 21percent and 40percent were located in
california, the gulf of mexico and other u.s. areas,
respectively.
in california, liquids reserves represented 95
percent of the total, with most classified as heavy
oil. because of heavy oils high viscosity and the
need to employ enhanced recovery methods, the
producing operations are capital intensive in nature.
most of the companys heavy-oil fields in california
employ a continuous steamflooding process.
in the gulf of mexico region, liquids represented
approximately 63percent of total oil-equivalent
reserves. production operations are mostly offshore
and, as a result,
are also capital intensive. costs include
investments in wells, production platforms and other
facilities, such as gathering lines and storage
facilities.
in other u.s. areas, the reserves were split
about equally between liquids and natural gas. for
production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced
recovery methods, including water-flood and co2 injection.
the pattern of net reserve changes shown in
the following tables for the three years ending
december31, 2005, is not necessarily indicative of
future trends. apart from acquisitions, the companys
ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among
other things, matters that are outside the companys
control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, declines in oil
and gas prices, opec constraints, geopolitical
uncertainties and civil unrest.
the companys estimated net proved underground oil
and natural gas reserves and changes thereto for the
years 2003, 2004 and 2005 are shown in the tables on
pages fs-72 and fs-74.

net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2005 consist of 490million barrels of
developed reserves and (170)million barrels of undeveloped reserves for consolidated companies and
(178)million barrels of developed reserves and (154)million barrels of undeveloped reserves for
affiliated companies.
during 2005, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at december31, 2004,
transferred to developed reserves were 11percent and 20percent for consolidated companies and
affiliated companies, respectively.
information on canadian oil sands net proved reserves not included above:
in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, chevron has significant
interests in proved oil sands reserves in canada associated with the athabasca project. for
internal management purposes, chevron views these reserves and their development as an integral
part of total upstream operations. however, sec regulations define these reserves as
mining-related and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves. net proved oil sands reserves
were 146million barrels as of december31, 2005. the oil sands reserves are not considered in the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves,
which is found on page fs-76.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of
proved-reserve changes for 2003 through 2005 in the
table above are discussed below:
revisions in 2003, net
revisions increased reserves by 57million barrels for
consolidated companies. whereas net u.s. reserve
changes were minimal, international volumes increased
66million barrels. the largest increase was in
kazakhstan in the asia-pacific area based on an updated
geologic model for one field. the 200-million-barrel
increase for tco was based on an updated model of
reservoir and well performance.
in 2004, net revisions decreased reserves 218
million barrels for consolidated companies and
increased reserves
for affiliates by 204million
barrels. for consolidated companies, the decrease
was composed of 161million barrels for
international areas and 57million barrels for the
united states. the largest downward revision
internationally was 70million barrels in africa.
one field in angola accounted for the majority of
the net decline as changes were made to
oil-in-place estimates based on reservoir
performance data. one field in the asia-pacific
area essentially accounted for the
43-million-barrel downward revision for that
region. the revision was associated with reduced
well performance. part of the 36-million-barrel net
downward revision for indonesia was associated with
the effect of higher year-end prices on the
calculation of reserves for cost-oil recovery under
a

production-sharing contract. in the united states, the 68-million-barrel net downward revision
in the gulf of mexico area was across several fields and based mainly on reservoir analyses and
assessments of well performance. for affiliated companies, the 206-million-barrel increase for tco
was based on an updated assessment of reservoir performance for the tengiz field. partially
offsetting this increase was a downward effect of higher year-end prices on the variable
royalty-rate calculation. downward revisions also occurred in other geographic areas because of the
effect of higher year-end prices on various production-sharing terms and variable royalty
calculations.
in 2005, net revisions reduced reserves by 239million and 24million barrels for
worldwide consolidated companies and equity affiliates, respectively. for consolidated companies,
the net decrease was 199million barrels in the international areas and 40million barrels in the
united states. the largest downward net revisions internationally were 108million barrels in
indonesia and 53million barrels in kazakhstan, due primarily to the effect of higher year-end
prices on the calculation of reserves associated with production-sharing and variable-royalty
contracts. in the united states, the 40-million-barrel reduction was across many fields in each of
the geographic sections. most of the downward revision for affiliated companies was a
19-million-barrel reduction in hamaca, attributable to revised government royalty provisions. for
tco, the downward effect of higher year-end prices was partially offset by increased reservoir
performance.
improved recovery in 2005, improved recovery
increased liquids volumes worldwide by 203million
barrels for consolidated companies. international areas
accounted for 142million barrels of the increase.
indonesia added 42million barrels due to improved
performance. reserve additions of 67million barrels in
africa occurred primarily in angola and resulted from
infill drilling, wells workovers and secondary recovery
from gas injection. additions of 29million barrels in
the other international area were mainly attributable
to improved waterflood performance offshore eastern
canada. an increase of 61million barrels occurred in
the united states, primarily in california due to
improved performance on a large heavy oil field under
thermal recovery.
extensions and discoveries in 2005,
extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes
worldwide by 184million barrels for consolidated
companies. the largest increase was 49million barrels
in nigeria, reflecting new development drilling,
including in the agbami field, among others. new field
developments in brazil contributed another 41million
barrels of discoveries. in the united states, the
44-million-barrel addition was associated mainly with
the initial booking of reserves for the blind faith
field in the deepwater gulf of mexico.
purchases in 2005, the acquisition of 572
million barrels of liquids related solely to the
acquisition of unocal in august. about three-fourths
of the 376million barrels acquired in the
international areas were represented by vol-
umes in
azerbaijan and thailand. most volumes acquired in
the united states were in texas and alaska.
sales in 2004, sales of liquids volumes reduced
reserves of consolidated companies by 179million
barrels. sales totaled 130million barrels in the
united states and 33million barrels in the other
international region. sales in the other region of
the united states totaled 103millions barrels, with
two fields accounting for approximately one-
half of the volume. the 27million barrels sold in
the gulf of mexico reflect the sale of a number of
shelf properties. the other international sales
include the disposal of western canada properties and
several fields in the united kingdom. all the sales
were associated with the companys program to dispose
of assets deemed nonstrategic to the portfolio of
producing properties.
in 2005, sales of 58million barrels in the
other international area related to the disposition
of the former unocal operations onshore in canada.

net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2005 consist of 5,141billion cubic
feet of developed reserves and 669billion cubic feet of undeveloped reserves for consolidated
companies and (672)billion cubic feet of developed reserves and 174billion cubic feet of
undeveloped reserves for affiliated companies.
during 2005, the percentages of
undeveloped reserves at december31, 2004, transferred to developed reserves were 12percent and 19
percent for consolidated companies and affiliated companies, respectively.
noteworthy amounts in the categories of
proved-reserve changes for 2003 through 2005 in the
table above are discussed below:
revisions in 2003,
revisions accounted for a net increase of 1,627 bcf for
consolidated companies, as net increases of 2,233 bcf
internationally were partially offset by net downward
revisions of 606 bcf in the united states.
internationally, the net 879 bcf increase in the
asia-pacific region related primarily to australia and
kazakhstan. in australia, the increase was associated
mainly with a change to the probabilistic method of
aggregating the reserves for multiple fields produced
through common offshore infrastructure into a single
lng plant. the increase in kazakhstan related to an
updated
geologic model for one
field and higher gas sales to a third-party processing
plant. the net 976 bcf increase in the other
international area was mainly the result of operating
contract extensions for two fields in south america. in
the united states, about one-third of the net 606 bcf
negative revision related to two coal bed methane
fields in the mid-continent region, based on
performance data for producing wells. downward
revisions for the balance of the write-down were
associated with several fields, based on assessments of
well performance and other data.
in 2004, revisions increased reserves for
consolidated companies by a net 248 bcf, composed of
increases of 928 bcf internationally and decreases
of 680 bcf in the united states. internationally,
about half of the 346 bcf
fs-74

table v  reserve quantity information  continued
increase in africa related to properties in nigeria, for which changes were associated with
well performance reviews, development drilling and lease fuel calculations. the 236 bcf addition in
the asia-pacific region was related primarily to reservoir analysis for a single field. most of the
325 bcf in the other international area is related to a new gas sales contract in trinidad and
tobago. in the united states, the net 391 bcf downward revision in the gulf of mexico was related
to well-performance reviews and technical analyses in several fields. most of the net 316 bcf
negative revision in the other u.s. area related to two coal bed methane fields in the
mid-continent region and their associated wells performance. the 963 bcf increase for tco was
connected with updated analyses of reservoir performance and processing plant yields.
in 2005, reserves were revised downward by 14 bcf
for consolidated companies and 498 bcf for equity
affiliates. for consolidated companies, negative
revisions were 428 bcf in the asia-pacific region. most
of the decrease was attributable to one field in
kazakhstan, due mainly to the effects of higher
year-end prices on variable-royalty provisions of the
production-sharing contract. reserves additions for
consolidated companies totaled 211 bcf and 243 bcf in
africa and other, respectively. the majority of the
african region changes were in angola, due to a revised
forecast of fuel gas usage, and in nigeria from
improved reservoir performance. the availability of
third-party compression in colombia accounted for most
of the increase in the other region. revisions in the
united states decreased reserves by 9 bcf, as nominal
increases in the san joaquin valley were more than
offset by decreases in the gulf of mexico and other
region. for the tco affiliate in kazakhstan, a
reduction of 547 bcf reflects the updated forecast of
future royalties payable and year-end price effects,
partially offset by volumes added as a result of an
updated assessment of reservoir performance.
extensions and discoveries in 2003, extensions and
discoveries accounted for an increase of 526 bcf for
consolidated companies, reflecting a 388 bcf increase
in the united states, with 270 bcf added in the gulf of
mexico and 118 bcf in the other region. the gulf of
mexico increase includes discoveries in several
offshore louisiana fields, with a large number of
fields in texas, louisiana and other states accounting
for the increase in other.
in 2004, extensions and
discoveries accounted for an increase of 214 bcf,
reflecting an increase in the united states of 144 bcf,
with 89 bcf added in the other region and 54 bcf
added in the gulf of mexico through drilling activities
in a large number of fields.
in 2005, consolidated companies increased reserves
by 370 bcf, including 167 bcf in the united states and
118 bcf in the asia-pacific region. in the united
states, 99 bcf was added in the other region and 68
bcf in the gulf of mexico, primarily due to drilling
activities. the addition in asia-pacific resulted
primarily from increased drilling in kazakhstan.
purchases in 2005, all except 7 bcf of the 5,656
bcf total purchases were associated with the unocal
acquisition. international reserve acquisitions were
4,488 bcf, with thailand accounting for about half the
volumes. other significant volumes were added in
bangladesh and myanmar.
sales in 2004, sales for consolidated companies
totaled 547 bcf. of this total, 436 bcf was in the
united states and 111 bcf in the other international
region. in the united states, other region sales
accounted for 289 bcf, reflecting the disposal of a
large number of smaller properties, including a coal
bed methane field. gulf of mexico sales of 147 bcf
reflected the sale of shelf properties, with four
fields accounting for more than one-third of the total
sales. sales in the other international region
reflected the disposition of the properties in western
canada and the united kingdom.
in 2005, sales of 248 bcf in the other
international region related to the disposition of
former-unocals onshore properties in canada.

table of contents
supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  continued
table vi  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and gas
reserves, is calculated in accordance with the
requirements of fas 69. estimated future cash inflows
from production are computed by applying year-end
prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of
estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are
limited to those provided by contractual arrangements
in existence at the end of each reporting year. future
development and production costs are those estimated
future expenditures necessary to develop and produce
year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end
cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end
economic conditions, and include estimated costs for
asset retirement obligations. estimated future income
taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end
statutory tax rates. these rates reflect allowable
deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated
future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of
related assets. discounted future net cash flows are
calculated
using 10percent midperiod discount
factors. discounting requires a year-by-year estimate
of when future expenditures will be incurred and when
reserves will be produced.
the information provided does not represent
managements estimate of the companys expected future
cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.
estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise
and change over time as new information becomes
available. moreover, probable and possible reserves,
which may become proved in the future, are excluded
from the calculations. the arbitrary valuation
prescribed under fas 69 requires assumptions as to the
timing and amount of future development and production
costs. the calculations are made as of december31 each
year and should not be relied upon as an indication of
the companys future cash flows or value of its oil and
gas reserves. in the following table, standardized
measure net cash flows refers to the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows.
