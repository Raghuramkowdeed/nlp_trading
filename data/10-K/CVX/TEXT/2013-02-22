subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to u.s.and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining activities, power generation and energy services. upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. a list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on pages e-4 and e-5. as of december31, 2012, chevron had approximately 62,000employees (including about 3,700 service station employees). approximately 31,000employees (including about 3,400 service station employees), or 50percent, were employed in u.s.operations. overview of petroleum industry petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) are typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. in its downstream business, chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. operating environment refer to pages fs-2 through fs-8 of this form10-k in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the companys current business environment and outlook.chevrons strategic direction chevrons primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. in the upstream, the companys strategies are to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global natural gas business. in the downstream, the strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the value chain. the company also continues to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions. ___________________________________*incorporated in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. in 2005, chevrontexaco corporation changed its name to chevron corporation. as used in this report, the term chevron and such terms as the company, the corporation, our, we and us may refer to chevron corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include affiliates of chevron i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 3description of business and propertiesthe upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in north america, south america, europe, africa, asia and australia. tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending december31, 2012, and assets as of the end of 2012 and 2011 for the united states and the companys international geographic areas are in note10 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on pagefs-36. similar comparative data for the companys investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in notes11 and 12 on pages fs-38 through fs-40.capital and exploratory expenditures total expenditures for 2012 were $34.2 billion, including $2.1 billion for the companys share of equity-affiliate expenditures. in 2011 and 2010, expenditures were $29.1 billion and $21.8 billion, respectively, including the companys share of affiliates expenditures of $1.7 billion in 2011 and $1.4 billion in 2010. of the $34.2 billion in expenditures for 2012, 89 percent, or $30.4 billion, was related to upstream activities. approximately 89 and 87 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2011 and 2010, respectively. international upstream accounted for about 72 percentof the worldwide upstream investment in 2012, about 68 percent in 2011 and about 82 percent in 2010. these amounts exclude the acquisition of atlas energy, inc., in 2011. in 2013, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $36.7billion, including $3.3billion of spending by affiliates. approximately 90percent of the total, or $33billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $25.5billion, or about 70percent, of this amount for projects outside the united states. refer also to a discussion of the companys capital and exploratory expenditures on page fs-12. upstream the table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2012 and 2011 by the company and its affiliates. worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.610 millionbarrels per day, down about 2 percent from 2011. the decrease was mainly associated with normal field declines, the shut-in of the frade field in brazil, and a major planned turnaround at the tengizchevroil facilities in kazakhstan. the start-up and ramp-up of several major capital projects the platong ii natural gas project in thailand, the usan and agbami 2 projects in nigeria, and the perdido, tahiti 2 and caesar/tonga projects in the u.s.gulf of mexico  partially offset the decrease in net production from 2011. refer to the results of operations section beginning on pagefs-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2010through 2012 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas. the company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2013 will be approximately 2.650 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of $112 per barrel in 2012. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project start-ups and ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. the longer-term outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. refer to the review of ongoing exploration and production activities in key areas, beginning on page9, for a discussion of the companys major crude oil and natural gas development projects.___________________________________*as used in this report, the term project may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. all of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term project as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation.4net production of crude oil

operations under a variety of contractual obligations. most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. in the united states, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 192billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2015. the company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the companys proved developed u.s.reserves and third-party purchases. these commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts. outside the united states, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 791billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2013 through 2015 for operations in australia, colombia, denmark and the philippines. these sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. the company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the companys proved developed reserves in these countries. 7development activities refer to table i on pagefs-62 for details associated with the companys development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2012, 2011 and 2010. the following table summarizes the companys net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the companys development wells drilling at december31, 2012. a development well is a well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural

production and net production, which are defined under production in exhibit99.1 onpagee-11.      the discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production and for projects recently placed on production. reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the companys share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the worlds major hydrocarbon basins. the companys upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the companys equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global natural gas business. the map above indicates chevrons primary areas for exploration and production.united statesupstream activities in the united states are concentrated in california, the gulf of mexico, colorado, louisiana, michigan, new mexico, ohio, oklahoma, pennsylvania, texas, west virginia, and wyoming. average net oil-equivalent production in the united states during 2012 was 655,000barrels per day. in california, the company has significant production in the sanjoaquin valley. in 2012, net daily production averaged 163,000barrels of crude oil, 70million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000barrels of natural gas liquids (ngls). approximately 86percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with api gravity lower than 22 degrees). during 2012, net daily production for the companys combined interests in the gulf of mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region, was 153,000barrels of crude oil, 395million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000barrels of ngls. chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico during 2012. the jack and st. malo fields are located within 25miles of each other and are being jointly developed. chevron has a 50percent interest in the jack field, a 51percent interest in the st. malo field and a 50.7 percent interest in the production host facility. both fields are company operated. drilling operations progressed during 2012, with five of 10 planned wells drilled. at the end of 2012, project activities were more than 57 percent complete, with subsea and floating production unit installation activities expected in second-half 2013. the facility is planned to have a design capacity of 177,000barrels of oil-equivalent per day to accommodate production from the jack/st. malo development, which is estimated to have maximum total daily production of 94,000barrels of oil equivalent, plus production from a nearby third-party field. total project costs for the initial phase of development are estimated at $7.5billion and start-up is expected in 2014. the fields have an estimated production life of 30years. proved reserves have been recognized for this project. in 2012, an evaluation of additional development opportunities was initiated for the jack and st. malo fields. stage 2, the first phase of future development work, is expected to include four additional development wells, two each at the jack and the st. malo fields. front-end engineering and design (feed) activities are planned to begin in mid-2013. at the end of 2012, proved reserves had not been recognized for the jack/st. malo stage 2 project.  9fabrication and development drilling continued in 2012 for the 60percent-owned and operated big foot project. the development plan includes a 15-slot drilling and production platform with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 79,000barrels of oil equivalent per day. at the end of 2012, project activities were 68 percent complete, and topside module installation is planned for mid-2013. first production is anticipated in 2014. the field has an estimated production life of 20years. proved reserves have been recognized for this project. tahiti 2 is the second development phase for the 58percent-owned and operated tahiti field, and is designed to increase recovery and return

primarily in transporting refined products in the coastal waters of the united states.the foreign-flagged vessels are engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from the middle east, southeast asia, the black sea, south america, mexico and west africa to ports in the united states, europe, australia and asia. the companys foreign-flagged vessels also transport refined products and feedstocks to and from various locations worldwide.in 2012, the company ordered eight new vessels, a combination of bareboat charters and new builds contracts, to modernize the fleet and increase lng coverage. in addition to the vessels ordered in 2012, the company has prior contracts in place to build lng carriers and a dynamic-positioning shuttle tanker to support future upstream projects. the company also owns a one-sixth interest in each of seven lng carriers transporting cargoes for the north west shelf venture in australia.other businesses mining: chevrons u.s.-based mining company concluded the divestment of its remaining coal mining operations. in 2012, the company completed the sale of its kemmerer, wyoming, surface coal mine and the sale of its 50percent interest in youngs creek mining company, llc, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern wyoming. activities related to final reclamation continued in 2012 at the company-operated surface coal mine in mckinley, newmexico. 26chevron also owns and operates the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico. at year-end 2012, chevron had 160million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves at questa. production and underground development at questa continued at reduced levels in 2012 in response to weak prices for molybdenum. power generation: chevrons global power company manages interests in 11 power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 2,200 megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the united states and asia. ten of these are efficient combined-cycle and gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize recovered waste heat to produce electricity and support industrial thermal hosts. the 11thfacility is a wind farm, located in casper, wyoming, that is designed to optimize the use of a decommissioned refinery site for delivery of clean, renewable energy to the local utility. chevron also has major geothermal operations in indonesia and the philippines and is evaluating several advanced solar technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its renewable energy strategy. for additional information on the companys geothermal operations and renewable energy projects, refer to page 19 in the upstream section and research and technology below.chevron energy solutions (ces): ces is a wholly owned subsidiary that develops and builds sustainable energy projects that increase energy efficiency and production of renewable power, reduce energy costs, and ensure reliable, high-quality energy for government, education and business facilities. ces has developed hundreds of projects that have helped customers reduce their energy costs and environmental impact. in 2012, ces completed several public sector programs, including a first-of-its-kind microgrid at the santa rita jail in alameda county, and renewable and efficiency programs for huntington beach city school district, south san francisco unified school district and union city, all in california, plus rootstown local school district in ohio. ces also completed an energy efficiency program at the detroit arsenal and a combined renewable power production and heating project at the marine corps logistics base in albany, georgia. ces is also guiding the work of the new chevron center for sustainable energy efficiency in qatar. in december 2012, ces and its partners inaugurated the first large scale solar testing in qatar. the evaluation will help determine the most appropriate solar technologies for the middle east.research and technology: the companys energy technology organization supports chevrons upstream and downstream businesses by providing technology, services and competency development in earth sciences; reservoir and production engineering; drilling and completions; facilities engineering; manufacturing; process technology; catalysis; technical computing; and health, environment and safety disciplines. the information technology organization integrates computing, telecommunications, data management, security and network technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure and enable chevrons global operations and business processes.chevron's venture capital investment group manages investments and projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration into chevrons core businesses. as of the end of 2012, the venture capital group continued to explore technologies such as next-generation biofuels, advanced solar and enhanced pipeline inspection methods. in 2012, the company continued evaluation of a solar-to-steam generation project in use to support enhanced-oil-recovery operations in coalinga, california. this project was commissioned to test the viability of using solar power to produce steam to improve oil recovery.in 2012, the company launched a new tank technology for storing water at hydraulic fracturing operations. these patent-pending modular metal tanks can be quickly assembled and taken apart for reuse at other wells. this enables drilling and fracturing without the need for water storage pits and is intended to result in enhanced safety, less land disturbance, smaller drill site pads and significantly lower costs. the first fully operational tank was brought into service in ohio. chevrons research and development expenses were $648million, $627million and $526million for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. some of the investments the company makes in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies and business processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are not certain.environmental protection: the company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and minimize the impact of those that may occur. chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address all credible and significant risks identified by site-specific risk and impact assessments. chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. in the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, chevron also maintains a worldwide emergency response team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. to complement the companys capabilities, chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the marine spill response corporation, which operates in u.s.territorial waters, and oil spill response, ltd. (osrl), which operates globally. the company is a founding member of the marine well containment company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the gulf of mexico. 27in addition, the company is a member of the subsea well response project (swrp). swrps objective is to further develop the industrys capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world.  refer to management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pages fs-15 and fs-16 for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on chevron and on the company's 2012 environmental expenditures. refer to page fs-15 and note 24 on page fs-58 for a discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. refer also to item 1a. risk factors on pages 28 through 30

furnished pursuant to section13(a) or 15(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934 are available free of charge on the companys web site soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission (sec). the reports are also available on the secs web site at www.sec.gov.item 1a.risk factorschevron is a global energy company with a diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a history of generating sufficient cash to pay dividends and fund capital and exploratory expenditures. nevertheless, some inherent risks could materially impact the companys financial results of operations or financial condition. chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices: chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risk. chevron accepts the risk of changing commodity prices as part of its business planning process. as such, an investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.during extended periods of historically low prices for crude oil, the companys upstream earnings and capital and exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected. upstream assets may also become impaired. the impact on downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. the scope of chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources: the company is in an extractive business; therefore, if chevron is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future production or through acquisitions, the companys business will decline. creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. the companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human factors: chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. the companys operations and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either natural or human causes beyond its control, including hurricanes, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats and terrorist acts, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment. the companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight: chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. the company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. however, failure to manage these risks effectively could result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. nonetheless, in certain situations where chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action: the company produces, transports, refines and markets materials with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially toxic materials in the course of its business. chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government 28action, either as a result of an accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment. in addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, including information relating to ecuador matters, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on fs-40.the company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure: the company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. as a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. the company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. the occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition. political instability and significant changes in the regulatory environment could harm chevrons business: the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates. as has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties. in certain locations, governments have imposed or proposed restrictions on the companys operations, export and exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. in other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations. those developments have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. at december31, 2012, 21percent of the companys net proved reserves were located in kazakhstan. the company also has significant interests in opec-member countries, including angola, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. twenty-one percent of the companys net proved reserves, including affiliates, were located in opec countries at december31, 2012. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for chevrons products: continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on the companys operations and financial results. international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. these and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. the level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, the companys activities in it and market conditions. greenhouse gas emissions that could be regulated include those arising from the companys exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys products. some of these activities, such as consumers and customers use of the companys products, as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such laws and regulations, are beyond the companys control. the effect of regulation on the companys financial performance will depend on a number of factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on the companys ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products. material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for products the company currently sells and adversely affect the companys sales volumes, revenues and margins. changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period: in preparing the companys periodic reports under the securities exchange act of 1934, including its financial statements, chevrons management is required under 29applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. these estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and impairments to property, plant and equipment. changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the companys business plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.item1b.unresolved staff commentsnone.item 2.propertiesthe location and character of the companys crude oil, natural gas and mining

beginning on pagefs-40. certain governmental proceedings: in 2011, the california air resources board (carb) made penalty demands with respect to four notices of violation against chevron for alleged violations of carb's fuel blend regulations at certain california terminals and refineries. in november 2011, the statute of limitations expired with respect to two of the notices of violation. on january 28, 2013, settlements were executed, which resolved the remaining two notices of violation. one settlement, with respect to the richmond refinery, resulted in the payment of a civil penalty in the amount of $192,500, and the other settlement, relating to the san jose and sacramento terminals, resulted in the payment of a civil penalty in the amount of $205,000. in july 2009, the hawaii department of health (doh) alleged that chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil penalties exceeding $100,000 in conjunction with commitments chevron undertook to install and operate certain air emission control equipment at its hawaii refinery pursuant to a clean air act settlement with the united states environmental protection agency (epa) and the doh. chevron has disputed many of the allegations.     the epa indicated that it would assess chevron's salt lake city refinery a civil penalty for alleged violations of federal requirements and utah's air quality laws. these alleged violations were the subject of an august20, 2008, epa notice of violation (nov) for which no penalty was assessed at the time. it appears that the resolution of this nov may result in the payment of a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. the south coast air quality management district (scaqmd) issued an nov to chevron's huntington beach, california, terminal seeking a civil penalty for alleged violations involving the repair of two holes in the roof of a tank at the terminal. on january 24, 2013, chevron u.s.a. inc. executed a settlement agreement with the scaqmd and made payment of $100,000 to resolve the nov issued to the huntington beach terminal. in september and november 2012, chevron's richmond refinery received from the bay area air quality management district (baaqmd) proposals to resolve 47 alleged novs related to air quality regulations.  a single settlement agreement has been finalized covering 28 of those novs for payment of $145,600 in civil penalties.  resolution of the remaining novs is pending and may result in a civil penalty exceeding $100,000. in april 2012, the south coast air quality management district (scaqmd) issued a letter seeking to settle five separate and unrelated novs issued to chevron's el segundo refinery in 2011 for alleged violations of various state and local rules relating to air emissions. on january 24, 2013, chevron u.s.a. inc. executed a settlement agreement with scaqmd and made payment of $300,000 to resolve the five novs issued to the el segundo refinery.item 4.mine safety disclosuresinformation concerning

that follow.refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs-6 for a discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ended december31, 2012. business environment and outlook chevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the level of the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the companys quarterly earnings during the year. to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments.the companys operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. from time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the companys operations or investments. those developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the companys financial performance and growth. refer to the results of operations section beginning on page fs-6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2012. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas are as follows:     upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could fs-2also inhibit the companys production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the companys ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations. the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the companys control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industrys material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industrys own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti)crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $112 per barrel for the full-year 2012, compared to $111 in 2011. as of mid-february2013, the brent price was about $118 per barrel. the majority of the companys equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. the wti price averaged $94 per barrel for the full-year 2012, compared to $95 in 2011. as of mid-february2013, the wti price was about $97 per barrel. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2012 due to high inventories in the u.s. midcontinent market driven by strong growth in domestic production. a differential in crude oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). during 2012, the differential between u.s. light and heavy crude oil remained below historical norms as light sweet crude oil production in the midcontinent region increased and outbound capacity at cushing remained constrained. outside of the u.s., the differential narrowed modestly during 2012 as additional heavy crude oil conversion capacity came on line. chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page fs-10 for the companys average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $2.71 per thousand cubic feet (mcf)during 2012, compared with about $4.00 during 2011. as of mid-february2013, the henry hub spot price was about $3.30 per mcf. fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america.outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. international natural gas realizations averaged about $6.00 per mcf during 2012, compared with about $5.40 per mcf during 2011. (see page fs-10 for the companys average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)fs-3management's discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations  the companys worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2012 averaged 2.610 million barrels per day. about one-fifth of the companys net oil-equivalent production in 2012 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the companys net crude oil production in 2012 or 2011. at their december2012 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30million barrels per day, which has been in effect since december2008. the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2013 will average approximately 2.650 million barrels per day based on an average brent price of $112 per barrel for the full-year 2012. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups or ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevrons upstream investment is made outside the united states.refer to the results of operations section on pages fs-6 through fs-7 for additional discussion of the companys upstream business.refer to table v beginning on page fs-67 for a tabulation of the companys proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2010 and each year-end from 2010 through 2012, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending december31, 2012.on november7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to this seep has emerged. on march14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. as a precautionary measure, the company and its partners decided to temporarily suspend field production and received approval from brazils national petroleum agency (anp) to do so.  chevron and its partners are cooperating with the brazilian authorities. on july19, 2012, anp issued its final investigative report on the november 2011 incident. a brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for each of the two seeps. the company is not aware of any basis for damages to be awarded in any civil lawsuit. on july 31, 2012, a court presiding over the civil litigation entered a preliminary injunction barring chevron from conducting oil production and transportation activities in brazil pending completion of the legal proceedings commenced by the federal district prosecutor and the ongoing proceedings of anp and the brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency. on september 28, 2012, the injunction was modified to clarify that chevron may continue its containment and mitigation activities under supervision of anp. on appeal, on november 27, 2012, the injunction was revoked in its entirety. the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against 11 chevron employees. jurisdiction for all three matters was moved from campos to a court in rio de janeiro. on february 19, 2013, the court dismissed the criminal matter, which is subject to appeal by the prosecutor. chevron has submitted to anp a plan for restarting limited fs-4production in the frade field. the companys ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period.     the company entered into a nonbinding financing term sheet with petroboscan, a joint stock company owned 39.2 percent by chevron, which operates the boscan field in venezuela.when finalized, the financing is expected to occur in stages over a limited drawdown period and is intended to support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level.the terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development, as well as distributions to shareholders  including current outstanding obligations.the loan will be repaid from future petroboscan crude sales.definitive documents are under negotiation.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the companys shipping operations, which are driven by the industrys demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the companys control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the companys refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the companys most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. the company completed a multiyear plan in 2012 to streamline the downstream asset portfolio to concentrate resources and capital on strategic assets. in third quarter 2012, the company completed the sale of its perth amboy, new jersey, refinery, which had been operated as a products terminal in recent years. in 2012, the company completed the sale of its fuels marketing and aviation businesses in eight countries in the caribbean.refer to the results of operations section on pages fs-7 through fs-8 for additional discussion of the companys downstream operations.all other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels, and technology companies. operating developments key operating developments and other events during 2012 and early 2013 included the following:upstream australia in october 2012, the company acquired additional interests in the clio and acme fields in the carnarvon basin in exchange for chevron's interests in the browse development. consolidating interests in the carnarvon basin fits strategically with long-term plans to grow the wheatstone area resource base and creates expansion opportunities for the wheatstone project.     in september 2012, the company completed the sale of an equity interest in the wheatstone project to tokyo electric.       during 2012 and early 2013, the company announced natural gas discoveries at the 47.3 percent-owned and operated pontus prospect in block wa-37-l, the 50 percent-owned and operated satyr prospect in block wa-374-p, the 50 percent-owned and operated pinhoe prospect in block wa-383-p, the 50 percent-owned and operated arnhem prospect in block wa-364-p, and the 50 percent-owned and operated kentish knock south prospect in block wa-365-p. these discoveries are expected to contribute to potential expansion opportunities at company-operated lng facilities.     during 2012, chevron signed nonbinding heads of agreement with tohoku electric and chubu electric and additional binding agreements with tokyo electric for lng offtake from the wheatstone project. to date, more than 80 percent of chevron's equity lng from wheatstone is covered under long-term agreements with customers in asia.angola in early 2013, the company announced it plans to proceed with the development of the mafumeira sul project located in block 0.angola-republic of the

presents the results of operations for the companys business segments  upstream and downstream  as well as for all other. earnings are also presented for the u.s. and international geographic areas of the upstream and downstream business segments. refer to note 10, beginning on page fs-36, for a discussion of the companys reportable segments, as defined in accounting standards for segment reporting (accounting standards codification (asc)280). this section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in business environment and outlook on pages fs-2 through fs-5.u.s. upstream millions of dollars201220112010earnings$5,332$6,512$4,122u.s. upstream earnings of $5.3 billion in 2012 decreased $1.2 billion from 2011, primarily due to lower natural gas and crude oil realizations of $340 million and $200 million, respectively, lower crude oil production of $240 million, and lower gains on asset sales of $180 million. u.s. upstream earnings of $6.5 billion in 2011 increased $2.4 billion from 2010. the benefit of higher crude oil realizations increased earnings by $2.8billion between periods. partly offsetting this effect were lower net oil-equivalent production, which decreased earnings by about $400million, and higher operating expenses of $200million. the companys average realization for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2012 was $95.21 per barrel, compared with $97.51 in 2011 and $71.59 in 2010. the average natural gas realization was $2.64 per thousand cubic feet in 2012, compared with $4.04 and $4.26 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.fs-6net oil-equivalent production in 2012 averaged 655,000 barrels per day, down 3 percent from 2011 and 7 percent from 2010. between 2012 and 2011, the decrease in production was associated with normal field declines and an absence of volumes associated with cook inlet, alaska, assets sold in 2011. partially offsetting this decrease was a ramp-up of projects in the gulf of mexico and marcellus shale and improved operational performance in the gulf of mexico. the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2012 averaged 455,000 barrels per day, down 2 percentfrom 2011 and 7 percent from 2010. net natural gas production averaged about 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2012, down approximately 6 percent from 2011 and about 8 percentfrom 2010. refer to the selected operating data table on page fs-10 for a three-year comparative of production volumes in the united states. international upstream millions of dollars201220112010earnings*$18,456$18,274$13,555*includes foreign currency effects:$(275)$211$(293)international upstream earnings were $18.5 billion in 2012 compared with $18.3 billion in 2011. the increase was mainly due to a gain of approximate $1.4 billion on an asset exchange in australia, higher natural gas realizations of about $610 million and a nearly $600 million gain on sale of an equity interest in the wheatstone project. mostly offsetting these effects were lower crude oil volumes of about $1.3 billion and higher exploration expenses of about $430 million. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $275 million in 2012, compared with an increase of $211 million a year earlier. international upstream earnings of $18.3 billion in 2011 increased $4.7 billion from 2010. higher prices for crude oil increased earnings by $7.1billion. this benefit was partly offset by higher tax items of about $1.7billion and higher operating expenses, including fuel, of about $1.0billion. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $211 million in 2011, compared with a decrease of $293 million in 2010. the companys average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2012 was $101.88 per barrel, compared with $101.53 in 2011 and $72.68 in 2010. the average natural gas realization was $5.99 per thousand cubic feet in 2012, compared with $5.39 and $4.64 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.international net oil-equivalent production of 1.96 million barrels per day in 2012 decreased 2 percent from 2011 and decreased about 5 percent from  2010. new production in thailand and nigeria in 2012 was more than offset by normal field declines, the shut-in of the frade field in brazil and a major planned turnaround at tengizchevroil. the decline between 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to price effects on entitlement volumes.the net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was about 1.3 million barrels per day in 2012, a decrease of approximately 5 percent from 2011 and a decrease of approximately 9 percent from 2010. international net natural gas production of 3.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2012 was up 6 percent from 2011 and up 4 percent from 2010.      refer to the selected operating data table, on

2012, compared with $1.5 billion in 2011. the increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales of $520 million and higher earnings of $140 million from the 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem). these benefits were partly offset by higher operating expenses of $130 million.earnings of $1.5 billion in 2011 increased $167 million from 2010. earnings benefited by $300million from improved margins on refined products, $200million from higher earnings from cpchem and $50million from the absence of 2010 charges related to employee reductions. these benefits were partly offset by the absence of a $400million gain on the sale of the companys ownership interest in the colonial pipeline company recognized in 2010. refined product sales of 1.21 million barrels per day in 2012 declined 4 percent, mainly reflecting lower gasoline and fuel oil sales. sales volumes of refined products were 1.26 million barrels per day in 2011, a decrease of 7 percent from 2010. the decline was mainly in gasoline, gas oil and kerosene sales. u.s. branded gasoline sales of 516,000 barrels per day in 2012 were essentially flat from 2011 and declined approximately 10percent from 2010. the decline in 2012 and fs-7management's discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations2011 from 2010 was primarily due to weaker demand and

downstream earned $2.3 billion in 2012, compared with $2.1 billion in 2011. earnings increased due to a favorable change in effects on derivative instruments of $190 million and higher margins on refined product sales of $100 million. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $173 million in 2012, compared with a decrease of $65 million a year earlier. earnings of $2.1 billion in 2011 increased $946 million from 2010. gains on asset sales benefited earnings by $700million, primarily from the sale of the pembroke refinery and related marketing assets in the united kingdom and ireland. also contributing to earnings were improved margins of $200million and the absence of 2010 charges of $90million related to employee reductions. these benefits were partly offset by an unfavorable change in effects on derivative instruments of about $180million. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $65 million in 2011, compared with a decrease of $135 million in 2010. total refined product sales of 1.55million barrels per day in 2012 declined 8percent, primarily related to the third quarter 2011 sale of the companys refining and marketing assets in the united kingdom and ireland. excluding the impact of 2011 asset sales, sales volumes were flat between the comparative periods. international refined product sales volumes of 1.69million barrels per day in

the rate was unchanged between 2012 and 2011. the impact of lower effective tax rates in international upstream operations were offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods.for international upstream, the lower effective tax rates in the current period were driven primarily by the effects of asset sales, one-time tax benefits and reduced withholding taxes, which were partially offset by a lower utilization of tax credits during the year. the rate was higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to higher effective tax rates in certain international upstream jurisdictions. the higher international upstream effective tax rates were driven primarily by lower utilization of non-u.s. tax credits in 2011 and the effect of changes in income tax rates between

projects at december31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was invested in short-term marketable securities and recorded as deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.dividends dividends paid to common stockholders were $6.8billion in 2012, $6.1 billion in 2011 and $5.7billion in 2010. in april 2012, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 11.1percent to 90 cents per common share.      debt and capital lease obligations total debt and capital lease obligations were $12.2billion at december31, 2012, up from $10.2billion at year-end 2011. the $2.0billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2012 included the net effect of a $4 billion bond issuance and the early redemption of a $2 billion bond due in march 2014. the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $6.0billion at december31, 2012, compared with $5.9billion at year-end 2011. of these amounts, $5.9 billion and $5.6 billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. at year-end 2012, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2013, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. at december31, 2012, the company had $6.0billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2012. in addition, in november 2012, the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a new registration statement that expires in november 2015. this registration statement is for an unspecified  amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the companys debt, and the companys cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation, chevron corporation profit sharing/savings plan trust fund and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard & poors corporation and aa1 by moodys investors service. the companys u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard & poors and p-l by moodys. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. the company also can modify capital spending plans during any extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the companys high-quality debt ratings. common stock repurchase program in july2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. the company expects to repurchase between $500million and $2billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. during 2012, the company purchased 46.6million common shares for $5.0billion. from the inception of the program throughfs-11management's discussion and analysis offinancial condition and

approximately 89percent and 87percent were expended for upstream operations in 2011 and 2010. international upstream accounted for about 72percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2012, about 68percent in 2011 and about 82 percent in 2010. these amounts exclude the acquisition of atlas energy, inc., in 2011.the company estimates that 2013 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $36.7billion, including $3.3billion of spending by affiliates. approximately 90percent of the total, or $33billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities. approximately $25.5billion, or 77percent, of this amount is for projects outside the united states. spending in 2013 is primarily focused on major development projects in angola, australia, brazil, canada, china, kazakhstan, nigeria, republic of congo, russia, the united kingdom and the u.s. gulf of mexico. also included is funding for enhancing recovery and mitigating natural field declines for currently-producing assets, and for focused exploration and appraisal activities. worldwide downstream spending in 2013 is estimated at $2.7billion, with about $1.4 billion for projects in the united states. major capital outlays include projects under construction at refineries in the united states, expansion of additives production capacity in singapore and chemicals projects in the united states. investments in technology companies, power generation and other corporate businesses in 2013 are budgeted at $1billion. noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1,308 million and $799

products at indexed prices.fs-13management's discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operationsfinancial and derivative instruments the market risk associated with the companys portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. the estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the companys projection of future market changes. the actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading risk factors in parti, item1a, of the companys 2012 annual report on form 10-k. derivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. the results of these activities were not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2012. the companys market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an internal risk control group in accordance with the companys risk management policies, which have been approved by the audit committee of the companys board of directors. the derivative commodity instruments used in the companys risk management and trading activities consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange and on electronic platforms of the inter-continental exchange and chicago mercantile exchange. in addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap contracts and option contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the over-the-counter markets. derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives (asc 815), with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. the change in fair value of chevrons derivative commodity instruments in 2012 was a quarterly average decrease of $31million in total assets and a quarterly average increase of $12million in total liabilities. the company uses a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate the potential loss in fair value on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. var is the maximum projected loss not to be exceeded within a given probability or confidence level over a given period of time. the companys var model uses the monte carlo simulation method that involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified probability distributions and constructing a full distribution of a portfolios potential values. the var model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average for computing historical volatilities and correlations, a 95percent confidence level, and a one-day holding period. that is, the companys 95percent, one-day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that would not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day. the one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be liquidated or hedged within one day. for hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. the following table presents the 95percent/one-day var for each of the companys primary risk exposures

approximately $13.3 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2012 related primarily to upstream properties. for the companys other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation. refer to the discussion below for

american taxpayer relief act of 2012 (the act) was signed into u.s. law on january 2, 2013. several tax provisions that expired at the end of 2011 were extended retroactive to january 1, 2012, including the research and development credit and certain rules for controlled foreign corporations. there were no impacts from the act included in chevron's 2012 financial statements and the company does not expect the impacts of the act to have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity in any future reporting period.  other contingencies information related to other contingencies is included on page fs-57 in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements under the heading other contingencies. environmental matters virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. these regulatory requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. regulations intended to address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change also continue to evolve and include those at the international or multinational (such as the mechanisms under the kyoto protocol and the european union's emissions trading system), national (such as the u.s. environmental protection agency's emission standards and renewable transportation fuel content requirements or domestic market-based programs such as those in effect in australia and new zealand), and state or regional (such as california's global warming solutions act) levels.     most of the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials. although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the company's liquidity or financial position.accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. in addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. an obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. most of the fs-15management's discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operationsexpenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards.  using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2012 at approximately $2.8 billion for its consolidated companies. included in these expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.7 billion of costs associated with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites.for 2013, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.2 billion. these capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.critical accounting estimates and assumptions management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting principles (gaap)that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. all such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates and assumptions are based on managements experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission (sec), wherein: 1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the companys financial condition or operating performance is material.     the development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed critical, and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors. the areas of accounting and the associated critical estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of pension plan obligations and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. for other postretirement benefit (opeb)plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical assumptions in determining opeb obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. note 20, beginning on page fs-49, includes information on the funded status of the companys pension and opeb plans at the end of 2012 and 2011; the components of pension and opeb expense for the three years ended december31, 2012; and the underlying assumptions for those periods. pension and opeb expense is reported on the consolidated statement of income as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses and applies to all business segments. the year-end 2012 and 2011 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and obligations, of each of the companys pension and opeb plans is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. the differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a long-term asset in deferred charges and other assets. the differences associated with underfunded or unfunded pension and opeb plans are reported as accrued liabilities or reserves for employee benefit plans. amounts yet to be recognized as components of pension or opeb expense are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss. to estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses a process that incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the companys estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. for 2012, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent for u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 70 percentof the companys pension plan assets. in 2011 and 2010, the company used a long-term rate of return of 7.8percent for this plan. for the 10years ending december31, 2012, actual asset returns averaged 7.1 percent for this plan. the actual return for 2012 was more than 7.5 percent and was associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year. additionally, with the exception of two other years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.5percent. fs-16the year-end market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months. management considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. the discount rate assumptions used to determine the u.s. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. at december31, 2012, the company used a 3.6 percent discount rate for the u.s. pension plans and 3.9 percentfor the main u.s. opeb plan. the discount rates at the end of 2011 and 2010 were 3.8and 4.0 percent and 4.8and 5.0percent for the u.s. pension plans and the main u.s. opeb plans, respectively. an increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. total pension expense for 2012 was $1.3billion. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the companys primary u.s. pension plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2012 by approximately $80million. a 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for about 62percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2012 by approximately $165million. an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan reported on the consolidated balance sheet. the aggregate funded status recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at december31, 2012, was a net liability of approximately $5.9billion. as an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate applied to the companys primary u.s. pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $335million, which would have decreased the plans underfunded status from approximately $2.6billion to $2.2 billion. other plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. the actual rates of return on plan assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the worlds financial markets. in 2012, the companys pension plan contributions were $1.2billion (including $844 millionto the u.s. plans). in 2013, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $1.0 billion. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. additional funding may be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. for the companys opeb plans, expense for 2012 was $172 million, and the total liability, which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2012, was $3.8 billion.      as an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2012, a 1percent increase in the discount rate for the companys primary u.s. opeb plan, which accounted for about 82percent of the companywide opeb expense, would have decreased opeb expense by approximately $17million. a 0.25percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which accounted for about 83percent of the companywide opeb liabilities, would have decreased total opeb liabilities at the end of 2012 by approximately $80million. for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is limited to 4 percentper year. for active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims experiences are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.5 percent in 2013 and gradually drop to 4.5 percentfor 2025 and beyond. as an indication of the health care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of opeb expense in 2012, a 1percent increase in the rates for the main u.s. opeb plan, would have increased opeb expense by $15million. differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference occurs. instead, the differences are included in actuarial gain/loss and unamortized amounts have been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 20, beginning on page fs-49, for information on the $9.7 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of december31, 2012; a description of the method used to amortize those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2013. oil and gas reserves crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the consolidated financial statements. proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. variables impacting chevron's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology and economic conditions.        fs-17management's discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations     the estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. impacts of oil and gas reserves on chevron's consolidated financial statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:1.amortization - proved reserves are used in amortizing capitalized costs related to oil and gas producing activities on the unit-of-production (uop) method. capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a uop basis using proved developed reserves. acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a uop basis using total proved reserves. during 2012, chevron's uop depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) for oil and gas properties was $10.7 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2012 were 4.8 billion barrels. if the estimates of proved reserves used in the uop calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by 5 percent across all oil and gas properties, uop dd&a in 2012 would have increased by approximately $540 million.  2.impairment - oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment.  a significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. in assessing whether the property is impaired, the fair value of the property must be determined.  frequently, a discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value. proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. for a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see impairment of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates below.     refer to table v, reserve quantity information, beginning on page fs-67, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ending december 31, 2012, and to table vii, changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on page fs-75 for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended december 31, 2012.      this oil and gas reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the properties, plant and equipment section of note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, beginning on page fs-28, which includes a description of the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.impairment of properties, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates the company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such indicators include changes in the companys business plans, changes in commodity prices and, for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved reserve quantities. if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. however, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with the companys business plans and long-term investment decisions. refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in note 8 beginning on page fs-33 and to the section on properties, plant and equipment in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, beginning on page fs-28. no material individual impairments of pp&e or investments were recorded for the three years ending december31, 2012. a sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the companys pp&e and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired. investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the companys carrying value. when such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investments carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time. fs-18in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis. from time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. for example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of. assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. that is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets associated carrying values. asset retirement obligations in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (aro), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. a sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for 2012 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. that is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. refer to note 23 on page fs-58 for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.contingent losses management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. for example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. the company generally reports these losses as operating expenses or selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income. an exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. for additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to note 14 beginning on page fs-43. refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended december31, 2012. an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. new accounting standards refer to note 17, on page fs-47 in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for information regarding new accounting standards. fs-19quarterly results and stock market data unaudited 20122011millions of dollars, except per-share amounts4th q3rd q2nd q1st q4th q3rd q2nd q1st qrevenues and other incomesales

represent the transactions and financial position of the company. the financial statements include amounts that are based on managements best estimates and judgment.as stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of pricewaterhousecoopers llp has audited the companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).the board of directors of chevron has an audit committee composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the company. the audit committee meets regularly with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. both the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the audit committee without the presence of management.managements report on internal control over financial reportingthe companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in exchange act rule13a-15(f). the companys management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on the results of this evaluation, the companys management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december31, 2012. the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2012, has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.john s. watsonpatricia e. yarringtonmatthew

firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of chevron corporation:evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or

degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of chevron corporation and its subsidiaries at december31, 2012, and december31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are

financial statementsmillions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 1 summary of significant accounting policiesgeneral upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (lng); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. downstream operations relate primarily to refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and additives for fuels and lubricant oils. the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur. subsidiary and affiliated companies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20percent to 50percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. as part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the companys proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliates equity currently in income. investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the companys carrying value. when such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance, and the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value. the new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.  differences between the companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. when appropriate, the companys share of the affiliates reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliates historical book values. derivatives the majority of the companys activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. for some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. for other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. for the companys commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. the company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. interest rate swaps related to a portion of the companys fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. where chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet. short-term investments all short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. those investments that are part of the companys cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as cash equivalents. bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90days are reported as time deposits. the balance of short-term investments is reported as marketable securities and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive income. inventories crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. in the aggregate, these costs are below market. materials, supplies and other inventories generally are stated at average cost. fs-28note 1summary of significant accounting policies - continuedproperties, plant and equipment the successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. all costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (aro)assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. all other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. refer to note 18, beginning on page fs-47, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net before-tax cash flows. for proved crude oil and natural gas properties in the united states, the company generally performs an impairment review on an individual field basis. outside the united states, reviews are performed on a country, concession, development area or field basis, as appropriate. in downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. if the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. refer to note 8, beginning on page fs-33, relating to fair value measurements. the fair value of a liability for an aro is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associ-ated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. refer also to note 23, on page fs-58, relating to aros. depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. the capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. in general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the united states; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets. gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as other income. expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. major replacements and renewals are capitalized. goodwill goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. as required by accounting standards for goodwill (asc 350), the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. environmental expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. for the companys u.s. and canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. for crude oil, natural gas and fs-29notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 1summary of significant accounting policies - continuedmineral-producing properties, a liability for an aro is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. refer to note 23, on page fs-58, for a discussion of the companys aros.for federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. the gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the companys best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the companys own internal environmental policies. future amounts are not discounted. recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured. currency translation the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the companys consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. for those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. the cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar are included in currency translation adjustment on the consolidated statement of equity. revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. revenues from natural gas production from properties in which chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized using the entitlement method. excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. the associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the consolidated statement of income, on page fs-23. purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in purchased crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income. stock options and other share-based compensation the company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to its employees and accounts for these transactions under the accounting standards for share-based compensation (asc 718). for equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. the company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the companys long-term incentive plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. the company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis. note 2 noncontrolling interestsownership interests in the companys subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parents equity on the consolidated balance sheet. the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. the term earnings is defined as net income attributable to chevron corporation. activity for the equity

continuedlevel 3: unobservable inputs. the company does not use level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair value measurements. level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. the table below shows the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december31, 2012, and december31, 2011. marketable securities the company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. the fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at december31, 2012. derivatives the company records its derivative instruments  other than any commodity derivative contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale  on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the consolidated statement of income. for derivatives with identical or similar provisions as contracts that are publicly traded on a regular basis, the company uses the market values of the publicly traded instruments as an input for fair value calculations. the companys derivative instruments principally include futures, swaps, options and forward contracts for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. derivatives classified as level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the new york mercantile exchange.derivatives classified as level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. the company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the level 2 instruments. since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. the company does not materially adjust this information. the company incorporates internal review, evaluation and assessment procedures, including a comparison of level 2 fair values derived from the companys internally developed forward curves (on a sample basis) with the pricing information to document reasonable, logical and supportable fair value determinations and proper level of classification. properties, plant and equipment the company did not have any material long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2012 or 2011. investments and advances the company did not have any material investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2012 or 2011. assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2012at december 31, 2011totallevel 1level 2level 3totallevel 1level 2level 3marketable securities$266$266$$$249$249$$derivatives862165208104104total assets at fair value$352$287$65$$457$353$104$derivatives14914811021011total liabilities at fair value$149$148$1$$102$101$1$assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at december 31at december 31before-tax lossbefore-tax losstotallevel 1level 2level 3year 2012totallevel 1level 2level 3year 2011properties, plant and equipment, net (held and used)$84$$$84$213$67$$$67$81properties, plant and     equipment, net (held for sale)16161716716754investments and advances15108total nonrecurring assets at fair value$100$$$100$245$234$$167$67$243fs-34note 8fair value measurements - continuedassets and liabilities not required to be measured at fair value the company holds cash equivalents and bank time deposits in u.s. and non-u.s. portfolios. the instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90days or less and money market funds. cash and cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of $20,939 and $15,864 at december31, 2012, and december31, 2011, respectively. the instruments held in time deposits are bank time deposits with maturities greater than 90days, and had carrying/fair values of $708 and $3,958 at december31, 2012, and december31, 2011, respectively. the fair values of cash, cash equivalents and bank time deposits are classified as level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at december31, 2012.      "cash and cash equivalents do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,454 and $1,240 at december31, 2012, and december31, 2011, respectively. at december31, 2012, these investments are classified as level 1 and include restricted funds related to tax payments, upstream abandonment activities, funds held in escrow for an asset acquisition and capital investment projects, all of which are reported in deferred charges and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. long-term debt of $6,086 and $4,101 at december31, 2012, and december31, 2011, had estimated fair values of $6,770 and $4,928, respectively. long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. the fair value of corporate bonds is $5,853 and classified as level 1. the fair value of the other bonds is $917 and classified as level 2.   the carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet approximate their fair values. fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at december31, 2012 and 2011, were not material.      the table on previous page shows the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at december 31, 2012 and 2011.note 9 financial and derivative instrumentsderivative commodity instruments chevron is exposed to market risks related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. the company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company refineries. from time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. the companys derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. none of the companys derivative instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the companys affiliates make such designation. the companys derivatives are not material to the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. the company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. the company uses international swaps and derivatives association agreements to govern derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. when the company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and is a reasonable measure of the companys credit risk exposure. the company also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate credit risk. derivative instruments measured at fair value at december31, 2012, december31, 2011, and december31, 2010, and their classification on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income are as follows: consolidated balance sheet: fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments type ofbalance sheetat december 31at december 31contractclassification20122011commodityaccounts and notes receivable, net$57$133commoditylong-term receivables, net2975total assets at fair value$86$208commodityaccounts payable$112$36commoditydeferred credits and other noncurrent obligations3766total liabilities at fair value$149$102consolidated statement of income: the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments gain/(loss)type of derivativestatement ofyear ended december 31contractincome classification201220112010commoditysales and other operating revenues$(49)$(255)$(98)commoditypurchased crude oil  and products(24)15(36)commodityother income6(2)(1)$(67)$(242)$(135)fs-35notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 9financial and derivative instruments - continuedconcentrations of credit risk the companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. the companys short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. company investment policies limit the companys exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the companys counterparties in derivative instruments. the trade receivable balances, reflecting the companys diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed among the companys broad customer base worldwide. as a result, the company believes concentrations of credit risk are limited. the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. when the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed including requiring pre-payments, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral instruments to support sales to customers. note 10 operating segments and geographic dataalthough each subsidiary of chevron is responsible for its own affairs, chevron corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. the investments are grouped into two business segments, upstream and downstream, representing the companys reportable segments and operating segments as defined in accounting standards for segment reporting (asc 280). upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (lng); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. all other activities of the company include mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels, and technology companies. the segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes segment managers who report to the companys chief operating decision maker (codm) (terms as defined in asc 280). the codm is the companys executive committee (excom), a committee of senior officers that includes the chief executive officer, and excom reports to the board of directors of chevron corporation. the operating segments represent components of the company, as described in accounting standards for segment reporting (asc 280), that engage in activities (a)from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b)whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the codm, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c)for which discrete financial information is available. fs-36note 10operating segments and geographic data -

continuedstan over a 40-year period. at december 31, 2012, the companys carrying value of its investment in tco was about $170 higher than the amount of underlying equity in tcos net assets. this difference results from chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in tco at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of tcos net assets. see note 6, on page fs-33, for summarized financial information for 100 percent of tco. petropiar chevron has a 30 percent interest in petropiar, a joint stock company formed in 2008 to operate the hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. the project, located in venezuelas orinoco belt, has a 25-year contract term. prior to the formation of petropiar, chevron had a 30 percent interest in the hamaca project. at december31, 2012, the companys carrying value of its investment in petropiar was approximately $180 less than the amount of underlying equity in petropiars net assets. the difference represents the excess of chevrons underlying equity in petropiars net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture. caspian pipeline consortium chevron has a 15 percent interest in the caspian pipeline consortium, a variable interest entity, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both tco and karachaganak. the company joined the consortium in 1997 and has investments and advances totaling $1,187 which includes long-term loans of $1,179 at year-end 2012. the loans were provided to fund 30 percent of the initial pipeline construction. the company is not the primary beneficiary of the consortium because it does not direct activities of the consortium and only receives its proportionate share of the financial returns. petroboscan chevron has a 39 percent interest in petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006 to operate the boscan field in venezuela until 2026. chevron previously operated the field under an operating service agreement. at december31, 2012, the companys carrying value of its investment in petroboscan was approximately $200 higher than the amount of underlying equity in petroboscans net assets. the difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by chevron over its underlying equity in petroboscans net assets. angola lng ltd. chevron has a 36 percent interest in angola lng ltd., which will process and liquefy natural gas produced in angola for delivery to international markets. gs caltex corporation chevron owns 50 percent of gs caltex corporation, a joint venture with gs holdings. the joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products and petrochemicals, predominantly in south korea. chevron phillips chemical company llc chevron owns 50 percent of chevron phillips chemical company llc. the other half is owned by phillips 66. star petroleum refining company ltd. chevron has a 64 percent  ownership interest in star petroleum refining company ltd.

the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline additive. chevron is a party to six pending lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. resolution of these lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of mtbe by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. the companys ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable. the company no longer uses mtbe in the manufacture of gasoline in the united states.      ecuador  chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the superior court of nueva loja in lago agrio, ecuador, brought in may2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be represen-fs-40note 13litigation - continuedtatives of certain residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. the lawsuit alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. until 1992, texaco petroleum company (texpet), a subsidiary of texaco inc., was a minority member of this consortium with petroecuador, the ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by petroecuador. at the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the concession area, texpet entered into a formal agreement with the republic of ecuador and petroecuador for texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to texpets ownership share of the consortium. pursuant to that agreement, texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. after certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government granted texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations. based on the history described above, chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. as to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously given to texpet by the republic of ecuador and petroecuador and by the pertinent provincial and municipal governments. with regard to the facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that texpets remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining environmental damage reflects petroecuadors failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and petroecuadors further conduct since assuming full control over the operations. in 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending that the court assess $18,900, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for petroecuador. the engineers report also asserted that an additional $8,400 could be assessed against chevron for unjust enrichment. in 2009, following the disclosure by chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case was recused. in 2010, chevron moved to strike the mining engineers report and to dismiss the case based on evidence obtained through discovery in the united states indicating that the report was prepared by consultants for the plaintiffs before being presented as the mining engineers independent and impartial work and showing further evidence of misconduct. in august2010, the judge issued an order stating that he was not bound by the mining engineers report and requiring the parties to provide their positions on damages within 45 days. chevron subsequently petitioned for recusal of the judge, claiming that he had disregarded evidence of fraud and misconduct and that he had failed to rule on a number of motions within the statutory time requirement. in september2010, chevron submitted its position on damages, asserting that no amount should be assessed against it. the plaintiffs submission, which relied in part on the mining engineers report, took the position that damages are between approximately $16,000 and $76,000 and that unjust enrichment should be assessed in an amount between approximately $5,000 and $38,000. the next day, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. chevron petitioned to have that order declared a nullity in light of chevrons prior recusal petition, and because procedural and evidentiary matters remained unresolved. in october2010, chevrons motion to recuse the judge was granted. a new judge took charge of the case and revoked the prior judges order closing the evidentiary phase of the case. on december17, 2010, the judge issued an order closing the evidentiary phase of the case and notifying the parties that he had requested the case file so that he could prepare a judgment. on february14, 2011, the provincial court in lago agrio rendered an adverse judgment in the case. the court rejected chevrons defenses to the extent the court addressed them in its opinion. the judgment assessed approximately $8,600 in damages and approximately $900 as an award for the plaintiffs representatives. it also assessed an additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages unless the company issued a public apology within 15 days of the judgment, which chevron did not do. on february17, 2011, the plaintiffs appealed the judgment, seeking increased damages, and on march11, 2011, chevron appealed the judgment seeking to have the judgment nullified. on january3, 2012, an appellate panel in the provincial court affirmed the february 14, 2011 decision and ordered that chevron pay additional attorneys fees in the amount of 0.10% of the values that are derived from the decisional act of this judgment. the plaintiffs filed a petition to clarify fs-41notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 13litigation - continuedand amplify the appellate decision on january6, 2012, and the court issued a ruling in response on january13, 2012, purporting to clarify and amplify its january3, 2012 ruling, which included clarification that the deadline for the company to issue a public apology to avoid the additional amount of approximately $8,600 in punitive damages was within 15 days of the clarification ruling, or february3, 2012. chevron did not issue an apology because doing so might be mischaracterized as an admission of liability and would be contrary to facts and evidence submitted at trial. on january20, 2012, chevron appealed (called a petition for cassation) the appellate panels decision to ecuadors national court of justice. as part of the appeal, chevron requested the suspension of any requirement that chevron post a bond to prevent enforcement under ecuadorian law of the judgment during the cassation appeal. on february 17, 2012, the appellate panel of the provincial court admitted chevrons cassation appeal in a procedural step necessary for the national court of justice to hear the appeal. the provincial court appellate panel denied chevrons request for a suspension of the requirement that chevron post a bond and stated that it would not comply with the first and second interim awards of the international arbitration tribunal discussed below. on march29, 2012, the matter was transferred from the provincial court to the national court of justice, and on november 22, 2012, the national court agreed to hear chevron's cassation appeal. on august 3, 2012, the provincial court in lago agrio approved a court-appointed liquidators report on damages that calculated the total judgment in the case to be $19,100.     chevron has no assets in ecuador and the lago agrio plaintiffs' lawyers have stated in press releases and through other media that they will seek to enforce the ecuadorian judgment in various countries and otherwise disrupt chevron's operations. on may30, 2012, the lago agrio plaintiffs filed an action against chevron corporation, chevron canada limited, and chevron canada finance limited in the ontario superior court of justice in ontario, canada, seeking to recognize and enforce the ecuadorian judgment. on june27, 2012, the lago agrio plaintiffs filed an action against chevron corporation in the superior court of justice in brasilia, brazil, seeking to recognize and enforce the ecuadorian judgment. on october 15, 2012, the provincial court in lago agrio issued an ex parte embargo order that purports to order the seizure of assets belonging to separate chevron subsidiaries in ecuador, argentina and colombia. on november 6, 2012, at the request of the lago agrio plaintiffs, a court in argentina issued a freeze order against chevron argentina s.r.l. and another chevron subsidiary, ingeniero nortberto priu, requiring shares of both companies to be "embargoed," requiring third parties to withhold 40% of any payments due to chevron argentina s.r.l. and ordering banks to withhold 40% of the funds in chevron argentina s.r.l. bank accounts. on december 14th, 2012, the argentinean court rejected a motion to revoke the freeze order but modified it by ordering that third parties are not required to withhold funds but must report their payments. the court also clarified that the freeze order relating to bank accounts excludes taxes. on january 30, 2013, an appellate court upheld the freeze order. chevron continues to believe the provincial courts judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable in ecuador, the united states and other countries. the company also believes the judgment is the product of fraud, and contrary to the legitimate scientific evidence. chevron cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the appeals process in ecuador or any enforcement action. chevron expects to continue a vigorous defense of any imposition of liability in the ecuadorian courts and to contest and defend any and all enforcement actions.chevron and texpet filed an arbitration claim in september2009 against the republic of ecuador before an arbitral tribunal presiding in the permanent court of arbitration in the hague under the rules of the united nations commission on international trade law. the claim alleges violations of the republic of ecuadors obligations under the united statesecuador bilateral investment treaty (bit)and breaches of the settlement and release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet (described above), which are investment agreements protected by the bit. through the arbitration, chevron and texpet are seeking relief against the republic of ecuador, including a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation constitutes a violation of ecuadors obligations under the bit. on february9, 2011, the tribunal issued an order for interim measures requiring the republic of ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without ecuador of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending further order of the tribunal. on january25, 2012, the tribunal converted the order for interim measures into an interim award. chevron filed a renewed application for further interim measures on january4, 2012, and the republic of ecuador opposed chevrons application and requested that the existing order for interim measures be vacated on january9, 2012. on february 16, 2012, the tribunal issued a second interim award mandating that the republic of ecuador take all measures necessary (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within and without ecuador of the judgment against chevron and, in particular, to preclude any certification by the republic of ecuador that would cause the judgment to be enforceable against chevron. on february27, 2012, the tribunal issued a third interim award confirming its fs-42note 13litigation - continuedjurisdiction to hear chevron's arbitration claims. on april9, 2012, the tribunal issued a scheduling order to hear issues relating to the scope of the settlement and release agreements between the republic of ecuador and texpet, and on july9, 2012, the tribunal indicated that it wanted to hear the remaining issues in january 2014. on february 7, 2013, the tribunal issued its fourth interim award in which it declared that the republic of ecuador has violated the first and second interim awards under the [bit], the uncitral rules and international law in regard to the finalization and enforcement subject to execution of the lago agrio judgment within and outside ecuador, including (but not limited to) canada, brazil and argentina. a schedule for the tribunals order to show cause hearing will be issued separately.through a series of u.s. court proceedings initiated by chevron to obtain discovery relating to the lago agrio litigation and the bit arbitration, chevron obtained evidence that it believes shows a pattern of fraud, collusion, corruption, and other misconduct on the part of several lawyers, consultants and others acting for the lago agrio plaintiffs. in february2011, chevron filed a civil lawsuit in the federal district court for the southern district of new york against the lago agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers, consultants and supporters, alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other state laws. through the civil lawsuit, chevron is seeking relief that includes an award of damages and a declaration that any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio litigation is the result of fraud and other unlawful conduct and is therefore unenforceable. on march7, 2011, the federal district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the lago agrio plaintiffs and persons acting in concert with them from taking any action in furtherance of recognition or enforcement of any judgment against chevron in the lago agrio case pending resolution of chevrons civil lawsuit by the federal district court. on may 31, 2011, the federal district court severed claims one through eight of chevrons complaint from the ninth claim for declaratory relief and imposed a discovery stay on claims one through eight pending a trial on the ninth claim for declaratory relief. on september19, 2011, the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the preliminary injunction, stayed the trial on chevrons ninth claim, a claim for declaratory relief, that had been set for november14, 2011, and denied the defendants mandamus petition to recuse the judge hearing the lawsuit. the second circuit issued its opinion on january26, 2012 ordering the dismissal of chevrons ninth claim for declaratory relief. on february 16, 2012, the federal district court lifted the stay on claims one through eight, and on october 18, 2012, the federal district court set a trial date of october 15, 2013. the ultimate outcome of the foregoing matters, including any financial effect on chevron, remains uncertain. management does not believe an estimate of a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. due to the defects associated with the ecuadorian judgment, the 2008 engineers report on alleged damages and the september2010 plaintiffs submission on alleged damages, management does not believe these documents have any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). note 14 taxes income taxesyear ended december

percent in 2011 to 43.2 percent in 2012. the impact of lower effective tax rates in international upstream operations was essentially offset by foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods.for international upstream, the lower effective tax rates in the current period were driven primarily by the effects of asset sales, one-time tax benefits and reduced withholding taxes, which were partially offset by a lower utilization of tax credits during the current year. the company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or liabilities. the reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following: at december 3120122011deferred tax

net$14,243$13,466deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2012 increased by approximately $700 from year-end 2011. the increase was related to increased temporary differences for property, plant and equipment. deferred tax assets increased by approximately $4,300 in 2012. increases primarily related to additional u.s. foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions (which were substantially offset by a valuation allowance) and to future international tax benefits earned. the overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. it reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in managements assessment, more likely than not to be realized. at the end of 2012, the company had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $2,009 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1,146 primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expira-tion date, others expire at various times from 2013 through 2029. u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $10,817 will expire between 2013 and 2022. at december31, 2012 and 2011, deferred taxes were classified on the consolidated balance sheet as follows: at december 3120122011prepaid expenses and other current assets$(1,365)$(1,149)deferred charges and other assets(2,662)(1,224)federal and other taxes on income598295noncurrent deferred income taxes17,67215,544total deferred income taxes, net$14,243$13,466income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled $26,527 at december31, 2012. this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the companys ongoing international business. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. at the end of 2012, deferred income taxes were recorded for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations where indefinite reinvestment of the earnings is not planned. the company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. uncertain income tax positions under accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes (asc 740-10), a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if managements assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. the term tax position in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. the following table indicates the changes to the companys unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. the term unrecognized tax benefits in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. interest and penalties are not included. fs-44note 14taxes - continued201220112010balance at january 1$3,481$3,507$3,195foreign currency effects4(2)17additions

limitations(72)(4)(8)balance at december 31$3,071$3,481$3,507the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits between december 31, 2011, and december 31, 2012 was primarily due to new information received during the fourth quarter 2012 regarding the sustainability of certain u.s. foreign tax credits. the reduction in unrecognized tax benefits related to these foreign tax credits had no impact on the effective tax rate since the deferred tax asset recognized for these foreign tax credits has been offset with a full valuation allowance.     approximately 67 percent of the $3,071 of unrecognized tax benefits at december31, 2012, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. tax positions for chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. for the companys major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of december31, 2012. for these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: united states  2007, nigeria  2000, angola  2001, saudi arabia  2003 and kazakhstan  2006. the company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. however, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the companys total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12months. given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.     the company is currently assessing the potential impact of an august 2012 decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit that disallows the historic rehabilitation tax credits (hrtcs) claimed by an unrelated taxpayer. the company has claimed a significant amount of hrtcs on its u.s. federal income tax returns in open years, and it is reasonably possible that the specific findings from management's ongoing assessment and evaluation could result in a significant increase in the company's unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months. any such increase would impact the effective tax rate. on the consolidated statement of income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. as of december31, 2012, accruals of $293 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the consolidated balance sheet, compared with accruals of $118 as of year-end 2011. income tax expense (benefit)associated with interest and penalties was $145, $(64) and $40 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. taxes other

december31, 2012 and 2011, were 0.13 percent and 0.04 percent, respectively.redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date. the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. at december31, 2012, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. at december31, 2012, the company had $6,000 in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december2016, that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the companys practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the companys strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december31, 2012. at december31, 2012 and 2011, the company classified $5,900 and $5,600, respectively, of short-term debt as long-term. settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. note 16 long-term debt total long-term debt, excluding capital leases, at december31, 2012, was $11,966.

financial statement presentation.note 18 accounting for suspended exploratory wells accounting standards for the costs of exploratory wells (asc 932) provide that exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized after the completion of drilling when (a)the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b)the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. if either condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. (note that an entity is not required to complete the exploratory well as a producing well.) the accounting standards provide a number of indicators that can assist an entity in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.      the following table indicates the changes to the companys suspended exploratory well costs for

31, 2012, $1,359 (23 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly planned for the near future. the $821 balance is related to 23 projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned for the near future. additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. fs-47notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 18accounting for suspended exploratory wells - continuedthe projects for the $821 referenced above had the following activities associated

$218 (four projects)  development concept under review by government; (c) $202 (five projects)  development alternatives under review; (d) $42 (eight projects)  miscellaneous activities for projects with smaller amounts suspended. while progress was being made on all 46 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under sec rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the projects. however, the majority of these decisions are expected to occur in the next three years. the $2,180 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of december31, 2012, represents 166 exploratory wells in 46 projects. the tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project

restricted stock units was $177 ($115 after tax), $214 ($139 after tax) and $194 ($126 after tax) for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. no significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at december31, 2012, or december 31, 2011. cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $753, $948 and $385, respectively. actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $101, $121 and $66 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $123, $151 and $140 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. chevron long-term incentive plan (ltip) awards under the ltip may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and nonstock grants. from april2004 through january2014, no more than 160 million shares may be issued under the ltip, and no more than 64 million of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. for the major types of awards outstanding as of december31, 2012, the contractual terms vary between three years for the performance units and 10years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. unocal share-based plans (unocal plans) when chevron acquired unocal in august2005, outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various unocal plans were exchanged for fully vested chevron options and appreciation rights. these awards retained the same provisions as the original unocal plans. unexercised awards began expiring in early 2010 and will continue to expire through early 2015.

compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7years. at january1, 2012, the number of ltip performance units outstanding was equivalent to 2,881,836 shares. during 2012, 888,350 units were granted, 882,003 units vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 60,426 units were forfeited. at december31, 2012, units outstanding were 2,827,757, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $320. in addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various ltip and former unocal programs totaled approximately 2.4 million equivalent shares as of december31, 2012. a liability of $71 was recorded for these awards. note 20 employee benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. the company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. in the united states, all qualified plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act (erisa)minimum funding standard. the company does not typically fund u.s. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the companys other investment alternatives. the company also sponsors other postretirement (opeb)plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. the plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. medical coverage for medicare-eligible retirees in the companys main u.s. medical plan is secondary to medicare (including partd) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. under accounting standards for postretirement benefits (asc 715), the company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and opeb plans as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet. fs-49notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of

plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 13 and 10 years, respectively. these amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. these losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. the amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. during 2013, the company estimates actuarial losses of $472, $143 and $54 will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international pension and opeb plans, respectively. in addition, the company estimates an additional $230 will be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2013 related to lump-sum settlement costs from u.s. pension plans. the weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december31, 2012, was approximately 10 and 13 years for u.s. and international pension plans, respectively, and 11 years  for other postretirement benefit plans. during 2013, the company estimates prior service (credits)costs of $1, $22 and $(50) will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for u.s. pension, international pension and opeb plans, respectively.

plan assets the companys estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the companys estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. for 2012, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.5 percent for u.s. pension plan assets, which account for 70 percent of the companys pension plan assets. in 2011 and 2010, the company used a long-term rate of return of 7.8 percent for this plan. the market-related value of assets of the major u.s. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. for other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. discount rate the discount rate assumptions used to determine the u.s. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled and is equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. this analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company's plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. at december31, 2012, the company used a 3.6 percent discount rate for the u.s. pension plans and 3.9 percent for the main u.s. opeb plan. the discount rates at the end of 2011 and 2010 were 3.8 and 4.0 percent and 4.8 and 5.0 percent for the u.s. pension plans and the main u.s. opeb plans, respectively.other benefit assumptions for the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december31, 2012, for the main u.s. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7.5 percent in 2013 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2025 and beyond. for this measurement at december31, 2011, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 8 percent in 2012 and gradually declined to 5 percent for 2023 and beyond. in both measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent. assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree health care costs. the impact is mitigated by the 4 percent cap on the companys medical contributions for the primary u.s. plan. a 1-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have the following effects: 1 percent1 percentincreasedecreaseeffect on total service and interest cost components$16$(13)effect on postretirement benefit obligation$165$(141)plan assets and investment strategy the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided into three levels: level 1: fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability to access. level 2: fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs fs-52note 20employee benefit plans - continuedthat are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means. if the asset has a contractual term, the level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of the asset. the fair values for level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges.level 3: inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. valuation may be performed using a financial model with estimated inputs entered into the model. the fair value measurements of the companys pension plans for 2012 and 2011 are below:u.s.intl.total fair valuelevel 1level 2level 3total fair valuelevel 1level 2level 3at december31,

and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management. the companys u.s. and u.k. pension plans comprise 87 percent of the total pension assets. both the u.s. and u.k. plans have an investment committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. to assess the plans investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. for the primary u.s. pension plan, the company's benefit plan investment committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: equities 4070 percent, fixed income and cash 2065 percent, real estate 015 percent, and other 05 percent. for the u.k. pension plan, the u.k. board of trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed regularly: equities 5070 percent and fixed income and cash 3050 percent. the other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset class risk. to mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. the company does not prefund its opeb obligations. cash contributions and benefit payments in 2012, the company contributed $844 and $384 to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. in 2013, the company expects contributions to be approximately $650 and $350 to its u.s. and international pension plans, respectively. actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. the company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $228 in 2013, compared with $199 paid in 2012. the following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10years: pension

of chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the chevron employee savings investment plan (esip). charges to expense for the esip represent the companys contributions to the plan, which are funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (lesop), which is described in the section that follows. total company matching contributions to employee accounts within the esip were $286, $263 and $253 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. this cost was reduced by the value of shares released from the lesop totaling $43, $38 and $97 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, fs-54note 20employee benefit plans - continuedrespectively. the remaining amounts, totaling $243, $225 and $156 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, represent open market purchases. employee stock ownership plan within the chevron esip is an employee stock ownership plan (esop). in 1989, chevron established a lesop as a constituent part of the esop. the lesop provides partial prefunding of the companys future commitments to the esip. as permitted by accounting standards for share-based compensation (asc 718), the debt of the lesop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as deferred compensation and benefit plan trust on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of equity. the company reports compensation expense equal to lesop debt principal repayments less dividends received and used by the lesop for debt service. interest accrued on lesop debt is recorded as interest expense. dividends paid on lesop shares are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. all lesop shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations. total expense (credits) for the lesop were $1, $(1) and $(1) in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the net credit for the respective years was composed of credits to compensation expense of $2, $5 and $6 and charges to interest expense for lesop debt of $3, $4 and $5. of the dividends paid on the lesop shares, $18, $18 and $46 were used in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, to service lesop debt. no contributions were required in 2011 or 2010, as dividends received by the lesop were sufficient to satisfy lesop debt service. in 2012, the company contributed $2 to the lesop.shares held in the lesop are released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants based on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of current-year and remaining debt service. lesop shares as of december31, 2012 and 2011, were as follows: thousands20122011allocated shares18,05519,047unallocated shares1,2921,864total lesop shares19,34720,911benefit plan trusts prior to its acquisition by chevron, texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. at year-end 2012, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of chevron treasury stock. the trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. the company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. the trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. prior to its acquisition by chevron, unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. at december31, 2012 and 2011, trust assets of $48 and $51, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts. employee incentive plans the chevron incentive plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, unit and individual performance in the prior year. charges to expense for cash bonuses were $898, $1,217 and $766 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. chevron also has the ltip for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. awards under the ltip consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in note 19, beginning on page fs-48. note 21 equity retained earnings at december31, 2012 and 2011, included approximately $10,119 and $10,127, respectively, for the companys share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates. at december31, 2012, about 55 million shares of chevrons common stock remained available for issuance from the 160 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the chevron ltip. in addition, approximately 231,000 shares remain available for issuance from the 800,000 shares of the companys common stock that were reserved for awards under the chevron corporation non-employee directors equity compensation and deferral plan. note 22 other contingencies and commitments income taxes the company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. these liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. refer to note 14, beginning on page fs-43, for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the companys major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. as discussed on page fs-45, chevron is currently assessing the potential impact of a decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit that disallows the historic rehabilita-fs-55notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 22other contingencies and commitments - continuedtion tax credits claimed by an unrelated taxpayer. it is reasonably possible that the specific findings from this assessment could result in a significant increase in unrecognized tax benefits, which may have a material effect on the company's results of operations in any one reporting period. the company does not expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. guarantees the companys guarantee of $562 is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. over the approximate 15-year remaining term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. there are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this guarantee. indemnifications the company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of equilon and motiva to shell and saudi refining, inc., in connection with the february2002 sale of the companys interests in those investments. through the end of 2012, the company paid $48 under these indemnities and continues to be obligated up to $250 for possible additional indemnification payments in the future. the company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities of assets originally contributed by texaco to the equilon and motiva joint ventures and environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of equilon and motiva, or that occurred during the period of texacos ownership interest in the joint ventures. in general, the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to december2001. claims had to be asserted by february2009 for equilon indemnities and february2012 for motiva indemnities. in february2012, motiva enterprises llc delivered a letter to the company purporting to preserve unmatured claims for certain motiva indemnities. the company had previously provided a negative response to similar claims. the letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount. management does not believe this letter or any other information provides a basis to estimate the amount, if any, of a range of loss or potential range of loss with respect to either the equilon or the motiva indemnities.  the company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the indemnities.      through december 31, 2012, the company has not received further correspondence from equilon and motiva enterprises llc and the company does not expect further action to occur related to the indemnities described in the preceding paragraphs.in the acquisition of unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. the acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which had been reached at december31, 2009. under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 obligation, chevron is solely responsible until april2022, when the indemnification expires. the environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997. although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the companys business. the aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2013  $3,700; 2014  $3,900; 2015  $4,100; 2016  $2,400; 2017  $1,800; 2018 and after  $6,500. a portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. total payments under the agreements were approximately $3,600 in 2012, $6,600 in 2011 and $6,500 in 2010. environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the company or other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited to, federal superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether operating, closed or divested. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, fs-56note 22other contingencies and commitments - continuedthe determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the companys competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or chemical companies. chevrons environmental reserve as of december31, 2012, was $1,403. included in this balance were remediation activities at approximately 175 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal superfund law or analogous state laws. the companys remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2012 was $157. the federal superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. any future actions by the epa or other regulatory agencies to require chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. of the remaining year-end 2012 environmental reserves balance of $1,246, $782 related to the companys u.s. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), chemical facilities, and pipelines. the remaining $464 was associated with various sites in international downstream $93, upstream $309 and other businesses $62.  liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the companys plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. these and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants. the company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the united states include the resource conservation and recovery act and various state and local regulations. no single remediation site at year-end 2012 had a recorded liability that was mate-rial to the companys results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. refer to note 23 on page fs-58 for a discussion of the companys asset retirement obligations. other contingencies on april26, 2010, a california appeals court issued a ruling related to the adequacy of an environmental impact report (eir)supporting the issuance of certain permits by the city of richmond, california, to replace and upgrade certain facilities at chevrons refinery in richmond. settlement discussions with plaintiffs in the case ended late fourth quarter 2010, and on march3, 2011, the trial court entered a final judgment and peremptory writ ordering the city to set aside the project eir and conditional use permits and enjoining chevron from any further work. on may23, 2011, the company filed an application with the city planning department for a conditional use permit for a revised project to complete construction of the hydrogen plant, certain sulfur removal facilities and related infrastructure. on june10, 2011, the city published its notice of preparation of the revised eir for the project. the revised and recirculated eir is intended to comply with the appeals court decision. management believes the outcomes associated with the project are uncertain. due to the uncertainty of the companys future course of action, or potential outcomes of any action or combination of actions, management does not believe an estimate of the financial effects, if any, can be made at this time.chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers. the amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve. the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses in future periods. fs-57notes to the consolidated financial statementsmillions of dollars, except per-share amountsnote 23 asset retirement obligations the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (aro)as an asset and liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. the legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the companys control. this uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. recognition of the aro includes: (1)the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2)the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount rates. aros are primarily recorded for the companys crude oil and natural gas producing assets. no significant aros associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. the following table indicates the changes to the companys before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2012, 2011 and 2010: 201220112010balance at

on average acquisition costs for the year. lifo profits (charges)of $121, $193 and $21 were included in earnings for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the company has $4,640 in goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet related to the 2005 acquisition of unocal and to the 2011 acquisition of atlas energy, inc. under the accounting standard for goodwill (asc 350), the company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2012 and concluded no impairment was necessary. fs-58note 25 earnings per share basic earnings per share (eps)is based upon net income attributable to chevron corporation (earnings) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. diluted

february17, 2011, the company acquired atlas energy, inc. (atlas), which held one of the premier acreage positions in the marcellus shale, concentrated in southwestern pennsylvania. the aggregate purchase price of atlas was approximately $4,500, which included $3,009 cash for all the common shares of atlas, a $403 cash advance to facilitate atlas' purchase of a 49 percent interest in laurel mountain midstream llc and about $1,100 of assumed debt. subsequent to the close of the transaction, the company paid off the assumed debt and made payments of $184 in connection with atlas equity awards. as part of the acquisition, chevron assumed the terms of a carry arrangement whereby reliance marcellus, llc, funds 75 percent of chevron's drilling costs, up to $1,300.      the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination (asc 805) which, among other things, requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. provisional fair value measurements were made in first quarter 2011 for acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and the measurement process was finalized in fourth quarter 2011.      proforma financial information is not presented, as it would not be materially different from the information presented in the consolidated statement of income.      the following table summarizes the measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed: at february 17,

income taxes(1,915)other liabilities(25)total liabilities assumed(3,261)net assets acquired$3,433     properties were measured primarily using an income approach. the fair values of the acquired oil and gas properties were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent level 3 measurements. refer to note 8, beginning on page fs-33 for a definition of fair value hierarchy levels. significant inputs included estimated resource volumes, assumed future production profiles, estimated future commodity prices, a discount rate of 8 percent, and assumptions on the timing and amount of future operating and development costs. all the properties are in the united states and are included in the upstream segment.      the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was $3,400 in cash. the $27 of goodwill was assigned to the upstream segment and represents the amount of the consideration transferred in excess of the values assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. none of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. goodwill recorded in the acquisition is not subject to amortization, but will be tested periodically for impairment as required by the applicable accounting standard (asc 350). fs-60five-year financial summary unauditedmillions of dollars, except per-share amounts20122011201020092008statement of income datarevenues and other

reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the society of petroleum engineers, the world petroleum congress and the american association of petroleum geologists. the system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting  three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. the potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. for reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all sec and company standards. proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. as part of theinternal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a reserves advisory committee (rac)that is chaired by the manager of corporate reserves, a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman responsible for the companys worldwide exploration and production activities. the manager of corporate reserves has more than 30years experience working in the oil and gas industry and a master of science in petroleum engineering degree from stanford university. his experience includes more than 15years of managing oil and gas reserves processes. he was chairman of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee, served on the united nations expert group on resources classification, and is a past member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training and the california conservation committee. he is an active member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers and serves on the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee.all rac members are degreed professionals, each with more than 15years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. the members are knowledgeable in sec guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates. the reserves activities are managed by two operating company-level reserves managers. these two reserves managers are not members of the rac so as to preserve corporate-level independence.fs-67table vreserve quantity information - continuedsummary of net oil and gas reserves 2012*2011*2010*liquids in millions of barrelscrude oilcrude oilcrude

responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with sec guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the corporate reserves manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves. during the year, the rac is represented in meetings with each of the companys upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. major changes are also reviewed with the companys strategy and planning committee, whose members include the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. the companys annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the board of directors. if major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the board.rac subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. these reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the corporate reserves manual.technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions  in 2012, additions to chevrons proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide reasonably certain proved reserves estimates. both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. these technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates. fs-68table vreserve quantity information - continuedproved undeveloped reserve quantities at the end of 2012, proved undeveloped reserves totaled 5.2billion barrels of oil-equivalent (boe). approximately 56 percent of these reserves are attributed to natural gas, of which about 55percent were located in australia. crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (ngls) accounted for about 38percent of the total proved undeveloped reserves, of which about 38 percent were from tco, and the remaining large concentrations were in africa, asia and the united states. synthetic oil accounted for the balance of the proved undeveloped reserves. in 2012, a total of 394million boe was transferred from proved undeveloped to proved developed. in asia, 98 million boe were transferred to proved developed primarily driven by development drilling performance. in the united states, approximately 95million boe were transferred, primarily due to ongoing drilling activities in the deepwater gulf of mexico and california. affiliates accounted for 104 million boe transferred to proved developed due to ongoing development activities. development drilling and the start up of several projects in africa, europe and other americas accounted for the remainder.investment to convert proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves during 2012, investments totaling approximately $10.7billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $3.5 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. australia accounted for $7.7billion of the total, mainly for development and construction activities at the gorgon and wheatstone lng projects. in africa, another $2.3 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in nigeria and angola. expenditures of about $1.8billion in the united states related primarily to various development activities in the gulf of mexico and the mid-continent region. in asia, expenditures during the year totaled $1.7billion, primarily related to development projects in thailand and indonesia. proved undeveloped reserves for five years or more reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. at year-end 2012, the company held approximately 1.7billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. the reserves are held by consolidated and affiliated companies and the majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects.in africa, the majority of the 300million boe is related to deepwater and natural gas developments in nigeria. major nigerian deepwater development projects include agbami, which started production in 2008 and has ongoing development activities to maintain full utilization of infrastructure capacity, and the usan development, which started production in 2012. also in nigeria, various fields and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas projects are currently under development.in asia, approximately 200million boe remain classified as proved undeveloped after five years. the majority relate to ongoing development activities in the pattani field (thailand) and the malampaya field (philippines) that are scheduled to maintain production within contractual and infrastructure constraints. in australia, approximately 100million boe remain classified as proved undeveloped due to a compression project at the north west shelf venture, which is scheduled for start-up in 2013.affiliated companies have approximately 1.0billion boe of proved undeveloped reserves that have been recorded for five years or more. the tco affiliate in kazakhstan accounts for most of this amount. production is constrained by plant capacity limitations. in venezuela, development drilling continues at hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity.annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. for 2012, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified as proved undeveloped. over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 37percent and 46percent. the consistent completion of major capital projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period. proved reserve quantities at december31, 2012, proved reserves for the company were 11.3billion boe. (refer to the term reserves on page e-11 for the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) approximately 17percent of the total reserves were located in the united states.      aside from the tco affiliate's tengiz field in kazakhstan, no single property accounted for more than 5 percent of the companys total oil-equivalent proved reserves. about 20 other individual properties in the companys portfolio of assets each contained between 1percent and 5percent of the companys oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for 45percent of the companys total oil-equivalent proved reserves. these properties were geographically dispersed, located in the united states, canada, south america, africa, asia and australia.fs-69table vreserve quantity information - continued     in the united states, total proved reserves at year-end 2012 were 2.0billion boe. california properties accounted for 32percent of the u.s. reserves, with most classified as heavy oil. because of heavy oils high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods, most of the companys heavy-oil fields in california employ a continuous steamflooding process. the gulf of mexico region contains 26percent of the u.s. reserves and production operations are mostly offshore. other u.s. areas represent the remaining 42percent of u.s. reserves. for production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including waterflood and co2 injection. for the three years ending december31, 2012, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. apart from acquisitions, the companys ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and circumstances that are outside the companys control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, opec constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.the companys estimated net proved reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil and changes thereto for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 are shown in the table below. the companys estimated

barrel increase in the united states. increases in the other regions were partially offset by asia, which decreased as a result of the effect of higher prices on entitlement volumes in kazakhstan. for affiliated companies, the price effect on entitlement volumes at tco decreased reserves by 33million barrels.in 2011, net revisions increased reserves 235million barrels. for consolidated companies, improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 63million barrel increase in the united states. in africa, improved field performance drove the 60million barrel increase. in asia, increases from improved reservoir performance were partially offset by the effects of higher prices on entitlement volumes. synthetic oil reserves in canada increased by 32million barrels, primarily due to geotechnical revisions. for affiliated companies, improved facility and reservoir performance was partially offset by the price effect on entitlement volumes at tco.  in 2012, net revisions increased reserves 390 million barrels. improved field performance and drilling associated with gulf of mexico projects accounted for the majority of the 104 million barrel increase in the united states. in asia, drilling results across numerous assets drove the 97 million barrel increase. improved field performance from various nigeria and angola producing assets was primarily responsible for the 66 million barrel increase in africa. improved plant efficiency for the tco affiliate was responsible for a large portion of the 59 million barrel increase.     improved recovery in 2010, improved

barrels. the united states and other americas each increased reserves 19million barrels, and asia increased reserves 16million barrels. no single area in the united states was individually significant. drilling activity in argentina and brazil accounted for the majority of the increase in other americas. in asia, the increase was primarily related to activity in azerbaijan.in 2011, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 299million barrels. in the united states, additions related to two gulf of mexico projects resulted in the majority of the 140million barrel increase. in australia, the wheatstone project increased liquid volumes 65million barrels. africa and other americas increased reserves 34million and 30 million barrels, respectively, following the start of new projects in these areas. in europe, a  project in the united kingdom increased reserves 26million barrels.     in 2012, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 218 million barrels. in other americas, extensions and discoveries increased reserves 101 million barrels primarily due to the initial booking of the hebron project in canada. in the united states, additions at several gulf of

below: revisions in 2010, net revisions decreased reserves by 71 bcf. for consolidated companies, a net increase in the united states of 220 bcf, primarily in the mid-continent area and the gulf of mexico, was the result of a number of small upward revisions related to improved reservoir performance and drilling activity, none of which were individually significant. the increase was partially offset by downward revisions due to the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes in asia. for equity affiliates, a downward revision of 324 bcf at tco was due to the price effect on entitlement volumes and a change in the variable-royalty calculation. this decline was partially offset by the recognition of additional reserves related to the angola lng project.in 2011, net revisions increased reserves 497 bcf. for consolidated companies, improved reservoir performance accounted for a majority of the 217 bcf increase in the united states. in asia, a net increase of 196 bcf was driven by development drilling and improved field performance in thailand, partially offset by the effects of higher prices on entitlement volumes in kazakhstan. for affiliated companies, ongoing reservoir assessment resulted in the recognition of additional reserves related to the angola lng project. at tco, improved facility and reservoir performance was more than offset by the price effect on entitlement volumes. fs-72table vreserve quantity information - continuedin 2012, net revisions increased reserves 1,855 bcf. a net increase of 1,007 bcf in asia was primarily due to development drilling and additional compression in bangladesh, and drilling results and improved field performance in thailand. in australia, updated reservoir data interpretation based on additional drilling at

                  flows related to proved oil and gas reserves     the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the fasb. estimated future cash inflows from production are computed by applying 12-month average prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. future price changes are limited to those provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. future development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations. estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. these rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10percent midperiod discount factors. discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced. the information provided does not represent managements estimate of the companys expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. moreover, probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. the valuation prescribed by the fasb requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. the calculations are made as of december31 each year and should not be relied upon as an indication of the companys future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. in the following table, standardized measure net cash flows refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.table vi - standardized measure of discounted future
