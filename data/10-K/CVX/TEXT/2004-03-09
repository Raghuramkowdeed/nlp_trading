SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF CHEVRONTEXACO

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION,

A DELAWARE

CORPORATION, MANAGES ITS INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT

SUPPORT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ENGAGE IN FULLY

INTEGRATED PETROLEUM OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS, COAL

MINING, POWER AND ENERGY SERVICES. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND IN MORE THAN 180 OTHER COUNTRIES. PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS; REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO FINISHED

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND THE

MANY PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS BY PIPELINE, MARINE

VESSEL, MOTOR EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICALS OPERATIONS

INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY AN AFFILIATE, OF

COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES, AND THE

MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING, BY A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, OF FUEL

AND LUBRICATING OIL ADDITIVES.

IN THIS REPORT, EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OF

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS MAY BE REFERRED

TO AS E&P OR UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

RM&T OR DOWNSTREAM ACTIVITIES. A

LIST OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED ON

PAGES E-4 AND E-5 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD 61,533 EMPLOYEES

(INCLUDING 10,951 SERVICE STATION EMPLOYEES), DOWN ABOUT 4,500

FROM YEAR-END 2002. APPROXIMATELY 26,000, OR 42 PERCENT, OF

THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES WERE EMPLOYED IN U.S. OPERATIONS,

OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 3,400 WERE UNIONIZED.

OVERVIEW OF PETROLEUM INDUSTRY

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY

ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, OVER SOME OF WHICH INDIVIDUAL

PETROLEUM COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE CONTROL. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF TAXATION, ENERGY AND THE

ENVIRONMENT, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES,

REGULATING WHERE AND HOW COMPANIES CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS AND

FORMULATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND, IN SOME CASES, LIMITING THEIR

PROFITS DIRECTLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS,

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND PETROCHEMICALS ARE DETERMINED BY SUPPLY

AND DEMAND FOR THESE COMMODITIES. THE MEMBERS OF THE

ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC) ARE

TYPICALLY THE WORLDS SWING PRODUCERS OF CRUDE OIL, AND

THEIR PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING

WORLDWIDE SUPPLY. DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ITS PRODUCTS AND FOR

NATURAL GAS IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONDITIONS OF LOCAL,

NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES, ALTHOUGH WEATHER PATTERNS AND

TAXATION RELATIVE TO OTHER ENERGY SOURCES ALSO PLAY A

SIGNIFICANT PART. VARIATIONS IN THE COMPONENTS OF REFINED

PRODUCTS SALES DUE TO SEASONALITY ARE NOT PRIMARY DRIVERS OF

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS OVERALL EARNINGS.

STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL SECTORS OF THE

PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY,

FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS.

CHEVRONTEXACO COMPETES WITH FULLY INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM

COMPANIES, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL PETROLEUM

COMPANIES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LEASES AND OTHER PROPERTIES, AND FOR THE EQUIPMENT AND LABOR

REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE THOSE PROPERTIES. IN ITS

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS, CHEVRONTEXACO ALSO COMPETES WITH FULLY

INTEGRATED MAJOR PETROLEUM COMPANIES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT

REFINING AND MARKETING ENTITIES IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF

VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS.

INCORPORATED

IN DELAWARE IN 1926 AS STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE NAME CHEVRON CORPORATION IN 1984 AND

CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION IN 2001. AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE

TERM CHEVRONTEXACO AND SUCH TERMS AS THE

COMPANY, THE CORPORATION, OUR,

WE, AND US MAY REFER TO CHEVRONTEXACO

CORPORATION, ONE OR MORE OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, OR TO

ALL OF THEM TAKEN AS A WHOLE, BUT UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE, IT

DOES NOT INCLUDE AFFILIATES OF

CHEVRONTEXACO  I.E., THOSE COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR BY

THE EQUITY METHOD (GENERALLY OWNED 50 PERCENT OR LESS) OR

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD. ALL OF THESE TERMS

ARE USED FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED AS A PRECISE

DESCRIPTION OF ANY OF THE SEPARATE COMPANIES, EACH OF WHICH

MANAGES ITS OWN AFFAIRS.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

REFER TO PAGES FS-2 THROUGH FS-4 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR A DISCUSSION ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK.

CHEVRONTEXACO STRATEGIC DIRECTION

CHEVRONTEXACOS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO

ACHIEVE SUSTAINED FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM ITS OPERATIONS THAT

WILL ENABLE IT TO OUTPERFORM ITS COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY HAS

SET AS A GOAL TO GENERATE THE HIGHEST TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN

AMONG A DESIGNATED PEER GROUP FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD

2000-2004. BP, EXXONMOBIL AND ROYAL DUTCH SHELL 

AMONG THE WORLDS LARGEST INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

COMPANIES  COMPRISE THE COMPANYS DESIGNATED

COMPETITOR PEER GROUP FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE COMPANY HAD THE

HIGHEST TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN IN THIS PEER GROUP FOR THE

2000-2003 PERIOD.

AS A FOUNDATION FOR ATTAINING THIS GOAL, THE

COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED FOUR KEY PRIORITIES.



OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

THROUGH SAFE, RELIABLE, EFFICIENT

AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND OPERATIONS;



COST REDUCTION

BY LOWERING UNIT COSTS THROUGH

INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY;



CAPITAL STEWARDSHIP

BY INVESTING IN THE BEST PROJECT

OPPORTUNITIES AND EXECUTING THEM SUCCESSFULLY (SAFER, FASTER,

AND AT LOWER COST); AND



PROFITABLE GROWTH

THROUGH LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN BOTH EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS.

SUPPORTING THESE FOUR PRIORITIES IS A FOCUS ON.



ORGANIZATIONAL

CAPABILITY.

HAVING THE RIGHT

PEOPLE, PROCESSES AND CULTURE TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN

INDUSTRY-LEADING PERFORMANCE IN THE FOUR PRIORITIES DESCRIBED

ABOVE.

THE CORPORATE STRATEGIC PLAN BUILDS ON THIS

FRAMEWORK WITH STRATEGIES FOCUSED ON APPROPRIATELY BALANCING

FINANCIAL RETURNS AND GROWTH. AS A RESULT OF A RIGOROUS

EVALUATION OF ITS ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS, THE COMPANY IS

EXPLORING POTENTIAL ASSET TRANSACTIONS  SALES,

ACQUISITIONS OR TRADES  TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY

AND PROFITABILITY OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND TO ENHANCE THE

ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS ASSET BASE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ITS

WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO

BE ITS MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS, WITH DEVELOPMENT OF ITS LARGE

WORLDWIDE PROVED AND UNPROVED NATURAL GAS RESERVES AS A PRIMARY

STRATEGY TO EXPAND THE COMPANYS BASE OF PRODUCTION AND TO

CAPTURE ECONOMIC VALUE FROM EMERGING NATURAL GAS MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SEEKING TO DELIVER IMPROVED

AND COMPETITIVE RETURNS FROM ITS WORLDWIDE DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESSES. IN JANUARY 2004, THE COMPANYS GLOBAL

DOWNSTREAM ORGANIZATION BEGAN OPERATING ALONG GLOBAL FUNCTIONAL

LINES RATHER THAN GEOGRAPHICAL FUNCTIONAL LINES IN ORDER TO

LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINED

IMPROVEMENTS IN FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

TEXACO MERGER TRANSACTION

ON OCTOBER 9, 2001, TEXACO INC. (TEXACO)

BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CHEVRON CORPORATION

(CHEVRON) PURSUANT TO A MERGER TRANSACTION, AND CHEVRON CHANGED

ITS NAME TO CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION. THE COMBINATION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS, AND EACH SHARE OF

TEXACO COMMON STOCK WAS CONVERTED ON A TAX-FREE BASIS INTO THE

RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.77 SHARES OF CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK.

IN THE MERGER, CHEVRONTEXACO ISSUED APPROXIMATELY

425 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, REPRESENTING ABOUT

40 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK

AFTER THE MERGER. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TEXACO MERGER

TRANSACTION IS CONTAINED ON PAGE FS-5 AND IN NOTE 2 ON

PAGE FS-30 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND

PROPERTIES

THE COMPANYS LARGEST BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (UPSTREAM) AND REFINING, MARKETING

AND TRANSPORTATION (DOWNSTREAM). CHEMICALS IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT

SEGMENT, CONDUCTED MAINLY BY THE COMPANYS

50 PERCENT-OWNED AFFILIATE  CHEVRON PHILLIPS

CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC (CPCHEM). THE PETROLEUM ACTIVITIES OF THE

COMPANY ARE WIDELY DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY. THE COMPANY HAS

PETROLEUM OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE,

AFRICA, MIDDLE EAST, CENTRAL AND FAR EAST ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA.

CPCHEM HAS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES,

PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR,

MEXICO AND BELGIUM. CHEVRONTEXACOS WHOLLY OWNED ORONITE

FUEL AND LUBRICATING OIL ADDITIVES BUSINESS HAS OPERATIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES, MEXICO, FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE,

INDIA, JAPAN AND BRAZIL.

CHEVRONTEXACO OWNS AN APPROXIMATE 26 PERCENT

EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COMMON STOCK OF DYNEGY INC. (DYNEGY), AN

ENERGY MERCHANT ENGAGED IN POWER GENERATION, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS

PROCESSING AND MARKETING, AND REGULATED ENERGY DELIVERY. THE

COMPANY ALSO HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY NOTES AND PREFERRED

STOCK. DURING 2003, THE COMPANY EXCHANGED ITS $1.5 BILLION

AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DYNEGY SERIES B PREFERRED

STOCK, WHICH WAS DUE FOR REDEMPTION AT PAR VALUE IN NOVEMBER

2003, FOR CASH AND NEW DYNEGY SECURITIES. REFER TO

PAGES FS-10 AND FS-11 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY.

TABULATIONS OF SEGMENT SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUES, EARNINGS, INCOME TAXES AND ASSETS, BY UNITED STATES

AND INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, FOR THE YEARS 2001 TO 2003

MAY BE FOUND IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-34 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K. IN ADDITION, SIMILAR COMPARATIVE DATA FOR THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN AND INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES

AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE CONTAINED IN NOTES 14

AND 15 ON PAGES FS-38 TO FS-40.

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS CAN BE

AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, TAX, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT

OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES CONCERNING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ENERGY

AND TAXATION MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISK

OF INITIATING, MAINTAINING OR EXPANDING OPERATIONS IN ANY

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA. THE COMPANY MONITORS POLITICAL EVENTS

WORLDWIDE AND THE POSSIBLE THREAT THESE MAY POSE TO ITS

ACTIVITIES  PARTICULARLY THE COMPANYS OIL AND

GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS  AND THE

SAFETY OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES. POLITICAL AND COMMUNITY

UNREST HAS DISRUPTED THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION IN THE PAST,

MOST RECENTLY IN NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS CAPITAL AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2003, CHEVRONTEXACO CONDUCTED ITS EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND APPROXIMATELY

25 OTHER COUNTRIES. WORLDWIDE NET CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS PRODUCTION, INCLUDING THAT OF AFFILIATES BUT EXCLUDING

VOLUMES PRODUCED UNDER OPERATING SERVICE AGREEMENTS, DECREASED

BY ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM THE 2002 LEVELS. NET WORLDWIDE

PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS, INCLUDING AFFILIATES, DECREASED ABOUT

2 PERCENT IN 2003.

NET LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IN THE

UNITED STATES WERE BOTH DOWN ABOUT 7 PERCENT COMPARED WITH

2002. THE DECLINE IN U.S. PRODUCTION IN 2003 WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINES IN MATURE FIELDS. IN ADDITION TO NORMAL

FIELD DECLINES IN 2003, OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION DECREASED FROM

THE ABSENCE OF 10,000 TO 15,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF

PRODUCTION THE COMPANY DEEMED UNECONOMIC TO RESTORE FOLLOWING

STORM DAMAGES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN LATE 2002.

INTERNATIONAL NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION, INCLUDING

AFFILIATES, DECREASED ABOUT 4 PERCENT, WHEREAS NET NATURAL

GAS PRODUCTION INCREASED ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM 2002. IN

INDONESIA, ABOUT 29,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF THE YEAR-TO-YEAR

DECLINE WAS RELATED TO THE EFFECT OF LOWER COST-OIL RECOVERY

VOLUMES UNDER PRODUCTION-SHARING TERMS DURING 2003 AND THE

EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCTION SHARING ARRANGEMENT IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2002.

FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE COMPANYS

WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION HAS FOLLOWED A DOWNWARD

TREND WITH 2003 PRODUCTION AT 89 PERCENT OF 1999 LEVELS,

EQUIVALENT TO AN AVERAGE ANNUAL DECLINE RATE OF SLIGHTLY MORE

THAN 2 PERCENT. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, INCREASES IN

INTERNATIONAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY

DECREASES IN THE UNITED STATES.

FOR 2004, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES LOWER

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION RATES IN THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT

OF NORMAL FIELD DECLINES, THE EFFECT OF PROPERTY SALES AND

OPPORTUNITY LIMITATIONS. THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF WORLDWIDE

PRODUCTION IN 2004 REMAINS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR

CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING

COUNTRIES (OPEC), AND DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY WEATHER, LOCAL CIVIL

UNREST AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS.

THE COMPANY SELLS CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS FROM

ITS PRODUCING OPERATIONS UNDER A VARIETY OF CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS. MOST CONTRACTS GENERALLY COMMIT THE COMPANY TO

SELL QUANTITIES BASED ON PRODUCTION FROM SPECIFIED PROPERTIES,

BUT CERTAIN GAS SALES CONTRACTS SPECIFY DELIVERY OF FIXED AND

DETERMINABLE QUANTITIES. DURING 2002, DYNEGY PURCHASED

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PRODUCED

BY THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCLUDING ALASKA, AND

SUPPLIED NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS FEEDSTOCKS TO THE

COMPANYS U.S. REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS. THE COMPANY

REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH DYNEGY TO TERMINATE THE NATURAL GAS

PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACTS AND OTHER RELATED CONTRACTS AT THE

END OF JANUARY 2003. SEE PAGES FS-10 AND FS-11 FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON DYNEGY.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS

CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO DELIVER TO THIRD PARTIES AND

AFFILIATES APPROXIMATELY 160 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL

GAS THROUGH 2006 FROM UNITED STATES RESERVES. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE CONTRACTS FROM QUANTITIES

AVAILABLE FROM PRODUCTION OF THE COMPANYS PROVED DEVELOPED

U.S. RESERVES. THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE VARIABLE-PRICING TERMS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY IS

CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO DELIVER TO THIRD PARTIES

APPROXIMATELY 600 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS THROUGH

2006 FROM AUSTRALIAN, CANADIAN, COLOMBIAN AND PHILIPPINE

RESERVES. THE SALES CONTRACTS CONTAIN VARIABLE PRICING FORMULAS

THAT ARE GENERALLY REFERENCED TO THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE FOR

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS OR OTHER PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AT THE TIME

OF DELIVERY AND THAT IN SOME CASES CONSIDER INFLATION OR OTHER

FACTORS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY THESE

CONTRACTS FROM QUANTITIES AVAILABLE FROM PRODUCTION OF THE

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPANYS

NET INTERESTS IN PRODUCTIVE AND DRY EXPLORATORY WELLS COMPLETED

IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AND THE NUMBER OF EXPLORATORY

WELLS DRILLING AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. EXPLORATORY

WELLS ARE WELLS DRILLED TO FIND AND PRODUCE OIL OR GAS IN

UNPROVED AREAS AND INCLUDE DELINEATION WELLS, WHICH ARE WELLS

DRILLED TO FIND A NEW RESERVOIR IN A FIELD PREVIOUSLY FOUND TO

BE PRODUCTIVE OF OIL OR GAS IN ANOTHER RESERVOIR OR TO EXTEND A

KNOWN RESERVOIR BEYOND THE PROVED AREA. WELLS

DRILLING INCLUDES WELLS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED. REFER TO

THE SUSPENDED WELLS DISCUSSION IN LITIGATION AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON

PAGE FS-17 AND NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES; PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

ON PAGES FS-28 AND FS-29 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. INCREASES

IN THE UNITED STATES, NIGERIA AND AUSTRALIA WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY DECREASES IN CHINA AND ANGOLA. THE WELLS ARE SUSPENDED

PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE

RELATED OIL AND GAS DEPOSITS. THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE

WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON: (1) DECISIONS ON ADDITIONAL

MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, (2) THE RESULTS OF ADDITIONAL

EXPLORATORY DRILLING THAT IS UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED, AND

(3) IN SOME CASES, SECURING FINAL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR

DEVELOPMENT.

THE SCHEDULED PHASE-OUT, BY YEAR-END 2010, OF ALL SINGLE-HULL

TANKERS TRADING TO U.S. PORTS OR TRANSFERRING CARGO IN

WATERS WITHIN THE U.S. EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE. THIS HAS

RAISED THE DEMAND FOR DOUBLE-HULL TANKERS. DURING 2003,

CHEVRONTEXACO OPERATED A TOTAL OF 20 DOUBLE-HULL TANKERS, WHICH

INCLUDES THREE ADDITIONAL DOUBLE-HULL TANKERS THAT THE COMPANY

TOOK DELIVERY OF IN 2003. THE COMPANY IS A MEMBER OF MANY

OIL-SPILL-RESPONSE COOPERATIVES IN AREAS AROUND THE WORLD IN

WHICH IT OPERATES.

CHEMICALS

30 PERCENT INTEREST IN INTER-AMERICAN COAL HOLDING N.V.,

WHICH HAS INTERESTS IN COAL MINING OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA AS

WELL AS IN TRADING AND TRANSPORTATION ACTIVITIES IN VENEZUELA

AND COLOMBIA.

SALES OF COAL FROM P&MS WHOLLY OWNED

MINES AND FROM ITS AFFILIATES WERE 13.4 MILLION TONS, A

DECREASE OF 10 PERCENT FROM 2002. THE REDUCTION RESULTED

FROM THE ABSENCE OF SALES IN 2003 FROM THE COMPANYS MINING

OPERATIONS IN NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO, WHERE PRODUCTION CEASED

IN LATE 2002. LOWER PRODUCTION FROM P&MS SURFACE MINE,

LOCATED NEAR GALLUP, NEW MEXICO, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE.

AT YEAR-END 2003, P&M CONTROLLED

APPROXIMATELY 189 MILLION TONS OF DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED

COAL RESERVES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT RESERVES OF ENVIRONMENTALLY

DESIRABLE LOW-SULFUR FUEL. THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY

COMMITTED TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY 13 MILLION TONS OF COAL

PER YEAR THROUGH THE END OF 2006 AND BELIEVES IT CAN SATISFY

THESE CONTRACTS FROM EXISTING COAL RESERVES.

AND OPERATING COMMERCIAL POWER PROJECTS. WITH 13 POWER

ASSETS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, ASIA AND EUROPE, GPG

MANAGES THE PRODUCTION OF MORE THAN 3,500 MEGAWATTS OF

ELECTRICITY IN ITS FACILITIES. ALL OF THE FACILITIES ARE OWNED

THROUGH JOINT VENTURES. THE COMPANY OPERATES EFFICIENT GAS-FIRED

COGENERATION FACILITIES, SOME OF WHICH PRODUCE STEAM FOR USE IN

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS TO FACILITATE PRODUCTION OF HEAVY OIL.

WORLDWIDE GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY

CHEVRONTEXACO WORLDWIDE GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY

FEEDSTOCKS INTO CLEAN SYNTHESIS GAS. THE SYNTHESIS GAS CAN BE

USED AS A FEEDSTOCK FOR BASIC CHEMICALS OR TO GENERATE

ELECTRICITY IN LOW-EMISSION POWER PLANTS. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS

LICENSED ITS GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY TO MORE THAN 60 PLANTS

WORLDWIDE.

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS

THE 50-50 SASOL CHEVRON GLOBAL JOINT VENTURE WAS

ESTABLISHED IN OCTOBER 2000 TO DEVELOP A WORLDWIDE

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS (GTL) BUSINESS. PROJECTS TO BUILD GTL PLANTS ARE

BEING CONSIDERED FOR QATAR, NIGERIA AND AUSTRALIA.

RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY

THE COMPANYS CORE HYDROCARBON TECHNOLOGY

EFFORTS SUPPORT THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND POWER AND

GASIFICATION BUSINESSES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE HEAVY OIL

RECOVERY AND UPGRADING, DEEPWATER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION,

SHALLOW WATER PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, GAS-TO-LIQUIDS PROCESSING,

HYDROCARBON GASIFICATION TO POWER, AND NEW AND IMPROVED REFINERY

PROCESSES.

ADDITIONALLY, CHEVRONTEXACOS TECHNOLOGY

VENTURES COMPANY FOCUSES ON THE IDENTIFICATION, GROWTH AND

COMMERCIALIZATION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE THE

POTENTIAL TO CHANGE OR TRANSFORM HOW ENERGY IS PRODUCED OR

CONSUMED. THE RANGE OF BUSINESS SPANS EARLY-STAGE INVESTING OF

VENTURE CAPITAL IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOPING JOINT

VENTURE COMPANIES IN NEW ENERGY SYSTEMS, SUCH AS ADVANCED

BATTERIES FOR DISTRIBUTED POWER AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND

HYDROGEN FUEL STORAGE.

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE WORLDWIDE

IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

ENCOMPASSING COMPUTING, DATA MANAGEMENT, SECURITY, AND

CONNECTIVITY OF PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND EMPLOYEES. THE

ARCHITECTURE, KNOWN AS NET READY, PROVIDES THE

FOUNDATION FOR THE COMPANY TO COST-EFFECTIVELY AND RAPIDLY

INTEGRATE ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND NETWORK-BASED TECHNOLOGY.

CHEVRONTEXACOS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES WERE $238 MILLION, $221 MILLION AND

$209 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2003, 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY.

BECAUSE SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES

IN THE AREAS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN NEW OR UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGIES

AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, ULTIMATE SUCCESS IS NOT CERTAIN.

ALTHOUGH NOT ALL INITIATIVES MAY PROVE TO BE ECONOMICALLY

VIABLE, THE COMPANYS OVERALL INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA IS

NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND INCREASE IN BOTH

NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY AND TO GOVERN NOT ONLY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT

SELLS. CHEVRONTEXACO EXPECTS MORE ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATIONS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT HAS

OPERATIONS. MOST OF THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH THE MANY LAWS

AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO ITS OPERATIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE

NORMAL COSTS OF CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS.

IN 2003, THE COMPANYS U.S. CAPITALIZED

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES WERE $178 MILLION, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED U.S. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES.

THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE CAPITAL OUTLAYS TO

RETROFIT EXISTING FACILITIES, AS WELL AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

NEW FACILITIES. THE EXPENDITURES ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE

PETROLEUM SEGMENT AND RELATE MOSTLY TO AIR-AND-WATER QUALITY

PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES AT THE COMPANYS REFINERIES, OIL

AND GAS PRODUCING FACILITIES, AND MARKETING FACILITIES. FOR

2004, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES U.S. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL FACILITIES WILL BE $260 MILLION. THE

FUTURE ANNUAL CAPITAL COSTS OF FULFILLING THIS COMMITMENT ARE

UNCERTAIN AND WILL BE GOVERNED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

FUTURE CHANGES TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THEIR NATURE AND AMOUNT,

THESE SPECIAL ITEMS ARE IDENTIFIED

SEPARATELY TO HELP EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN

NET INCOME AND SEGMENT INCOME BETWEEN

PERIODS, AS WELL AS TO HELP DISTINGUISH

THE UNDERLYING TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS

CORE BUSINESSES. SPECIAL ITEMS ARE

DISCUSSED IN DETAIL FOR EACH MAJOR

OPERATING AREA IN THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE

FS-6. RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATIONS

IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN NOTE 12 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE

FS-37. THE CATEGORIES MERGER-RELATED

IN DETAIL IN THE TEXACO MERGER

TRANSACTION SECTION ON PAGE FS-5.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

AS SHOWN IN THE SPECIAL ITEMS TABLE, LARGE

NET SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES ADVERSELY AFFECTED

NET INCOME IN 2002 AND 2001. IN 2002, $2.3

BILLION OF THE $3.3 BILLION OF NET CHARGES

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN ITS

DYNEGY INC. AFFILIATE. REFER TO PAGES FS-10

AND FS-11 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE $3.5 BILLION

OF NET CHARGES IN 2001 RELATED TO ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL

GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES.

APART FROM THE EFFECTS OF SPECIAL

ITEMS, CHEVRONTEXACOS EARNINGS DEPEND

LARGELY ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ITS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN UPSTREAM 

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  AND

DOWNSTREAM  REFINING, MARKETING AND

TRANSPORTATION. OVERALL EARNINGS TRENDS

ARE TYPICALLY LESS AFFECTED BY RESULTS

FROM THE COMPANYS COMMODITY CHEMICALS

SEGMENT AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE

POSITION, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE

CAPITAL-INTENSIVE AND COMMODITY-BASED

NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY, IS CLOSELY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

INVEST IN PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE ADEQUATE

FINANCIAL RETURNS AND TO MANAGE OPERATING

EXPENSES EFFECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ALSO

CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO

DISPOSE OF ASSETS THAT ARE NOT KEY TO

PROVIDING LONG-TERM VALUE, OR TO ACQUIRE

ASSETS OR OPERATIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO ITS

ASSET BASE TO HELP SUSTAIN THE COMPANYS

GROWTH. IN ADDITION TO THE

ASSET-DISPOSITION AND RESTRUCTURING PLANS

ANNOUNCED IN 2003, OTHER SUCH PLANS MAY

OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS AND RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT GAINS OR LOSSES. REFER TO THE

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS SECTION ON PAGES

FS-4 AND FS-5 FOR A DISCUSSION THAT

INCLUDES REFERENCES TO THE COMPANYS ASSET

DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES.

FS-2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMENTS RELATED TO EARNINGS TRENDS FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS AREAS

ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UPSTREAM

YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES IN EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION EARNINGS ALIGN

MOST CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXTERNAL FACTORS OVER WHICH

THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEMAND CONNECTED WITH GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCTION QUOTAS IMPOSED BY

THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (OPEC), WEATHER-RELATED

DAMAGES AND DISRUPTIONS, COMPETING FUEL PRICES AND REGIONAL SUPPLY

INTERRUPTIONS THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY MILITARY CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST OR

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY MONITORS DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IN THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES.

LONGER-TERM TRENDS IN EARNINGS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE ALSO A FUNCTION OF

OTHER FACTORS BESIDES PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION LEVELS AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FIND OR ACQUIRE AND

EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. MOST OF THE COMPANYS

OVERALL CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS IN ITS UPSTREAM BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES. REFER TO THE CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES ON PAGES

FS-11 AND FS-12 FOR DISCUSSION OF THE TYPES OF UPSTREAM INVESTMENTS TARGETED

FOR 2004. INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM PROJECTS OFTENTIMES ARE MADE WELL IN ADVANCE

OF THE START OF THE ASSOCIATED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION.

INDUSTRY PRICE LEVELS FOR CRUDE OIL IN EARLY 2003 REACHED A 12-YEAR HIGH,

REACHING A PEAK OF ABOUT $38 PER BARREL. PRICES FOR WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE

(WTI), A BENCHMARK CRUDE, THEN AVERAGED ABOUT $31 FOR THE YEAR, AN INCREASE OF

ABOUT $5 FROM 2002. THE WTI SPOT PRICES AT THE END OF DECEMBER 2003 AND AT THE

END OF FEBRUARY 2004 WERE ABOUT $32 AND $36, RESPECTIVELY. AMONG OTHER THINGS,

THESE RELATIVELY HIGH INDUSTRY PRICES REFLECTED INCREASED DEMAND FROM IMPROVED

ECONOMIES IN MANY COUNTRIES AND CONTINUED PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS BY OPEC.

THE AVERAGE SPOT PRICE OF WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE, A BENCHMARK CRUDE OIL, ROSE

19 PERCENT BETWEEN 2002 AND 2003 AND REMAINED ABOVE $30 PER BARREL IN EARLY 2004.

NATURAL GAS PRICES WERE ALSO HIGHER IN 2003 THAN IN 2002. BENCHMARK PRICES

FOR HENRY HUB U.S. NATURAL GAS AVERAGED MORE THAN $5 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN

2003, VERSUS ABOUT $3 IN 2002. THE 2003 YEAR-END PRICE WAS NEARLY $6 PER

THOUSAND CUBIC FEET, ABOUT A DOLLAR HIGHER THAN THE YEAR-EARLIER LEVEL. PRICES

IN THE UNITED STATES ARE TYPICALLY HIGHEST DURING THE WINTER PERIOD, WHEN

DEMAND FOR HEATING FUEL IS GREATEST. AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2004, THE U.S.

BENCHMARK PRICE WAS ABOUT $5 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET. THE TREND TOWARD HIGHER

U.S. NATURAL GAS PRICES IS MAINLY THE RESULT OF OVERALL DEMAND BASED UPON THE

STRENGTH OF

AVERAGE PRICES CLIMBED MORE THAN 70 PERCENT DURING 2003. PRODUCTION

WAS DOWN MORE THAN 7 PERCENT DUE TO NORMAL FIELD DECLINES AND PRODUCTION

NOT RESTORED AFTER 2002 STORM DAMAGE TO FACILITIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION DECLINED ABOUT 5 PERCENT IN 2003, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF NORMAL FIELD DECLINES IN THE UNITED STATES.

* INCLUDES EQUITY IN AFFILIATES

THE ECONOMY AND THE DECLINING LEVELS OF INDUSTRY RESERVES AND PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES IN 2003 WAS A 4 PERCENT DECLINE IN THE

COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE

WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF LOWER PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO NORMAL

FIELD DECLINES AND PRODUCTION DEEMED UNECONOMIC TO RESTORE FOLLOWING STORM

DAMAGES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2002. INTERNATIONAL

OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS ALSO DOWN SLIGHTLY  PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

LOWER LIQUIDS PRODUCTION IN THE COMPANYS INDONESIAN OPERATIONS. THE REDUCED

NET PRODUCTION IN INDONESIA WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES ON

COST-OIL RECOVERY VOLUMES UNDER PRODUCTION-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS AND THE

EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCTION-SHARING AGREEMENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2002.

THE COMPANYS OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION LEVEL IN FUTURE PERIODS IS

UNCERTAIN, IN PART BECAUSE OF PRODUCTION QUOTAS SET BY OPEC AND THE POTENTIAL

FOR PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS FROM CIVIL UNREST AND CHANGING GEOPOLITICS IN THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES AND HOLDS INTERESTS. TWENTY-TWO PERCENT

OF THE COMPANYS NET OIL EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION IN 2003 WAS IN THE OPEC-MEMBER

COUNTRIES OF INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA AND IN THE PARTITIONED NEUTRAL

ZONE BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION LEVELS

IN THESE AREAS WERE NOT CONSTRAINED IN

2003 BY OPEC QUOTAS, FUTURE PRODUCTION COULD BE AFFECTED BY OPEC-IMPOSED

LIMITATIONS. IN NIGERIA, ABOUT 45,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF THE COMPANYS NET

PRODUCTION CAPACITY HAS BEEN SHUT-IN IN CERTAIN ONSHORE AREAS SINCE MARCH 2003

BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RE-ENTER THIS AREA DURING

2004 TO BEGIN REPAIRING DAMAGED EQUIPMENT. OPEC PRODUCTION CONSTRAINTS COULD

POSSIBLY LIMIT THE EVENTUAL RESUMPTION OF A PORTION OR ALL OF THIS PRODUCTION.

DOWNSTREAM

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION EARNINGS ARE CLOSELY

TIED TO REGIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND THE ASSOCIATED

EFFECTS ON INDUSTRY REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS. THE COMPANYS CORE

MARKETING AREAS ARE THE WESTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, WESTERN CANADA,

THE ASIA-PACIFIC, NORTHERN EUROPE, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA.

FS-3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

»

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPANY-SPECIFIC FACTORS INFLUENCING THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY IN THIS

SEGMENT INCLUDE THE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES OF THE REFINERY NETWORK, INCLUDING

ANY DOWNTIME DUE TO PLANNED MAINTENANCE, REFINERY UPGRADE PROJECTS OR OPERATING

INCIDENTS.

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IMPROVED IN 2003, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, ON

HIGHER REFINED PRODUCT MARGINS IN MOST OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING AREAS. IN

CONTRAST, MARGINS IN THE 2002 PERIOD WERE AT THEIR LOWEST LEVELS SINCE THE

MID-1990S, AS WEAK MARKET CONDITIONS DID NOT ALLOW RISING FEEDSTOCK COSTS TO BE

FULLY RECOVERED FROM CONSUMERS OF REFINED PRODUCTS. INDUSTRY MARGINS MAY BE

VOLATILE IN THE FUTURE, DEPENDING PRIMARILY ON PRICE MOVEMENTS FOR CRUDE OIL

FEEDSTOCKS, THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES AND

OTHER FACTORS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS OF $69 MILLION IN 2003 WERE LOWER THAN THE YEAR-AGO

PERIOD. DEPRESSED EARNINGS IN BOTH YEARS REFLECTED EXCESS-SUPPLY CONDITIONS FOR

THE COMMODITY CHEMICALS INDUSTRY THAT HAVE KEPT PRODUCT MARGINS AT LOW LEVELS

FOR A PROTRACTED PERIOD. A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN EARNINGS IS NOT EXPECTED

IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

KEY OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS AND EVENTS DURING 2003 AND EARLY 2004 INCLUDED.

UPSTREAM

WORLDWIDE OIL AND GAS RESERVES

APPROXIMATELY 1 BILLION BARRELS OF

OIL-EQUIVALENT RESERVES WERE ADDED DURING 2003, INCLUDING SALES AND

ACQUISITIONS. THESE ADDITIONS EQUATED TO 108 PERCENT OF PRODUCTION FOR THE

NET PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2003 EQUALED 108 PERCENT OF OIL-EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION FOR THE PERIOD. THIS WAS THE 11TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR THAT RESERVE ADDITIONS

EXCEEDED 100 PERCENT OF PRODUCTION.

* BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT

** INCLUDES EQUITY IN AFFILIATES

YEAR. OF THE 1 BILLION BARRELS ADDED, NEARLY 300 MILLION WERE THE RESULT OF

DISCOVERIES AND EXTENSIONS, INCLUDING ALMOST 200 MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES.

CONTRACT EXTENSIONS IN COLOMBIA AND DENMARK ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 200 MILLION ADDITIONAL BARRELS. ABOUT 100 MILLION BARRELS WERE ADDED THROUGH

IMPROVED RECOVERY TECHNIQUES, PRIMARILY IN INDONESIA AND THE UNITED STATES. FINALLY, THE LARGEST REVISIONS RESULTED FROM

RESERVOIR STUDIES AND ANALYSES IN KAZAKHSTAN, INCREASING RESERVES 300 MILLION BARRELS.

NORTH AMERICA

PLANS WERE INITIATED TO IMPROVE THE COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANYS NORTH AMERICA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION PORTFOLIO. THESE PLANS INCLUDE THE SALE OF CERTAIN

NONSTRATEGIC PRODUCING PROPERTIES AND ROYALTY INTERESTS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND POSSIBLY WESTERN CANADA. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RETAIN ABOUT 400 CORE

FIELDS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN BUSINESS

FUNCTIONS AND OFFICE LOCATIONS.

IN LATE 2003, FOUR NEW DEEPWATER DISCOVERIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO  PERSEUS,

STURGIS, TUBULAR BELLS AND SAINT MALO  WERE ANNOUNCED.

CHEVRONTEXACO IS THE OPERATOR AND HOLDS A 50 PERCENT WORKING INTEREST IN BOTH THE PERSEUS AND

STURGIS PROSPECTS. IN THE NON-OPERATED DISCOVERIES, THE COMPANY HOLDS A 30

PERCENT INTEREST IN TUBULAR BELLS AND A 12.5 PERCENT INTEREST IN SAINT MALO.

ADDITIONALLY AT THE BLIND FAITH DISCOVERY, AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED TO ASSUME

OPERATORSHIP AND INCREASE THE COMPANYS WORKING INTEREST TO 50 PERCENT.

AT THE TAHITI PROSPECT, A MAJOR DISCOVERY IN THE DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO, APPRAISAL

DRILLING VALIDATED THE PRESENCE OF HIGH-QUALITY RESERVOIR SAND. CHEVRONTEXACO

IS THE OPERATOR OF THE PROSPECT AND HAS A 58 PERCENT WORKING INTEREST.

IN LATE 2003, AN APPRAISAL WELL WAS DRILLED AT THE GREAT WHITE DISCOVERY, A NONOPERATED

EXPLORATORY OPPORTUNITY IN THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THE COMPANY HAS A 33

PERCENT WORKING INTEREST IN THIS PROSPECT.

AUSTRALIA

A WELL WAS DRILLED DURING 2003 IN THE IO-JANSZ NATURAL GAS

FIELD, OFF THE NORTHWEST COAST OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA. TEST RESULTS PROVIDED

VERIFICATION OF THE FIELDS EXTENSIVE PRODUCTION POTENTIAL. CHEVRONTEXACO HOLDS

A 50 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN THE WA-18-R PERMIT AREA.

NIGERIA

IN OCTOBER 2003, SUCCESSFUL RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED FROM THE

APARO-3 APPRAISAL WELL AND THE NSIKO-1 WILDCAT WELL IN DEEPWATER BLOCK OPL-249,

WHERE THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO A VARIABLE EQUITY INTEREST OVER THE LIFE OF

THE FIELD. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A SIGNIFICANT EXTENSION OF ITS 30

PERCENT-OWNED USAN FIELD DISCOVERY. THE DRILLING OF THE USAN-4 APPRAISAL WELL,

LOCATED IN DEEPWATER BLOCK OPL-222, CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF COMMERCIAL

QUANTITIES OF OIL AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL IN PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED

RESERVOIRS. IN EARLY 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A GAS DISCOVERY IN THE 46

PERCENT-OWNED DEEPWATER BLOCK OPL-218, FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE NNWA-2

APPRAISAL WELL.

EARLIER IN THE YEAR, THE COMPANY AND ITS PARTNERS REACHED AN AGREEMENT

THAT WILL GOVERN FUTURE OPERATIONS IN THE OFFSHORE BLOCK OPL-216 CONCESSION.

THE AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE CONTINUED ADVANCEMENT OF PLANS TO

DEVELOP THE AGBAMI FIELD. THE COMPANY HAS VARYING FUNDING OBLIGATIONS AND

PROFIT ENTITLEMENT FOR THE BLOCK OPL-216 DEVELOPMENT ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF

TWO PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS IN THE CONCESSION.

ANGOLA

MAJOR CONTRACTS WERE AWARDED FOR THE FIRST PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT IN

THE BENGUELA, BELIZE, LOBITO AND TOMBOCO FIELDS IN DEEPWATER BLOCK 14. THE

FIRST PHASE WILL INVOLVE THE DRILLING AND COMPLETION OF MORE THAN 30

DEVELOPMENT WELLS IN THE BENGUELA AND BELIZE FIELDS AND THE CONSTRUCTION AND

INSTALLATION OF DRILLING AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES THAT WILL FORM A NEW

PRODUCTION HUB IN BLOCK 14. THE COMPANY IS THE OPERATOR AND HOLDS A 31 PERCENT

INTEREST IN BLOCK 14.

CHAD/CAMEROON

THE COMPANYS FIRST CARGO OF CRUDE OIL FROM FIELDS IN

SOUTHERN CHAD WAS LOADED AT FACILITIES OFFSHORE CAMEROON FOR EXPORT TO WORLD

MARKETS IN LATE 2003. THE CRUDE OIL PRODUCED IN CHAD IS TRANSPORTED MORE THAN

600 MILES BY PIPELINE TO A FLOATING STORAGE AND OFFLOADING VESSEL LOCATED

SEVERAL MILES OFFSHORE. FULL PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF 225,000 BARRELS PER DAY IS

EXPECTED TO BE REACHED IN MID-2004. CHEVRONTEXACO HOLDS A 25 PERCENT EQUITY

INTEREST IN THE CHAD-CAMEROON UPSTREAM OPERATION AND ABOUT A 23 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE PIPELINE.

KAZAKHSTAN

THE COMPANYS 50 PERCENT-OWNED AFFILIATE, TENGIZ-CHEVROIL (TCO)

REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF

FS-4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

KAZAKHSTAN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 TO

EXPAND OPERATIONS AT THE TENGIZ AND KOROLEV

FIELDS. THE SOUR GAS INJECTION/SECOND

GENERATION PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE

TCOS OIL PRODUCTION CAPACITY FROM 285,000

BARRELS PER DAY TO BETWEEN 430,000 AND

500,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN THE SECOND HALF

OF 2006. ALSO, A 400-MILE PIPELINE WAS COMPLETED THAT WILL

ENABLE PRODUCTION FROM THE KARACHAGANAK

FIELD TO BE EXPORTED TO WORLD MARKETS VIA

THE CASPIAN PIPELINE WHEN FULLY OPERATIONAL

IN MID-2004.

COLOMBIA

AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED THAT

EXTENDS THE COMPANYS PRODUCTION RIGHTS IN

NORTHERN NATURAL GAS FIELDS. UNDER THE

CONTRACT EXTENSION, CHEVRONTEXACO HOLDS A

43 PERCENT INTEREST WITH THE REMAINING 57

PERCENT HELD BY THE COUNTRYS NATIONAL

PETROLEUM COMPANY.

VENEZUELA

CHEVRONTEXACO WAS AWARDED THE

LICENSE FOR THE 60 PERCENT-OWNED AND

-OPERATED BLOCK 2 PLATAFORMA DELTANA, A

PROSPECTIVE NATURAL GAS REGION IN

VENEZUELAS ATLANTIC CONTINENTAL SHELF.

GLOBAL NATURAL GAS PROJECTS

IN THE

GULF OF MEXICO, THE COMPANYS PERMIT

APPLICATION WAS APPROVED FOR PLANS TO

DEVELOP THE PORT PELICAN DEEPWATER LNG

FACILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO FILED PERMITS

FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LNG RECEIVING AND

REGASIFICATION TERMINAL OFFSHORE BAJA

CALIFORNIA, MEXICO.

IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE GORGON JOINT

VENTURE, IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS A 57

PERCENT OWNER, RECEIVED IN-PRINCIPLE

APPROVAL FROM THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN

GOVERNMENT THROUGH AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT TO

PROCEED WITH PLANS TO CONSTRUCT A NATURAL

GAS PROCESSING FACILITY ON BARROW ISLAND.

THE DECISION REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT

MILESTONE IN THE COMPANYS PLANS TO

COMMERCIALIZE ITS LARGE GORGON NATURAL GAS

RESOURCE BASE. ALSO IN 2003, THE GORGON

JOINT VENTURE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH

THE CHINA NATIONAL OFFSHORE OIL CORPORATION

(CNOOC) IN OCTOBER TO NEGOTIATE THE SALE OF

GORGON LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS TO THE

PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THE AGREEMENT,

WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE COMPLETION OF

FORMAL CONTRACTS, ENABLES CNOOC TO PURCHASE

AN INTEREST IN THE GORGON GAS DEVELOPMENT

PROJECT AND TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF LNG

INTO THE CHINESE MARKET.

IN NIGERIA, THE COMPANY AND ITS

PARTNERS IN THE BRASS RIVER CONSORTIUM

AGREED TO ADVANCE PLANS FOR THE FRONT-END

ENGINEERING AND DESIGN WORK FOR A NEW LNG

FACILITY AT BRASS RIVER. THE STUDIES ARE

EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2004.

A NEW U.S. WHOLESALE NATURAL GAS

MARKETING UNIT BECAME FULLY OPERATIONAL IN

APRIL 2003. THIS BUSINESS UNIT WAS

ESTABLISHED FOLLOWING A DECISION BY THE

COMPANYS DYNEGY AFFILIATE TO EXIT THE

NATURAL GAS MARKETING AND TRADING

BUSINESS. CHEVRONTEXACOS NATURAL GAS

SALE AND PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH DYNEGY

WERE TERMINATED AT THE END OF JANUARY

2003.

DOWNSTREAM

THE COMPANY INITIATED A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING

OF ITS GLOBAL REFINING, MARKETING, AND

SUPPLY AND TRADING ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER

TO LOWER COSTS, IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND

ACHIEVE SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENTS IN ITS

THE IMPROVEMENT IN 2003 SEGMENT INCOME FROM 2002 PRIMARILY WAS THE RESULT

OF HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL

EXPLORATION EXPENSES DECLINED AFTER THE OCTOBER 2001 MERGER,

REFLECTING, IN PART, THE HIGH-GRADING OF THE COMBINED EXPLORATION PORTFOLIO.

EARNINGS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2003 ON HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING WERE THE EFFECTS OF LOWER PRODUCTION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES.

* BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GAS. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS EFFECT WAS A DECLINE IN OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION. THE CHANGE BETWEEN 2001 AND

2002 REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS AND LOWER

PRODUCTION IN THE 2002 PERIOD.

THE COMPANYS AVERAGE 2003 U.S. LIQUIDS REALIZATION WAS $26.66 PER BARREL,

COMPARED WITH $21.34 IN 2002 AND ESSENTIALLY THE SAME IN 2001. THE AVERAGE

NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS $5.01 PER THOUSAND CUBIC FEET IN 2003, COMPARED

WITH $2.89 AND $4.38 IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

NET OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AVERAGED 933,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN

2003, DOWN 7 PERCENT FROM 2002 AND 12 PERCENT FROM 2001. THE NET LIQUIDS

COMPONENT FOR 2003 AVERAGED 562,000 BARRELS PER DAY, A DECLINE OF 7 PERCENT

FROM 2002 AND 8 PERCENT FROM 2001. NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION AVERAGED 2.228

BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2003, 7 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2002 AND 18 PERCENT

LOWER THAN 2001. THE OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION DECLINE IN 2003 WAS ASSOCIATED

MAINLY WITH NORMAL FIELD DECLINES AND THE ABSENCE OF ABOUT 10,000 TO 15,000

BARRELS PER DAY OF PRODUCTION THE COMPANY DEEMED UNECONOMIC TO RESTORE

FOLLOWING STORM DAMAGES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO IN LATE 2002. THE STORMS REDUCED

THE COMPANYS 2002 OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION BY ABOUT 20,000 BARRELS PER DAY.

NET SPECIAL-ITEM CHARGES OF $64 MILLION IN 2003 REFLECTED ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS OF $103 MILLION  ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS

IN ANTICIPATION OF SALE  AND RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION CHARGES OF $38

MILLION, WHICH MAINLY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS. OFFSETTING

A PORTION OF THESE CHARGES WERE GAINS OF $77 MILLION FROM ASSET SALES. SPECIAL

ITEMS IN 2002 AND 2001 INCLUDED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS CAUSED BY WRITE-DOWNS IN

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES FOR A NUMBER OF FIELDS. THE AMOUNT IN

2001 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE MIDWAY SUNSET FIELD IN CALIFORNIAS SAN JOAQUIN

VALLEY, AFTER THE DETERMINATION THAT LOWER-THAN-PROJECTED HEAVY OIL RECOVERY

WOULD RESULT FROM THE STEAM-INJECTION PROCESS.

THE EARNINGS IMPROVEMENT FROM 2002 TO 2003 INCLUDED THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE IMPROVEMENTS WERE

THE EFFECTS OF LOWER OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION AND AN UNFAVORABLE SWING IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS. NET FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES OF $319 MILLION IN 2003

PRIMARILY RELATED TO A SIGNIFICANT WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE

FS-6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CURRENCIES OF CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. EARNINGS IMPROVEMENT IN

2002 VS. 2001 WERE MARGINALLY AFFECTED BY A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

BENEFITS FROM HIGHER LIQUIDS REALIZATIONS, HIGHER NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION, AND

LOWER EXPLORATION AND INCOME TAX EXPENSES, WHICH WERE OFFSET IN PART BY THE

EFFECTS OF LOWER LIQUIDS PRODUCTION, LOWER NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS AND HIGHER

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

THE AVERAGE LIQUIDS REALIZATION, INCLUDING EQUITY

AFFILIATES, WAS $26.79 PER BARREL IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $23.06 IN 2002 AND

$22.17 IN 2001. THE AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATION WAS $2.64 PER THOUSAND

CUBIC FEET IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $2.14 IN 2002 AND $2.36 IN 2001.

DAILY NET LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 1.246 MILLION BARRELS IN 2003 DECREASED

ABOUT 4 PERCENT FROM 1.295 MILLION BARRELS IN 2002 AND ABOUT 7 PERCENT FROM

1.345 MILLION BARRELS IN 2001. THE 2003 PRODUCTION DECLINE INCLUDED ABOUT

29,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN INDONESIA, RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE EFFECT OF LOWER

COST-OIL RECOVERY VOLUMES UNDER PRODUCTION-SHARING TERMS DURING 2003, AND THE

EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCTION-SHARING ARRANGEMENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2002. NEW

PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN CHAD IN 2003 AND HIGHER VOLUMES WERE PRODUCED IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM AND VENEZUELA. THE 2002 PRODUCTION DECLINE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

INCLUDED LOWER OUTPUT IN INDONESIA, PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN CONTRACTUAL

TERMS, AND IN NIGERIA, WHICH WAS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH OPEC CONSTRAINTS. THESE

EFFECTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRODUCTION IN KAZAKHSTAN.

NET NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 2.064 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY IN 2003 WAS

UP 5 PERCENT FROM 2002 AND MORE THAN 20 PERCENT FROM 2001. DURING 2003, OUTPUT

WAS HIGHER IN AUSTRALIA, KAZAKHSTAN, THE PHILIPPINES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN

2002, AREAS WITH PRODUCTION INCREASES FROM 2001 INCLUDED THE PHILIPPINES,

KAZAKHSTAN, NIGERIA AND AUSTRALIA.

SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2003 WERE COMPOSED OF BENEFITS TOTALING $150 MILLION

RELATED TO INCOME TAXES AND PROPERTY SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS AND CHARGES FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS. IN 2002, SPECIAL ITEMS

INCLUDED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS CONNECTED WITH WRITE-DOWNS IN QUANTITIES OF PROVED

OIL AND GAS RESERVES FOR FIELDS IN AFRICA AND CANADA. IN 2001, SPECIAL ITEMS

INCLUDED A $247 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF THE LL-652 FIELD IN VENEZUELA.

THE U.S. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION EARNINGS IN 2003 REFLECTED

PRIMARILY A RECOVERY IN INDUSTRY MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY ON

THE WEST COAST. MARGINS IN 2002 WERE VERY DEPRESSED AND AT ONE POINT, HOVERED

NEAR THEIR 12-YEAR LOWS. RESULTS FOR 2001 INCLUDED EARNINGS OF $375 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH ASSETS THAT WERE LATER SOLD AS A CONDITION OF THE MERGER, WHICH

INCLUDED THE COMPANYS EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES.

SALES VOLUMES FOR REFINED PRODUCTS OF 1.514 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY IN

2003 DECREASED ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM 2002. DEMAND WAS WEAKER FOR BRANDED

GASOLINE, DIESEL AND JET FUELS, AND THERE WERE LOWER SALES UNDER CERTAIN SUPPLY

CONTRACTS. BRANDED GASOLINE

REFINED PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES DECREASED ABOUT 5 PERCENT FROM 2002. THE DECLINE PARTIALLY REFLECTED

THE AUGUST 2003 SALE OF THE EL PASO, TEXAS, REFINERY.

* INCLUDES EQUITY IN AFFILIATES

U.S. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IN 2003 REBOUNDED FROM A LOSS IN 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO A RECOVERY IN THE INDUSTRY MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS.

SALES VOLUMES OF 557,000 BARRELS PER DAY WERE 4 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2002. IN 2002, BRANDED GASOLINE SALES INCREASED

APPROXIMATELY 4 PERCENT COMPARED WITH 2001 VOLUMES. THE AVERAGE U.S. REFINED

PRODUCTS SALES REALIZATION OF $39.93 PER BARREL IN 2003 WAS UP FROM THE AVERAGE

OF $32.63 PER BARREL AND $36.26 PER BARREL IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2003 INCLUDED $160 MILLION FOR RESERVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL DOWNSTREAM

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION. THESE CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS

PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF SERVICE STATIONS. IN 2002, SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDED

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PROVISIONS AND ASSET WRITE-DOWNS FOR CERTAIN REFINING AND MARKETING ASSETS, AND A LITIGATION CHARGE.

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE INTERNATIONAL DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS INCREASED

ON IMPROVED REFINED-PRODUCT MARGINS FOR THE INDUSTRY. THE DECLINE IN EARNINGS

THE CHANGE IN NET CHARGES BETWEEN 2002 AND 2003 WAS

LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECTS OF SPECIAL

ITEMS. THE 2003 PERIOD ALSO INCLUDED LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE AND

OTHER CORPORATE CHARGES COMPARED WITH 2002. ASIDE FROM THE

EFFECT OF SPECIAL ITEMS BETWEEN 2001 AND 2002, THE NET CHANGE ALSO

REFLECTED LOWER CORPORATE CHARGES AND NET INTEREST EXPENSE, AS WELL

AS AN INCREASE IN FAVORABLE TAX ADJUSTMENTS OF $245 MILLION.

SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2003 INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF $365 MILLION

FROM THE EXCHANGE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK FOR CASH AND OTHER DYNEGY SECURITIES. THIS BENEFIT

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES FOR ASSET WRITE-DOWNS OF $84

THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT BY DYNEGY; AND

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS OF $16 MILLION.

INFORMATION RELATING TO SPECIAL ITEMS.

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES

WERE $120 BILLION IN 2003,

COMPARED WITH $99 BILLION IN 2002 AND $104 BILLION IN 2001.

REVENUES INCREASED IN 2003 PRIMARILY FROM SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE.

TOTAL SALES AND OPERATING REVENUES IN 2002 DECLINED FROM

2001 DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE REALIZATIONS FOR CRUDE OIL AND REFINED

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS LOWER PRICES AND SALES VOLUMES FOR NATURAL GAS

IN THE UNITED STATES.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES

INCREASED IN 2003, AS

EARNINGS IMPROVED FOR A NUMBER OF AFFILIATES, INCLUDING TENGIZ-CHEVROIL, LG-CALTEX AND CPCHEM. IN 2001, INCOME FROM EQUITY

AFFILIATES INCLUDED EARNINGS FROM ASSETS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD AS A

CONDITION OF THE MERGER.

OTHER INCOME

IN 2003 REFLECTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES. LIKEWISE, FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS LARGELY

CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER OTHER INCOME IN 2002 VS. 2001. FOREIGN

CURRENCY LOSSES IN 2003  EXCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR

LOSSES OF AFFILIATES WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME (LOSS) FROM

EQUITY AFFILIATES  WERE $199 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $5

MILLION AND A GAIN OF $121 MILLION IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2003, LOSSES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE WEAKENING OF

THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE CURRENCIES OF CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND

THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN 2002, FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES RELATED

TO CURRENCIES OF MOST COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIG-

NIFICANT OPERATIONS APPRECIATING AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. OTHER

INCOME IN 2002 ALSO REFLECTED LOWER INTEREST INCOME.

PURCHASED CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS

COSTS OF $72 BILLION IN 2003

INCREASED ABOUT 25 PERCENT FROM 2002. THE INCREASE WAS THE

RESULT OF SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS

AND REFINED PRODUCTS. CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCTS PURCHASE COSTS

DECREASED ABOUT 5 PERCENT IN 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NATURAL

GAS PRICES AND REDUCED NATURAL GAS VOLUMES.

OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

OF

$13 BILLION INCREASED FROM $12 BILLION IN 2002. ABOUT $800 MILLION OF THE INCREASE IN 2003 RESULTED FROM HIGHER FREIGHT RATES

FROM INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING OPERATIONS AND HIGHER COSTS OF

EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS AND

OTHER EMPLOYEE-BENEFIT

THE 8 PERCENT INCREASE IN 2003

RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER

COSTS FOR TRANSPORTATION, SHIPPING,

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

EXPENSES. DURING 2002, OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY

$95 MILLION FROM 2001, PRIMARILY

FROM HIGHER PENSION EXPENSE,

PAYROLL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-

BENEFIT COSTS. REFER TO NOTE

21, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS,

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-42 FOR

DISCUSSION OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS

AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS IN

THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS.

EXPLORATION EXPENSES

WERE

$571 MILLION IN 2003, $591 MILLION IN 2002 AND $1 BILLION IN

2001. WELL WRITE-OFFS WERE HIGHER

IN 2001 THAN IN THE OTHER COMPARATIVE PERIODS.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND

AMORTIZATION EXPENSES

DID NOT CHANGE MATERIALLY FOR THE REPORTING

PERIODS AFTER CONSIDERATION OF THE EFFECTS FROM SPECIAL ITEMS.

MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES

WERE $576 MILLION AND APPROXIMATELY

$1.6 BILLION IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. NO MERGER-RELATED

EXPENSES WERE RECORDED IN 2003, REFLECTING THE COMPLETION OF

MERGER INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN 2002.

TAXES OTHER THAN ON INCOME

WERE $17.9 BILLION, $16.7 BILLION

AND $15.2 BILLION IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASE IN 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE WEAKENING U.S. DOLLAR IN

2003 ON FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DUTIES IN THE COMPANYS

EUROPEAN DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS. IN 2002, THE INCREASE BETWEEN

PERIODS RESULTED FROM HIGHER SALES VOLUMES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ALONG WITH CURRENCY EFFECTS OF A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR IN THE

COMPANYS EUROPEAN DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS.

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE

WAS $474 MILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $565 MILLION IN 2002 AND $833 MILLION IN 2001. THE

DECLINES BETWEEN PERIODS REFLECTED LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER VARIABLE RATE DEBT AND LOWER AVERAGE

DEBT LEVELS.

INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY INC.

CHEVRONTEXACO OWNS AN APPROXIMATE 26

PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN THE COMMON STOCK

OF DYNEGY  AN ENERGY MERCHANT ENGAGED IN

POWER GENERATION, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS

PROCESSING AND MARKETING, AND REGULATED

ENERGY DELIVERY. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS

INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY NOTES AND PREFERRED

STOCK.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

WAS APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT

WAS ABOUT $425 MILLION BELOW THE COMPANYS

PROPORTIONATE INTEREST IN DYNEGYS

UNDERLYING NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE

RESULTED FROM WRITE-DOWNS OF THE INVESTMENT

IN 2002 FOR DECLINES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF

THE COMMON SHARES BELOW THE COMPANYS

CARRYING VALUE THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY. THE APPROXIMATE $425 MILLION

DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT

PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC DYNEGY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, BASED UPON THE COMPANYS

ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE

TO THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE DYNEGY

SHARES. THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF

DYNEGYS REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED

QUARTERLY TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND DYNEGYS

HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES. THE MARKET VALUE OF

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGYS COMMON

STOCK AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WAS $415

MILLION.

INVESTMENTS IN DYNEGY NOTES AND

PREFERRED STOCK

AT THE BEGINNING OF 2003,

THE COMPANY HELD $1.5 BILLION AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DYNEGY SERIES B

PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH WAS DUE FOR

REDEMPTION AT PAR VALUE IN NOVEMBER 2003. IN

AUGUST, THE COMPANY EXCHANGED ITS PREFERRED

STOCK FOR $225 MILLION IN CASH, $225 MILLION

FACE VALUE OF DYNEGY JUNIOR UNSECURED

SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2016 AND $400 MILLION

FACE VALUE OF DYNEGY SERIES C CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK WITH A STATED MATURITY OF

2033.

THE COMPANY RECORDED THE JUNIOR NOTES

AND SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK ON THE DATE OF

EXCHANGE AT THEIR FAIR VALUES OF $170

MILLION AND $270 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR

A TOTAL OF $440 MILLION. TOGETHER WITH THE

$225 MILLION CASH, THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECORDED

ON THE DATE OF EXCHANGE WAS $665 MILLION. A

GAIN OF $365 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME AT THAT DATE FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE $665 MILLION FAIR

VALUE RECEIVED AND THE NET BALANCE SHEET

AMOUNT OF $300 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

SERIES B SHARES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES OF THE JUNIOR NOTES AND SERIES

C SHARES TOTALED $530 MILLION. THE $90

MILLION INCREASE FROM THE $440 MILLION

RECORDED IN AUGUST WAS RECORDED TO

INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES, WITH AN

OFFSETTING AMOUNT IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME. FUTURE TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NEW SECURITIES

LIKEWISE WILL BE REPORTED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, IF ANY

FUTURE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DEEMED TO

BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, A CHARGE AGAINST

INCOME IN THE PERIOD WOULD BE RECORDED.

INTEREST THAT ACCRUES ON THE NOTES AND

DIVIDENDS PAYABLE

ON THE PREFERRED STOCK IS RECOGNIZED

IN INCOME EACH PERIOD.

IN ADDITION TO THE $365 MILLION GAIN

RECORDED IN INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER

2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED $170 MILLION

DIRECTLY TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE

LATTER AMOUNT REPRESENTED THE COMPANYS

APPROXIMATE 26 PERCENT EQUITY SHARE OF A

GAIN RECORDED BY DYNEGY IN CONNECTION WITH

THE SERIES B EXCHANGE TRANSACTION. UNDER

THE ACCOUNTING RULES APPLICABLE TO

PREFERRED

FS-10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STOCK REDEMPTIONS, CHEVRONTEXACO INCREASED ITS EARNINGS PER

SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2003 BY $0.16 FOR THE EFFECT OF THE $170

MILLION RECORDED DIRECTLY TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

IN FEBRUARY 2004, DYNEGY ANNOUNCED AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS

ILLINOIS POWER SUBSIDIARY TO AMEREN CORPORATION. THE SALE IS

CONDITIONED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RECEIPT OF APPROVALS

FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY AGENCIES. PENDING THESE

APPROVALS, THE ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2004. THE SALE OF ILLINOIS POWER TRIGGERS A MANDATORY PREPAYMENT PROVISION IN THE DYNEGY JUNIOR NOTES HELD BY THE COMPANY.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THAT PROVISION, 75 PERCENT OF THE NET PROCEEDS,

NOT INCLUDING ANY AMOUNTS USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF ANY DEBT

ASSOCIATED WITH ILLINOIS POWER, ARE TO BE USED TO RETIRE AT PAR, PLUS

ACCRUED INTEREST, THE $225 MILLION FACE VALUE NOTES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH,

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

TOTALED $5.3 BILLION AND $3.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2003 WAS $12.3 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $9.9 BILLION IN 2002 AND $11.5 BILLION IN 2001. THE

2003 INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAINLY

HIGHER EARNINGS HELPED BOOST

THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH

FLOW BY 24 PERCENT.

INTEREST EXPENSE FELL 16 PERCENT ON SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DEBT LEVELS.

REFLECTED HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE U.S. UPSTREAM AND WORLDWIDE

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES. CASH PROVIDED BY ASSET SALES WAS $1.1

BILLION IN 2003, $2.3 BILLION IN 2002 AND ABOUT $300 MILLION IN

2001. IN 2002, THE COMPANY RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $2.2 BILLION,

INCLUDING DIVIDENDS DUE, FROM THE FTC-MANDATED SALE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN EQUILON AND MOTIVA. CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING 2003 GENERATED SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR THE

COMPANYS CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURE PROGRAM AND THE

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO A REDUCTION OF $3.7 BILLION IN DEBT LEVELS, $1.4 BILLION

FUNDING OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS AND THE INCREASE IN CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

DIVIDENDS

PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION IN 2003 AND

2002 AND $2.9 BILLION IN 2001 WERE MADE FOR DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS FOR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND MINORITY INTERESTS.

DEBT, CAPITAL LEASE AND MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS

CHEVRON-TEXACOS TOTAL DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS TOTALED $12.6

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, DOWN FROM $16.3 BILLION AT YEAR-END

2002. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD MINORITY INTEREST OBLIGATIONS OF $268

MILLION, DOWN FROM $303 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE COMPANYS DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS DUE WITHIN

ONE YEAR, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALED $6 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, DOWN FROM $9.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. OF THESE

AMOUNTS, $4.3 BILLION AND $4.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE RECLASSIFIED TO LONG-TERM AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. SETTLEMENT OF THE

OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2003 WAS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE

OF WORKING CAPITAL IN 2004, AS THE COMPANY HAD THE INTENT AND THE

ABILITY, AS EVIDENCED BY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, TO REFINANCE

THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO

CONTINUALLY REFINANCE ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER, MAINTAINING LEVELS IT

BELIEVES APPROPRIATE.

AT YEAR-END 2003, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD $4.3 BILLION IN COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH VARIOUS MAJOR BANKS, WHICH PERMIT

THE REFINANCING OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

THESE FACILITIES SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND ALSO CAN

BE USED FOR OTHER GENERAL CREDIT REQUIREMENTS. NO BORROWINGS WERE

OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES DURING THE YEAR OR AT YEAR-END

2003. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD THREE EXISTING EFFECTIVE SHELF

REGISTRATIONS ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC) THAT TOGETHER WOULD PERMIT ADDITIONAL REGISTERED DEBT OFFERINGS UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $3.8 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1 BILLION OF NEW LONG-TERM

DEBT AND OTHER FINANCING OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING $750 MILLION

OF 3.375 PERCENT CHEVRONTEXACO CAPITAL NOTES DUE IN FEBRUARY

2008, $265 MILLION OF NEW PHILIPPINE DEBT AND $19 MILLION OF

INDIVIDUALLY SMALLER ISSUES. PROCEEDS FROM THE CHEVRONTEXACO

CAPITAL COMPANY NOTE ISSUE WERE USED TO RETIRE COMMERCIAL

PAPER. REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDED $665 MILLION OF

TEXACO CAPITAL INC. BONDS, $143 MILLION OF PHILIPPINE DEBT, $110

MILLION OF CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION 8.11 PERCENT NOTES, $128

MILLION OF NIGERIAN DEBT AND $91 MILLION OF INDIVIDUALLY SMALLER

ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, A $210 MILLION PAYMENT WAS MADE TO THE

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN RELATING TO THE COMPANYS 1993 ACQUISITION OF ITS INTEREST IN THE TCO JOINT VENTURE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE

COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT LEVELS WAS A NONCASH REDUCTION OF $50

MILLION OF ESOP DEBT.

CHEVRONTEXACOS SENIOR DEBT IS RATED AA BY STANDARD

AND POORS CORPORATION AND AA2 BY MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICE,

EXCEPT FOR SENIOR DEBT OF TEXACO CAPITAL INC., WHICH IS RATED AA3.

CHEVRONTEXACOS U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POORS AND PRIME 1 BY MOODYS, AND THE COMPANYS

CANADIAN COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED R-1 (MIDDLE) BY DOMINION

BOND RATING SERVICE. ALL OF THESE RATINGS DENOTE HIGH-QUALITY,

INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE DEBT LEVEL IS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE CAPITAL-SPENDING PROGRAM AND CASH THAT

MAY BE GENERATED FROM ASSET DISPOSITIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO MEET UNANTICIPATED CASH

REQUIREMENTS AND, FOR PERIODS OF LOW PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS AND NARROW MARGINS FOR REFINED PRODUCTS AND COMMODITY CHEMICALS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS THE FLEXIBILITY

TO INCREASE BORROWINGS AND/OR MODIFY CAPITAL-SPENDING PLANS TO

CONTINUE PAYING THE COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND AND MAINTAIN THE

COMPANYS HIGH-QUALITY DEBT RATINGS.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

FOR 2003 TOTALED $7.4

BILLION, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES WERE $9.3 BILLION

IN 2002 AND $12 BILLION IN 2001. CHEVRONTEXACOS EQUITY SHARE

OF AFFILIATES EXPENDITURES WERE $1.1 BILLION, $1.4 BILLION AND $1.7

BILLION IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, AND DID NOT REQUIRE

CASH OUTLAYS BY THE COMPANY. EXPENDITURES OF $5.7 BILLION IN

PERCENT OF TOTAL OUTLAYS FOR THE

YEAR, COMPARED WITH 68 PERCENT

IN 2002 AND 59 PERCENT IN 2001.

WITH 70 PERCENT IN 2002 AND 66

PERCENT IN 2001, REFLECTING THE

COMPANYS CONTINUING FOCUS ON

INTERNATIONAL EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES.

EXPENDITURES IN 2003 WERE

$1.9 BILLION LOWER THAN THE PRIOR

YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS

SPENT IN 2002 FOR LARGE LEASE

ACQUISITIONS IN THE NORTH SEA

AND THE GULF OF MEXICO, THE

ATHABASCA OIL SANDS PROJECT IN

WESTERN CANADA, AND ADDITIONAL

COMMON STOCK INVESTMENTS IN

DYNEGY. THE LARGEST EXPENDITURES IN 2003 INCLUDED UPSTREAM

PROJECTS IN EURASIA, WEST AFRICA AND THE GULF OF MEXICO. EXPENDITURES IN 2002 INCLUDED LOWER ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY

AFFILIATES THAN IN 2001 DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE COMPANYS SHARE

OF EXPENDITURES FOR ITS EQUILON AND MOTIVA INVESTMENTS, WHICH

WERE SOLD AS A CONDITION OF THE MERGER. THE 2001 EXPENDITURES

INCLUDED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN TCO AND DYNEGY, INCLUDING

THE PURCHASE OF $1.5 BILLION OF DYNEGY PREFERRED STOCK.

INCLUDING THE SHARE OF SPENDING BY AFFILIATES, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES 2004 CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AT

$8.5 BILLION, WHICH IS ABOUT 15 PERCENT HIGHER THAN SPENDING IN

2003. ABOUT $6.4 BILLION, OR 75 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL, IS TARGETED

FOR EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WITH $4.5 BILLION OF

THAT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE UPSTREAM SPENDING IS TARGETED FOR THE MOST PROMISING EXPLORATORY PROSPECTS IN NIGERIA,

ANGOLA AND DEEPWATER GULF OF MEXICO AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS IN KAZAKHSTAN, VENEZUELA AND AFRICA. INCLUDED IN THE

UPSTREAM EXPENDITURES IS ABOUT $400 MILLION TO COMMERCIALIZE

THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL NATURAL GAS RESOURCE BASE, INCLUDING

THE CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) FACILITIES TO HELP MEET FUTURE DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS. ADDITIONAL LNG

EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT $100 MILLION ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE 2004 CAPITAL PROGRAM.

WORLDWIDE DOWNSTREAM SPENDING IS ESTIMATED TO BE $1.4

BILLION, WITH ABOUT $1 BILLION OF THE AMOUNT ON REFINING AND MARKETING AND $400 MILLION ON SUPPLY AND TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS.

INVESTMENTS IN CHEMICALS ARE BUDGETED AT $200 MILLION. ESTIMATES

FOR POWER AND RELATED BUSINESSES ARE $150 MILLION. THE REMAINING

$300 MILLION IS PRIMARILY FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS

IN 2003, CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. PLANS

TOTALED $1.2 BILLION. IN EARLY 2004, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $535

MILLION TO THE U.S. PENSION PLANS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES CONTRIBUTING ABOUT $50 MILLION TO THE U.S. PLANS

DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. IN YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2004,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. PENSION PLANS OF

ABOUT $250 MILLION PER YEAR, APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE COST OF

BENEFITS EARNED IN EACH YEAR. IN 2003, CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS WERE $214 MILLION AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF

$200 MILLION ARE ANTICIPATED IN 2004. THE ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION

AMOUNTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON INVESTMENT RETURNS, CHANGES IN

PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED

IF INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFSET INCREASES IN PLAN

OBLIGATIONS. REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION OF PENSION ACCOUNTING IN

FINANCIAL RATIOS

CURRENT RATIO

 CURRENT ASSETS DIVIDED BY CURRENT LIABILITIES.

GENERALLY, TWO ITEMS ADVERSELY AFFECTED CHEVRONTEXACOS CURRENT

RATIO, BUT IN THE COMPANYS OPINION DO NOT AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY. FIRST, CURRENT ASSETS IN ALL

CHEVRONTEXACOS RATIO OF TOTAL

DEBT TO TOTAL DEBT PLUS EQUITY

FELL TO 25.8 PERCENT AT YEAR-END

2003 AS THE COMPANYS DEBT

LEVEL DECLINED BY $3.7 BILLION.

A LIFO BASIS, WHICH AT YEAR-END

2003 WERE LOWER THAN REPLACEMENT COSTS, BASED ON AVERAGE

ACQUISITION COSTS DURING THE YEAR,

BY APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION.

SECOND, THE COMPANY BENEFITS

FROM LOWER INTEREST RATES AVAILABLE ON SHORT-TERM DEBT BY

CONTINUALLY REFINANCING ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER; HOWEVER, THE

COMPANYS PROPORTIONATELY LARGE

AMOUNT OF SHORT-TERM DEBT IN

2002 AND 2001 KEPT ITS CURRENT

INDEMNIFICATIONS

SECTION ON PAGE FS-14.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED GUARANTEES, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF $917 MILLION IN

GUARANTEES FOR NOTES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND $256 MILLION FOR THIRD PARTIES AS DESCRIBED,

BY MAJOR CATEGORY, BELOW. THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS BEING CARRIED AS

LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

OF THE $917 MILLION IN GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO AFFILIATES, $716

MILLION RELATE TO BORROWINGS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THESE GUARANTEES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE

LOWER INTEREST RATES AND GENERALLY COVER THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD

OF THE CAPITAL PROJECTS. APPROXIMATELY 75 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS

GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE IN 2004, WITH THE REMAINING GUARANTEES

EXPIRING BY THE END OF 2015. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES,

THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THE GUARANTEE SHOULD

AN AFFILIATE BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL

AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE PROVISIONS, AND NO

ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE GUARANTEES.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES GUARANTEES OF $201 MILLION RELATING TO

OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH PRICING OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR CERTAIN OF ITS COGENERATION AFFILIATES. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IF THE AFFILIATE DOES NOT PERFORM UNDER

THE AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE PROVISIONS TO THIRD PARTIES,

AND NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE PRICING GUARANTEES.

GUARANTEES OF $256 MILLION HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THIRD

PARTIES, INCLUDING GUARANTEES OF APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION OF

CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO HOST GOVERNMENTS IN THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. THE REMAINING GUARANTEES OF

$146 MILLION WERE PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY AS CONDITIONS OF SALE OF

THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, TO PROVIDE A SOURCE

OF LIQUIDITY TO THE GUARANTEED PARTIES AND IN CONNECTION WITH

COMPANY MARKETING PROGRAMS. NO AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES.

ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE

IN 2004, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPIRING AFTER 2004. THE COMPANY

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN OR CONTRACT TERMS,

GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE RECOURSE PROVISIONS, WHICH ENABLE THE

COMPANY TO RECOVER ANY PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

GUARANTEES FROM SECURITIES HELD OVER THE GUARANTEED PARTIES ASSETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD OUTSTANDING

GUARANTEES FOR APPROXIMATELY $238 MILLION OF EQUILON DEBT AND

LEASES. FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 2002 DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN

EQUILON, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN INDEMNIFICATION FROM SHELL

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY ALSO

PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA TO SHELL

AND SAUDI REFINING INC. IN CONNECTION WITH

THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE COMPANYS

INTERESTS IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE

INDEMNITIES COVER CERTAIN CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

THE UNOCAL PATENT LITIGATION. THE COMPANY

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SHOULD THE

INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES

AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE MAXIMUM FUTURE

PAYMENTS OF $300 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS

PAID APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION UNDER THESE

CONTINGENCIES AND HAS DISPUTED APPROXIMATELY

$34 MILLION IN CLAIMS SUBMITTED BY SHELL

UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. SHELL HAS REQUESTED

ARBITRATION OF THIS DISPUTE, WHICH IS

EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN MID-2004. THERE ARE NO

RECOURSE PROVISIONS ENABLING RECOVERY OF ANY

AMOUNTS FROM THIRD PARTIES NOR ARE ANY

ASSETS HELD AS COLLATERAL. WITHIN FIVE YEARS

OF THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE, AT THE BUYERS

OPTION, THE COMPANY ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TO

PURCHASE CERTAIN ASSETS FROM SHELL FOR THEIR

RESPECTIVE NET BOOK VALUES, AS DETERMINED AT

THE TIME OF THE COMPANYS PURCHASE. UNDER

THESE TERMS, THE COMPANY PURCHASED TWO

LUBRICANT FACILITIES IN LATE 2003 FOR

IMMATERIAL AMOUNTS.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO PROVIDED

INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CONTINGENT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO ASSETS

ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO THE

EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED PRIOR

TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR

THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PERIODS OF

CHEVRONTEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE

JOINT VENTURES. IN GENERAL, THE

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OR EVENTS THAT ARE

SUBJECT TO THESE INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE

ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS

RELATING TO EQUILON MUST BE ASSERTED NO

LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2009, AND CLAIMS

RELATING TO MOTIVA MUST BE ASSERTED NO

LATER THAN FEBRUARY 2012. UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE INDEMNITIES, THERE IS NO MAXIMUM

LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE

PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED ANY

LIABILITIES FOR POSSIBLE CLAIMS UNDER THESE

INDEMNITIES. THE COMPANY HOLDS NO ASSETS AS

COLLATERAL AND HAS MADE NO PAYMENTS UNDER

THE INDEMNITIES.

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE

INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE TO BE NET

OF AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE

CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES

RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY SPECIFIC

INCIDENT.

SECURITIZATION

IN OTHER

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, THE

COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN ITS DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES). AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, APPROXIMATELY $1

BILLION, REPRESENTING ABOUT 11 PERCENT OF

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED.

CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL

EXPOSURE UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, WAS APPROXIMATELY $75

MILLION. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT

OF ACCELERATING CHEVRONTEXACOS COLLECTION

OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT

THE SPES EXPERIENCED MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE

COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES, CHEVRONTEXACO

BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO LOSS

EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATION

ARRANGEMENTS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT

AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE CERTAIN

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND

TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE

TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE

AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND

SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE

CAPACITY, UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS,

TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE

AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS UNDER THESE

VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE: 2004  $1.2

BILLION; 2005  $1.1 BILLION; 2006  $1

BILLION; 2007  $1 BILLION; 2008  $1

BILLION; 2009 AND AFTER  $1.9 BILLION.

TOTAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE

APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION IN 2003, $1.2

BILLION IN 2002 AND $1.5 BILLION IN 2001.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENT

CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE

APPROXIMATELY 55,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF

REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY AFFILIATE

REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT

IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCING OF A

REFINERY OWNED BY THE AFFILIATE AND EXPIRES

IN 2009. THE FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS

UNDER THIS CONTRACT ARE: 2004  $700

MILLION; 2005  $800 MILLION; 2006  $800

MILLION; 2007  $800 MILLION; 2008  $800

MILLION; 2009  $800 MILLION.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PREFERRED SHARES OF

SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS MINORITY INTEREST. TEXACO CAPITAL LLC, A

WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, HAS ISSUED

$65 MILLION OF DEFERRED PREFERRED SHARES

SERIES C. DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $60

MILLION ON SERIES C, AT A RATE OF 7.17

PERCENT COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY, WILL BE PAID AT

THE REDEMPTION DATE IN FEBRUARY 2005 UNLESS

EARLIER REDEMPTION OCCURS. EARLY REDEMPTION

MAY RESULT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN

SPECIFIC EVENTS. MVP PRODUCTION INC., A

SUBSIDIARY, REDEEMED VARIABLE RATE

CUMULATIVE PREFERRED SHARES OF $75 MILLION

OWNED BY ONE MINORITY HOLDER DURING 2003.

INCLUDES GUARANTEES OF $385 OF LESOP DEBT, $25 DUE IN 2004 AND

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS OTHER OBLIGATIONS

CONNECTED WITH ASSET RETIREMENTS AND

PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY

FIXED AS TO TIMING AND AMOUNT.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRONTEXACO

IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS

RELATED TO THE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL,

REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY

FEEDSTOCK PRICES. THE COMPANY USES

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE

ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE VOLATILITY ON A SMALL

PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING: FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS

FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF CRUDE OIL;

FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR COMPANY REFINERIES;

CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS INVENTORIES;

AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS TO SELL NATURAL

GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES,

THE RESULTS OF WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, NET

INCOME OR CASH FLOWS IN 2003.

THE COMPANYS POSITIONS ARE MONITORED

AND MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS BY AN INTERNAL

RISK CONTROL GROUP TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH

THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT

HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE

COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT AND TRADING

ACTIVITIES CONSIST MAINLY OF FUTURES

CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND THE INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM

EXCHANGE; CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS SWAP

CONTRACTS; OPTIONS AND OTHER DERIVATIVE

PRODUCTS ENTERED INTO PRINCIPALLY WITH

MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; AND OTHER OIL

AND GAS COMPANIES. VIRTUALLY ALL

DERIVATIVES BEYOND THOSE DESIGNATED AS

NORMAL PURCHASE AND NORMAL SALE CONTRACTS

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING

GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. FAIR

VALUES ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM MARKET

QUOTES AND OTHER INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY

QUOTES.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF A 10 PERCENT

CHANGE IN PRICES FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

FOR NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $20

MILLION. THE HYPOTHETICAL EFFECT ON THESE

CONTRACTS WAS ESTIMATED BY CALCULATING THE

CASH VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HYPOTHETICAL AND

CONTRACT DELIVERY PRICES, MULTIPLIED BY THE

CONTRACT AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, GENERALLY

WITH TERMS OF 180 DAYS OR LESS, TO MANAGE

SOME OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES.

THESE EXPOSURES INCLUDE REVENUE AND

ANTICIPATED PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND

LEASE COMMITMENTS, FORECASTED TO OCCUR

WITHIN 180 DAYS. THE FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND

LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME.

THE AGGREGATE EFFECT ON FOREIGN

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF A HYPOTHETICAL 10

PERCENT CHANGE TO YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES

WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION.

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL

STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON

ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS, NET

CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE

INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO

AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. INTEREST

RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE

SWAPS RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS

FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH RESULTING

GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED IN INCOME. DURING

2003, NO NEW SWAPS WERE INITIATED. AT

YEAR-END 2003, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY

OF RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS

APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS. THERE WERE NO

RECEIVE FLOATING SWAPS OUTSTANDING AT YEAR

END.

A HYPOTHETICAL 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN

INTEREST RATES UPON THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS

WOULD CAUSE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RECEIVE

FIXED SWAPS TO DECLINE AND THE RECEIVE

FLOATING SWAPS TO INCREASE. THE AGGREGATE

EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES WOULD BE

APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

CHEVRONTEXACO ENTERS INTO A NUMBER OF

BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES,

PRINCIPALLY ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. THESE

ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE LONG-TERM SUPPLY OR

OFFTAKE AGREEMENTS. IN JANUARY 2003,

CHEVRONTEXACO AND DYNEGY AGREED TO

TERMINATE THE NATURAL GAS SALE AND PURCHASE

AGREEMENTS. INTERNATIONALLY, THERE ARE

LONG-TERM PURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH

THE COMPANYS REFINING AFFILIATE IN

THAILAND. REFER TO PAGE FS-14 FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE

FOREGOING AGREEMENTS AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN

NEGOTIATED ON TERMS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE

THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH AN

UNRELATED PARTY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

UNOCAL PATENT LITIGATION

CHEVRON, TEXACO

AND FOUR OTHER OIL COMPANIES (REFINERS)

FILED SUIT IN 1995, CONTESTING THE VALIDITY

OF A PATENT (393 PATENT) GRANTED TO

UNOCAL CORPORATION (UNOCAL) FOR CERTAIN

REFORMULATED GASOLINE BLENDS. CHEVRONTEXACO

SELLS REFORMULATED GASOLINES IN CALIFORNIA

IN CERTAIN MONTHS OF THE YEAR. IN MARCH

2000, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FEDERAL CIRCUIT UPHELD A SEPTEMBER 1998

DISTRICT COURT DECISION THAT UNOCALS

PATENT WAS VALID AND ENFORCEABLE AND

ASSESSED DAMAGES OF 5.75 CENTS PER GALLON

FOR GASOLINE PRODUCED DURING THE SUMMER OF

1996 THAT INFRINGED ON THE CLAIMS OF THE

PATENT. IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE

U.S. SUPREME COURT CONCLUDED IT WOULD NOT

REVIEW THE LOWER COURTS RULING, AND THE

CASE WAS SENT BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT

FOR AN ACCOUNTING OF ALL INFRINGING

GASOLINE PRODUCED AFTER AUGUST 1, 1996. THE

DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT THE

FS-15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

»

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PER-GALLON DAMAGES AWARDED BY THE JURY ARE LIMITED TO INFRINGEMENT THAT OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, THE U.S. PATENT

AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) GRANTED THREE PETITIONS BY THE

REFINERS TO RE-EXAMINE THE VALIDITY OF UNOCALS 393 PATENT AND

HAS TWICE REJECTED ALL OF THE CLAIMS IN THE 393 PATENT. THOSE

REJECTIONS HAVE BEEN APPEALED BY UNOCAL TO THE USPTO BOARD

OF APPEALS. THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE REQUESTED FURTHER BRIEFING

AND ADVISED THAT SHE WOULD NOT ENTER A FINAL JUDGMENT IN THIS

CASE UNTIL THE USPTO HAD COMPLETED ITS RE-EXAMINATION OF THE

393 PATENT. DURING 2002 AND 2003, THE USPTO GRANTED TWO

PETITIONS FOR REEXAMINATION OF ANOTHER UNOCAL PATENT, THE 126

PATENT. THE USPTO HAS REJECTED THE VALIDITY OF THE CLAIMS OF THE

126 PATENT, WHICH COULD AFFECT A LARGER SHARE OF U.S. GASOLINE

PRODUCTION. SEPARATELY, IN MARCH 2003, THE FEDERAL TRADE

COMMISSION (FTC) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST UNOCAL ALLEGING

THAT ITS CONDUCT DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE PATENTS WAS IN VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST LAW. IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

JUDGE DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT BROUGHT BY THE FTC. THE FTC HAS

APPEALED THE DECISION.

UNOCAL HAS OBTAINED ADDITIONAL PATENTS THAT COULD AFFECT A

LARGER SHARE OF U.S. GASOLINE PRODUCTION. CHEVRONTEXACO BELIEVES

THESE ADDITIONAL PATENTS ARE INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE AND/OR NOT

INFRINGED. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL EXPOSURE IN THE EVENT OF

UNFAVORABLE CONCLUSIONS TO THE PATENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

REVIEWS MAY INCLUDE ROYALTIES, PLUS INTEREST, FOR PRODUCTION OF

GASOLINE THAT IS PROVED TO HAVE INFRINGED THE PATENTS. THE COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS ON THE COMPANYS REFINING AND

MARKETING OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH PRESENTLY INDETERMINABLE, COULD

BE MATERIAL. CHEVRONTEXACO HAS BEEN ACCRUING IN THE NORMAL

COURSE OF BUSINESS ANY FUTURE ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR POTENTIAL

INFRINGEMENT OF THE 393 PATENT COVERED BY THE 1998 TRIAL COURTS

RULING. IN 2000, PRIOR TO THE MERGER, CHEVRON AND TEXACO MADE

PAYMENTS TO UNOCAL TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION FOR THE

ORIGINAL COURT RULING, INCLUDING INTEREST AND FEES.

MTBE

ANOTHER ISSUE INVOLVING THE COMPANY IS THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRYS USE OF METHYL TERTIARY BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A

GASOLINE ADDITIVE AND ITS POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH

SEEPAGE INTO GROUNDWATER. ALONG WITH OTHER OIL COMPANIES, THE

COMPANY IS A PARTY TO MORE THAN 60 LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RELATED

TO THE USE OF THE CHEMICAL MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED GASOLINES.

THESE ACTIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE

THE ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF MTBE

BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS

RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS,

MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE

RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE,

BUT COULD BE MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD. CHEVRON-TEXACO HAS REDUCED THE USE OF MTBE IN GASOLINE IT MANUFACTURES

IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE COMPLETE PHASE-OUT OF MTBE

IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE END OF 2003.

RESERVES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION INCREASED 5

PERCENT DURING 2003.

EXPENDITURES DURING THE

YEAR WERE APPROXIMATELY $200

MILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE ACTION

TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR RELEASE OF CHEMICALS

OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES.

SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED

TO: SUPERFUND SITES AND REFINERIES, OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS, TERMINALS,

AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR SOLD. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

DISPLAYS THE ANNUAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS BEFORE-TAX ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

RESERVES, INCLUDING THOSE FOR SUPERFUND

SITES. IN 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

FOR ESTIMATED REMEDIATION COSTS, PRIMARILY AT REFINED PRODUCTS

MARKETING SITES AND VARIOUS CLOSED OR DIVESTED FACILITIES IN THE

UNITED STATES.

$1,160

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) OR OTHER

REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. SUPERFUND

LAW AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR OTHERWISE INVOLVED IN THE

REMEDIATION OF 218 SITES. THE COMPANYS REMEDIATION RESERVE FOR

THESE SITES AT YEAR-END 2003 WAS $113 MILLION. THE SUPERFUND LAW

PROVIDES FOR JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR ALL RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

ANY FUTURE ACTIONS BY THE EPA AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES TO

REQUIRE CHEVRONTEXACO TO ASSUME OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES COSTS AT DESIGNATED HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES ARE NOT EXPECTED

TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

IT IS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES, BEYOND THOSE RECORDED, FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION RELATING TO PAST OPERATIONS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE

INDETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE OF

POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND

THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE

RECOGNIZED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE COSTS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO

MAKE SUCH EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT

FS-16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE

POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICALS COMPANIES.

PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, ADDITIONAL

RESERVES FOR DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND

RESTORATION OF ITS WORLDWIDE OIL, GAS AND

COAL PROPERTIES AT THE END OF THEIR

PRODUCTIVE LIVES, WHICH INCLUDED COSTS

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, WERE

RECOGNIZED ON A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION BASIS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY

IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD STATEMENT NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143).

UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY

FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS

RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. THE LIABILITY BALANCE FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT YEAR-END 2003 WAS

$2.9 BILLION. REFER ALSO TO NOTE 25 ON PAGE

FS-50 RELATED TO FAS 143.

FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER ONGOING

OPERATING ASSETS, SUCH AS REFINERIES AND

CHEMICALS FACILITIES, NO PROVISIONS ARE MADE

FOR EXIT OR CLEANUP COSTS THAT MAY BE

REQUIRED WHEN SUCH ASSETS REACH THE END OF

THEIR USEFUL LIVES UNLESS A DECISION TO SELL

OR OTHERWISE ABANDON THE FACILITY HAS BEEN

MADE, AS THE INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES

FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENT ESTIMATION

OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION.

REFER TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED

TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS

INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES ANNUALLY.

THESE LIABILITIES GENERALLY ARE NOT

FINALIZED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL TAXING

AUTHORITIES UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE

END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD FOR WHICH INCOME

TAXES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED. THE U.S. FEDERAL

INCOME TAX LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED

THROUGH 1996 FOR CHEVRONTEXACO (FORMERLY

CHEVRON), 1993 FOR CHEVRONTEXACO GLOBAL

ENERGY INC. (FORMERLY CALTEX), AND 1991 FOR

TEXACO. CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX LIABILITIES

HAVE BEEN SETTLED THROUGH 1991 FOR CHEVRON

AND THROUGH 1987 FOR TEXACO. SETTLEMENT OF

OPEN TAX YEARS, AS WELL AS TAX ISSUES IN

OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS

ITS BUSINESSES, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE

COMPANY, AND IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT,

ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME

AND FRANCHISE TAXES FOR ALL YEARS UNDER

EXAMINATION OR SUBJECT TO FUTURE

EXAMINATION.

GLOBAL OPERATIONS

CHEVRONTEXACO AND ITS

AFFILIATES HAVE OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 180

COUNTRIES. AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY AND

ITS AFFILIATES HAVE MAJOR OPERATIONS INCLUDE

THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, THE

UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY, DENMARK, FRANCE,

PARTITIONED NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN KUWAIT AND

SAUDI ARABIA, REPUBLIC OF CONGO, ANGOLA,

NIGERIA, CHAD, CAMEROON, EQUATORIAL GUINEA,

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, SOUTH AFRICA,

INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE,

CHINA, THAILAND, VENEZUELA, ARGENTINA,

BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, AND

SOUTH KOREA. THE COMPANYS TENGIZCHEVROIL

AFFILIATE OPERATES IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE

COMPANYS CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC)

AFFILIATE OPERATES IN RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN.

THE COMPANYS CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL

COMPANY LLC AFFILIATE MANUFACTURES AND

MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF PETROCHEMICALS ON A

WORLDWIDE BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO

RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI

ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND BELGIUM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE AFFECTED

BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING

THE UNITED STATES. AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE

PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY HOST

GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF

THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED

BUSINESSES AND/OR TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES

OR ROYALTIES ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

IN

CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE

IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND TAXES,

AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE

EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF

EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED

PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES. INTERNAL UNREST

OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST

GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY OR OTHER

GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE, AT TIMES,

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY

CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE

LEVEL OF CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH

COUNTRIES.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

MAY PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF

EQUITY INTERESTS IN ESTIMATED OIL AND GAS

RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR

TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT

COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION

PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996 FOR

CHEVRONTEXACOS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING

ZONES AT THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK

HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE

REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE

OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. A

WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET

SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES.

CHEVRONTEXACO CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS

MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY AT

APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION. AT THE SAME

TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT

COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRONTEXACO IS ESTIMATED

AT ABOUT $50 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE

SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS

RANGE OF ESTIMATES IS UNCERTAIN.

SUSPENDED WELLS

THE COMPANY ALSO

SUSPENDS THE COSTS OF EXPLORATORY WELLS

PENDING A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THE RELATED OIL AND

GAS FIELDS. THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF

THESE WELL COSTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS

OF FUTURE DRILLING ACTIVITY AND/OR

DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. IF THE COMPANY

DECIDES NOT TO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT, THE

COSTS OF THESE WELLS ARE EXPENSED. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD $658

MILLION OF SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS

INCLUDED IN PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT,

AN INCREASE OF $208 MILLION FROM 2002 AND A

DECREASE OF $30 MILLION FROM 2001. THE

INCREASE IN 2003 PRIMARILY REFLECTS DRILLING

ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND NIGERIA.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRONTEXACO

RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO

CUSTOMERS, TRADING PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES, HOST

GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS AND

SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE CLAIMS,

INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE

SIGNIFICANT AND MAY TAKE LENGTHY PERIODS OF

TIME TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO

CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR

OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL,

EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE ASSETS TO

ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS

AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES,

INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY RESULT IN

GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES IN

WHICH THE COMPANY ENGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO

VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN BOTH NUMBER AND

COMPLEXITY OVER TIME AND GOVERN NOT ONLY THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS

OPERATIONS, BUT ALSO THE PRODUCTS IT SELLS.

MOST OF THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO COMPANY OPERATIONS

AND PRODUCTS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORMAL

COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

FS-17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ACCIDENTAL LEAKS AND SPILLS REQUIRING

CLEANUP MAY OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO THE COSTS FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH

ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS, THE

COMPANY MAY INCUR EXPENSES FOR CORRECTIVE

ACTIONS AT VARIOUS OWNED AND PREVIOUSLY

OWNED FACILITIES AND AT THIRD-PARTY-OWNED

WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES USED BY THE COMPANY.

AN OBLIGATION MAY ARISE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE

CLOSED OR SOLD AND AT NON-CHEVRONTEXACO

SITES WHERE COMPANY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

HANDLED OR DISPOSED OF. MOST OF THE

EXPENDITURES TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS

RELATE TO FACILITIES AND SITES WHERE PAST

OPERATIONS FOLLOWED PRACTICES AND

PROCEDURES THAT WERE CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE

AT THE TIME BUT NOW REQUIRE INVESTIGATIVE

AND/OR REMEDIAL WORK TO MEET CURRENT

STANDARDS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES

ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM

INSTITUTE, CHEVRONTEXACO ESTIMATED ITS

WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING IN 2003 AT

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION FOR ITS

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES. INCLUDED IN THESE

EXPENDITURES WERE $305 MILLION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $820

MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

CONTROL AND ABATEMENT OF HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES AND POLLUTANTS FROM ONGOING

OPERATIONS.

FOR 2004, TOTAL WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT $430

MILLION. THESE CAPITAL COSTS ARE IN ADDITION

TO THE ONGOING COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND THE COSTS TO

REMEDIATE PREVIOUSLY CONTAMINATED SITES.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL

INVESTMENTS IN NEW OR EXISTING FACILITIES OR

AMOUNTS OF INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS TO BE

INCURRED IN THE FUTURE TO: PREVENT, CONTROL,

REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT; COMPLY WITH

EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR

REGULATIONS; OR REMEDIATE AND RESTORE AREAS

DAMAGED BY PRIOR RELEASES OF HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE COSTS MAY BE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

ANY SINGLE PERIOD, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS LIQUIDITY OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

MANAGEMENT MAKES MANY ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS IN THE

APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) THAT MAY HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED DISCLOSURES AND ON THE

COMPARABILITY OF SUCH INFORMATION OVER

DIFFERENT REPORTING PERIODS. ALL SUCH

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT REPORTED

AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES

AND EXPENSES AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS EXPERIENCE AND OTHER

INFORMATION AVAILABLE PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE

OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.

THE DISCUSSION IN THIS SECTION OF

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR

ASSUMPTIONS IS ACCORDING TO THE DISCLOSURE

GUIDELINES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC), WHEREIN.

1.

THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES OR

ASSUMPTIONS IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE

LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT

NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY

UNCERTAIN MATTERS, OR THE

SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO

CHANGE, AND

2.

THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING

PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.

BESIDES THOSE MEETING THE CRITICAL

CRITERIA, THE COMPANY MAKES MANY OTHER

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN

PREPARING ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALTHOUGH NOT ASSOCIATED

WITH HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS, THESE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT

TO REVISION AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, AND

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS MAY SOMETIMES

OCCUR.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT UNDER THE

ACCOUNTING RULES THAT THE FUTURE REALIZATION

OF THE ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFITS BE MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE

ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES UNDER SEC

RULES THAT REQUIRE ...GEOLOGICAL AND

ENGINEERING DATA (THAT) DEMONSTRATE WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY (RESERVES) TO BE

RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN

RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND COSTS

AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. REFER

TO TABLE V, RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION,

ON PAGE FS-57 FOR THE CHANGES IN THESE

ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING

DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND TO TABLE VII,

CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF

DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FROM PROVED

RESERVES, ON PAGE FS-59 FOR ESTIMATES OF

PROVED-RESERVE VALUES FOR EACH YEAR-END

20012003, WHICH WERE BASED ON YEAR-END

PRICES AT THE TIME. NOTE 1 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES A

DESCRIPTION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE

ESTIMATES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE TIMING OF

EXPENSE RECOGNITION FOR COSTS INCURRED.

THE DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR IMPAIRMENT OF

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES ON PAGES FS-19

AND FS-20 INCLUDES REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS

UNDER WHICH DOWNWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED

RESERVE QUANTITIES COULD RESULT IN

IMPAIRMENTS OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES.

THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN

CONJUNCTION WITH DISCLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN

THIS DISCUSSION AND IN THE NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO

ESTIMATES, UNCERTAINTIES, CONTINGENCIES AND

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-28. THE DEVELOPMENT AND

SELECTION OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DEEMED

CRITICAL, AND THE ASSOCIATED DISCLOSURES IN

THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY

MANAGEMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTING AND THE

ASSOCIATED CRITICAL ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY ARE AS

FOLLOWS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION

PLAN EXPENSE AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

FUNDING OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR PENSION PLANS

ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE

THE RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS

AND THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO PENSION

PLAN OBLIGATIONS. FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT (OPEB) PLANS, WHICH PROVIDE

FOR CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE

FOR QUALIFYING RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND WHICH

ARE NOT FUNDED, CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN

DETERMINING OPEB EXPENSE ARE THE DISCOUNT

RATE APPLIED TO BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES USED IN

THE CALCULATION OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

FS-18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-42,

INCLUDES INFORMATION FOR THE THREE YEARS

ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2003, ON THE COMPONENTS

OF PENSION AND OPEB EXPENSE AND THE

UNDERLYING DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL

AS ON THE FUNDED STATUS FOR THE COMPANYS

PENSION PLANS AT THE END OF 2003 AND 2002.

TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THE

COMPANY EMPLOYS A RIGOROUS PROCESS THAT

INCORPORATES ACTUAL HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS

RETURNS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED FUTURE

PERFORMANCE, AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION

EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL ADVICE AND ASSET-CLASS

RISK FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE

REGULARLY UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN

ASSET/LIABILITY STUDIES, AND THE

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF

LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ARE CONSISTENT

WITH THESE STUDIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AT DECEMBER

31, 2003 AND 2002, THE ESTIMATED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS,

WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WAS 7.8

PERCENT, AS COMPARED WITH 9 PERCENT AT THE

END OF 2001. THE YEAR-END MARKET-RELATED

VALUE OF U.S. PENSION-PLAN ASSETS USED IN

THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE WAS

BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN THE PRECEDING

THREE MONTHS AS OPPOSED TO THE MAXIMUM

ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS UNDER U.S.

ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE

THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG ENOUGH TO

MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF DISTORTIONS FROM

DAY-TO-DAY MARKET VOLATILITY AND STILL BE

CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THE END OF THE YEAR.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

AND PENSION EXPENSE IS BASED ON HIGH-QUALITY

FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT INTEREST RATES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY CALCULATED

THE U.S. PENSION OBLIGATIONS USING A 6.0

PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATES

USED AT THE END OF 2002 AND 2001 WERE 6.8

PERCENT AND 7.3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AN INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

PENSION PLAN ASSETS OR THE DISCOUNT RATE

WOULD REDUCE PENSION PLAN EXPENSE, AND VICE

VERSA. TOTAL PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2003

WAS $697 MILLION. AS AN INDICATION OF

INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVITY TO THE

DETERMINATION OF PENSION EXPENSE, A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS PRIMARY U.S. PENSION

PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 61 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANYWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WOULD

HAVE REDUCED TOTAL PENSION PLAN EXPENSE FOR

2003 BY APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION. A 1

PERCENT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR

THIS SAME PLAN WOULD HAVE REDUCED TOTAL

BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $120

MILLION. THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATES MAY VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ESTIMATES BECAUSE OF

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE WORLDS

FINANCIAL MARKETS.

BASED ON THE EXPECTED CHANGES IN

PENSION PLAN ASSET VALUES AND PENSION

OBLIGATIONS IN 2004, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

BELIEVE ANY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING OF THE

PENSION PLANS WILL BE MANDATORY DURING THE

YEAR. FOR THE U.S. PLANS, THIS DETERMINATION

WAS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINIMUM

FUNDING STANDARD OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA). HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF

$535 MILLION TO U.S. PLANS IN EARLY 2004.

LATER IN 2004, ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY

PAYMENTS OF $200 MILLION AND $50 MILLION FOR

THE INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. PLANS,

RESPECTIVELY, ARE ANTICIPATED.

PENSION EXPENSE IS INCLUDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN

OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND APPLIES TO

ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DEPENDING UPON THE

FUNDING STATUS OF THE DIFFERENT PLANS,

EITHER A LONG-TERM PREPAID ASSET OR A

LONG-TERM LIABILITY IS RECORDED FOR PLANS

WITH OVERFUNDING OR UNDERFUNDING,

RESPECTIVELY. ANY UNFUNDED ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION IN EXCESS OF RECORDED

LIABILITIES IS RECORDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SEE NOTE

21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-42 FOR THE

PENSION-RELATED BALANCE SHEET EFFECTS AT

THE END OF 2003 AND 2002.

FOR THE COMPANYS OPEB PLANS, EXPENSE

FOR 2003 WAS $228 MILLION AND WAS ALSO

RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES OR

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES IN ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE

DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS

U.S. OPEB OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

WAS 6.0 PERCENT  THE SAME DISCOUNT RATE

USED FOR U.S. PENSION OBLIGATIONS. THE

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST-TREND RATES USED

TO CALCULATE OPEB OBLIGATIONS STARTING IN

2003 WAS AN 8.4 PERCENT COST INCREASE OVER

THE PREVIOUS YEAR GRADUALLY DROPPING OVER

FOUR YEARS TO A LONG-TERM ULTIMATE

RATE-INCREASE ASSUMPTION OF 4.5 PERCENT

FOR 2007 AND THEREAFTER. THE HEALTH CARE

COST-TREND INCREASE ASSUMPTION AND

DURATION TO REACH THAT RATE ARE COMPANY

ESTIMATES, DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH

EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS, AND ARE CONSISTENT

WITH THE COMPANYS ACTUAL EXPERIENCE.

AS AN INDICATION OF DISCOUNT-RATE

SENSITIVITY TO THE DETERMINATION OF OPEB

EXPENSE IN 2003, A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE COMPANYS

PRIMARY U.S. OPEB PLAN, WHICH ACCOUNTED

FOR THE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANYWIDE OPEB OBLIGATION, WOULD HAVE

DECREASED OPEB EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

$10 MILLION.

IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

THE

COMPANY ASSESSES ITS PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT (PP&E) FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS PLANS,

CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND FOR OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD

REVISIONS OF ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVE

QUANTITIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN

ASSET EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS EXPECTED FROM THE ASSET, AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE EXCESS OF

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR

VALUE.

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AND HOW

MUCH AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED INVOLVES

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES ON HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

MATTERS SUCH AS FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, THE

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS ON OPERATING EXPENSES AND THE

OUTLOOK FOR GLOBAL OR REGIONAL MARKET SUPPLY

AND DEMAND CONDITIONS FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL

GAS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND REFINED

PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS

AND CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS

THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS PLANS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT

DECISIONS.

THE AMOUNT AND INCOME STATEMENT

CLASSIFICATION OF MAJOR IMPAIRMENTS OF PP&E

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 31,

2003, ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMMENTARY ON THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THIS

DISCUSSION, AS WELL AS IN NOTE 3 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES

FS-30 AND FS-31. AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE

SENSITIVITY TO EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF

OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN THE

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND IMPAIRMENT

CALCULATIONS IS NOT PRACTICABLE, GIVEN THE

BROAD RANGE OF THE COMPANYS PP&E AND THE

NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THE

ESTIMATES. THAT IS, FAVORABLE CHANGES TO

SOME ASSUMPTIONS MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THE NEED

TO IMPAIR ANY ASSETS IN THESE PERIODS,

WHEREAS UNFAVORABLE CHANGES MIGHT HAVE

CAUSED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWN NUMBER OF OTHER

ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED.

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK OF

AFFILIATES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

EQUITY METHOD AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN

OTHER SECURITIES OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES

ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT FALLS BELOW THE

COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN SUCH A

DECLINE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED

TO THE

FS-19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

»

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INVESTMENTS CARRYING VALUE AND

ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME. IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER

A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE

DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND

THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS

MARKET VALUE. DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS COULD AFFECT WHETHER AN INVESTMENT IS

IMPAIRED IN ANY PERIOD AND THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY PERFORMS

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS AND DETERMINES THAT NO

WRITE-DOWN IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET

OR ASSET GROUP IS REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE,

WHEN SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE MADE FOR

ANY SINGLE FIELD OR CONCESSION, AN

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE

IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET REMAINS

RECOVERABLE. ALSO, IF THE EXPECTATION OF

SALE OF A PARTICULAR ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IN

ANY PERIOD HAS BEEN DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT, AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED, AND

IF THE ESTIMATED NET PROCEEDS EXCEED THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP,

NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS REQUIRED. SUCH

CALCULATIONS ARE REVIEWED EACH

PERIOD UNTIL THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP

IS DISPOSED OF. ASSETS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED

ON A HELD-AND-USED BASIS COULD POSSIBLY

BECOME IMPAIRED IF A DECISION WAS MADE TO

SELL SUCH ASSETS AND THE ESTIMATED PROCEEDS

WERE LESS THAN THE ASSOCIATED CARRYING

VALUES.

CONTINGENT LOSSES

MANAGEMENT ALSO MAKES

JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN RECORDING

LIABILITIES FOR CLAIMS, LITIGATION, TAX

MATTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION.

ACTUAL COSTS CAN FREQUENTLY VARY FROM

ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE COSTS FROM SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS

AND LITIGATION CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES BASED

ON DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF LAWS,

OPINIONS ON CULPABILITY AND ASSESSMENTS ON

THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES. SIMILARLY,

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

LAWS, REGULATIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION;

THE DETERMINATION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF SITE

CONTAMINATION; AND IMPROVEMENTS IN

TECHNOLOGY.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, A

LIABILITY IS RECORDED FOR THESE TYPES OF

CONTINGENCIES IF MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE

LOSS TO BE BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE

COMPANY GENERALLY RECORDS THESE LOSSES AS

OPERATING EXPENSES OR SELLING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. REFER TO

THE BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE

IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN NOTE 3 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES

FS-30 AND FS-31 FOR THE EFFECT ON EARNINGS

FROM LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

AND TAX MATTERS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2003.

AN ESTIMATE AS TO THE SENSITIVITY TO

EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS IF OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS HAD BEEN USED IN RECORDING

THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT PRACTICAL BECAUSE

OF THE NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT MUST BE

ASSESSED, THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS AND THE WIDE RANGE OF

REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, IN TERMS OF

BOTH THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND THE

ESTIMATES OF SUCH LOSS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED

INTERPRETATION NO. 46,

"

CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES



(FIN 46). FIN

46 AMENDED ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN

(ARB) 51, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AND ESTABLISHED STANDARDS FOR

DETERMINING CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE

CONSOLIDATED BY ITS PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

FIN 46 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT VIES

THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO

CONSOLIDATE BUT IN WHICH IT HAS A

SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST. IN DECEMBER

2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46-R, WHICH NOT

ONLY INCLUDED AMENDMENTS TO FIN 46, BUT

ALSO REQUIRED APPLICATION OF THE

INTERPRETATION TO ALL AFFECTED ENTITIES NO

LATER THAN MARCH 31, 2004 FOR CALENDAR-YEAR

REPORTING COMPANIES. PRIOR TO THIS

REQUIREMENT, HOWEVER, COMPANIES MUST APPLY

THE INTERPRETATION TO SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITIES BY DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE ADOPTION

OF FIN 46-R AS IT RELATES TO

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT

A MATERIAL IMPACT UPON ITS FULL ADOPTION OF

THE INTERPRETATION AS OF MARCH 31, 2004.

ACCOUNTING FOR MINERAL INTERESTS INVESTMENT

THE SEC HAS QUESTIONED CERTAIN PUBLIC

COMPANIES IN THE OIL AND GAS AND MINING

INDUSTRIES AS TO THE PROPER ACCOUNTING FOR,

AND REPORTING OF, ACQUIRED CONTRACTUAL

MINERAL INTERESTS UNDER FASB STATEMENT NO.

141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (FAS 141), AND

FASB STATEMENT NO. 142, GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142). THESE

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR

THE COMPANY ON JULY 1, 2001, AND JANUARY 1,

2002, RESPECTIVELY.

AT ISSUE IS WHETHER SUCH MINERAL INTEREST

COSTS SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET AS PART OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT OR AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO CLASSIFY THESE

COSTS AS PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

AND APPORTION THEM TO EXPENSE IN FUTURE

PERIODS UNDER THE COMPANYS EXISTING

ACCOUNTING POLICY UNTIL AUTHORITATIVE

GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED.

FOR CHEVRONTEXACO, THE NET BOOK VALUES OF

THIS CATEGORY OF MINERAL INTEREST INVESTMENT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, WERE $3.8

BILLION AND $4.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IF

RECLASSIFICATION OF THESE BALANCES BECOMES

NECESSARY, THE COMPANYS STATEMENTS OF

INCOME AND CASH FLOWS WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED.

HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES RELATED TO

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WOULD BE REQUIRED AS

PRESCRIBED UNDER THE ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE AMOUNTS

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL

CHEVRONTEXACO MANAGES ITS

INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE,

FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TO U.S. AND

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES THAT

ENGAGE IN FULLY INTEGRATED PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS, CHEMICALS OPERATIONS AND COAL

MINING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION,

CHEVRONTEXACO HOLDS INVESTMENTS IN POWER

GENERATION AND GASIFICATION BUSINESSES.

COLLECTIVELY, THESE COMPANIES OPERATE IN

MORE THAN 180 COUNTRIES. PETROLEUM

OPERATIONS CONSIST OF EXPLORING FOR,

DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS; REFINING CRUDE OIL INTO

FINISHED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; MARKETING CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS AND THE MANY PRODUCTS

DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM; AND TRANSPORTING

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS BY PIPELINES, MARINE VESSELS, MOTOR

EQUIPMENT AND RAIL CAR. CHEMICALS OPERATIONS

INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF

COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, PLASTICS FOR

INDUSTRIAL USES, AND FUEL AND LUBE OIL

ADDITIVES.

IN PREPARING ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY FOLLOWS

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS REQUIRES

THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES

AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AS WELL AS AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN

THE NOTES THERETO, INCLUDING DISCUSSION AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. WHILE

THE COMPANY USES ITS BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM

THESE ESTIMATES AS FUTURE CONFIRMING EVENTS

OCCUR.

THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS AND THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH

IT OPERATES SUBJECT IT TO CHANGING

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE

IT IS VULNERABLE TO THE RISK OF NEAR-TERM

SEVERE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF ANY

CONCENTRATION OF ITS ACTIVITIES.

SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE

THE ACCOUNTS OF CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY

COMPANIES MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OWNED.

INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES

IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL

OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 20

PERCENT TO 50 PERCENT OR FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT

NOT CONTROL OVER POLICY DECISIONS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD. AS PART

OF THAT ACCOUNTING, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE FROM THE

ISSUANCE OF STOCK BY AN AFFILIATE THAT

RESULTS IN CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF

THE AFFILIATES EQUITY CURRENTLY IN INCOME.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR

THESE GAINS AND LOSSES.

INVESTMENTS ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE

IMPAIRMENT WHEN THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT MAY BE

BELOW THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE. WHEN

SUCH A CONDITION IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR

VALUE, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS

INCLUDED IN NET INCOME. IN MAKING THE

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER

A DECLINE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS SUCH FACTORS AS THE

DURATION AND EXTENT OF THE DECLINE, THE

INVESTEES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE

COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENTION TO RETAIN

ITS INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD THAT WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED

RECOVERY IN THE INVESTMENTS MARKET VALUE.

THE NEW COST BASIS OF INVESTMENTS IN THE

COMMON STOCK OF THESE EQUITY INVESTEES IS

NOT CHANGED FOR SUBSEQUENT RECOV-

ERIES IN

FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT RECOVERIES IN THE

CARRYING VALUE OF OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE

REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING

VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS

UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE

AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT

PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS

OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE

DIFFERENCE. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE

AFFILIATES REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED

QUARTERLY TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND THE AFFILIATES

HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES.

DERIVATIVES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

ACTIVITY IN COMMODITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED TO MANAGE THE PRICE

RISK POSED BY PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. FOR

SOME OF THIS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY, GENERALLY

LIMITED TO LARGE, DISCRETE OR INFREQUENTLY

OCCURRING TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY MAY

ELECT TO APPLY FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW

HEDGE ACCOUNTING. FOR OTHER SIMILAR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, GENERALLY BECAUSE

OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE CONTRACTS

OR THEIR LIMITED USE, THE COMPANY HAS

ELECTED NOT TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE

CONTRACTS ARE REFLECTED IN CURRENT INCOME.

FOR THE COMPANYS TRADING ACTIVITY, GAINS

AND LOSSES FROM THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

ARE REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RELATING TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXPOSURES, GAINS AND LOSSES ARE

REPORTED IN CURRENT INCOME. INTEREST RATE

SWAPS  HEDGING A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS

FIXED-RATE DEBT  ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS

RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS

FLOATING-RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES REFLECTED

IN INCOME.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR

SALE AND ARE IN HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT OR

EQUITY SECURITIES. THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT

ARE PART OF THE COMPANYS CASH MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS ARE REPORTED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS. THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED AS MARKETABLE

SECURITIES. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE

MARKED-TO-MARKET WITH ANY UNREALIZED GAINS

OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

AND CHEMICALS ARE GENERALLY STATED AT COST,

USING A LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD.

IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COSTS ARE BELOW

MARKET. MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND OTHER

INVENTORIES GENERALLY ARE STATED AT AVERAGE

COST.

PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE

SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD IS USED FOR OIL

AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES. ALL COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT WELLS,

RELATED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PROVED MINERAL

INTERESTS IN OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, AND

RELATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (ARO)

ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED. COSTS OF EXPLORATORY

WELLS ARE CAPITALIZED PENDING DETERMINATION

OF WHETHER

THE WELLS FOUND PROVED RESERVES. COSTS OF

WELLS THAT ARE ASSIGNED PROVED RESERVES

REMAIN CAPITALIZED. COSTS ALSO ARE

CAPITALIZED FOR WELLS THAT FIND COMMERCIALLY

PRODUCIBLE RESERVES THAT CANNOT BE

CLASSIFIED AS PROVED, PENDING ONE OR MORE OF

THE FOLLOWING: (1) DECISIONS ON ADDITIONAL

MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, (2) THE RESULTS

OF ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT ARE

UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED, AND (3)

SECURING FINAL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR

DEVELOPMENT. OTHERWISE, WELL COSTS ARE

EXPENSED IF A DETER-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONTINUED

MINATION AS TO WHETHER PROVED RESERVES WERE FOUND CANNOT BE MADE WITHIN ONE

YEAR FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF DRILLING. ALL OTHER EXPLORATORY WELLS AND COSTS

ARE EXPENSED.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED,

INCLUDING PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES,

ARE ASSESSED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY

COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUES WITH THE

UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE NET BEFORE-TAX CASH

FLOWS. EVENTS THAT CAN TRIGGER ASSESSMENTS

FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENTS INCLUDE

WRITE-DOWNS OF PROVED RESERVES BASED ON

FIELD PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN

THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, SIGNIFICANT

CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER OF USE,

PHYSICAL CHANGE IN AN ASSET, AND AN

EXPECTATION THAT, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, A

LONG-LIVED ASSET OR ASSET GROUP WILL BE

SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF SIGNIFICANTLY

BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIFE. IMPAIRED ASSETS ARE WRITTEN

DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES,

GENERALLY THEIR DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET

BEFORE-TAX CASH FLOWS. FOR PROVED OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

COMPANY GENERALLY PERFORMS THE IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW ON AN INDIVIDUAL FIELD BASIS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, REVIEWS ARE

PERFORMED ON A COUNTRY, CONCESSION OR FIELD

BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. IMPAIRMENT AMOUNTS

ARE RECORDED AS INCREMENTAL DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE HELD FOR

SALE ARE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT

BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE WITH THE

FAIR VALUE LESS THE COST TO SELL. IF THE NET

BOOK VALUE EXCEEDS THE SALES VALUE, THE

ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED RESULTING IN AN

ADJUSTMENT TO THE LOWER VALUE.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY

IMPLEMENTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD STATEMENT NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143), IN

WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECORDED AS

AN ASSET AND A LIABILITY WHEN THERE IS A

LEGAL OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE

AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SEE ALSO

NOTE 25 ON PAGE FS-50 RELATING TO ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDES

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS

ADOPTION OF FAS 143. PREVIOUSLY, FOR OIL,

GAS AND COAL PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A

PROVISION WAS MADE THROUGH DEPRECIATION

EXPENSE FOR ANTICIPATED ABANDONMENT AND

RESTORATION COSTS AT THE END OF THE

PROPERTYS USEFUL LIFE.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION OF ALL

CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED OIL AND GAS

PRODUCING PROPERTIES, EXCEPT MINERAL

INTERESTS, ARE EXPENSED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL

FIELD AS THE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

PRODUCED. DEPLETION EXPENSES FOR

CAPITALIZED COSTS OF PROVED MINERAL

INTERESTS ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BY INDIVIDUAL

FIELD AS THE RELATED PROVED RESERVES ARE

PRODUCED. PERIODIC VALUATION PROVISIONS FOR

IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF UNPROVED

MINERAL INTERESTS ARE EXPENSED.

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES

FOR COAL ASSETS ARE DETERMINED USING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD AS THE PROVED

RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. THE CAPITALIZED

COSTS OF ALL OTHER PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE

DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN GENERAL, THE

DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD IS USED TO

DEPRECIATE PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE

UNITED STATES; THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

GENERALLY IS USED TO DEPRECIATE

INTERNATIONAL PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND TO

AMORTIZE ALL CAPITALIZED LEASED ASSETS.

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR

NORMAL RETIREMENTS OF PROPERTIES, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT SUBJECT TO COMPOSITE GROUP

AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION. GAINS OR

LOSSES FROM ABNORMAL RETIREMENTS ARE

RECORDED AS EXPENSES AND FROM SALES AS

OTHER INCOME.

EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE, REPAIRS

AND MINOR RENEWALS TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES IN

OPERATING CONDITION ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED

AS INCURRED. MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND RENEWALS

ARE CAPITALIZED.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO ONGOING

OPERATIONS OR TO CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST

OPERATIONS ARE EXPENSED. EXPENDITURES THAT

CREATE FUTURE BENEFITS OR CONTRIBUTE TO

FUTURE REVENUE GENERATION ARE CAPITALIZED.

LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUTURE

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND/OR CLEANUPS

ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR THE COMPANYS

U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKETING FACILITIES, THE

ACCRUAL IS BASED IN PART ON THE PROBABILITY

THAT A FUTURE REMEDIATION COMMITMENT WILL

BE REQUIRED. FOR OIL, GAS AND COAL

PRODUCING PROPERTIES, A LIABILITY FOR AN

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS MADE

FOLLOWING FAS 143, WHICH THE COMPANY

IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. SEE

NOTE 25 ON PAGE FS-50 RELATED TO FAS 143.

FOR SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANY

RECORDS A LIABILITY FOR ITS DESIGNATED

SHARE OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE COSTS

AND PROBABLE AMOUNTS FOR OTHER POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHEN MANDATED BY THE

REGULATORY AGENCIES BECAUSE THE OTHER

PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY THEIR

RESPECTIVE SHARES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS THE GROSS AMOUNT

OF ITS LIABILITY BASED ON ITS BEST ESTIMATE

OF FUTURE COSTS USING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

TECHNOLOGY AND APPLYING CURRENT REGULATIONS

AS WELL AS THE COMPANYS OWN INTERNAL

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. FUTURE AMOUNTS ARE

NOT DISCOUNTED. RECOVERIES OR

REIMBURSEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS ASSETS WHEN

RECEIPT IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

AND THOSE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES. FOR

THOSE OPERATIONS, ALL GAINS OR LOSSES FROM

CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS ARE CURRENTLY

INCLUDED IN INCOME. THE CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION EFFECTS FOR THOSE FEW ENTITIES,

BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND AFFILIATED, USING

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S.

DOLLAR ARE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT IN STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH

SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL,

PETROLEUM AND CHEMICALS PRODUCTS, AND ALL

OTHER SOURCES ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES

TO THE CUSTOMER, NET OF ROYALTIES, DISCOUNTS

AND ALLOWANCES, AS APPLICABLE. REVENUES FROM

NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FROM PROPERTIES IN

WHICH CHEVRONTEXACO HAS AN INTEREST WITH

OTHER PRODUCERS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON

THE BASIS OF THE COMPANYS NET WORKING

INTEREST (ENTITLEMENT METHOD).

STOCK COMPENSATION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE

COMPANY HAD STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE

COMPENSATION PLANS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED MORE

FULLY IN NOTE 22 BEGINNING ON PAGE FS-46.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION - MERGER OF CHEVRON

AND TEXACO

ON OCTOBER 9, 2001, TEXACO INC.

(TEXACO) BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

CHEVRON CORPORATION (CHEVRON) PURSUANT TO A

MERGER TRANSACTION, AND CHEVRON CHANGED ITS

NAME TO CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION

(CHEVRONTEXACO). THE COMBINATION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS.

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

GIVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO THE MERGER, WITH

ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AS IF CHEVRON AND

TEXACO HAD ALWAYS BEEN COMBINED. CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM

THE SEPARATE PRESENTATIONS OF CHEVRON AND

TEXACO. THE RECLASSIFICATIONS HAD NO IMPACT

ON THE AMOUNT OF NET INCOME OR STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL MAJORITY-OWNED,

CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES AFTER THE

ELIMINATION OF SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY

ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATION ARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE CALTEX

GROUP OF COMPANIES (CALTEX), A JOINT VENTURE

OWNED 50 PERCENT EACH BY CHEVRON AND TEXACO

LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALES OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS IN EQUILON AND

MOTIVA.

AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, EACH SHARE

OF TEXACO COMMON STOCK WAS CONVERTED, ON A

TAX-FREE BASIS, INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

0.77 SHARES OF CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK.

APPROXIMATELY 425 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES

OF COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED, REPRESENTING

ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING

CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK AFTER THE

MERGER.

AS A CONDITION OF APPROVING THE

MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

(FTC) REQUIRED THE DIVESTMENT OF CERTAIN

TEXACO ASSETS: TEXACOS INVESTMENTS IN ITS

U.S. REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

AFFILIATES, EQUILON ENTERPRISES LLC

(EQUILON) AND MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC

(MOTIVA), AS WELL AS OTHER INTERESTS IN

U.S. NATURAL GAS PROCESSING AND

TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES AND GENERAL

AVIATION FUEL MARKETING.

AT THE TIME OF THE MERGER, TEXACO

PLACED ITS INTERESTS IN EQUILON AND MOTIVA

IN TRUST, AS REQUIRED BY THE FTC. BECAUSE

THE COMPANY NO LONGER EXERCISED SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE OVER THESE INVESTMENTS, THE

ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTING METHOD WAS CHANGED

FROM EQUITY TO COST BASIS.

NET INCOME FOR 2001 INCLUDED A LOSS OF

$643, NET OF A TAX BENEFIT OF $144 ($0.61

PER COMMON SHARE  DILUTED), RELATED TO THE

DISPOSITION OF ASSETS THAT WERE REQUIRED AS

A CONDITION OF THE FTC APPROVAL OF THE

MERGER AND OTHER ASSETS THAT WERE MADE

DUPLICATIVE BY THE MERGER. ALL SUCH ASSETS

SOLD AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER PROVIDED NET

INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $375 IN 2001. THE

AFTER-TAX LOSS ON THESE DISPOSITIONS WAS

REPORTED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY ITEM IN

ACCORDANCE WITH POOLING-OF-INTERESTS

ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS.

INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL AFTER-TAX LOSS

WAS A LOSS OF $564 CONNECTED WITH THE SALE

OF INTERESTS IN EQUILON AND MOTIVA. PROCEEDS

FROM THE SALE, WHICH CLOSED IN FEBRUARY

2002, WERE APPROXIMATELY $2,200.

FIELD IN VENEZUELA WAS ALSO RECORDED IN 2001

 AS SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED RESERVOIR

UPON THE MERGER OF CHEVRON AND TEXACO,

THE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK OF

CHEVRONTEXACO WAS INCREASED FROM 2 BILLION

SHARES OF $0.75 PAR VALUE TO 4 BILLION

SHARES OF $0.75 PAR VALUE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER

AGREEMENT, APPROXIMATELY 425 MILLION SHARES

OF CHEVRONTEXACO COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED

IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING

SHARES OF TEXACO COMMON STOCK BASED UPON AN

EXCHANGE RATIO OF 0.77 OF A CHEVRONTEXACO

SHARE FOR EACH TEXACO SHARE. TEXACOS

COMMON STOCK HELD IN TREASURY WAS CANCELED

AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER.

IN 1998, IN CONNECTION WITH THE

RENEWAL OF CHEVRONS STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

PLAN, CHEVRON DECLARED A DIVIDEND

DISTRIBUTION ON EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF

ITS COMMON STOCK OF ONE RIGHT TO PURCHASE

PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK. THE RIGHTS

ISSUED UNDER THE PLAN BECAME EXERCISABLE,

UNLESS REDEEMED EARLIER BY CHEVRONTEXACO,

IF A PERSON OR GROUP COMMENCED A TENDER OR

EXCHANGE OFFER OR ACQUIRED OR OBTAINED THE

RIGHT TO ACQUIRE 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE

OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITHOUT

THE PRIOR CONSENT OF CHEVRONTEXACO. IN

OCTOBER 2002, THE

STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED SO

THAT THE RIGHTS WOULD EXPIRE IN NOVEMBER

2003, FIVE YEARS EARLIER THAN THE INITIAL

EXPIRATION DATE IN NOVEMBER 2008. NO EVENT

MADE THE RIGHTS EXERCISABLE PRIOR TO THEIR

EXPIRATION IN NOVEMBER 2003.

UNTIL JUNE 2001, THERE WERE 1,200

SHARES OF TEXACO CUMULATIVE VARIABLE RATE

PREFERRED STOCK, CALLED MARKET AUCTION

PREFERRED SHARES (MAPS), OUTSTANDING, WITH

AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF $300. THE MAPS WERE

REDEEMED IN JUNE 2001, AT A LIQUIDATION

PREFERENCE OF $250,000 PER SHARE, PLUS

PREMIUM AND ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, 30 MILLION SHARES

OF CHEVRONTEXACOS AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED

COMMON STOCK WERE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE

UNDER THE CHEVRONTEXACO CORPORATION

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), WHICH WAS

APPROVED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS IN 1990.

THROUGH THE END OF 2003, ALL OF THE PLANS

COMMON STOCK REQUIREMENTS WERE MET FROM THE

COMPANYS TREASURY STOCK, AND THERE HAD BEEN

NO ISSUANCES OF RESERVED SHARES.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

CHEVRONTEXACO IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS

RELATED TO PRICE VOLATILITY OF CRUDE OIL,

REFINED PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS AND REFINERY

FEEDSTOCK.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE COMMODITY

INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THIS EXPOSURE ON A

SMALL PORTION OF ITS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING.

FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF

CRUDE OIL; FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES FOR COMPANY

REFINERIES; CRUDE OIL AND REFINED PRODUCTS

INVENTORIES; AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS TO

SELL NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

THE COMPANY ALSO USES DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS FOR LIMITED TRADING

PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A POLICY OF

REQUIRING THAT AN INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND

DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT GOVERN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK.

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTION, BILATERAL COLLATERAL

ARRANGEMENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED. WHEN THE

COMPANY IS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE

OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTION WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY

AND ALSO HAS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE NETTING

AGREEMENT WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, THE NET

MARK-TO-MARKET EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE

NETTING OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE

EXPOSURES WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY AND A

REASONABLE MEASURE OF THE COMPANYS CREDIT

RISK. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO USE

OTHER NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN

COUNTERPARTIES WITH WHICH IT CONDUCTS

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE OUTSTANDING

CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AS ACCOUNTS AND NOTES

INTEREST RATES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL

STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK

ON ITS DEBT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS,

NET CASH SETTLEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED-RATE AND

FLOATING-RATE INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED

BY REFERENCE TO AGREED NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL

AMOUNTS. INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FIXED-RATE DEBT

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES,

WHEREAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE DEBT

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE

SHEET WITH RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES

REFLECTED IN INCOME.

DURING 2003, NO NEW SWAPS WERE

INITIATED. AT YEAR-END 2003, THE INTEREST

RATE SWAPS OUTSTANDING RELATED TO FIXED-RATE

DEBT, AND THEIR WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY

WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.6 YEARS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS

ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OR

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WITH GAINS AND LOSSES

REPORTED DIRECTLY IN INCOME AS PART OF

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE. THESE

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES ARE DERIVED EITHER

FROM QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR, IF NOT

AVAILABLE, THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE FAIR VALUES

REFLECT THE CASH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

RECEIVED OR PAID IF THE INSTRUMENTS WERE

SETTLED AT YEAR-END.

LONG-TERM DEBT OF $7,229 AND $7,296

HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $7,709 AND

$7,971 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY.

FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, THE

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF $665 AND

$665 HAD ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF $65

AND $70 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

U.S. DOLLAR MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN

DOMESTIC AND OFFSHORE PORTFOLIOS.

EURODOLLAR BONDS, FLOATING-RATE NOTES, TIME

DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE THE

PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS HELD. CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HAD FAIR VALUES

OF $3,803 AND $2,506 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. OF THESE BALANCES,

$2,803 AND $1,682 AT THE RESPECTIVE

YEAR-ENDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH

EQUIVALENTS THAT HAD AVERAGE MATURITIES

UNDER 90 DAYS. THE REMAINDER, CLASSIFIED AS

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, HAD AVERAGE

MATURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY 3.5 YEARS.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS,

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. THE

COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PLACED

WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS. THIS DIVERSIFIED

INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE BOTH TO CREDIT RISK AND TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. SIMILAR

STANDARDS OF DIVERSITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS

ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANYS COUNTERPARTIES

IN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE TRADE RECEIVABLE BALANCES,

REFLECTING THE COMPANYS DIVERSIFIED

SOURCES OF REVENUE, ARE DISPERSED AMONG THE

COMPANYS BROAD CUSTOMER BASE WORLDWIDE. AS

A CONSEQUENCE, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

RISK ARE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY

ASSESSES THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF ITS

CUSTOMERS. WHEN THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF A

CUSTOMER IS NOT CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT,

LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE THE PRINCIPAL

SECURITY OBTAINED TO SUPPORT LINES OF

CREDIT.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY NOTES AND PREFERRED

STOCK

AT THE BEGINNING OF 2003, THE COMPANY

HELD $1,500 AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

DYNEGY SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH WAS

DUE FOR REDEMPTION AT PAR VALUE IN NOVEMBER

2003. IN AUGUST, THE COMPANY EXCHANGED ITS

PREFERRED STOCK FOR $225 IN CASH, $225 FACE

VALUE OF DYNEGY

JUNIOR UNSECURED SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2016

AND $400 FACE VALUE OF DYNEGY SERIES C

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WITH A STATED

MATURITY OF 2033.

THE COMPANY RECORDED THE JUNIOR NOTES

AND SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK ON THE DATE OF

EXCHANGE AT THEIR FAIR VALUES OF $170 AND

$270, RESPECTIVELY, FOR A TOTAL OF $440.

TOGETHER WITH THE $225 CASH, THE TOTAL

AMOUNT RECORDED ON THE DATE OF EXCHANGE WAS

$665. A GAIN OF $365 WAS INCLUDED IN NET OF INCOME AT THAT DATE FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE $665 FAIR VALUE

RECEIVED AND THE NET BALANCE SHEET AMOUNT OF

$300 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERIES B SHARES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES OF THE JUNIOR NOTES AND SERIES C

SHARES TOTALED $530. THE $90 DIFFERENCE FROM

THE $440 RECORDED IN AUGUST WAS RECORDED TO

INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES, WITH AN

OFFSETTING AMOUNT IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME. FUTURE TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NEW SECURITIES

LIKEWISE WILL BE REPORTED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, IF ANY

FUTURE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE

OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, A CHARGE AGAINST

INCOME IN THE PERIOD WOULD BE RECORDED.

INTEREST THAT ACCRUES ON THE NOTES AND

DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON THE PREFERRED STOCK IS

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME EACH PERIOD.

LITIGATION

UNOCAL PATENT

CHEVRON, TEXACO AND FOUR

OTHER OIL COMPANIES (REFINERS) FILED SUIT

IN 1995, CONTESTING THE VALIDITY OF A

PATENT (393 PATENT) GRANTED TO UNOCAL

CORPORATION (UNOCAL) FOR CERTAIN

REFORMULATED GASOLINE BLENDS.

CHEVRONTEXACO SELLS REFORMULATED GASOLINES

IN CALIFORNIA IN CERTAIN MONTHS OF THE

YEAR.

IN MARCH 2000, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT UPHELD A

SEPTEMBER 1998 DISTRICT COURT DECISION THAT

UNOCALS PATENT WAS VALID AND

ENFORCEABLE AND ASSESSED DAMAGES OF 5.75

CENTS PER GALLON FOR GASOLINE PRODUCED

DURING THE SUMMER OF 1996 THAT INFRINGED ON

THE CLAIMS OF THE PATENT.

IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE U.S. SUPREME

COURT CONCLUDED IT WOULD NOT REVIEW THE

LOWER COURTS RULING, AND THE CASE WAS SENT

BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR AN

ACCOUNTING OF ALL INFRINGING GASOLINE

PRODUCED AFTER AUGUST 1, 1996. THE DISTRICT

COURT RULED THAT THE PER-GALLON DAMAGES

AWARDED BY THE JURY ARE LIMITED TO

INFRINGEMENT THAT OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA

ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, THE U.S. PATENT AND

TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) GRANTED THREE

PETITIONS BY THE REFINERS TO RE-EXAMINE THE

VALIDITY OF UNOCALS 393 PATENT AND HAS

TWICE REJECTED ALL OF THE CLAIMS IN THE

393 PATENT. THOSE REJECTIONS HAVE BEEN

APPEALED BY UNOCAL TO THE USPTO BOARD OF

APPEALS. THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE REQUESTED

FURTHER BRIEFING AND ADVISED THAT SHE WOULD

NOT ENTER A FINAL JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE

UNTIL THE USPTO HAD COMPLETED ITS

RE-EXAMINATION OF THE 393 PATENT.

DURING 2002 AND 2003, THE USPTO GRANTED

TWO PETITIONS FOR RE-EXAMINATION OF ANOTHER

UNOCAL PATENT, THE 126 PATENT. THE USPTO

HAS REJECTED THE VALIDITY OF THE CLAIMS OF

THE 126 PATENT, WHICH COULD AFFECT A

LARGER SHARE OF U.S. GASOLINE PRODUCTION.

SEPARATELY, IN MARCH 2003, THE FEDERAL TRADE

COMMISSION (FTC)

FS-36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 10. LITIGATION  CONTINUED

FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST UNOCAL ALLEGING

THAT ITS CONDUCT DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE

PATENTS WAS IN VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST LAW.

IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

JUDGE DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT BROUGHT BY

THE FTC. THE FTC HAS APPEALED THE DECISION.

UNOCAL HAS OBTAINED ADDITIONAL PATENTS

THAT COULD AFFECT A LARGER SHARE OF U.S.

GASOLINE PRODUCTION. CHEVRONTEXACO BELIEVES

THESE ADDITIONAL PATENTS ARE INVALID,

UNENFORCEABLE AND/OR NOT INFRINGED. THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL EXPOSURE IN THE EVENT

OF UNFAVORABLE CONCLUSIONS TO THE PATENT

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY REVIEWS MAY

INCLUDE ROYALTIES, PLUS INTEREST, FOR

PRODUCTION OF GASOLINE THAT IS PROVED TO

HAVE INFRINGED THE PATENTS. THE COMPETITIVE

AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS ON THE COMPANYS REFINING AND MARKETING OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH

PRESENTLY INDETERMINABLE, COULD BE MATERIAL.

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS BEEN ACCRUING IN THE

NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS ANY FUTURE

ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR POTENTIAL

INFRINGEMENT OF THE 393 PATENT COVERED BY

THE 1998 TRIAL COURTS RULING.

IN 2000, PRIOR TO THE MERGER, CHEVRON

AND TEXACO MADE PAYMENTS TO UNOCAL

TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION FOR THE

ORIGINAL COURT RULING, INCLUDING INTEREST

AND FEES.

MTBE

ANOTHER ISSUE INVOLVING THE COMPANY IS

THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRYS USE OF METHYL

TERTIARY BUTYL ETHER (MTBE) AS A GASOLINE

ADDITIVE AND ITS POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL

IMPACT THROUGH SEEPAGE INTO GROUNDWATER.

ALONG WITH OTHER OIL COMPANIES, THE

COMPANY IS A PARTY TO MORE THAN 60 LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF THE

CHEMICAL MTBE IN CERTAIN OXYGENATED

GASOLINES. THESE ACTIONS MAY REQUIRE THE

COMPANY TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE

ALLEGED EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR

RELEASE OF MTBE BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER

PARTIES. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS

RELATED TO THE USE OF MTBE, INCLUDING

PERSONAL-INJURY CLAIMS, MAY BE FILED IN

THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANYS ULTIMATE EXPOSURE

RELATED TO THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IS NOT

CURRENTLY DETERMINABLE, BUT COULD BE

MATERIAL TO NET INCOME IN ANY ONE PERIOD.

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS REDUCED THE USE OF MTBE

IN GASOLINE IT MANUFACTURES IN THE UNITED

STATES, INCLUDING THE COMPLETE PHASE-OUT OF

MTBE IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE END OF 2003.

CAPACITY. AS A PART OF THE 2001 TRANSACTION,

THE COMPANY PAID $210 OF THE $420

OBLIGATION. AN ADDITIONAL $210 WAS PAID IN

2003 TO SETTLE THE REMAINING OBLIGATION. THE

$420 WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT, AS THE COMPANY

BELIEVED, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, THAT

ITS FULL PAYMENT WOULD BE MADE.

EQUILON ENTERPRISES LLC AND MOTIVA

CALTEX AUSTRALIA LTD.

CHEVRONTEXACO HAS A 50

PERCENT EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN CALTEX

PERCENT OF CAL IS PUBLICLY OWNED. DURING

2002, THE COMPANY WROTE DOWN ITS INVESTMENT

IN CAL BY $136 TO ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FAIR VALUE OF

CHEVRONTEXACOS SHARE OF CAL COMMON STOCK

WAS $465. THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN CAL WAS

APPROXIMATELY $90 LOWER THAN THE AMOUNT OF

UNDERLYING EQUITY IN CAL NET ASSETS.

CHEVRONTEXACO OWNS 50 PERCENT OF CPCHEM,

FORMED IN JULY 2000 WHEN CHEVRON MERGED

MOST OF ITS PETROCHEMICALS BUSINESSES WITH

THOSE OF PHILLIPS PETROLEUM COMPANY.

INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY COMMON STOCK

WAS APPROXIMATELY $150. THIS AMOUNT WAS

ABOUT $425 BELOW THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE

INTEREST IN DYNEGYS UNDERLYING NET ASSETS.

THIS DIFFERENCE RESULTED FROM WRITE-DOWNS OF

THE INVESTMENT IN 2002 FOR DECLINES IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES BELOW THE

COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE THAT WERE DEEMED TO

BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE APPROXIMATE

$425 DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE

EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC DYNEGY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BASED UPON THE

COMPANYS ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS

GIVING RISE TO THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF THE

DYNEGY SHARES. THE COMPANYS EQUITY SHARE OF

DYNEGYS REPORTED EARNINGS IS ADJUSTED

QUARTERLY TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THESE ALLOCATED VALUES AND DYNEGYS

HISTORICAL BOOK VALUES. THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGYS COMMON STOCK AT DECEMBER 31, 2003

WAS $415.

NOTE 16. TAXES  CONTINUED

IN 2003, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS

ABOUT 42 PERCENT. THE DECREASE IN THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2003 COMPARED WITH

2002 RESULTED FROM A LOWER PROPORTION OF

INTERNATIONAL TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH IS TAXED

AT HIGHER RATES THAN U.S. TAXABLE INCOME,

AND THE ABSENCE IN 2003 OF THE 2002 TAX

EFFECTS OF THE CAPITAL LOSSES DISCUSSED IN

THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

THE INCREASE IN THE 2002 EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE FROM 2001 WAS DUE TO A NUMBER OF

FACTORS. ONE REASON WAS THAT U.S.

BEFORE-TAX INCOME (GENERALLY SUBJECT TO A

LOWER TAX RATE) WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY

SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL BEFORE-TAX

INCOME IN 2002. ANOTHER MAJOR FACTOR WAS

THAT THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE INVESTMENTS IN

DYNEGY AND CALTEX AUSTRALIA WERE CAPITAL

LOSSES FOR WHICH NO OFFSETTING CAPITAL

GAINS WERE AVAILABLE.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS DEFERRED TAXES

ON A TAX-JURISDICTION BASIS AND CLASSIFIES

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO

FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRY-FORWARDS, TAX LOSS

WHICH NO BENEFIT IS EXPECTED TO BE

REALIZED. THE DECREASE IN THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCE RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE

EXPIRATION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND TO

THE RELEASE OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON

CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES, WHICH

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WILL NOW BE REALIZED.

TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS EXIST IN MANY

SOME OF THESE TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS DO NOT

SHORT-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTE 8 BEGINNING ON

PAGE FS-33 FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

COMPANYS DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD

$4,285 OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH

BANKS WORLDWIDE, WHICH PERMIT THE COMPANY TO

REFINANCE SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS ON A

LONG-TERM BASIS. THE FACILITIES SUPPORT THE

COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS.

INTEREST ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERMS OF

SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS MAY BE BASED ON THE

LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE OR BANK PRIME

RATE. NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER

THESE CREDIT AGREEMENTS DURING 2003 OR AT

YEAR-END.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, THE

COMPANY CLASSIFIED $4,285 AND $4,110,

RESPECTIVELY, OF SHORT-TERM DEBT AS

LONG-TERM. SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS

IS NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE USE OF

WORKING CAPITAL IN 2004, AS THE COMPANY HAS

BOTH THE INTENT AND THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE THIS DEBT ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION

NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES (FIN 46). FIN 46 AMENDED ARB 51,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND

ESTABLISHED STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING UNDER

WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES A VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED BY ITS

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FIN 46 ALSO REQUIRES

DISCLOSURES ABOUT VIES THAT THE COMPANY IS

NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE BUT IN WHICH IT

HAS A SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST. ON

DECEMBER 17, 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46-R,

WHICH NOT ONLY INCLUDED AMENDMENTS TO FIN

46, BUT ALSO REQUIRED APPLICATION OF THE

INTERPRETATION TO ALL AFFECTED ENTITIES NO

LATER THAN MARCH 31, 2004, FOR CALENDAR-YEAR

REPORTING COMPANIES. HOWEVER, COMPANIES MUST

HAVE APPLIED THE INTERPRETATION TO

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES BY DECEMBER 31,

2003. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46-R AS IT RELATES

TO SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY, AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT A

MATERIAL IMPACT UPON ITS FULL ADOPTION OF

THE INTERPRETATION AS OF MARCH 31, 2004.

NOTE 20.

ACCOUNTING FOR MINERAL INTERESTS INVESTMENT

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

HAS QUESTIONED CERTAIN PUBLIC COMPANIES IN

THE OIL, GAS AND MINING INDUSTRIES AS TO THE

PROPER ACCOUNTING FOR, AND REPORTING OF

ACQUIRED CONTRACTUAL MINERAL INTERESTS UNDER

FASB STATEMENT NO. 141, BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS (FAS 141), AND FASB STATEMENT

NO. 142, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(FAS 142). THESE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BECAME

EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JULY 1, 2001,

AND JANUARY 1, 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

AT ISSUE IS WHETHER SUCH MINERAL

INTEREST COSTS SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF PROPERTIES, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT OR AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO CLASSIFY THESE

COSTS AS PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

AND APPORTION THEM TO EXPENSE IN FUTURE

PERIODS UNDER THE COMPANYS EXISTING

ACCOUNTING POLICY UNTIL AUTHORITATIVE

GUIDANCE IS PROVIDED.

FOR CHEVRONTEXACO, THE NET BOOK VALUES

OF THIS CATEGORY OF MINERAL INTEREST

INVESTMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002,

WERE $3.8 BILLION AND $4.1 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. IF RECLASSIFICATION OF THESE

BALANCES BECOMES NECESSARY, THE COMPANYS

STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND CASH FLOWS WOULD

NOT BE AFFECTED. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WOULD BE REQUIRED AS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE

ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

NOTE 21.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

PLANS FOR MANY EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDES FOR

CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS

FOR SOME ACTIVE AND QUALIFYING RETIRED

EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY FUNDS ONLY

THOSE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WHERE LEGAL

FUNDING IS REQUIRED. IN THE UNITED STATES,

THIS INCLUDES ALL QUALIFIED TAX-EXEMPT

PLANS SUBJECT TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) MINIMUM FUNDING

STANDARD. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

FS-42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 21. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  CONTINUED

TYPICALLY FUND DOMESTIC NONQUALIFIED

TAX-EXEMPT PENSION PLANS OR INTERNATIONAL

PENSION PLANS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO LEGAL

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE CONTRIBUTIONS

TO THESE PENSION PLANS MAY BE LESS TAX EFFICIENT AND INVESTMENT RETURNS MAY BE LESS

ATTRACTIVE THAN THE COMPANYS OTHER

INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES.

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR

MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFITS ARE LIMITED TO

THE LESSER OF ACTUAL MEDICAL AND DENTAL

CLAIMS OR A DEFINED FIXED PER-CAPITA

AMOUNT. LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE PAID BY

THE COMPANY AND ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE

BASED ON ACTUAL PLAN EXPERIENCE.

THE COMPANY USES A MEASUREMENT DATE OF

DECEMBER 31 TO VALUE ITS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE ACT) BECAME

LAW.

THE ACT INTRODUCES A PRESCRIPTION DRUG

BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE (MEDICARE PART D)

AS WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF

RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS, SUCH AS

THE COMPANY, THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT

IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO

MEDICARE PART D. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE LEGISLATION TO

ITS BENEFIT PLAN DESIGN AND ACCOUNTING.

THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 106-1,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003,

TO DEFER RECOGNITION OF THE ACT IN THE

COMPANYS MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND NET

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES. SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR

THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY IS PENDING AND, WHEN

ISSUED, COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED INFORMATION.

DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WERE UPDATED QUARTERLY FOR THE MAIN U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A RIGOROUS PROCESS

TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS. THESE

ESTIMATES ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ACTUAL

HISTORICAL ASSET-CLASS RETURNS AND ADVICE

FROM EXTERNAL ACTUARIAL FIRMS WHILE

INCORPORATING SPECIFIC ASSET-CLASS RISK

FACTORS. ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE REGULARLY

UPDATED USING PENSION PLAN ASSET/LIABILITY

STUDIES, AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF LONG-TERM RATES OF

RETURN ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE STUDIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE ESTIMATED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION

PLAN ASSETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 70

PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLAN

ASSETS, WAS 7.8 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH RATES

OF 7.8 AND 9.0 PERCENT AT THE END OF 2002

AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-END

MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF U.S. PENSION PLAN

ASSETS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF PENSION

EXPENSE WAS BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES IN

THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS, AS OPPOSED TO

THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS

UNDER U.S. ACCOUNTING RULES. MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE THREE-MONTH TIME PERIOD LONG

ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF

DISTORTIONS FROM DAY-TO-DAY MARKET

VOLATILITY AND YET STILL BE CONTEMPORANEOUS

TO THE END OF THE YEAR.

OTHER REGULAR SALARIED EMPLOYEES OF THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WHO HOLD

POSITIONS OF SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY.

THE PLANS WERE EXPANDED IN 2002 TO INCLUDE

FORMER EMPLOYEES OF TEXACO AND CALTEX. THE

MIP IS AN ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PLAN THAT

LINKS AWARDS TO PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE CASH AWARDS MAY BE

DEFERRED BY CONVERSION TO STOCK UNITS OR

OTHER INVESTMENT FUND ALTERNATIVES. AWARDS

UNDER THE LTIP MAY TAKE THE FORM OF, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, STOCK OPTIONS,

RESTRICTED STOCK, STOCK UNITS AND NONSTOCK

BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

IN 1998,

CHEVRON GRANTED TO ALL ITS ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES AN OPTION THAT VARIED FROM 100 TO

300 SHARES OF STOCK OR EQUIVALENTS,

DEPENDENT ON THE EMPLOYEES SALARY OR JOB

GRADE. THESE OPTIONS VESTED AFTER TWO YEARS

IN FEBRUARY 2000. OPTIONS FOR 4,820,800

SHARES WERE AWARDED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF

$76.3125 PER SHARE. OUTSTANDING OPTION

SHARES WERE 2,366,311 AT THE END OF 2001.

IN 2002, EXERCISES OF 295,985 AND

FORFEITURES OF 61,151 REDUCED THE

OUTSTANDING OPTION SHARES TO 2,009,175 AT

THE END OF THE YEAR. IN 2003, EXERCISES OF

11,630 AND FORFEITURES OF 61,050 REDUCED

THE OUTSTANDING OPTION SHARES TO 1,936,495

AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE OPTIONS EXPIRE

IN FEBRUARY 2008. THE COMPANY RECORDED

EXPENSE (CREDIT) OF $2, $(2) AND $1 FOR

THESE OPTIONS IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION SHARE ON

THE DATE OF GRANT UNDER FAS NO. 123 WAS

ESTIMATED AT $19.08 USING THE AVERAGE

RESULTS OF BLACK-SCHOLES MODELS FOR THE

PRECEDING 10 YEARS. THE 10-YEAR AVERAGES OF

EACH ASSUMPTION USED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES

MODELS WERE: A RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF

7.0 PERCENT, A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 4.2

PERCENT, AN EXPECTED LIFE OF SEVEN YEARS AND

A VOLATILITY OF 24.7 PERCENT.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

STOCK OPTIONS

GRANTED UNDER THE LTIP EXTEND FOR 10 YEARS

FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE WITH

OPTIONS GRANTED IN JUNE 2002, ONE THIRD OF

THE OPTIONS VEST ON EACH OF THE FIRST,

SECOND AND THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE

OF GRANT. PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE, OPTIONS

GRANTED BY CHEVRON VESTED ONE YEAR AFTER THE

DATE OF GRANT, WHEREAS OPTIONS GRANTED BY

TEXACO UNDER ITS SIP VESTED OVER A TWO-YEAR

PERIOD AT A RATE OF 50 PERCENT EACH YEAR.

THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT MAY BE

GRANTED EACH YEAR IS 1 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL

OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS OF

JANUARY 1 OF SUCH YEAR.

ON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IN

OCTOBER 2001, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS GRANTED

UNDER THE TEXACO SIP WERE CONVERTED TO

CHEVRONTEXACO OPTIONS AT THE MERGER

EXCHANGE RATE OF 0.77. THESE OPTIONS

RETAINED A PROVISION FOR RESTORED OPTIONS.

THIS FEATURE ENABLES A PARTICIPANT WHO

EXERCISES A STOCK OPTION BY EXCHANGING

PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED COMMON STOCK OR WHO

HAS SHARES WITHHELD TO SATISFY TAX

WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS TO RECEIVE NEW

OPTIONS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES

EXCHANGED OR WITHHELD. THE RESTORED OPTIONS

ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE SIX MONTHS AFTER THE

DATE OF GRANT, AND THE EXERCISE PRICE IS THE

FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK ON THE

DAY THE RESTORED OPTION IS GRANTED.

RESTRICTED SHARES GRANTED UNDER THE FORMER

TEXACO PLAN CONTAINED A PERFORMANCE ELEMENT

THAT HAD TO BE SATISFIED IN ORDER FOR ALL

OR A SPECIFIED PORTION OF THE SHARES TO

VEST. UPON THE MERGER, ALL RESTRICTED SHARES

BECAME VESTED AND CONVERTED TO

CHEVRONTEXACO SHARES AT THE MERGER EXCHANGE

RATIO OF 0.77. APART FROM THE RESTORED

OPTIONS, NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED

UNDER THE FORMER TEXACO PLANS. NO AMOUNT FOR

THESE PLANS WAS CHARGED TO COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IN 2003 OR 2002; $110 OF EXPENSE WAS

RECORDED IN 2001. RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE

SHARES GRANTED UNDER SIP IN 2001 TOTALED

GUARANTEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDED

GUARANTEES, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OF $917 FOR NOTES AND OTHER

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND $256 FOR THIRD PARTIES, AS

LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES. OF THE $917

GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO AFFILIATES, $716 RELATED TO BORROWINGS FOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THESE GUARANTEES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO

ACHIEVE LOWER INTEREST RATES AND GENERALLY COVER THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD OF THE

CAPITAL PROJECTS. APPROXIMATELY 75 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL

EXPIRE IN 2004, WITH THE REMAINING GUARANTEES EXPIRING BY THE END OF 2015.

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL

THE GUARANTEE SHOULD AN AFFILIATE BE IN DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN TERMS, GENERALLY

FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS DISCLOSED. THERE ARE NO RECOURSE PROVISIONS, AND NO ASSETS

ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THESE GUARANTEES.

ANOTHER $201 OF THE AFFILIATE GUARANTEES RELATED TO OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION

SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN CERTAIN OPERATIONS, TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY TO THE GUARANTEED PARTIES AND IN CONNECTION WITH COMPANY MARKETING

PROGRAMS. NO AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES ARE

RECORDED AS LIABILITIES. ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL

EXPIRE IN 2004, WITH THE REMAINDER EXPIRING AFTER 2004. THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES SHOULD AN ENTITY BE IN

DEFAULT OF ITS LOAN OR CONTRACT TERMS, GENERALLY FOR THE FULL AMOUNTS

DISCLOSED. APPROXIMATELY $100 OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE RECOURSE PROVISIONS, WHICH

ENABLE THE COMPANY TO RECOVER ANY PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

GUARANTEES FROM SECURITIES HELD OVER THE GUARANTEED PARTIES ASSETS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, CHEVRONTEXACO HAD OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES FOR

APPROXIMATELY $238 OF EQUILON DEBT AND LEASES. FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 2002

DISPOSITION OF ITS INTEREST IN EQUILON, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN INDEMNIFICATION FROM SHELL OIL COMPANY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE GUARANTEES. THE

COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR THESE GUARANTEES. APPROXIMATELY 50

PERCENT OF THE AMOUNTS GUARANTEED WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THE 2004-2008 PERIOD, WITH

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDED CERTAIN INDEMNITIES OF CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA TO SHELL OIL COMPANY (SHELL) AND SAUDI REFINING INC. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2002 SALE OF THE COMPANYS INTERESTS

IN THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE INDEMNITIES COVER GENERAL CONTINGENT LIABILITIES,

INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNOCAL PATENT LITIGATION. THE COMPANY WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SHOULD THE INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES BECOME ACTUAL LOSSES

AND COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE MAXIMUM FUTURE PAYMENTS OF $300. THE COMPANY HAS

PAID APPROXIMATELY $28 UNDER THESE CONTINGENCIES AND HAS DISPUTED APPROXIMATELY

$34 IN CLAIMS SUBMITTED BY SHELL UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. SHELL REQUESTED

ARBITRATION OF THIS DISPUTE, AND IT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN MID-2004. THERE ARE

NO RECOURSE PROVISIONS ENABLING RECOVERY OF ANY AMOUNTS FROM THIRD PARTIES NOR

ARE ANY ASSETS HELD AS COLLATERAL. WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF THE FEBRUARY 2002

SALE, AT THE BUYERS OPTION, THE COMPANY ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE

CERTAIN ASSETS FROM SHELL FOR THEIR NET BOOK VALUE, AS DETERMINED AT THE TIME

DE MINIMIS

PRICE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO ASSETS ORIGINALLY CONTRIBUTED BY TEXACO TO

THE EQUILON AND MOTIVA JOINT VENTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED

PRIOR TO THE FORMATION OF EQUILON AND MOTIVA OR THAT OCCURRED DURING THE

PERIODS OF CHEVRONTEXACOS OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURES. IN

GENERAL, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE

INDEMNITIES MUST HAVE ARISEN PRIOR TO DECEMBER 2001. CLAIMS RELATING TO EQUILON

NOTE 23. OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  CONTINUED

THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE FOR THE INDEMNITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE TO BE NET OF

AMOUNTS RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS AND OTHERS AND NET OF LIABILITIES

RECORDED BY EQUILON OR MOTIVA PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, FOR ANY SPECIFIC

INCIDENT.

SECURITIZATION

THE COMPANY SECURITIZES CERTAIN RETAIL AND TRADE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE IN ITS DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS THROUGH THE USE OF QUALIFYING SPECIAL

PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES). AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, APPROXIMATELY $1,000,

REPRESENTING ABOUT 11 PERCENT OF CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL CURRENT ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLES BALANCE, WERE SECURITIZED. CHEVRONTEXACOS TOTAL ESTIMATED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WAS

APPROXIMATELY $75. THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT OF ACCELERATING

CHEVRONTEXACOS COLLECTION OF THE SECURITIZED AMOUNTS. IN THE EVENT OF THE SPES

EXPERIENCING MAJOR DEFAULTS IN THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES, CHEVRONTEXACO

BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD HAVE NO LOSS EXPOSURE CONNECTED WITH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTMENTS IN THESE SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENTS.

LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT

AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE

CERTAIN OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO LONG-TERM UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS, THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS, AND TAKE-OR-PAY

AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO SUPPLIERS FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE

AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS PIPELINE AND STORAGE

CAPACITY, UTILITIES, AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, TO BE USED OR SOLD IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED PAYMENTS

UNDER THESE VARIOUS COMMITMENTS ARE 2004  $1,200; 2005  $1,100; 2006 

$1,000; 2007  $1,000; 2008  $1,000; 2009 AND AFTER  $1,900. TOTAL PAYMENTS

UNDER THE AGREEMENTS WERE $1,400 IN 2003, $1,200 IN 2002 AND $1,500 IN 2001.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAKE-OR-PAY AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE

APPROXIMATELY 55,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF REFINED PRODUCTS FROM AN EQUITY AFFILIATE REFINER IN THAILAND. THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

FINANCING OF A REFINERY OWNED BY THE AFFILIATE AND EXPIRES IN 2009. THE

FUTURE ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT ARE: 2004  $700; 2005  $800;

2006  $800; 2007  $800; 2008  $800 AND 2009  $800.

MINORITY INTERESTS

THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PREFERRED SHARES OF

SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS MINORITY INTEREST. TEXACO

CAPITAL LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, HAS ISSUED $65 OF DEFERRED

PREFERRED SHARES, SERIES C. DIVIDENDS AMOUNTING TO $60 ON SERIES C, AT A RATE

OF 7.17 PERCENT COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY, WILL BE PAID AT THE REDEMPTION DATE IN

FEBRUARY 2005, UNLESS EARLIER REDEMPTION OCCURS. EARLY REDEMPTION MAY RESULT

UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIC EVENTS. MVP PRODUCTION INC., A

SUBSIDIARY, REDEEMED VARIABLE RATE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED SHARES OF $75 OWNED BY

ONE MINORITY HOLDER DURING 2003.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY

TO TAKE ACTION TO CORRECT OR AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR

RELEASE OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING MTBE, BY THE

COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. SUCH CONTINGENCIES MAY EXIST FOR VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING BUT

NOT LIMITED TO: SUPERFUND SITES AND REFINERIES, OIL FIELDS, SERVICE STATIONS,

TERMINALS, AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AREAS, WHETHER OPERATING, CLOSED OR SOLD. THE

AMOUNT OF SUCH FUTURE COST IS INDETERMINABLE DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE UNKNOWN

MAGNITUDE OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION, THE UNKNOWN TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS

LIABILITY IN PROPORTION TO OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH

SUCH COSTS ARE RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED

FOR KNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE,

THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS MAY BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THESE

COSTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

LIQUIDITY. ALSO, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE SUCH

EXPENDITURES HAVE HAD, OR WILL HAVE, ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

COMPETITIVE POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHER U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM OR

CHEMICALS CONCERNS.

SOUTH KOREA. THE COMPANYS CASPIAN PIPELINE CONSORTIUM (CPC) AFFILIATE

OPERATES IN RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS TENGIZCHEVROIL AFFILIATE

OPERATES IN KAZAKHSTAN. THE COMPANYS CHEVRON PHILLIPS CHEMICAL COMPANY LLC

AFFILIATE MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS A WIDE RANGE OF PETROCHEMICALS ON A

WORLDWIDE BASIS, WITH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO

RICO, SINGAPORE, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, MEXICO AND BELGIUM.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, CAN BE

AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE

VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. AS HAS

OCCURRED IN THE PAST, ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE

PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANYS PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OWNED BUSINESSES AND/OR

TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TAXES OR ROYALTIES ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, HOST GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS, CONTROLS AND

TAXES, AND IN OTHERS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS HAVE EXISTED THAT MAY THREATEN THE

SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THOSE COUNTRIES.

INTERNAL UNREST OR STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN A HOST GOVERNMENT AND THE COMPANY

OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS

HAVE, AT TIMES, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE COMPANYS RELATED OPERATIONS AND

RESULTS AND ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN EVALUATING THE LEVEL OF

CURRENT AND FUTURE ACTIVITY IN SUCH COUNTRIES.

EQUITY REDETERMINATION

FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING OPERATIONS, OWNERSHIP

AGREEMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR PERIODIC REASSESSMENTS OF EQUITY INTERESTS IN

ESTIMATED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER, MAY

RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD. ONE SUCH EQUITY REDETERMINATION PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDER WAY SINCE 1996

FOR CHEVRONTEXACOS INTERESTS IN FOUR PRODUCING ZONES AT THE

FS-48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 23. OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  CONTINUED

NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AT ELK HILLS, CALIFORNIA, FOR THE TIME WHEN THE

REMAINING INTERESTS IN THESE ZONES WERE OWNED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.

A WIDE RANGE REMAINS FOR A POSSIBLE NET SETTLEMENT AMOUNT FOR THE FOUR ZONES.

CHEVRONTEXACO CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS MAXIMUM POSSIBLE NET BEFORE-TAX LIABILITY

AT APPROXIMATELY $200. AT THE SAME TIME, A POSSIBLE MAXIMUM NET AMOUNT THAT

COULD BE OWED TO CHEVRONTEXACO IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $50. THE TIMING OF THE

SETTLEMENT AND THE EXACT AMOUNT WITHIN THIS RANGE OF ESTIMATES IS UNCERTAIN.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CHEVRONTEXACO RECEIVES CLAIMS FROM AND SUBMITS CLAIMS TO

CUSTOMERS, TRADING PARTNERS, U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY BODIES,

HOST GOVERNMENTS, CONTRACTORS, INSURERS, AND SUPPLIERS. THE AMOUNTS OF THESE

CLAIMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND TAKE LENGTHY

PERIODS TO RESOLVE.

THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES ALSO CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THEIR

OPERATIONS AND MAY CLOSE, ABANDON, SELL, EXCHANGE, ACQUIRE OR RESTRUCTURE

ASSETS TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC

BENEFITS AND TO IMPROVE

COMPETITIVENESS AND PROFITABILITY. THESE ACTIVITIES, INDIVIDUALLY OR TOGETHER,

MAY RESULT IN GAINS OR LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTE 24.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IS BASED UPON NET INCOME LESS PREFERRED STOCK

DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS AND INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF DEFERRALS OF SALARY AND OTHER

COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT ARE INVESTED IN CHEVRONTEXACO STOCK UNITS BY CERTAIN

OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANYS SHARE OF STOCK

TRANSACTIONS OF AFFILIATES, WHICH, UNDER THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING RULES MAY

BE RECORDED DIRECTLY TO THE COMPANYS RETAINED EARNINGS INSTEAD OF NET INCOME.

NOTE 25.

FAS 143  ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143), EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2003. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION THAT IS RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND THE LIABILITY

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF

THESE ASSETS REQUIRE RECOGNITION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) THE PRESENT

VALUE OF A LIABILITY AND OFFSETTING ASSET FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

(ARO), (2) THE SUBSEQUENT ACCRETION OF THAT LIABILITY AND DEPRECIATION OF THE

ASSET, AND (3) THE PERIODIC REVIEW OF THE ARO LIABILITY ESTIMATES AND DISCOUNT

RATES. FAS 143 PRIMARILY AFFECTS THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCING ASSETS AND DIFFERS IN SEVERAL RESPECTS FROM PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING UNDER

FAS 19, FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

COMPANIES.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET AFTER-TAX

CHARGE OF $200 FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF FAS 143, INCLUDING

THE COMPANYS SHARE OF AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE

CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT ALSO INCREASED THE FOLLOWING BALANCE SHEET

CATEGORIES: PROPERTIES, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, $2,568; ACCRUED LIABILITIES,

$115; AND DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER NONCURRENT OBLIGATIONS, $2,674.

NONCURRENT DEFERRED INCOME TAXES DECREASED BY $21.

UPON ADOPTION, NO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO RETIRE REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

(DOWNSTREAM) AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS GENERALLY WERE RECOGNIZED, AS

INDETERMINATE SETTLEMENT DATES FOR THE ASSET RETIREMENTS PREVENTED ESTIMATION

OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED ARO. THE COMPANY PERFORMS PERIODIC REVIEWS

OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR ANY CHANGES IN FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF A RETIREMENT OBLIGATION.

OTHER

THAN THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT NET CHARGE, THE EFFECT OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING

STANDARD ON NET INCOME IN 2003 WAS NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE

RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FAS 19 ACCOUNTING. INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION WERE $52 RELATED TO THE DEPRECIATION OF THE ARO

ASSET AND $132 RELATED TO THE ACCRETION OF THE ARO LIABILITY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES WHAT THE COMPANYS NET INCOME BEFORE

EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, NET INCOME AND RELATED PER SHARE AMOUNTS WOULD HAVE BEEN

IF THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 143 HAD BEEN APPLIED RETROACTIVELY.

$3.10 PER BASIC SHARE ($3.09  DILUTED) FOR 2001.

PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 143, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED A PROVISION

FOR ABANDONMENT THAT WAS PART OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND

AMORTIZATION. UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF FAS 143, THE PROVISION FOR ABANDONMENT

WAS REVERSED AND ARO LIABILITY WAS RECORDED. THE AMOUNT OF THE ABANDONMENT

RESERVE AT THE END OF EACH YEAR AND THE PROFORMA ARO LIABILITY WERE AS FOLLOWS.

TABLE V  RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED NET PROVED

UNDERGROUND OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND CHANGES

THERETO FOR THE YEARS 2003, 2002 AND 2001

ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. PROVED

RESERVES ARE ESTIMATED BY COMPANY ASSET

TEAMS COMPOSED OF EARTH SCIENTISTS AND

RESERVOIR ENGINEERS. THESE PROVED RESERVE

ESTIMATES ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY THE

COMPANYS RESERVES ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO

ENSURE THAT RIGOROUS PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS

AND THE RESERVES DEFINITIONS PRESCRIBED BY

THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE

COMPANY.

PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED

QUANTITIES THAT GEOLOGIC AND ENGINEERING

DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY

TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN

RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING CONDITIONS. DUE TO THE INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES AND THE LIMITED NATURE OF

RESERVOIR DATA, ESTIMATES OF UNDERGROUND

RESERVES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PROVED RESERVES DO NOT INCLUDE

ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES THAT MAY RESULT FROM

EXTENSIONS OF CURRENTLY PROVED AREAS OR

FROM APPLYING SECONDARY OR TERTIARY

RECOVERY PROCESSES NOT YET TESTED AND

DETERMINED TO BE ECONOMIC.

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THE

QUANTITIES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH

EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS.

NET RESERVES EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND

INTERESTS OWNED BY OTHERS AND REFLECT

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ROYALTY

OBLIGATIONS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE

ESTIMATE.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES, CHEVRONTEXACO HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATHABASCA

PROJECT. FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, CHEVRONTEXACO VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, U.S. SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATIONS DEFINE THESE RESERVES AS MINING-RELATED AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES. NET PROVED OIL SANDS RESERVES WERE 171 MILLION

BARRELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. PRODUCTION BEGAN IN LATE 2002.

THE OIL SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES, WHICH IS FOUND ON PAGE FS-58.

TABLE VI  STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED

FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS, RELATED TO THE

PRECEDING PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES, IS

CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF FAS NO. 69. ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCTION ARE COMPUTED BY

APPLYING YEAR-END PRICES FOR OIL AND GAS TO

YEAR-END QUANTITIES OF ESTIMATED NET PROVED

RESERVES. FUTURE PRICE CHANGES ARE LIMITED

TO THOSE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS IN EXISTENCE AT THE END OF EACH

REPORTING YEAR. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND

PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE ESTIMATED FUTURE

EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND

PRODUCE YEAR-END ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES

BASED ON YEAR-END COST INDICES, ASSUMING

CONTINUATION OF YEAR-END ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, AND INCLUDE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. ESTIMATED

FUTURE INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY

APPLYING APPROPRIATE YEAR-END STATUTORY TAX

RATES. THESE RATES REFLECT ALLOWABLE

DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS AND ARE APPLIED

TO ESTIMATED FUTURE PRETAX NET CASH FLOWS,

LESS THE TAX BASIS OF RELATED

ASSETS.

DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ARE

CALCULATED USING 10 PERCENT MIDPERIOD

DISCOUNT FACTORS. DISCOUNTING REQUIRES A

YEAR-BY-YEAR ESTIMATE OF WHEN FUTURE

EXPENDITURES WILL BE INCURRED AND WHEN

RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED DOES NOT

REPRESENT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE

COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR

VALUE OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

ESTIMATES OF PROVED RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE

IMPRECISE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS NEW

INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. MOREOVER,

PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE RESERVES, WHICH MAY

BECOME PROVED IN THE FUTURE, ARE EXCLUDED

FROM THE CALCULATIONS. THE ARBITRARY

VALUATION PRESCRIBED UNDER FAS NO. 69

REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE TIMING AND

AMOUNT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION

COSTS. THE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE AS OF

DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR AND SHOULD NOT BE

RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF THE

COMPANYS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUE OF ITS

OIL AND GAS RESERVES.
