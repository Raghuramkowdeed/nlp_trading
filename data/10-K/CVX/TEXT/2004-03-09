summary description of chevrontexaco
chevrontexaco corporation,1 a delaware
corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and
affiliates and provides administrative, financial and management
support to u.s. and foreign subsidiaries that engage in fully
integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, coal
mining, power and energy services. the company operates in the
united states and in more than 180 other countries. petroleum
operations consist of exploring for, developing and producing
crude oil and natural gas; refining crude oil into finished
petroleum products; marketing crude oil, natural gas and the
many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude
oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine
vessel, motor equipment and rail car. chemicals operations
include the manufacture and marketing, by an affiliate, of
commodity petrochemicals for industrial uses, and the
manufacture and marketing, by a consolidated subsidiary, of fuel
and lubricating oil additives.
in this report, exploration and production of
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas may be referred
to as e&p or upstream activities.
refining, marketing and transportation may be referred to as
rm&t or downstream activities. a
list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented on
pagese-4 and e-5 of this annual report on form10-k.
as of december31, 2003, chevrontexaco had 61,533 employees
(including 10,951 service station employees), down about 4,500
from year-end 2002. approximately 26,000, or 42percent, of
the companys employees were employed in u.s. operations,
of which approximately 3,400 were unionized.
overview of petroleum industry
petroleum industry operations and profitability
are influenced by many factors, over some of which individual
petroleum companies have little control. governmental policies,
particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the
environment, have a significant impact on petroleum activities,
regulating where and how companies conduct their operations and
formulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their
profits directly. prices for crude oil and natural gas,
petroleum products and petrochemicals are determined by supply
and demand for these commodities. the members of the
organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) are
typically the worlds swing producers of crude oil, and
their production levels are a major factor in determining
worldwide supply. demand for crude oil and its products and for
natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local,
national and worldwide economies, although weather patterns and
taxation relative to other energy sources also play a
significant part. variations in the components of refined
products sales due to seasonality are not primary drivers of
changes in the companys overall earnings.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the
petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy,
fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers.
chevrontexaco competes with fully integrated major petroleum
companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties, and for the equipment and labor
required to develop and operate those properties. in its
downstream business, chevrontexaco also competes with fully
integrated major petroleum companies and other independent
refining and marketing entities in the sale or purchase of
various goods or services in many national and international
markets.
1incorporated
in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the
company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and
chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. as used in this report, the
term chevrontexaco and such terms as the
company, the corporation, our,
we, and us may refer to chevrontexaco
corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to
all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise, it
does not include affiliates of
chevrontexaco i.e., those companies accounted for by
the equity method (generally owned 50percent or less) or
investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms
are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.
table of contents
operating environment
refer to pagesfs-2 through fs-4 of this
annual report on form10-k in managements discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
for a discussion on the companys current business
environment and outlook.
chevrontexaco strategic direction
chevrontexacos primary objective is to
achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
will enable it to outperform its competitors. the company has
set as a goal to generate the highest total stockholder return
among a designated peer group for the five-year period
2000-2004. bp, exxonmobil and royal dutch shell
among the worlds largest integrated petroleum
companies comprise the companys designated
competitor peer group for this purpose. the company had the
highest total stockholder return in this peer group for the
2000-2003 period.
as a foundation for attaining this goal, the
company has established four key priorities:
operational excellence
through safe, reliable, efficient
and environmentally sound operations;
cost reduction
by lowering unit costs through
innovation and technology;
capital stewardship
by investing in the best project
opportunities and executing them successfully (safer, faster,
and at lower cost); and
profitable growth
through leadership in developing
new business opportunities in both existing and new markets.
supporting these four priorities is a focus on:
organizational
capability:having the right
people, processes and culture to achieve and sustain
industry-leading performance in the four priorities described
above.
the corporate strategic plan builds on this
framework with strategies focused on appropriately balancing
financial returns and growth. as a result of a rigorous
evaluation of its entire portfolio of assets, the company is
exploring potential asset transactions sales,
acquisitions or trades to increase the efficiency
and profitability of continuing operations and to enhance the
economic value of its asset base. the company expects that its
worldwide exploration and production business will continue to
be its most important business, with development of its large
worldwide proved and unproved natural gas reserves as a primary
strategy to expand the companys base of production and to
capture economic value from emerging natural gas market
opportunities. the company is also seeking to deliver improved
and competitive returns from its worldwide downstream
businesses. in january 2004, the companys global
downstream organization began operating along global functional
lines rather than geographical functional lines in order to
lower costs, improve efficiency and achieve sustained
improvements in financial performance.
texaco merger transaction
on october9, 2001, texaco inc. (texaco)
became a wholly owned subsidiary of chevron corporation
(chevron) pursuant to a merger transaction, and chevron changed
its name to chevrontexaco corporation. the combination was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, and each share of
texaco common stock was converted on a tax-free basis into the
right to receive 0.77shares of chevrontexaco common stock.
in the merger, chevrontexaco issued approximately
425million shares of common stock, representing about
40percent of the outstanding chevrontexaco common stock
after the merger. further discussion of the texaco merger
transaction is contained on pagefs-5 and in note2 on
pagefs-30 of this annual report on form10-k.

description of business and
properties
the companys largest business segments are
exploration and production (upstream) and refining, marketing
and transportation (downstream). chemicals is also a significant
segment, conducted mainly by the companys
50percent-owned affiliate chevron phillips
chemical company llc (cpchem). the petroleum activities of the
company are widely dispersed geographically. the company has
petroleum operations in north america, south america, europe,
africa, middle east, central and far east asia, and australia.
cpchem has operations in the united states,
puerto rico, singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar,
mexico and belgium. chevrontexacos wholly owned oronite
fuel and lubricating oil additives business has operations in
the united states, mexico, france, the netherlands, singapore,
india, japan and brazil.
chevrontexaco owns an approximate 26percent
equity interest in the common stock of dynegy inc. (dynegy), an
energy merchant engaged in power generation, natural gas liquids
processing and marketing, and regulated energy delivery. the
company also holds investments in dynegy notes and preferred
stock. during 2003, the company exchanged its $1.5billion
aggregate principal amount of dynegy seriesb preferred
stock, which was due for redemption at par value in november
2003, for cash and new dynegy securities. refer to
pagesfs-10 and fs-11 for further information relating to
the companys investment in dynegy.
tabulations of segment sales and other operating
revenues, earnings, income taxes and assets, by united states
and international geographic areas, for the years 2001 to 2003
may be found in note9 to the consolidated financial
statements beginning on pagefs-34 of this annual report on
form10-k. in addition, similar comparative data for the
companys investments in and income from equity affiliates
and property, plant and equipment are contained in notes14
and 15 on pages fs-38 to fs-40.
the companys worldwide operations can be
affected significantly by changing economic, tax, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates, including the united states. environmental regulations
and government policies concerning economic development, energy
and taxation may have a significant effect on the companys
operations. management evaluates the economic and political risk
of initiating, maintaining or expanding operations in any
geographical area. the company monitors political events
worldwide and the possible threat these may pose to its
activities particularly the companys oil and
gas exploration and production operations and the
safety of the companys employees. political and community
unrest has disrupted the companys production in the past,
most recently in nigeria and venezuela.
capital and exploratory expenditures
a discussion of the companys capital and
exploratory expenditures is contained on pagesfs-11 and
fs-12 of this annual report on form10-k.

in 2003, chevrontexaco conducted its exploration
and production operations in the united states and approximately
25 other countries. worldwide net crude oil and natural gas
liquids production, including that of affiliates but excluding
volumes produced under operating service agreements, decreased
by about 5percent from the 2002 levels. net worldwide
production of natural gas, including affiliates, decreased about
2percent in 2003.
net liquids and natural gas production in the
united states were both down about 7percent compared with
2002. the decline in u.s.production in 2003 was primarily
attributable to declines in mature fields. in addition to normal
field declines in 2003, oil-equivalent production decreased from
the absence of 10,000 to 15,000barrels per day of
production the company deemed uneconomic to restore following
storm damages in the gulf of mexico in late 2002.
international net liquids production, including
affiliates, decreased about 4percent, whereas net natural
gas production increased about 5percent from 2002. in
indonesia, about 29,000barrels per day of the year-to-year
decline was related to the effect of lower cost-oil recovery
volumes under production-sharing terms during 2003 and the
expiration of a production sharing arrangement in the third
quarter of 2002.
for the past five years, the companys
worldwide oil-equivalent production has followed a downward
trend with 2003 production at 89percent of 1999 levels,
equivalent to an average annual decline rate of slightly more
than 2percent. during this time period, increases in
international oil-equivalent production were more than offset by
decreases in the united states.
for 2004, the company currently anticipates lower
oil-equivalent production rates in the united states as a result
of normal field declines, the effect of property sales and
opportunity limitations. the ultimate level of worldwide
production in 2004 remains uncertain due to the potential for
constraints imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting
countries (opec), and disruptions caused by weather, local civil
unrest and other economic factors.

proved oil and gas reserves, by geographic area, as of
december31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. during 2004, the company
will file estimates of oil and gas reserves with the department
of energy, energy information agency, consistent with the
reserve data reported on pagefs-57 of this annual report
on form10-k.
in 2003, chevrontexacos worldwide oil and
oil-equivalent gas barrels of net proved reserves additions
exceeded production, with a replacement rate of 108 percent of
net production, including sales and acquisitions. excluding
sales and acquisitions, the replacement rate was
114percent of net production. reserve additions included
extensions of the guajira contract in colombia and the danish
underground consortium contract in denmark; initial booking of
the tahiti field in the gulf of mexico; reservoir studies and
analyses at the tengiz and karachaganak fields in kazakhstan;
and improved recovery activity primarily in indonesia and the
united states. the following table summarizes the companys

the company sells crude oil and natural gas from
its producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. most contracts generally commit the company to
sell quantities based on production from specified properties,
but certain gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and
determinable quantities. during 2002, dynegy purchased
substantially all natural gas and natural gas liquids produced
by the company in the united states, excluding alaska, and
supplied natural gas and natural gas liquids feedstocks to the
companys u.s. refineries and chemical plants. the company
reached an agreement with dynegy to terminate the natural gas
purchase and sale contracts and other related contracts at the
end of january 2003. see pages fs-10 and fs-11 for further
information on dynegy.
in the united states, the company is
contractually committed to deliver to third parties and
affiliates approximately 160billion cubic feet of natural
gas through 2006 from united states reserves. the company
believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities
available from production of the companys proved developed
u.s. reserves. these contracts include variable-pricing terms.
outside the united states, the company is
contractually committed to deliver to third parties
approximately 600billion cubic feet of natural gas through
2006 from australian, canadian, colombian and philippine
reserves. the sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas
that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for
crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time
of delivery and that in some cases consider inflation or other
factors.
the company believes it can satisfy these
contracts from quantities available from production of the
companys proved developed australian, canadian, colombian
and philippine reserves.

exploration activities
the following table summarizes the companys
net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed
in each of the last three years and the number of exploratory
wells drilling at december31, 2003. exploratory
wells are wells drilled to find and produce oil or gas in
unproved areas and include delineation wells, which are wells
drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to
be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir or to extend a
known reservoir beyond the proved area. wells
drilling includes wells temporarily suspended. refer to
the suspended wells discussion in litigation and other
contingencies in managements discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations on
pagefs-17 and note1, summary of significant
accounting policies; properties, plant and equipment
on pagesfs-28 and fs-29 for further discussion. increases
in the united states, nigeria and australia were partially
offset by decreases in china and angola. the wells are suspended
pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the
related oil and gas deposits. the ultimate disposition of these
well costs is dependent on: (1)decisions on additional
major capital expenditures, (2)the results of additional
exploratory drilling that is under way or firmly planned, and
(3)in some cases, securing final regulatory approvals for
development.

activities in key areas
chevrontexacos 2003 key upstream activities
not discussed in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations beginning on
pagefs-2 of this annual report on form10-k are
presented below. the comments include reference to net
production, which excludes partner shares and royalty
interests. total production includes these
components. in addition to the activities discussed,
chevrontexaco was active in other geographic areas, but these
activities were less significant.
consolidated operations
a)united states
the united states exploration and production
activities are concentrated in the gulf of mexico, california,
louisiana, texas, new mexico and the rocky mountains. as part of
the ongoing effort to improve competitive performance and
increase operating efficiency, the company announced plans in
2003 to sell interests in non-strategic producing properties in
the united states. the majority of these properties are located
in 15 states and the outer continental shelf of the gulf of
mexico. the company expects to retain about 400 core fields and
anticipates the divestment program will be substantially
completed in 2004.
gulf of mexico:
combining the shelf and deepwater
interests in the gulf of mexico, average daily net production
during 2003 were 169,000 barrels of crude oil, 1billion
cubic feet of natural gas and 19,700 barrels of natural gas
liquids.
in deepwater, the company has an interest in
three significant developments: petronius, genesis and typhoon.
petronius, 50percent-owned and operated, maintained a
daily production of approximately 30,000 barrels of net
oil-equivalent in 2003. the 57percent-owned and operated
genesis averaged production of approximately 20,000 barrels of
net oil-equivalent per day in 2003. typhoon, which is
50percent-owned and operated, had average production of
approximately 14,000 barrels of net oil-equivalent per day in
2003, including production from the boris field that utilizes
the typhoon production facility.
in exploration, there were four new deepwater
discoveries in 2003 sturgis and perseus, in which
the company has a 50percent interest in each, and tubular
bells and saint malo, which the companys interest is
30percent and 12.5 percent, respectively. the company
drilled a well in the tonga prospect in 2003. the data from this
well is under evaluation. additionally, under terms of an
agreement with bp, chevrontexaco earned the right to operate the
blind faith discovery and increased its ownership to
50percent. appraisal work was completed in the tahiti
discovery.
mid-continent:
onshore operations in the
mid-continent united states are concentrated in texas, oklahoma,
kansas, alabama and the rocky mountain states. net production of
natural gas averaged 822million cubic feet per day through
development drilling activity, combined with a focus on
maintaining base production with workovers, artificial lift and
facility optimization. net production of crude oil and natural
gas liquids averaged 32,000 barrels per day during the year.
capital spending was focused on natural gas development with
major programs in the rockies, east texas and south texas.
permian: permian
operations are located predominantly in southeastern new mexico
and west texas. during 2003, daily net production averaged
110,500 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
257million cubic feet of natural gas.

chevrontexaco is the largest producer
in california. in 2003, average daily net production was 225,500
barrels of crude oil, 112million cubic feet of natural gas
and 4,800 barrels of natural gas liquids. approximately
85percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy
oil (typically
table of contents
with an api gravity lower than 22 degrees). heat
management continued to be a major focus for the oil assets,
enabling greater recovery of this resource.
global natural gas projects:
in november 2003, chevrontexaco
received approval for a deepwater port license by
u.s.government authorities to construct, own and operate a
liquefied natural gas (lng)receiving and regasification
terminal, port pelican, to be located offshore louisiana to
serve the north american market. efforts are under way in 2004
to obtain project approval. the company also filed permits to
construct an lng receiving and regasification terminal to be
located approximately eight miles off the coast of baja
california, mexico. chevrontexaco is working with mexican
authorities to secure permit approvals for the project.
b)africa

cnl-operated fields averaged 113,100 barrels of crude oil, 2,400
barrels of liquefied petroleum gas (lpg)and
50million cubic feet of natural gas. net production from
five topcon operating fields during the year averaged
approximately 7,200 barrels of crude oil per day. onshore
operations in the western niger delta were suspended in march
2003 as a result of community disturbance. net onshore
production capacity of about 45,000 barrels of oil per day
remained shut-in at year-end while the company continued to
evaluate options for safe and secure restoration of production.
the onshore and offshore engineering, procurement
and construction bids were received in 2003 for phase3 of
the escravos gas project, which includes adding a second gas
plant and expanding processing capacity to 680million
cubic feet per day and is targeted for completion in 2007.
chevrontexaco holds a 40 percent working interest in the
escravos gas project, which has the capacity to process
285million cubic feet of natural gas per day.
front-end engineering and design and site

(gtl)facility at escravos. this proposed
33,000-barrel-per-day gtl project is the companys first
project to use the sasol chevron global joint ventures
technology and operational expertise. project start-up is
expected to be in 2007. chevrontexaco will ultimately hold about
a 38percent beneficial interest.
the company also continued activities in the
deepwater agbami development. in 2003, a pre-unitization
agreement was completed between chevrontexaco and the
blocks216 and 217 participants. initial production is
expected in 2007.
successful results were achieved in 2003 from the
aparo-3 appraisal well and the nsiko-1 wildcat well in the
deepwater blockopl-249, in which the company is entitled
to a variable equity interest over the life of the field.
opl-222 activities continued in 2003 with the
successful completion of appraisal programs involving usan-3,
usan-4 and ukot-2, in which chevrontexaco holds a
30percent interest. exploration activities on the shelf
included the completion of the okagba-2 appraisal well along
with the successful sonam-4 appraisal well.
the company and its partners in the brass river
consortium agreed to advance plans for the front-end engineering
and design work for a new lng facility at brass river in nigeria.

oil-equivalent per day.
thailand:
chevrontexaco operates blockb8/32 in the gulf of thailand
with a 52percent interest. during 2003, the company was
awarded the exploration and production rights to two additional
offshore concessions. the companys interests in the newly
acquired blocksg4/43 and 9a are 85percent and
52percent, respectively. the company also holds a
33percent interest in exploration blocks7, 8 and 9,
which are currently inactive pending resolution of border issues
between thailand and cambodia.
blockb8/32 produces crude oil and natural
gas from three fields: tantawan, maliwan and benchamas. daily
net production in 2003 from these fields was 104million
cubic feet of natural gas and 24,600barrels of crude oil.
during the year, the company drilled 44development wells
and installed three platforms in blockb8/32. in early
2004, the company completed an upgrade of processing capacity at
the benchamas field, increasing total capacity to approximately
65,000barrels of crude oil per day (34,000 net barrels of
crude oil per day). during 2004, an exploration program is
planned to continue to evaluate the remaining areas of
blockb8/32 and the recently acquired concessions.
cambodia:
chevrontexaco operates and holds a 70percent interest in
block a, located offshore cambodia in the gulf of thailand.
efforts are under way to reduce the companys working
interest in the block to 55percent. the concession covers

seismic data has been acquired and processed over a portion of
the block, and the drilling of additional exploration wells is
planned for 2004.
australia:
chevrontexaco has a one-sixth interest in the north west shelf
(nws) project in offshore western australia. daily net
production from the project during 2003 averaged 18,100 barrels
of condensate, 282million cubic feet of natural gas,
17,900barrels of crude oil and 3,700barrels of
liquefied petroleum gas. approximately 60percent of the
natural gas was sold, primarily under long-term contracts, in
the form of liquefied natural gas (lng) to major utilities in
japan and south korea. the remaining natural gas was sold to the
western australia domestic market. the train4 lng
expansion project, which is planned to increase lng capacity by
about 50percent, is under construction and is expected to
have first gas sales by september 2004. the nws venture was
selected by the peoples republic of china to be the
supplier of lng for the proposed guangdong lng terminal project.
a 25-year lng sale and purchase agreement (spa) for
approximately 3.9trillion cubic feet of natural gas is
being negotiated, with first lng cargoes expected in late 2006

in 2003, the western australian government granted in-principle
approval, through an act of parliament, for the development and
construction of a multibillion-dollar gas processing facility on
barrow island. this represented one of several milestones toward
enabling production of natural gas resources in this area.
additionally, chevrontexaco signed a memorandum of understanding
with the gorgon joint venture partners for the supply of lng to
the north america west coast, over a 20-year period
(approximately 1.9trillion cubic feet in total) beginning
in 2008. in october 2003, the gorgon joint venture partners
announced an agreement with cnooc to negotiate the sale of
gorgon lng to the peoples republic of china. the
agreement, which is subject to the completion of formal
contracts, enables cnooc to purchase an equity stake in the
gorgon gas development project and to facilitate the sale of lng
into the chinese market.

per day of heavy crude oil, creating a lighter, higher-value
crude oil.
table of contents
petroleum natural gas and natural
gas liquids
the company sells natural gas and natural gas
liquids from its producing operations under a variety of
contractual arrangements. prior to february 2003,
chevrontexacos equity affiliate, dynegy, purchased
substantially all natural gas and natural gas liquids produced
by the company in the united states, excluding alaska, and
supplied natural gas and natural gas liquids feedstocks to the
companys u.s. refineries and chemical plants. at the end
of january 2003, the companys natural gas purchase and
sale contracts with dynegy were terminated. this was preceded by
an agreement between chevrontexaco and dynegy to discontinue
certain commercial arrangements as a result of dynegys
decision to exit the gas marketing and trading business. as a
result, the company now markets its domestic natural gas
production to a variety of third parties through its new unit,
chevrontexaco natural gas. the companys long-term natural
gas processing and liquids arrangements with dynegy were not
affected by the early termination of natural gas purchase and
sale contracts. during 2003, nearly all of chevrontexacos
u.s. natural gas liquids production was sold to dynegy. refer to

federal law requires that cargo transported
between u.s. ports be carried in ships built and registered in
the united states, owned and operated by u.s. entities, and
manned by u.s. crews. at year-end 2003, the companys u.s.
flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting refined
products between the gulf coast
table of contents
and the east coast, and from california
refineries to terminals on the west coast and in alaska and
hawaii.
the international flag vessels were engaged
primarily in transporting crude oil from the middle east,
indonesia, mexico and west africa to ports in the united states,
europe and asia. refined products also were transported by
tanker worldwide.
the federal oil pollution act of 1990 requires
the scheduled phase-out, by year-end 2010, of all single-hull
tankers trading to u.s.ports or transferring cargo in
waters within the u.s.exclusive economic zone. this has
raised the demand for double-hull tankers. during 2003,
chevrontexaco operated a total of 20 double-hull tankers, which
includes three additional double-hull tankers that the company
took delivery of in 2003. the company is a member of many
oil-spill-response cooperatives in areas around the world in
which it operates.
chemicals
chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) is
a 50-50 joint venture with conocophillips corporation. cpchem
owns or has joint venture interests in 32 manufacturing
facilities and six research and technical centers in the united
states, puerto rico, belgium, china, mexico, saudi arabia,
singapore, south korea and qatar.
a new olefins and polyolefins complex was
commissioned in qatar in 2003. the complex is owned and operated
by qatar chemical company ltd., a joint venture between cpchem,
with a 49percent interest, and qatar general petroleum,
which owns the remaining 51percent.
also during 2003, a 50-50 joint venture with bp
solvay commenced operations of a new high-density polyethylene
(hdpe) facility at a cpchem site in the houston, texas area. the
jointly owned 700-million-pounds per-year hdpe facility is among
the largest of its kind in the world and uses cpchem proprietary
manufacturing technology.
chevrontexacos oronite brand fuel and
lubricant additives business is a leading developer,
manufacturer and marketer of performance additives for fuels and
lubricating oils. the company owns and operates facilities in
the united states, france, the netherlands, singapore, japan and
brazil and has equity interests in facilities in india and
mexico.
coal
the companys coal mining and marketing
subsidiary, the pittsburg& midway coal mining co.
(p&m), owned and operated two surface mines and one
underground mine at year-end 2003. in addition, final
reclamation activities were under way at two mines that are
scheduled to close. p&m also owns an approximate
30percent interest in inter-american coal holding n.v.,
which has interests in coal mining operations in venezuela as
well as in trading and transportation activities in venezuela
and colombia.
sales of coal from p&ms wholly owned
mines and from its affiliates were 13.4million tons, a
decrease of 10percent from 2002. the reduction resulted
from the absence of sales in 2003 from the companys mining
operations in northeastern new mexico, where production ceased
in late 2002. lower production from p&ms surface mine,
located near gallup, new mexico, also contributed to the decline.
at year-end 2003, p&m controlled
approximately 189million tons of developed and undeveloped
coal reserves, including significant reserves of environmentally
desirable low-sulfur fuel. the company is contractually
committed to deliver approximately 13million tons of coal
per year through the end of 2006 and believes it can satisfy
these contracts from existing coal reserves.
other activities synthetic crude
oil
in canada, chevrontexaco holds a 20percent
interest in the athabasca oil sands project (aosp). bitumen is
extracted from oil sands and upgraded into synthetic crude oil
using hydroprocessing technology. the integrated operation at
aosp commenced in april 2003 when the scotford upgrader
table of contents
started processing bitumen from train1 of
the muskeg river mine. full operation with both processing
trains began in june. bitumen production in the fourth quarter
of 2003 averaged approximately 130,000 barrels per day. full
capacity is expected to reach 155,000 barrels per day.
global power generation
chevrontexacos global power generation
(gpg) has more than 20years experience in developing
and operating commercial power projects. with 13power
assets located in the united states, asia and europe, gpg
manages the production of more than 3,500 megawatts of
electricity in its facilities. all of the facilities are owned
through joint ventures. the company operates efficient gas-fired
cogeneration facilities, some of which produce steam for use in
upstream operations to facilitate production of heavy oil.
worldwide gasification technology
chevrontexaco worldwide gasification technology
(wgt) is used to convert a wide variety of hydrocarbon
feedstocks into clean synthesis gas. the synthesis gas can be
used as a feedstock for basic chemicals or to generate
electricity in low-emission power plants. chevrontexaco has
licensed its gasification technology to more than 60 plants
worldwide.
gas-to-liquids
the 50-50 sasol chevron global joint venture was
established in october 2000 to develop a worldwide
gas-to-liquids (gtl) business. projects to build gtl plants are
being considered for qatar, nigeria and australia.
research and technology
the companys core hydrocarbon technology
efforts support the upstream, downstream, and power and
gasification businesses. these activities include heavy oil
recovery and upgrading, deepwater exploration and production,
shallow water production operations, gas-to-liquids processing,
hydrocarbon gasification to power, and new and improved refinery
processes.
additionally, chevrontexacos technology
ventures company focuses on the identification, growth and
commercialization of emerging technologies that have the
potential to change or transform how energy is produced or
consumed. the range of business spans early-stage investing of
venture capital in emerging technologies to developing joint
venture companies in new energy systems, such as advanced
batteries for distributed power and transportation systems and
hydrogen fuel storage.
during 2003, the company completed the worldwide
implementation of a new information technology infrastructure
encompassing computing, data management, security, and
connectivity of partners, suppliers and employees. the
architecture, known as net ready, provides the
foundation for the company to cost-effectively and rapidly
integrate advances in computing and network-based technology.
chevrontexacos research and development
expenses were $238million, $221million and
$209million for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
because some of the investments the company makes
in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies
and business processes, ultimate success is not certain.
although not all initiatives may prove to be economically
viable, the companys overall investment in this area is
not significant to the companys consolidated financial
position.
environmental protection
virtually all aspects of the companys
businesses are subject to various federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. chevrontexaco expects more environmental-related
table of contents
regulations in the countries where it has
operations. most of the costs of complying with the many laws
and regulations pertaining to its operations are embedded in the
normal costs of conducting its business.
in 2003, the companys u.s.capitalized
environmental expenditures were $178million, representing
approximately 8percent of the companys total
consolidated u.s.capital and exploratory expenditures.
these environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
retrofit existing facilities, as well as those associated with
new facilities. the expenditures are predominantly in the
petroleum segment and relate mostly to air-and-water quality
projects and activities at the companys refineries, oil
and gas producing facilities, and marketing facilities. for
2004, the company estimates u.s.capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities will be $260million. the
future annual capital costs of fulfilling this commitment are
uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
future changes to regulatory requirements.

their impact on chevrontexaco and on the companys 2003

and procedures
(a)evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures
the company maintains disclosure controls
and procedures, as such term is defined in
rule13a-15(e) and rule15d-15(e) under the securities
exchange act of 1934 (the exchange act), that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
reports the company files or submits under the exchange act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the companys chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. in
designing and evaluating its disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that no matter how well conceived and
operated, disclosure controls and procedures can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. the companys
disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet,
and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance
standards. based on their evaluation as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on form10-k, the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded
that, subject to the limitations noted above, the companys
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
material information relating to the company, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to them by others
within those entities.
(b)changes in internal control over
financial reporting
as of the last quarter, there were no changes in
the companys internal control over financial reporting

because of their nature and amount,
these special items are identified
separately to help explain the changes in
net income and segment income between
periods, as well as to help distinguish
the underlying trends for the companys
core businesses. special items are
discussed in detail for each major
operating area in the results of
operations section beginning on page
fs-6. restructuring and reorganizations
is described in detail in note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements on page
fs-37. the categories merger-related
expenses and extraordinary loss on
merger-related asset sales are described
in detail in the texaco merger
transaction section on page fs-5.
business environment and outlook
as shown in the special items table, large
net special-item charges adversely affected
net income in 2002 and 2001. in 2002, $2.3
billion of the $3.3billion of net charges
related to the companys investment in its
dynegy inc. affiliate. refer to pages fs-10
and fs-11 for a discussion of these matters.
approximately one-half of the $3.5billion
of net charges in 2001 related to asset
impairments, primarily the result of
downward revisions to crude oil and natural
gas reserve quantities.
apart from the effects of special
items, chevrontexacos earnings depend
largely on the profitability of its
business segments in upstream
exploration and production  and
downstream  refining, marketing and
transportation. overall earnings trends
are typically less affected by results
from the companys commodity chemicals
segment and other investments.
the companys long-term competitive
position, particularly given the
capital-intensive and commodity-based
nature of the industry, is closely
associated with the companys ability to
invest in projects that provide adequate
financial returns and to manage operating
expenses effectively. the company also
continuously evaluates opportunities to
dispose of assets that are not key to
providing long-term value, or to acquire
assets or operations complementary to its
asset base to help sustain the companys
growth. in addition to the
asset-disposition and restructuring plans
announced in 2003, other such plans may
occur in future periods and result in
significant gains or losses. refer to the
operating developments section on pages
fs-4 and fs-5 for a discussion that
includes references to the companys asset
disposition activities.
fs-2
table of contents
comments related to earnings trends for the companys major business areas
are as follows:
upstream year-to-year changes in exploration and production earnings align
most closely with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. crude
oil and natural gas prices are subject to certain external factors over which
the company has no control, including product demand connected with global
economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by
the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related
damages and disruptions, competing fuel prices and regional supply
interruptions that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or
political uncertainties. the company monitors developments closely in the
countries in which it operates.
longer-term trends in earnings for this segment are also a function of
other factors besides price fluctuations, including changes in the companys
oil and gas production levels and the companys ability to find or acquire and
efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas reserves. most of the companys
overall capital investment is in its upstream businesses, particularly outside
the united states. refer to the capital and exploratory expenditures on pages
fs-11 and fs-12 for discussion of the types of upstream investments targeted
for 2004. investments in upstream projects oftentimes are made well in advance
of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production.
industry price levels for crude oil in early 2003 reached a 12-year high,
reaching a peak of about $38 per barrel. prices for west texas intermediate
(wti), a benchmark crude, then averaged about $31 for the year, an increase of
about $5 from 2002. the wti spot prices at the end of december2003 and at the
end of february2004 were about $32 and $36, respectively. among other things,
these relatively high industry prices reflected increased demand from improved
economies in many countries and continued production curtailments by opec.
the average spot price of west texas intermediate, a benchmark crude oil, rose
19percent between 2002 and 2003 and remained above $30 per barrel in early 2004.
natural gas prices were also higher in 2003 than in 2002. benchmark prices
for henry hub u.s. natural gas averaged more than $5 per thousand cubic feet in
2003, versus about $3 in 2002. the 2003year-end price was nearly $6 per
thousand cubic feet, about a dollar higher than the year-earlier level. prices
in the united states are typically highest during the winter period, when
demand for heating fuel is greatest. at the end of february2004, the u.s.
benchmark price was about $5 per thousand cubic feet. the trend toward higher
u.s. natural gas prices is mainly the result of overall demand based upon the
strength of
average prices climbed more than 70percent during 2003. production
was down more than 7percent due to normal field declines and production
not restored after 2002 storm damage to facilities in the gulf of mexico.
net liquids production declined about 5percent in 2003, primarily the result of normal field declines in the united states.
* includes equity in affiliates
the economy and the declining levels of industry reserves and production in the united states.
partially offsetting the benefit of higher crude oil and natural gas prices in 2003 was a 4percent decline in the
companys worldwide oil-equivalent production from the prior year. the decrease
was largely the result of lower production in the united states due to normal
field declines and production deemed uneconomic to restore following storm
damages in the gulf of mexico in the second half of 2002. international
oil-equivalent production was also down slightly  primarily the result of
lower liquids production in the companys indonesian operations. the reduced
net production in indonesia was mainly due to the effect of higher prices on
cost-oil recovery volumes under production-sharing arrangements and the
expiration of a production-sharing agreement in the third quarter 2002.
the companys oil-equivalent production level in future periods is
uncertain, in part because of production quotas set by opec and the potential
for production disruptions from civil unrest and changing geopolitics in the
countries in which the company operates and holds interests. twenty-two percent
of the companys net oil equivalent production in 2003 was in the opec-member
countries of indonesia, nigeria and venezuela and in the partitioned neutral
zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. although the companys production levels
in these areas were not constrained in
2003 by opec quotas, future production could be affected by opec-imposed
limitations. in nigeria, about 45,000 barrels per day of the companys net
production capacity has been shut-in in certain onshore areas since march2003
because of security concerns. the company expects to re-enter this area during
2004 to begin repairing damaged equipment. opec production constraints could
possibly limit the eventual resumption of a portion or all of this production.
downstream refining, marketing and transportation earnings are closely
tied to regional supply and demand for refined products and the associated
effects on industry refining and marketing margins. the companys core
marketing areas are the western and southeastern united states, western canada,
the asia-pacific, northern europe, africa and latin america.
fs-3
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
company-specific factors influencing the companys profitability in this
segment include the operating efficiencies of the refinery network, including
any downtime due to planned maintenance, refinery upgrade projects or operating
incidents.
downstream earnings improved in 2003, compared with the prior year, on
higher refined product margins in most of the companys operating areas. in
contrast, margins in the 2002 period were at their lowest levels since the
mid-1990s, as weak market conditions did not allow rising feedstock costs to be
fully recovered from consumers of refined products. industry margins may be
volatile in the future, depending primarily on price movements for crude oil
feedstocks, the strength of the economies in which the company operates and
other factors.
chemicals earnings of $69million in 2003 were lower than the year-ago
period. depressed earnings in both years reflected excess-supply conditions for
the commodity chemicals industry that have kept product margins at low levels
for a protracted period. a significant improvement in earnings is not expected
in the near future.
operating developments
key operating developments and events during 2003 and early 2004 included:
upstream
worldwide oil and gas reserves approximately 1billion barrels of
oil-equivalent reserves were added during 2003, including sales and
acquisitions. these additions equated to 108percent of production for the
net proved reserves additions in 2003 equaled 108percent of oil-equivalent
production for the period. this was the 11th consecutive year that reserve additions
exceeded 100percent of production.
* barrels of oil-equivalent
** includes equity in affiliates
year. of the 1billion barrels added, nearly 300million were the result of
discoveries and extensions, including almost 200million in the united states.
contract extensions in colombia and denmark accounted for
approximately 200 million additional barrels. about 100million barrels were added through
improved recovery techniques, primarily in indonesia and the united states. finally, the largest revisions resulted from
reservoir studies and analyses in kazakhstan, increasing reserves 300million barrels.
north america plans were initiated to improve the competitive performance and operating efficiency of the companys north america
exploration and production portfolio. these plans include the sale of certain
nonstrategic producing properties and royalty interests in the united states
and possibly western canada. the company expects to retain about 400 core
fields. additionally, the company expects to consolidate certain business
functions and office locations.
in late 2003, four new deepwater discoveries in the gulf of mexico  perseus,
sturgis, tubular bells and saint malo  were announced.
chevrontexaco is the operator and holds a 50percent working interest in both the perseus and
sturgis prospects. in the non-operated discoveries, the company holds a 30
percent interest in tubular bells and a 12.5percent interest in saint malo.
additionally at the blind faith discovery, an agreement was reached to assume
operatorship and increase the companys working interest to 50percent.
at the tahiti prospect, a major discovery in the deepwater gulf of mexico, appraisal
drilling validated the presence of high-quality reservoir sand. chevrontexaco
is the operator of the prospect and has a 58percent working interest.
in late 2003, an appraisal well was drilled at the great white discovery, a nonoperated
exploratory opportunity in the western gulf of mexico. the company has a 33
percent working interest in this prospect.
australia a well was drilled during 2003 in the io-jansz natural gas
field, off the northwest coast of western australia. test results provided
verification of the fields extensive production potential. chevrontexaco holds
a 50percent equity interest in the wa-18-r permit area.
nigeria in october2003, successful results were announced from the
aparo-3 appraisal well and the nsiko-1 wildcat well in deepwater block opl-249,
where the company is entitled to a variable equity interest over the life of
the field. in addition, the company announced a significant extension of its 30
percent-owned usan field discovery. the drilling of the usan-4 appraisal well,
located in deepwater block opl-222, confirmed the presence of commercial
quantities of oil as well as additional potential in previously untested
reservoirs. in early 2003, the company announced a gas discovery in the 46
percent-owned deepwater block opl-218, following completion of the nnwa-2
appraisal well.
earlier in the year, the company and its partners reached an agreement
that will govern future operations in the offshore block opl-216 concession.
the agreement is expected to enable the continued advancement of plans to
develop the agbami field. the company has varying funding obligations and
profit entitlement for the block opl-216 development according to the terms of
two production-sharing contracts in the concession.
angola major contracts were awarded for the first phase of development in
the benguela, belize, lobito and tomboco fields in deepwater block 14. the
first phase will involve the drilling and completion of more than 30
development wells in the benguela and belize fields and the construction and
installation of drilling and production facilities that will form a new
production hub in block 14. the company is the operator and holds a 31percent
interest in block 14.
chad/cameroon the companys first cargo of crude oil from fields in
southern chad was loaded at facilities offshore cameroon for export to world
markets in late 2003. the crude oil produced in chad is transported more than
600 miles by pipeline to a floating storage and offloading vessel located
several miles offshore. full production capacity of 225,000 barrels per day is
expected to be reached in mid-2004. chevrontexaco holds a 25percent equity
interest in the chad-cameroon upstream operation and about a 23percent
interest in the pipeline.
kazakhstan the companys 50percent-owned affiliate, tengiz-chevroil (tco)
reached an agreement with the government of
fs-4
table of contents
kazakhstan in the third quarter of 2003 to
expand operations at the tengiz and korolev
fields. the sour gas injection/second
generation project is expected to increase
tcos oil production capacity from 285,000
barrels per day to between 430,000 and
500,000 barrels per day in the second half
of 2006. also, a 400-mile pipeline was completed that will
enable production from the karachaganak
field to be exported to world markets via
the caspian pipeline when fully operational
in mid-2004.
colombiaan agreement was reached that
extends the companys production rights in
northern natural gas fields. under the
contract extension, chevrontexaco holds a
43percent interest with the remaining 57
percent held by the countrys national
petroleum company.
venezuelachevrontexaco was awarded the
license for the 60percent-owned and
-operated block 2 plataforma deltana, a
prospective natural gas region in
venezuelas atlantic continental shelf.
global natural gas projectsin the
gulf of mexico, the companys permit
application was approved for plans to
develop the port pelican deepwater lng
facility. the company also filed permits
for the construction of a lng receiving and
regasification terminal offshore baja
california, mexico.
in september2003, the gorgon joint
venture, in which the company is a 57
percent owner, received in-principle
approval from the western australian
government through an act of parliament to
proceed with plans to construct a natural
gas processing facility on barrow island.
the decision represented a significant
milestone in the companys plans to
commercialize its large gorgon natural gas
resource base. also in 2003, the gorgon
joint venture announced an agreement with
the china national offshore oil corporation
(cnooc)in october to negotiate the sale of
gorgon liquefied natural gas to the
peoples republic of china. the agreement,
which is subject to the completion of
formal contracts, enables cnooc to purchase
an interest in the gorgon gas development
project and to facilitate the sale of lng
into the chinese market.
in nigeria, the company and its
partners in the brass river consortium
agreed to advance plans for the front-end
engineering and design work for a new lng
facility at brass river. the studies are
expected to be completed in 2004.
a new u.s. wholesale natural gas
marketing unit became fully operational in
april2003. this business unit was
established following a decision by the
companys dynegy affiliate to exit the
natural gas marketing and trading
business. chevrontexacos natural gas
sale and purchase agreements with dynegy
were terminated at the end of january
2003.
downstream
the company initiated a major restructuring
of its global refining, marketing, and
supply and trading organizations in order
to lower costs, improve efficiency and
achieve sustained improvements in its
financial performance relative to
competitors. the organization was changed
from a geographical to a global functional
alignment and was implemented at the
beginning of 2004.
downstream asset dispositions,
including the sale of the el
paso, texas, refinery and
approximately 400 service stations in
various markets, were completed in 2003 to
improve returns by
focusing investment in areas with the
strongest long-term growth and returns.
facility upgrade projects at refineries
in pascagoula, mississippi; pembroke, united
kingdom; and rotterdam, netherlands were
completed, resulting in increased product
yields and enabling the manufacture of
low-sulfur fuels. in the philippines, the
batangas refinery was converted into a
finished-product terminal.
chemicals
in qatar, a new olefins and polyolefins
complex was commissioned in 2003. the
complex is owned and operated through a
joint venture between the companys 50
percent-owned equity affiliate, chevron
phillips chemical company (cpchem), and
qatar general petroleum. cpchem holds a 49
percent interest in the joint venture.
texaco merger transaction
basis of presentationin october2001,
texaco inc. (texaco) became a wholly owned
subsidiary of chevron corporation
(chevron) pursuant to a merger
transaction, and chevron changed its name
to chevrontexaco corporation. certain
operations that were jointly owned by the
combining companies are consolidated in
the accompanying financial statements.
these operations are primarily those of
the caltex group of companies, which was
previously owned 50percent each by
chevron and texaco. the combination was
accounted for as a pooling of interests,
and the accompanying audited consolidated
financial statements for all periods are
presented as if chevron and texaco had
always been combined.
merger effectsunder mandate of the
federal trade commission (ftc)as a
condition to its approval of the merger,
the company sold its interests in equilon
and motiva  joint ventures engaged in u.s.
downstream businesses  in february2002,
resulting in cash proceeds of $2.2billion.
indemnification by chevrontexaco against
certain equilon and motiva contingent
liabilities at the date of sale are
discussed in the guarantees,
off-balance-sheet arrangements and
contractual obligations, and other
contingencies section beginning on page
fs-13. other mandated asset dispositions
were also completed during 2002. net income
and cash proceeds from these other asset
sales were not material. all such assets
sold as a result of the merger provided net
income of approximately $375million in
2001. the net loss on assets sold under the
ftc mandate is presented in the 2001 income
statement as an extraordinary item.
the company incurred before-tax
merger-related expenses of approximately
$1.6billion ($1.1billion after tax) and
$576million ($386million after tax) in
2001 and 2002, respectively. major expenses
included employee severance payments;
incremental pension and medical plan benefit
costs associated with workforce reductions;

commission (sec)filing and investment
banker fees; employee
and office relocations; and costs for

the improvement in 2003 segment income from 2002 primarily was the result
of higher prices for crude oil and natural
exploration expenses declined after the october2001 merger,
reflecting, in part, the high-grading of the combined exploration portfolio.
earnings increased significantly in 2003 on higher prices for crude oil and natural gas. partially offsetting were the effects of lower production and foreign currency losses.
* before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles
gas. partially offsetting this effect was a decline in oil-equivalent production. the change between 2001 and
2002 reflected significantly lower natural gas realizations and lower
production in the 2002 period.
the companys average 2003 u.s. liquids realization was $26.66 per barrel,
compared with $21.34 in 2002 and essentially the same in 2001. the average
natural gas realization was $5.01 per thousand cubic feet in 2003, compared
with $2.89 and $4.38 in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
net oil-equivalent production averaged 933,000 barrels per day in
2003, down 7percent from 2002 and 12percent from 2001. the net liquids
component for 2003 averaged 562,000 barrels per day, a decline of 7percent
from 2002 and 8percent from 2001. net natural gas production averaged 2.228
billion cubic feet per day in 2003, 7percent lower than 2002 and 18percent
lower than 2001. the oil-equivalent production decline in 2003 was associated
mainly with normal field declines and the absence of about 10,000 to 15,000
barrels per day of production the company deemed uneconomic to restore
following storm damages in the gulf of mexico in late 2002. the storms reduced
the companys 2002 oil-equivalent production by about 20,000 barrels per day.
net special-item charges of $64million in 2003 reflected asset
impairments of $103million  associated mainly with the write-down of assets
in anticipation of sale  and restructuring and reorganization charges of $38
million, which mainly were associated with employee severance costs. offsetting
a portion of these charges were gains of $77million from asset sales. special
items in 2002 and 2001 included asset impairments caused by write-downs in
proved oil and gas reserve quantities for a number of fields. the amount in
2001 related primarily to the midway sunset field in californias san joaquin
valley, after the determination that lower-than-projected heavy oil recovery
would result from the steam-injection process.

the earnings improvement from 2002 to 2003 included the benefit of higher
crude oil and natural gas prices. partially offsetting the improvements were
the effects of lower oil-equivalent production and an unfavorable swing in
foreign currency effects. net foreign currency losses of $319million in 2003
primarily related to a significant weakening of the u.s. dollar against the
fs-6
table of contents
currencies of canada, australia and the united kingdom. earnings improvement in
2002 vs. 2001 were marginally affected by a combination of factors, including
benefits from higher liquids realizations, higher natural gas production, and
lower exploration and income tax expenses, which were offset in part by the
effects of lower liquids production, lower natural gas realizations and higher
depreciation expense.
the average liquids realization, including equity
affiliates, was $26.79 per barrel in 2003, compared with $23.06 in 2002 and
$22.17 in 2001. the average natural gas realization was $2.64 per thousand
cubic feet in 2003, compared with $2.14 in 2002 and $2.36 in 2001.
daily net liquids production of 1.246million barrels in 2003 decreased
about 4percent from 1.295million barrels in 2002 and about 7percent from
1.345million barrels in 2001. the 2003 production decline included about
29,000 barrels per day in indonesia, related primarily to the effect of lower
cost-oil recovery volumes under production-sharing terms during 2003, and the
expiration of a production-sharing arrangement in the third quarter 2002. new
production occurred in chad in 2003 and higher volumes were produced in the
united kingdom and venezuela. the 2002 production decline from the prior year
included lower output in indonesia, primarily due to changes in contractual
terms, and in nigeria, which was mainly associated with opec constraints. these
effects were partially offset by increased production in kazakhstan.
net natural gas production of 2.064billion cubic feet per day in 2003 was
up 5percent from 2002 and more than 20percent from 2001. during 2003, output
was higher in australia, kazakhstan, the philippines and the united kingdom. in
2002, areas with production increases from 2001 included the philippines,
kazakhstan, nigeria and australia.
special items in 2003 were composed of benefits totaling $150million
related to income taxes and property sales, partially offset by asset
impairments and charges for employee termination costs. in 2002, special items
included asset impairments connected with write-downs in quantities of proved
oil and gas reserves for fields in africa and canada. in 2001, special items
included a $247million impairment of the ll-652 field in venezuela.

the u.s. refining, marketing and transportation earnings in 2003 reflected
primarily a recovery in industry margins for refined products, especially on
the west coast. margins in 2002 were very depressed and at one point, hovered
near their 12-year lows. results for 2001 included earnings of $375million
associated with assets that were later sold as a condition of the merger, which
included the companys equilon and motiva joint ventures.
sales volumes for refined products of 1.514million barrels per day in
2003 decreased about 5percent from 2002. demand was weaker for branded
gasoline, diesel and jet fuels, and there were lower sales under certain supply
contracts. branded gasoline
refined products sales volumes decreased about 5 percent from 2002. the decline partially reflected
the august 2003 sale of the el paso, texas, refinery.* includes equity in affiliates
u.s. downstream earnings in 2003 rebounded from a loss in 2002, primarily due to a recovery in the industry margins for refined products.
sales volumes of 557,000 barrels per day were 4percent lower than 2002. in 2002, branded gasoline sales increased
approximately 4percent compared with 2001 volumes. the average u.s. refined
products sales realization of $39.93 per barrel in 2003 was up from the average
of $32.63 per barrel and $36.26 per barrel in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
special items in 2003 included $160million for reserves for environmental
remediation and employee severance costs associated with the global downstream
restructuring and reorganization. these charges were partially offset by gains
primarily from the sale of service stations. in 2002, special items included
environmental remediation provisions and asset write-downs for certain refining and marketing assets, and a litigation charge.

the international refining, marketing and transportation segment includes
the companys consolidated refining and marketing businesses, international
marine operations, international supply and trading activities, and equity
earnings of affiliates, primarily in the asia-pacific region.
as in the united states, the international downstream earnings increased
on improved refined-product margins for the industry. the decline in earnings
from 2001 to 2002 reflected not only the trend in refined product margins but
also about a $200million unfavorable shift in foreign currency effects between
periods.

employee severance benefits associated with the global downstream restructuring and reorganization. in addition, special
charges of $70million were recognized for the impairment of

administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.
the change in net charges between 2002 and 2003 was
largely attributable to the differences in the effects of special
items. the 2003 period also included lower interest expense and
other corporate charges compared with 2002. aside from the
effect of special items between 2001 and 2002, the net change also
reflected lower corporate charges and net interest expense, as well
as an increase in favorable tax adjustments of $245million.
special items in 2003 included a benefit of $365million
from the exchange of the companys investment in dynegy preferred stock for cash and other dynegy securities. this benefit
was partially offset by charges for asset write-downs of $84
million, primarily in the gasification business; $40million for
the companys share of an asset impairment by dynegy; and
employee severance costs of $16million.
special items in 2002 included $2.3billion related to dynegy,
composed of $1.6billion for the write-down of the companys
investment in dynegy common and preferred stock to its estimated fair value and $680million for the companys share of
dynegys own special items for asset write-downs and revaluations
and a loss on an asset sale. refer also to pages fs-10 and fs-11 for

explanations follow for variations between years for the
amounts in the table above  after consideration of the effects of
special items  as well as for other income statement categories.
refer to the preceding segment discussions in this section for
information relating to special items.
sales and other operating revenues were $120billion in 2003,
compared with $99billion in 2002 and $104billion in 2001.
revenues increased in 2003 primarily from significantly higher
prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products worldwide.
total sales and operating revenues in 2002 declined from
2001 due to lower average realizations for crude oil and refined
products, as well as lower prices and sales volumes for natural gas
in the united states.
income (loss)from equity affiliates increased in 2003, as
earnings improved for a number of affiliates, including tengiz-chevroil, lg-caltex and cpchem. in 2001, income from equity
affiliates included earnings from assets subsequently sold as a
condition of the merger.
other income in 2003 reflected significantly higher foreign currency losses. likewise, foreign currency effects largely
contributed to lower other income in 2002 vs. 2001. foreign
currency losses in 2003  excluding foreign currency gains or
losses of affiliates which are included in income (loss)from
equity affiliates  were $199million, compared with a loss of $5
million and a gain of $121million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. in 2003, losses resulted primarily from the weakening of
the u.s. dollar against the currencies of canada, australia and
the united kingdom. in 2002, foreign currency losses related
to currencies of most countries in which the company has sig-
nificant operations appreciating against the u.s. dollar. other
income in 2002 also reflected lower interest income.
purchased crude oil and products costs of $72billion in 2003
increased about 25percent from 2002. the increase was the
result of significantly higher prices for crude oil, natural gas
and refined products. crude oil and products purchase costs
decreased about 5percent in 2002, primarily due to lower natural
gas prices and reduced natural gas volumes.
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses of
$13billion increased from $12billion in 2002. about $800million of the increase in 2003 resulted from higher freight rates
from international shipping operations and higher costs of
employee pension plans and
other employee-benefit
the 8percent increase in 2003
resulted primarily from higher
costs for transportation, shipping,
pension plans and other
employee benefits.
expenses. during 2002, operating, selling, general and administrative
expenses increased approximately
$95million from 2001, primarily
from higher pension expense,
payroll and other employee-
benefit costs. refer to note
21, employee benefit plans,
beginning on page fs-42 for
discussion of the costs associated
with the companys pension plans
and other employee benefits in
the comparative periods.
exploration expenses were
$571million in 2003, $591million in 2002 and $1billion in
2001. well write-offs were higher
in 2001 than in the other comparative periods.
depreciation, depletion and
amortization expenses did not change materially for the reporting
periods after consideration of the effects from special items.
merger-related expenses were $576million and approximately
$1.6billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. no merger-related
expenses were recorded in 2003, reflecting the completion of
merger integration activities in 2002.
taxes other than on income were $17.9billion, $16.7billion
and $15.2billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. the
increase in 2003 primarily reflected the weakening u.s. dollar in
2003 on foreign-currency-denominated duties in the companys
european downstream operations. in 2002, the increase between
periods resulted from higher sales volumes in the united kingdom along with currency effects of a weaker u.s. dollar in the
companys european downstream operations.
interest and debt expense was $474million in 2003, compared with $565million in 2002 and $833million in 2001. the
declines between periods reflected lower average interest rates on
commercial paper and other variable rate debt and lower average
debt levels.

information related to investment in dynegy inc.
chevrontexaco owns an approximate 26
percent equity interest in the common stock
of dynegy  an energy merchant engaged in
power generation, natural gas liquids
processing and marketing, and regulated
energy delivery. the company also holds
investments in dynegy notes and preferred
stock.
investment in dynegy common stockat
december31, 2003, the carrying value of the
companys investment in dynegy common stock
was approximately $150million. this amount
was about $425million below the companys
proportionate interest in dynegys
underlying net assets. this difference
resulted from write-downs of the investment
in 2002 for declines in the market value of
the common shares below the companys
carrying value that were deemed to be other
than temporary. the approximate $425million
difference has been assigned to the extent
practicable to specific dynegy assets and
liabilities, based upon the companys
analysis of the various factors giving rise
to the decline in value of the dynegy
shares. the companys equity share of
dynegys reported earnings is adjusted
quarterly to reflect the difference between
these allocated values and dynegys
historical book values. the market value of
the companys investment in dynegys common
stock at december31, 2003, was $415
million.
investments in dynegy notes and
preferred stockat the beginning of 2003,
the company held $1.5billion aggregate
principal amount of dynegy seriesb
preferred stock, which was due for
redemption at par value in november2003. in
august, the company exchanged its preferred
stock for $225million in cash, $225million
face value of dynegy junior unsecured
subordinated notes due 2016 and $400million
face value of dynegy seriesc convertible
preferred stock with a stated maturity of
2033.
the company recorded the junior notes
and seriesc preferred stock on the date of
exchange at their fair values of $170
million and $270million, respectively, for
a total of $440million. together with the
$225million cash, the total amount recorded
on the date of exchange was $665million. a
gain of $365million was included in net income at that date for the
difference between the $665million fair
value received and the net balance sheet
amount of $300million associated with the
seriesb shares.
at december31, 2003, the estimated
fair values of the junior notes and series
c shares totaled $530million. the $90
million increase from the $440million
recorded in august was recorded to
investments and advances, with an
offsetting amount in other comprehensive
income. future temporary changes in the
estimated fair values of the new securities
likewise will be reported in other
comprehensive income. however, if any
future decline in fair value is deemed to
be other than temporary, a charge against
income in the period would be recorded.
interest that accrues on the notes and
dividends payable
on the preferred stock is recognized
in income each period.
in addition to the $365million gain
recorded in income in the third quarter
2003, the company recorded $170million
directly to retained earnings. the
latter amount represented the companys
approximate 26percent equity share of a
gain recorded by dynegy in connection with
the seriesb exchange transaction. under

stock redemptions, chevrontexaco increased its earnings per
share in the third quarter 2003 by $0.16 for the effect of the $170
million recorded directly to retained earnings.
in february2004, dynegy announced agreement to sell its
illinois power subsidiary to ameren corporation. the sale is
conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of approvals
from governmental and regulatory agencies. pending these
approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter
of 2004. the sale of illinois power triggers a mandatory prepayment provision in the dynegy junior notes held by the company.
under the terms of that provision, 75percent of the net proceeds,
not including any amounts used for the payment of any debt
associated with illinois power, are to be used to retire at par, plus
accrued interest, the $225million face value notes.
liquidity and capital resources
cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5.3 billion and $3.8billion at december31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was $12.3billion,
compared with $9.9billion in 2002 and $11.5billion in 2001. the
2003 increase in cash provided by operating activities mainly
higher earnings helped boost
the companys operating cash
flow by 24percent.
interest expense fell 16percent on significantly lower debt levels.
reflected higher earnings in the u.s. upstream and worldwide
downstream businesses. cash provided by asset sales was $1.1
billion in 2003, $2.3billion in 2002 and about $300million in
2001. in 2002, the company received proceeds of $2.2billion,
including dividends due, from the ftc-mandated sale of the
companys investments in equilon and motiva. cash provided by
operating activities during 2003 generated sufficient funds for the
companys capital and exploratory expenditure program and the
payment of dividends to stockholders as well as contributing significantly to a reduction of $3.7billion in debt levels, $1.4billion
funding of the companys pension plans and the increase in cash
and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
dividends payments of approximately $3billion in 2003 and
2002 and $2.9billion in 2001 were made for dividends or distributions for common stock, preferred stock and minority interests.
debt, capital lease and minority interest obligations chevron-texacos total debt and capital lease obligations totaled $12.6
billion at december31, 2003, down from $16.3billion at year-end
2002. the company also had minority interest obligations of $268
million, down from $303million at december31, 2002.
the companys debt and capital lease obligations due within
one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $6billion at december
31, 2003, down from $9.5billion at december31, 2002. of these
amounts, $4.3billion and $4.1billion, respectively, were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period. settlement of the
obligations at year-end 2003 was not expected to require the use
of working capital in 2004, as the company had the intent and the
ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance
them on a long-term basis. the companys practice has been to
continually refinance its commercial paper, maintaining levels it
believes appropriate.
at year-end 2003, chevrontexaco had $4.3billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, which permit
the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis.
these facilities support commercial paper borrowings and also can
be used for other general credit requirements. no borrowings were
outstanding under these facilities during the year or at year-end
2003. in addition, the company had three existing effective shelf
registrations on file with the securities and exchange commission
(sec)that together would permit additional registered debt offerings up to an aggregate of $3.8billion of debt securities.
in 2003, the company issued $1billion of new long-term
debt and other financing obligations, including $750million
of 3.375percent chevrontexaco capital notes due in february
2008, $265million of new philippine debt and $19million of
individually smaller issues. proceeds from the chevrontexaco
capital company note issue were used to retire commercial
paper. repayments of long-term debt included $665million of
texaco capital inc. bonds, $143million of philippine debt, $110
million of chevrontexaco corporation 8.11percent notes, $128
million of nigerian debt and $91million of individually smaller
issues. additionally, a $210million payment was made to the
republic of kazakhstan relating to the companys 1993 acquisition of its interest in the tco joint venture. also included in the
companys long-term debt levels was a noncash reduction of $50
million of esop debt.
chevrontexacos senior debt is rated aa by standard
and poors corporation and aa2 by moodys investor service,
except for senior debt of texaco capital inc., which is rated aa3.
chevrontexacos u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poors and prime 1 by moodys, and the companys
canadian commercial paper is rated r-1 (middle)by dominion
bond rating service. all of these ratings denote high-quality,
investment-grade securities.
the companys future debt level is dependent primarily on
results of operations, the capital-spending program and cash that
may be generated from asset dispositions. the company believes
it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash
requirements and, for periods of low prices for crude oil and
natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company believes that it has the flexibility
to increase borrowings and/or modify capital-spending plans to
continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the
companys high-quality debt ratings.
capital and exploratory expenditures for 2003 totaled $7.4
billion, including the companys equity share of affiliates expenditures. capital and exploratory expenditures were $9.3billion
in 2002 and $12billion in 2001. chevrontexacos equity share
of affiliates expenditures were $1.1billion, $1.4billion and $1.7
billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and did not require
cash outlays by the company. expenditures of $5.7billion in
fs-11

international projects accounted
for 71percent of worldwide
exploration and production
expenditures in 2003.
*includes equity in affiliates
2003 for exploration and production activities represented 77
percent of total outlays for the
year, compared with 68percent
in 2002 and 59percent in 2001.
international exploration and
production spending of $4.0billion was 71percent of worldwide
exploration and production
expenditures in 2003, compared
with 70percent in 2002 and 66
percent in 2001, reflecting the
companys continuing focus on
international exploration and
production activities.
expenditures in 2003 were
$1.9billion lower than the prior
year, primarily due to amounts
spent in 2002 for large lease
acquisitions in the north sea
and the gulf of mexico, the
athabasca oil sands project in
western canada, and additional
common stock investments in
dynegy. the largest expenditures in 2003 included upstream
projects in eurasia, west africa and the gulf of mexico. expenditures in 2002 included lower additional investments in equity
affiliates than in 2001 due to the absence of the companys share
of expenditures for its equilon and motiva investments, which
were sold as a condition of the merger. the 2001 expenditures
included additional investments in tco and dynegy, including
the purchase of $1.5billion of dynegy preferred stock.
including the share of spending by affiliates, the company estimates 2004 capital and exploratory expenditures at
$8.5billion, which is about 15percent higher than spending in
2003. about $6.4billion, or 75percent of the total, is targeted
for exploration and production activities, with $4.5billion of
that outside the united states. the upstream spending is targeted for the most promising exploratory prospects in nigeria,
angola and deepwater gulf of mexico and major development
projects in kazakhstan, venezuela and africa. included in the
upstream expenditures is about $400million to commercialize
the companys international natural gas resource base, including
the construction of additional liquefied natural gas (lng)facilities to help meet future demand for natural gas. additional lng
expenditures of about $100million are included in other segments of the 2004 capital program.
worldwide downstream spending is estimated to be $1.4
billion, with about $1billion of the amount on refining and marketing and $400million on supply and transportation projects.
investments in chemicals are budgeted at $200million. estimates
for power and related businesses are $150million. the remaining
$300million is primarily for emerging technologies and information technology infrastructure.

pension obligations in 2003, contributions to the u.s. plans
totaled $1.2billion. in early 2004, the company contributed $535
million to the u.s. pension plans. additionally, the company
anticipates contributing about $50million to the u.s. plans
during the remainder of the year. in years subsequent to 2004,
the company expects contributions to the u.s. pension plans of
about $250million per year, approximately equal to the cost of
benefits earned in each year. in 2003, contributions to the international pension plans were $214million and contributions of
$200million are anticipated in 2004. the actual contribution
amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in
pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan
obligations. refer also to the discussion of pension accounting in
critical accounting estimates and assumptions beginning on
page fs-18.
financial ratios
current ratio  current assets divided by current liabilities.
generally, two items adversely affected chevrontexacos current
ratio, but in the companys opinion do not affect its liquidity. first, current assets in all
chevrontexacos ratio of total
debt to total debt plus equity
fell to 25.8percent at year-end
2003 as the companys debt
level declined by $3.7billion.
years
included inventories valued on
a lifo basis, which at year-end
2003 were lower than replacement costs, based on average
acquisition costs during the year,
by approximately $2.1billion.
second, the company benefits
from lower interest rates available on short-term debt by
continually refinancing its commercial paper; however, the
companys proportionately large
amount of short-term debt in
2002 and 2001 kept its current
ratio at relatively low levels.
interest
coverage ratio
income before income tax
expense, plus interest and debt
expense and amortization of
capitalized interest, divided by
before-tax interest costs. the
companys interest coverage ratio
was higher in 2003, primarily due
to higher before-tax income, lower average debt balances and
lower market interest rates.
debt ratio  total debt divided by total debt plus equity.
this ratio was approximately 26percent at december31, 2003,
compared with 34percent a year earlier.

contingencies associated with the sale
of the companys interest in equilon
and motiva in 2002, as discussed in the
indemnifications
section on page fs-14.
at december31, 2003, the company and its subsidiaries provided guarantees, either directly or indirectly, of $917million in
guarantees for notes and other contractual obligations of affiliated companies and $256million for third parties as described,
by major category, below. there are no amounts being carried as
liabilities for the companys obligations under these guarantees.
of the $917million in guarantees provided to affiliates, $716
million relate to borrowings for capital projects or general corporate purposes. these guarantees were undertaken to achieve
lower interest rates and generally cover the construction period
of the capital projects. approximately 75percent of the amounts
guaranteed will expire in 2004, with the remaining guarantees
expiring by the end of 2015. under the terms of the guarantees,
the company would be required to fulfill the guarantee should
an affiliate be in default of its loan terms, generally for the full
amounts disclosed. there are no recourse provisions, and no
assets are held as collateral for these guarantees.
the company provides guarantees of $201million relating to
obligations in connection with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of its cogeneration affiliates. under the terms of
these guarantees, the company may be required to make payments
under certain conditions if the affiliate does not perform under
the agreements. there are no recourse provisions to third parties,
and no assets are held as collateral for these pricing guarantees.
guarantees of $256million have been provided to third
parties, including guarantees of approximately $110million of
construction loans to host governments in the companys international upstream operations. the remaining guarantees of
$146million were provided principally as conditions of sale of
the companys interest in certain operations, to provide a source
of liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with
company marketing programs. no amounts of the companys
obligations under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities.
about 75percent of the total amounts guaranteed will expire
in 2004, with the remainder expiring after 2004. the company
would be required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in default of its loan or contract terms,
generally for the full amounts disclosed. approximately $100million of the guarantees have recourse provisions, which enable the
company to recover any payments made under the terms of the
guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties assets.
at december31, 2003, chevrontexaco had outstanding
guarantees for approximately $238million of equilon debt and
leases. following the february2002 disposition of its interest in
equilon, the company received an indemnification from shell
fs-13
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
oil company (shell) for any claims arising
from the guarantees. accordingly, the
company has not recorded a liability for
these guarantees. approximately 50percent
of the amounts guaranteed will expire within
the 20042008 period, with the guarantees of
the remaining amounts expiring by 2019.
indemnificationsthe company also
provided certain indemnities of contingent
liabilities of equilon and motiva to shell
and saudi refining inc. in connection with
the february2002 sale of the companys
interests in those investments. the
indemnities cover certain contingent
liabilities, including those associated with
the unocal patent litigation. the company
would be required to perform should the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses
and could be required to make maximum future
payments of $300million. the company has
paid approximately $28million under these
contingencies and has disputed approximately
$34million in claims submitted by shell
under these indemnities. shell has requested
arbitration of this dispute, which is
expected to occur in mid-2004. there are no
recourse provisions enabling recovery of any
amounts from third parties nor are any
assets held as collateral. within five years
of the february2002 sale, at the buyers
option, the company also may be required to
purchase certain assets from shell for their
respective net book values, as determined at
the time of the companys purchase. under
these terms, the company purchased two
lubricant facilities in late 2003 for
immaterial amounts.
the company has also provided
indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities related to assets
originally contributed by texaco to the
equilon and motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior
to the formation of equilon and motiva or
that occurred during the periods of
chevrontexacos ownership interests in the
joint ventures. in general, the
environmental conditions or events that are
subject to these indemnities must have
arisen prior to december2001. claims
relating to equilon must be asserted no
later than february2009, and claims
relating to motiva must be asserted no
later than february2012. under the terms
of the indemnities, there is no maximum
limit on the amount of potential future
payments. the company has not recorded any
liabilities for possible claims under these
indemnities. the company holds no assets as
collateral and has made no payments under
the indemnities.
the amounts payable for the
indemnities described above are to be net
of amounts recovered from insurance
carriers and others and net of liabilities
recorded by equilon or motiva prior to
september30, 2001, for any specific
incident.
securitizationin other
off-balance-sheet arrangements, the
company securitizes certain retail and
trade accounts receivable in its downstream
business through the use of qualifying
special purpose entities (spes). at
december31, 2003, approximately $1
billion, representing about 11percent of
chevrontexacos total current accounts
receivable balance, were securitized.
chevrontexacos total estimated financial
exposure under these arrangements at
december31, 2003, was approximately $75
million. these arrangements have the effect
of accelerating chevrontexacos collection
of the securitized amounts. in the event
the spes experienced major defaults in the
collection of receivables, chevrontexaco
believes that it would have no loss
exposure connected with third-party
investments in these securitization
arrangements.
long-term unconditional purchase
obligations and commitments, throughput
agreements, and take-or-pay agreementsthe
company and its subsidiaries have certain
other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations
and commitments, throughput agreements, and
take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate
to suppliers financing arrangements. the
agreements typically provide goods and
services, such as pipeline and storage
capacity, utilities, and petroleum products,
to be used or sold in the ordinary course of
the companys business. the aggregate
amounts of required payments under these
various commitments are: 2004  $1.2
billion; 2005  $1.1billion; 2006  $1
billion; 2007  $1billion; 2008  $1
billion; 2009 and after  $1.9billion.
total payments under the agreements were
approximately $1.4billion in 2003, $1.2
billion in 2002 and $1.5billion in 2001.
the most significant take-or-pay agreement
calls for the company to purchase
approximately 55,000 barrels per day of
refined products from an equity affiliate
refiner in thailand. this purchase agreement
is in conjunction with the financing of a
refinery owned by the affiliate and expires
in 2009. the future estimated commitments
under this contract are: 2004  $700
million; 2005  $800million; 2006  $800
million; 2007  $800million; 2008  $800
million; 2009  $800million.
minority intereststhe company has
commitments related to preferred shares of
subsidiary companies that are accounted for
as minority interest. texaco capital llc, a
wholly owned finance subsidiary, has issued
$65million of deferred preferred shares
seriesc. dividends of approximately $60
million on seriesc, at a rate of 7.17
percent compounded annually, will be paid at
the redemption date in february2005 unless
earlier redemption occurs. early redemption
may result upon the occurrence of certain
specific events. mvp production inc., a
subsidiary, redeemed variable rate
cumulative preferred shares of $75million
owned by one minority holder during 2003.

financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instrumentschevrontexaco
is exposed to market risks
related to the volatility of crude oil,
refined products, natural gas and refinery
feedstock prices. the company uses
derivative commodity instruments to manage
its exposure to price volatility on a small
portion of its activity, including: firm
commitments and anticipated transactions
for the purchase or sale of crude oil;
feedstock purchases for company refineries;
crude oil and refined products inventories;
and fixed-price contracts to sell natural
gas and natural gas liquids.
the company also uses derivative
commodity instruments for trading purposes,
the results of which were not material to
the companys financial position, net
income or cash flows in 2003.
the companys positions are monitored
and managed on a daily basis by an internal
risk control group to ensure compliance with
the companys risk management policy that
has been approved by the audit committee of
the companys board of directors.
the derivative instruments used in the
companys risk management and trading
activities consist mainly of futures
contracts traded on the new york mercantile
exchange and the international petroleum
exchange; crude oil and natural gas swap
contracts; options and other derivative
products entered into principally with
major financial institutions; and other oil
and gas companies. virtually all
derivatives beyond those designated as
normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the
consolidated balance sheet with resulting
gains and losses reflected in income. fair
values are derived principally from market
quotes and other independent third-party
quotes.
the aggregate effect of a 10percent
change in prices for derivative contracts
for natural gas, crude oil and petroleum
products would be approximately $20
million. the hypothetical effect on these
contracts was estimated by calculating the
cash value of the contracts as the
difference between the hypothetical and
contract delivery prices, multiplied by the
contract amounts.
foreign currencythe company enters
into forward exchange contracts, generally
with terms of 180days or less, to manage
some of its foreign currency exposures.
these exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including
foreign currency capital expenditures and
lease commitments, forecasted to occur
within 180days. the forward exchange
contracts are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and
losses reflected in income.
the aggregate effect on foreign
exchange contracts of a hypothetical 10
percent change to year-end exchange rates
would be approximately $35million.
interest ratesthe company enters into
interest rate swaps as part of its overall
strategy to manage the interest rate risk on
its debt. under the terms of the swaps, net
cash settlements are based on the difference
between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to
agreed notional principal amounts. interest
rate swaps related to a portion of the
companys fixed-rate debt are accounted for
as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate
swaps relating to a portion of the companys
floating-rate debt are recorded at fair
value on the balance sheet with resulting
gains and losses reflected in income. during
2003, no new swaps were initiated. at
year-end 2003, the weighted average maturity
of receive fixed interest rate swaps was
approximately five years. there were no
receive floating swaps outstanding at year
end.
a hypothetical 10percent increase in
interest rates upon the interest rate swaps
would cause the fair value of the receive
fixed swaps to decline and the receive
floating swaps to increase. the aggregate
effect of these changes would be
approximately $10million.
transactions with related parties
chevrontexaco enters into a number of
business arrangements with related parties,
principally its equity affiliates. these
arrangements include long-term supply or
offtake agreements. in january2003,
chevrontexaco and dynegy agreed to
terminate the natural gas sale and purchase
agreements. internationally, there are
long-term purchase agreements in place with
the companys refining affiliate in
thailand. refer to page fs-14 for further
discussion. management believes the
foregoing agreements and others have been
negotiated on terms consistent with those
that would have been negotiated with an
unrelated party.
litigation and other contingencies
unocal patent litigationchevron, texaco
and four other oil companies (refiners)
filed suit in 1995, contesting the validity
of a patent (393 patent) granted to
unocal corporation (unocal) for certain
reformulated gasoline blends. chevrontexaco
sells reformulated gasolines in california
in certain months of the year. in march
2000, the u.s. court of appeals for the
federal circuit upheld a september1998
district court decision that unocals
patent was valid and enforceable and
assessed damages of 5.75 cents per gallon
for gasoline produced during the summer of
1996 that infringed on the claims of the
patent. in february2001, the
u.s. supreme court concluded it would not
review the lower courts ruling, and the
case was sent back to the district court
for an accounting of all infringing
gasoline produced after august1, 1996. the
district court ruled that the
fs-15
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
per-gallon damages awarded by the jury are limited to infringement that occurs in california only. additionally, the u.s. patent
and trademark office (uspto)granted three petitions by the
refiners to re-examine the validity of unocals 393 patent and
has twice rejected all of the claims in the 393 patent. those
rejections have been appealed by unocal to the uspto board
of appeals. the district court judge requested further briefing
and advised that she would not enter a final judgment in this
case until the uspto had completed its re-examination of the
393 patent. during 2002 and 2003, the uspto granted two
petitions for reexamination of another unocal patent, the 126
patent. the uspto has rejected the validity of the claims of the
126 patent, which could affect a larger share of u.s. gasoline
production. separately, in march2003, the federal trade
commission (ftc)filed a complaint against unocal alleging
that its conduct during the pendency of the patents was in violation of antitrust law. in november2003, the administrative law
judge dismissed the complaint brought by the ftc. the ftc has
appealed the decision.
unocal has obtained additional patents that could affect a
larger share of u.s. gasoline production. chevrontexaco believes
these additional patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not
infringed. the companys financial exposure in the event of
unfavorable conclusions to the patent litigation and regulatory
reviews may include royalties, plus interest, for production of
gasoline that is proved to have infringed the patents. the competitive and financial effects on the companys refining and
marketing operations, although presently indeterminable, could
be material. chevrontexaco has been accruing in the normal
course of business any future estimated liability for potential
infringement of the 393 patent covered by the 1998 trial courts
ruling. in 2000, prior to the merger, chevron and texaco made
payments to unocal totaling approximately $30million for the
original court ruling, including interest and fees.
mtbe another issue involving the company is the petroleum industrys use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe)as a
gasoline additive and its potential environmental impact through
seepage into groundwater. along with other oil companies, the
company is a party to more than 60 lawsuits and claims related
to the use of the chemical mtbe in certain oxygenated gasolines.
these actions may require the company to correct or ameliorate
the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of mtbe
by the company or other parties. additional lawsuits and claims
related to the use of mtbe, including personal-injury claims,
may be filed in the future. the companys ultimate exposure
related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable,
but could be material to net income in any one period. chevron-texaco has reduced the use of mtbe in gasoline it manufactures
in the united states, including the complete phase-out of mtbe
in california before the end of 2003.
reserves for environmental
remediation increased 5
percent during 2003.
expenditures during the
year were approximately $200
million.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental
laws and regulations that in the future may require the company to take action
to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals
or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the company or other parties.
such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not limited
to: superfund sites and refineries, oil fields, service stations, terminals,
and land development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. the following table
displays the annual changes to the companys before-tax environmental remediation
reserves, including those for superfund
sites. in 2003, the company recorded additional provisions
for estimated remediation costs, primarily at refined products
marketing sites and various closed or divested facilities in the
united states.

as of december31, 2003, chevrontexaco had been identified by the environmental protection agency (epa)or other
regulatory agencies under the provisions of the u.s. superfund
law as a potentially responsible party or otherwise involved in the
remediation of 218 sites. the companys remediation reserve for
these sites at year-end 2003 was $113million. the superfund law
provides for joint and several liability for all responsible parties.
any future actions by the epa and other regulatory agencies to
require chevrontexaco to assume other potentially responsible
parties costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected
to have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial
position or liquidity.
it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental
remediation relating to past operations. these future costs are
indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of
possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the
corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and
the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. although the amount of future costs may be material to the
companys results of operations in the period in which they are
recognized, the company does not expect these costs will have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to
make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
fs-16

impact on the companys competitive
position relative to other petroleum or
chemicals companies.
prior to january1, 2003, additional
reserves for dismantlement, abandonment and
restoration of its worldwide oil, gas and
coal properties at the end of their
productive lives, which included costs
related to environmental issues, were
recognized on a unit-of-production basis.
effective january1, 2003, the company
implemented financial accounting standards
board statement no.143, accounting for
asset retirement obligations (fas 143).
under fas 143, the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation is
recorded when there is a legal obligation
associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets and the liability can be reasonably
estimated. the liability balance for asset
retirement obligations at year-end 2003 was
$2.9billion. refer also to note 25 on page
fs-50 related to fas 143.
for the companys other ongoing
operating assets, such as refineries and
chemicals facilities, no provisions are made
for exit or cleanup costs that may be
required when such assets reach the end of
their useful lives unless a decision to sell
or otherwise abandon the facility has been
made, as the indeterminate settlement dates
for the asset retirements prevent estimation
of the fair value of the asset retirement
obligation.
refer to environmental matters
below for additional information related
to environmental matters.
income taxes the company estimates its
income tax expense and liabilities annually.
these liabilities generally are not
finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the
end of the annual period for which income
taxes have been estimated. the u.s. federal
income tax liabilities have been settled
through 1996 for chevrontexaco (formerly
chevron), 1993 for chevrontexaco global
energy inc. (formerly caltex), and 1991 for
texaco. california franchise tax liabilities
have been settled through 1991 for chevron
and through 1987 for texaco. settlement of
open tax years, as well as tax issues in
other countries where the company conducts
its businesses, is not expected to have a
material effect on the consolidated
financial position or liquidity of the
company, and in the opinion of management,
adequate provision has been made for income
and franchise taxes for all years under
examination or subject to future
examination.
global operations chevrontexaco and its
affiliates have operations in more than 180
countries. areas in which the company and
its affiliates have major operations include
the united states, canada, australia, the
united kingdom, norway, denmark, france,
partitioned neutral zone between kuwait and
saudi arabia, republic of congo, angola,
nigeria, chad, cameroon, equatorial guinea,
democratic republic of congo, south africa,
indonesia, the philippines, singapore,
china, thailand, venezuela, argentina,
brazil, colombia, trinidad and tobago, and
south korea. the companys tengizchevroil
affiliate operates in kazakhstan. the
companys caspian pipeline consortium (cpc)
affiliate operates in russia and kazakhstan.
the companys chevron phillips chemical
company llc affiliate manufactures and
markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a
worldwide basis, with manufacturing
facilities in the united states, puerto
rico, singapore, china, south korea, saudi
arabia, qatar, mexico and belgium.
the companys operations, particularly
exploration and production, can be affected
by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various
countries in which it operates, including
the united states. as has occurred in the
past, actions could be taken by host
governments to increase public ownership of
the companys partially or wholly owned
businesses and/or to impose additional taxes
or royalties on the companys operations.
in
certain locations, host governments have
imposed restrictions, controls and taxes,
and in others, political conditions have
existed that may threaten the safety of
employees and the companys continued
presence in those countries. internal unrest
or strained relations between a host
government and the company or other
governments may affect the companys
operations. those developments have, at times,
significantly affected the companys related
operations and results and are carefully
considered by management when evaluating the
level of current and future activity in such
countries.
equity redetermination for oil and gas
producing operations, ownership agreements
may provide for periodic reassessments of
equity interests in estimated oil and gas
reserves. these activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses that
could be material to earnings in any given
period. one such equity redetermination
process has been under way since 1996 for
chevrontexacos interests in four producing
zones at the naval petroleum reserve at elk
hills, california, for the time when the
remaining interests in these zones were
owned by the u.s. department of energy. a
wide range remains for a possible net
settlement amount for the four zones.
chevrontexaco currently estimates its
maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200million. at the same
time, a possible maximum net amount that
could be owed to chevrontexaco is estimated
at about $50million. the timing of the
settlement and the exact amount within this
range of estimates is uncertain.
suspended wells the company also
suspends the costs of exploratory wells
pending a final determination of the
commercial potential of the related oil and
gas fields. the ultimate disposition of
these well costs is dependent on the results
of future drilling activity and/or
development decisions. if the company
decides not to continue development, the
costs of these wells are expensed. at
december31, 2003, the company had $658
million of suspended exploratory wells
included in properties, plant and equipment,
an increase of $208million from 2002 and a
decrease of $30million from 2001. the
increase in 2003 primarily reflects drilling
activities in the united states and nigeria.
other contingencies chevrontexaco
receives claims from and submits claims to
customers, trading partners, u.s. federal,
state and local regulatory bodies, host
governments, contractors, insurers and
suppliers. the amounts of these claims,
individually and in the aggregate, may be
significant and may take lengthy periods of
time to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also
continue to review and analyze their
operations and may close, abandon, sell,
exchange, acquire or restructure assets to
achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness
and profitability. these activities,
individually or together, may result in
gains or losses in future periods.
environmental matters
virtually all aspects of the businesses in
which the company engages are subject to
various federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations. these regulatory requirements
continue to increase in both number and
complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its
operations, but also the products it sells.
most of the costs of complying with laws and
regulations pertaining to company operations
and products are embedded in the normal
costs of doing business.
fs-17
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
accidental leaks and spills requiring
cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of
business. in addition to the costs for
environmental protection associated with
its ongoing operations and products, the
company may incur expenses for corrective
actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned
waste-disposal sites used by the company.
an obligation may arise when operations are
closed or sold and at non-chevrontexaco
sites where company products have been
handled or disposed of. most of the
expenditures to fulfill these obligations
relate to facilities and sites where past
operations followed practices and
procedures that were considered acceptable
at the time but now require investigative
and/or remedial work to meet current
standards. using definitions and guidelines
established by the american petroleum
institute, chevrontexaco estimated its
worldwide environmental spending in 2003 at
approximately $1.1billion for its
consolidated companies. included in these
expenditures were $305million of
environmental capital expenditures and $820
million of costs associated with the
control and abatement of hazardous
substances and pollutants from ongoing
operations.
for 2004, total worldwide environmental
capital expenditures are estimated at $430
million. these capital costs are in addition
to the ongoing costs of complying with
environmental regulations and the costs to
remediate previously contaminated sites.
it is not possible to predict with
certainty the amount of additional
investments in new or existing facilities or
amounts of incremental operating costs to be
incurred in the future to: prevent, control,
reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous
materials into the environment; comply with
existing and new environmental laws or
regulations; or remediate and restore areas
damaged by prior releases of hazardous
materials. although these costs may be
significant to the results of operations in
any single period, the company does not
expect them to have a material effect on the
companys liquidity or financial position.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions
management makes many estimates and
assumptions in the
application of generally accepted
accounting principles (gaap)that may have
a material impact on the companys
consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures and on the
comparability of such information over
different reporting periods. all such
estimates and assumptions affect reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses as well as disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities.
estimates and assumptions are based on
managements experience and other
information available prior to the issuance
of the financial statements. materially
different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional
information becomes known.
the discussion in this section of
critical accounting estimates or
assumptions is according to the disclosure
guidelines of the securities and exchange
commission (sec), wherein:
1.
the nature of the estimates or
assumptions is material due to the
levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly
uncertain matters, or the
susceptibility of such matters to
change, and
2.
the impact of the estimates and
assumptions on the companys
financial condition or operating
performance is material.
besides those meeting the critical
criteria, the company makes many other
accounting estimates and assumptions in
preparing its financial statements and
related disclosures. although not associated
with highly uncertain matters, these
estimates and assumptions are also subject
to revision as circumstances warrant, and
materially different results may sometimes
occur.
for example, the recording of deferred
tax assets requires an assessment under the
accounting rules that the future realization
of the associated tax benefits be more
likely than not. another example is the
estimation of oil and gas reserves under sec
rules that require ...geological and
engineering data (that)demonstrate with
reasonable certainty (reserves)to be
recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs
as of the date the estimate is made. refer
to table v, reserve quantity information,
on page fs-57 for the changes in these
estimates for the three years ending
december31, 2003, and to table vii,
changes in the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows from proved
reserves, on page fs-59 for estimates of
proved-reserve values for each year-end
20012003, which were based on year-end
prices at the time. note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements includes a
description of the successful efforts
method of accounting for oil and gas
exploration and production activities. the
estimates of crude oil and natural gas
reserves are important to the timing of
expense recognition for costs incurred.
the discussion of the critical
accounting policy for impairment of
property, plant and equipment and
investments in affiliates on pages fs-19
and fs-20 includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved
reserve quantities could result in
impairments of oil and gas properties.
this commentary should be read in
conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in
this discussion and in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements related to
estimates, uncertainties, contingencies and
new accounting standards. significant
accounting policies are discussed in note 1
to the consolidated financial statements
beginning on page fs-28. the development and
selection of accounting estimates and
assumptions, including those deemed
critical, and the associated disclosures in
this discussion have been discussed by
management with the audit committee of the
board of directors.
the areas of accounting and the
associated critical estimates and
assumptions made by the company are as
follows:
pension and other postretirement
benefit plans the determination of pension
plan expense and the requirements for
funding of the companys major pension plans
are based on a number of actuarial
assumptions. two critical assumptions are
the rate of return on pension plan assets
and the discount rate applied to pension
plan obligations. for other postretirement
employee benefit (opeb)plans, which provide
for certain health care and life insurance
for qualifying retired employees and which
are not funded, critical assumptions in
determining opeb expense are the discount
rate applied to benefit obligations and the
assumed health care cost-trend rates used in
the calculation of benefit obligations.
fs-18
table of contents
note 21 to the consolidated financial
statements, beginning on page fs-42,
includes information for the three years
ending december31, 2003, on the components
of pension and opeb expense and the
underlying discount rate assumptions as well
as on the funded status for the companys
pension plans at the end of 2003 and 2002.
to determine the estimate of long-term
rate of return on pension assets, the
company employs a rigorous process that
incorporates actual historical asset-class
returns and an assessment of expected future
performance, and takes into consideration
external actuarial advice and asset-class
risk factors. asset allocations are
regularly updated using pension plan
asset/liability studies, and the
determination of the companys estimates of
long-term rates of return are consistent
with these studies. for example, at december
31, 2003 and 2002, the estimated long-term
rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets,
which account for about 70percent of the
companys pension plan assets, was 7.8
percent, as compared with 9percent at the
end of 2001. the year-end market-related
value of u.s. pension-plan assets used in
the determination of pension expense was
based on the market values in the preceding
three months as opposed to the maximum
allowable period of five years under u.s.
accounting rules. management considers the
three-month time period long enough to
minimize the effects of distortions from
day-to-day market volatility and still be
contemporaneous to the end of the year.
the discount rate used in the
determination of pension benefit obligations
and pension expense is based on high-quality
fixed income investment interest rates. at
december31, 2003, the company calculated
the u.s. pension obligations using a 6.0
percent discount rate. the discount rates
used at the end of 2002 and 2001 were 6.8
percent and 7.3percent, respectively.
an increase in the expected return on
pension plan assets or the discount rate
would reduce pension plan expense, and vice
versa. total pension expense for 2003
was $697million. as an indication of
interest-rate sensitivity to the
determination of pension expense, a 1
percent increase in the expected return on
assets of the companys primary u.s. pension
plan, which accounted for about 61percent
of the companywide pension obligation, would
have reduced total pension plan expense for
2003 by approximately $30million. a 1
percent increase in the discount rate for
this same plan would have reduced total
benefit plan expense by approximately $120
million. the actual rates of return on plan
assets and discount rates may vary
significantly from estimates because of
unanticipated changes in the worlds
financial markets.
based on the expected changes in
pension plan asset values and pension
obligations in 2004, the company does not
believe any significant funding of the
pension plans will be mandatory during the
year. for the u.s. plans, this determination
was made in accordance with the minimum
funding standard of the employee retirement
income security act (erisa). however, the
company made discretionary contributions of
$535million to u.s. plans in early 2004.
later in 2004, additional discretionary
payments of $200million and $50million for
the international and u.s. plans,
respectively, are anticipated.
pension expense is included on the
consolidated statement of income in
operating expenses or selling, general
and administrative expenses and applies to
all business segments. depending upon the
funding status of the different plans,
either a long-term prepaid asset or a
long-term liability is recorded for plans
with overfunding or underfunding,
respectively. any unfunded accumulated
benefit obligation in excess of recorded
liabilities is recorded in other
comprehensive income. see note
21 to the consolidated financial statements
beginning on page fs-42 for the
pension-related balance sheet effects at
the end of 2003 and 2002.
for the companys opeb plans, expense
for 2003 was $228million and was also
recorded as operating expenses or
selling, general and administrative
expenses in all business segments. the
discount rate applied to the companys
u.s. opeb obligations at december31, 2003
was 6.0percent  the same discount rate
used for u.s. pension obligations. the
assumed health care cost-trend rates used
to calculate opeb obligations starting in
2003 was an 8.4percent cost increase over
the previous year gradually dropping over
four years to a long-term ultimate
rate-increase assumption of 4.5percent
for 2007 and thereafter. the health care
cost-trend increase assumption and
duration to reach that rate are company
estimates, developed in consultation with
external consultants, and are consistent
with the companys actual experience.
as an indication of discount-rate
sensitivity to the determination of opeb
expense in 2003, a 1percent increase in
the discount rate for the companys
primary u.s. opeb plan, which accounted
for the significant majority of the
companywide opeb obligation, would have
decreased opeb expense by approximately
$10million.
impairment of property, plant and
equipment and investments in affiliates the
company assesses its property, plant and
equipment (pp&e) for possible impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of the assets may
not be recoverable. such indicators include
changes in the companys business plans,
changes in commodity prices and for oil and
gas properties, significant downward
revisions of estimated proved reserve
quantities. if the carrying value of an
asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash
flows expected from the asset, an impairment
charge is recorded for the excess of
carrying value of the asset over its fair
value.
determination as to whether and how
much an asset is impaired involves
management estimates on highly uncertain
matters such as future commodity prices, the
effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses and the
outlook for global or regional market supply
and demand conditions for crude oil, natural
gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. however, the impairment reviews
and calculations are based on assumptions
that are consistent with the companys
business plans and long-term investment
decisions.
the amount and income statement
classification of major impairments of pp&e
for the three years ending december31,
2003, are included in the commentary on the
business segments elsewhere in this
discussion, as well as in note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements on pages
fs-30 and fs-31. an estimate as to the
sensitivity to earnings for these periods if
other assumptions had been used in the
impairment reviews and impairment
calculations is not practicable, given the
broad range of the companys pp&e and the
number of assumptions involved in the
estimates. that is, favorable changes to
some assumptions might have avoided the need
to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have
caused an additional unknown number of other
assets to become impaired.
investments in common stock of
affiliates that are accounted for under the
equity method as well as investments in
other securities of these equity investees
are reviewed for impairment when the fair
value of the investment falls below the
companys carrying value. when such a
decline is deemed to be other than
temporary, an impairment charge is recorded
to the
fs-19
table of contents
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
income statement for the difference between the investments carrying value and
its estimated fair value at the time. in making the determination as to whether
a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the
duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and
the companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that
will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments
market value. differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is
impaired in any period and the amount of the impairment and are not subject to
sensitivity analysis.
from time to time, the company performs
impairment reviews and determines that no
write-down in the carrying value of an asset
or asset group is required. for example,
when significant downward revisions to crude
oil and natural gas reserves are made for
any single field or concession, an
impairment review is performed to determine
if the carrying value of the asset remains
recoverable. also, if the expectation of
sale of a particular asset or asset group in
any period has been deemed more likely than
not, an impairment review is performed, and
if the estimated net proceeds exceed the
carrying value of the asset or asset group,
no impairment charge is required. such
calculations are reviewed each
period until the asset or asset group
is disposed of. assets that are not impaired
on a held-and-used basis could possibly
become impaired if a decision was made to
sell such assets and the estimated proceeds
were less than the associated carrying
values.
contingent losses management also makes
judgments and estimates in recording
liabilities for claims, litigation, tax
matters and environmental remediation.
actual costs can frequently vary from
estimates for a variety of reasons. for
example, the costs from settlement of claims
and litigation can vary from estimates based
on differing interpretations of laws,
opinions on culpability and assessments on
the amount of damages. similarly,
liabilities for environmental remediation
are subject to change because of changes in
laws, regulations and their interpretation;
the determination of additional information
on the extent and nature of site
contamination; and improvements in
technology.
under the accounting rules, a
liability is recorded for these types of
contingencies if management determines the
loss to be both probable and estimable. the
company generally records these losses as
operating expenses or selling, general
and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of income. refer to
the business segment discussions elsewhere
in this discussion and in note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements on pages
fs-30 and fs-31 for the effect on earnings
from losses associated with certain
litigation and environmental remediation
and tax matters for the three years ended
december31, 2003.
an estimate as to the sensitivity to
earnings for these periods if other
assumptions had been used in recording
these liabilities is not practical because
of the number of contingencies that must be
assessed, the number of underlying
assumptions and the wide range of
reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of
both the probability of loss and the
estimates of such loss.
new accounting standards
in january2003, the financial accounting
standards board (fasb)issued
interpretation no.46, "consolidation of
variable interest entities (fin 46). fin
46 amended accounting research bulletin
(arb)51, consolidated financial
statements, and established standards for
determining circumstances under which a
variable interest entity (vie)should be
consolidated by its primary beneficiary.
fin 46 also requires disclosures about vies
that the company is not required to
consolidate but in which it has a
significant variable interest. in december
2003, the fasb issued fin 46-r, which not
only included amendments to fin 46, but
also required application of the
interpretation to all affected entities no
later than march31, 2004 for calendar-year
reporting companies. prior to this
requirement, however, companies must apply
the interpretation to special-purpose
entities by december31, 2003. the adoption
of fin 46-r as it relates to
special-purpose entities did not have a
material impact on the companys results of
operations, financial position or
liquidity, and the company does not expect
a material impact upon its full adoption of
the interpretation as of march31, 2004.
accounting for mineral interests investment
the sec has questioned certain public
companies in the oil and gas and mining
industries as to the proper accounting for,
and reporting of, acquired contractual
mineral interests under fasb statement no.
141, business combinations (fas 141), and
fasb statement no.142, goodwill and
intangible assets (fas 142). these
accounting standards became effective for
the company on july1, 2001, and january1,
2002, respectively.
at issue is whether such mineral interest
costs should be classified on the balance
sheet as part of properties, plant and
equipment or as intangible assets. the
company will continue to classify these
costs as properties, plant and equipment
and apportion them to expense in future
periods under the companys existing
accounting policy until authoritative
guidance is provided.
for chevrontexaco, the net book values of
this category of mineral interest investment
at december31, 2003 and 2002, were $3.8
billion and $4.1billion, respectively. if
reclassification of these balances becomes
necessary, the companys statements of
income and cash flows would not be affected.
however, additional disclosures related to
intangible assets would be required as
prescribed under the associated accounting
standards.

summary of significant accounting policies
general chevrontexaco manages its
investments in and provides administrative,
financial and management support to u.s. and
foreign subsidiaries and affiliates that
engage in fully integrated petroleum
operations, chemicals operations and coal
mining activities. in addition,
chevrontexaco holds investments in power
generation and gasification businesses.
collectively, these companies operate in
more than 180 countries. petroleum
operations consist of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and
natural gas; refining crude oil into
finished petroleum products; marketing crude
oil, natural gas and the many products
derived from petroleum; and transporting
crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
products by pipelines, marine vessels, motor
equipment and rail car. chemicals operations
include the manufacture and marketing of
commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lube oil
additives.
in preparing its consolidated
financial statements, the company follows
accounting principles generally accepted in
the united states of america. this requires
the use of estimates and assumptions that
affect the assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses reported in the financial
statements as well as amounts included in
the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. while
the company uses its best estimates and
judgments, actual results could differ from
these estimates as future confirming events
occur.
the nature of the companys
operations and the many countries in which
it operates subject it to changing
economic, regulatory and political
conditions. the company does not believe
it is vulnerable to the risk of near-term
severe impact as a result of any
concentration of its activities.
subsidiary and affiliated companies the
consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of controlled subsidiary
companies more than 50percent owned.
investments in and advances to affiliates
in which the company has a substantial
ownership interest of approximately 20
percent to 50percent or for which the
company exercises significant influence but
not control over policy decisions are
accounted for by the equity method. as part
of that accounting, the company recognizes
gains and losses that arise from the
issuance of stock by an affiliate that
results in changes in the companys
proportionate share of the dollar amount of
the affiliates equity currently in income.
deferred income taxes are provided for
these gains and losses.
investments are assessed for possible
impairment when there are indications that
the fair value of the investment may be
below the companys carrying value. when
such a condition is deemed to be other than
temporary, the carrying value of the
investment is written down to its fair
value, and the amount of the write-down is
included in net income. in making the
determination as to whether
a decline is other than temporary, the
company considers such factors as the
duration and extent of the decline, the
investees financial performance, and the
companys ability and intention to retain
its investment for a period that will be
sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in the investments market value.
the new cost basis of investments in the
common stock of these equity investees is
not changed for subsequent recov-
eries in
fair value. subsequent recoveries in the
carrying value of other investments are
reported in other comprehensive income.
differences between the companys carrying
value of an equity investment and its
underlying equity in the net assets of the
affiliate are assigned to the extent
practicable to specific assets and
liabilities based on the companys analysis
of the various factors giving rise to the
difference. the companys share of the
affiliates reported earnings is adjusted
quarterly to reflect the difference between
these allocated values and the affiliates
historical book values.
derivatives the majority of the companys
activity in commodity derivative
instruments is intended to manage the price
risk posed by physical transactions. for
some of this derivative activity, generally
limited to large, discrete or infrequently
occurring transactions, the company may
elect to apply fair value or cash flow
hedge accounting. for other similar
derivative instruments, generally because
of the short-term nature of the contracts
or their limited use, the company has
elected not to apply hedge accounting, and
changes in the fair value of those
contracts are reflected in current income.
for the companys trading activity, gains
and losses from the derivative instruments
are reported in current income. for
derivative instruments relating to foreign
currency exposures, gains and losses are
reported in current income. interest rate
swaps  hedging a portion of the companys
fixed-rate debt  are accounted for as fair
value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps
relating to a portion of the companys
floating-rate debt are recorded at fair
value on the consolidated balance sheet
with resulting gains and losses reflected
in income.
short-term investments all short-term
investments are classified as available for
sale and are in highly liquid debt or
equity securities. those investments that
are part of the companys cash management
portfolio with original maturities of three
months or less are reported as cash
equivalents. the balance of the short-term
investments is reported as marketable
securities. short-term investments are
marked-to-market with any unrealized gains
or losses included in other comprehensive
income.
inventories crude oil, petroleum products
and chemicals are generally stated at cost,
using a last-in, first-out (lifo)method.
in the aggregate, these costs are below
market. materials, supplies and other
inventories generally are stated at average
cost.
properties, plant and equipment the
successful efforts method is used for oil
and gas exploration and production
activities. all costs for development wells,
related plant and equipment, proved mineral
interests in oil and gas properties, and
related asset retirement obligation (aro)
assets are capitalized. costs of exploratory
wells are capitalized pending determination
of whether
the wells found proved reserves. costs of
wells that are assigned proved reserves
remain capitalized. costs also are
capitalized for wells that find commercially
producible reserves that cannot be
classified as proved, pending one or more of
the following: (1)decisions on additional
major capital expenditures, (2)the results
of additional exploratory wells that are
under way or firmly planned, and (3)
securing final regulatory approvals for
development. otherwise, well costs are
expensed if a deter-
fs-28
table of contents
note 1. summary of significant accounting policies  continued
mination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one
year following completion of drilling. all other exploratory wells and costs
are expensed.
long-lived assets to be held and used,
including proved oil and gas properties,
are assessed for possible impairment by
comparing their carrying values with the
undiscounted future net before-tax cash
flows. events that can trigger assessments
for possible impairments include
write-downs of proved reserves based on
field performance, significant decreases in
the market value of an asset, significant
change in the extent or manner of use,
physical change in an asset, and an
expectation that, more likely than not, a
long-lived asset or asset group will be
sold or otherwise disposed of significantly
before the end of its previously estimated
useful life. impaired assets are written
down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net
before-tax cash flows. for proved oil and
gas properties in the united states, the
company generally performs the impairment
review on an individual field basis.
outside the united states, reviews are
performed on a country, concession or field
basis, as appropriate. impairment amounts
are recorded as incremental depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense.
long-lived assets that are held for
sale are evaluated for possible impairment
by comparing the carrying value with the
fair value less the cost to sell. if the net
book value exceeds the sales value, the
asset is considered impaired resulting in an
adjustment to the lower value.
effective january1, 2003, the company
implemented financial accounting standards
board statement no.143, accounting for
asset retirement obligations (fas 143), in
which the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation is recorded as
an asset and a liability when there is a
legal obligation associated with the
retirement of a long-lived asset and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. see also
note 25 on page fs-50 relating to asset
retirement obligations, which includes
additional information on the companys
adoption of fas 143. previously, for oil,
gas and coal producing properties, a
provision was made through depreciation
expense for anticipated abandonment and
restoration costs at the end of the
propertys useful life.
depreciation and depletion of all
capitalized costs of proved oil and gas
producing properties, except mineral
interests, are expensed using the
unit-of-production method by individual
field as the proved developed reserves are
produced. depletion expenses for
capitalized costs of proved mineral
interests are recognized using the
unit-of-production method by individual
field as the related proved reserves are
produced. periodic valuation provisions for
impairment of capitalized costs of unproved
mineral interests are expensed.
depreciation and depletion expenses
for coal assets are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved
reserves are produced. the capitalized
costs of all other plant and equipment are
depreciated or amortized over their
estimated useful lives. in general, the
declining-balance method is used to
depreciate plant and equipment in the
united states; the straight-line method
generally is used to depreciate
international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.
gains or losses are not recognized for
normal retirements of properties, plant and
equipment subject to composite group
amortization or depreciation. gains or
losses from abnormal retirements are
recorded as expenses and from sales as
other income.
expenditures for maintenance, repairs
and minor renewals to maintain facilities in
operating condition are generally expensed
as incurred. major replacements and renewals
are capitalized.
environmental expenditures environmental
expenditures that relate to ongoing
operations or to conditions caused by past
operations are expensed. expenditures that
create future benefits or contribute to
future revenue generation are capitalized.
liabilities related to future
remediation costs are recorded when
environmental assessments and/or cleanups
are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. for the companys
u.s. and canadian marketing facilities, the
accrual is based in part on the probability
that a future remediation commitment will
be required. for oil, gas and coal
producing properties, a liability for an
asset retirement obligation is made
following fas 143, which the company
implemented effective january1, 2003. see
note 25 on page fs-50 related to fas 143.
for superfund sites, the company
records a liability for its designated
share of the probable and estimable costs
and probable amounts for other potentially
responsible parties when mandated by the
regulatory agencies because the other
parties are not able to pay their
respective shares.
the company records the gross amount
of its liability based on its best estimate
of future costs using currently available
technology and applying current regulations
as well as the companys own internal
environmental policies. future amounts are
not discounted. recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when
receipt is reasonably assured.
currency translation the u.s. dollar is the
functional currency for substantially all
of the companys consolidated operations
and those of its equity affiliates. for
those operations, all gains or losses from
currency translations are currently
included in income. the cumulative
translation effects for those few entities,
both consolidated and affiliated, using
functional currencies other than the u.s.
dollar are included in the currency
translation adjustment in stockholders
equity.
revenue recognition revenues associated with
sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal,
petroleum and chemicals products, and all
other sources are recorded when title passes
to the customer, net of royalties, discounts
and allowances, as applicable. revenues from
natural gas production from properties in
which chevrontexaco has an interest with
other producers are generally recognized on
the basis of the companys net working
interest (entitlement method).
stock compensation at december31, 2003, the
company had stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more
fully in note 22 beginning on page fs-46.
the company accounts for those plans under
the recognition and measurement principles
of accounting principles board (apb)opinion
no.25, accounting for stock issued to
employees, and related interpretations. the
following table illustrates the effect on
net income and earnings per share if the

basis of presentation - merger of chevron
and texaco on october9, 2001, texaco inc.
(texaco) became a wholly owned subsidiary of
chevron corporation (chevron) pursuant to a
merger transaction, and chevron changed its
name to chevrontexaco corporation
(chevrontexaco). the combination was
accounted for as a pooling of interests.
these consolidated financial statements
give retroactive effect to the merger, with
all periods presented as if chevron and
texaco had always been combined. certain
reclassifications have been made to conform
the separate presentations of chevron and
texaco. the reclassifications had no impact
on the amount of net income or stockholders
equity.
the consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of all majority-owned,

loss associated with the sales of the companys interests in equilon and
motiva.
at the time of the merger, each share
of texaco common stock was converted, on a
tax-free basis, into the right to receive
0.77 shares of chevrontexaco common stock.
approximately 425million additional shares
of common stock were issued, representing
about 40percent of the outstanding
chevrontexaco common stock after the
merger.
as a condition of approving the
merger, the u.s. federal trade commission
(ftc)required the divestment of certain
texaco assets: texacos investments in its
u.s. refining, marketing and transportation
affiliates, equilon enterprises llc
(equilon) and motiva enterprises llc
(motiva), as well as other interests in
u.s. natural gas processing and
transportation facilities and general
aviation fuel marketing.
at the time of the merger, texaco
placed its interests in equilon and motiva
in trust, as required by the ftc. because
the company no longer exercised significant
influence over these investments, the
associated accounting method was changed
from equity to cost basis.
net income for 2001 included a loss of
$643, net of a tax benefit of $144 ($0.61
per common share  diluted), related to the
disposition of assets that were required as
a condition of the ftc approval of the
merger and other assets that were made
duplicative by the merger. all such assets
sold as a result of the merger provided net
income of approximately $375 in 2001. the
after-tax loss on these dispositions was
reported as an extraordinary item in
accordance with pooling-of-interests
accounting requirements.
included in the total after-tax loss
was a loss of $564 connected with the sale
of interests in equilon and motiva. proceeds
from the sale, which closed in february
2002, were approximately $2,200.

in 2003, the company recorded
impairments of $103 and $30, respectively,
for various u.s. and international oil and
gas producing properties, reflecting lower
expected recovery of proved reserves or a
write-down to market value for assets in
anticipation of sale. impairments of $123
on downstream assets were for the
conversion of a refinery to a products
terminal and a write-down to market value
for assets in anticipation of sale. also in
2003, chevrontexaco exchanged its dynegy
seriesb preferred stock for cash, notes
and seriesc preferred stock. the $365
difference between the fair value of these
items and the companys carrying value was
included in net income.
in 2002, the company recorded
write-downs of $1,626 of its investment in
dynegy common and preferred stock and $136
of its investment in its publicly traded
caltex australia affiliate to their
respective estimated fair values. the
write-downs were required because the
declines in the fair values of the
investments below their carrying values were deemed to be
other than temporary. refer to note 14 on
pages fs-38 and fs-39 for additional
information on the companys investment in
dynegy and caltex australia.
also in 2002, impairments of $183 were
recorded for various u.s. exploration and
production properties and $100 for
international projects. impairments in 2001
included $1,022 for the midway sunset field
in california  the result of a write-down
in proved oil reserve quantities  upon
determination of a lower-than-projected oil
recovery from the fields steam injection
process. a $247 impairment of the ll-652
field in venezuela was also recorded in 2001
as slower-than-expected reservoir
repressurization resulted in a reduction in
the projected volumes of oil recoverable
during the companys remaining contract
period of operation. impairments included in
asset write-offs and revaluations were for
assets held for use.

stockholders equity
retained earnings at december31, 2003 and
2002, included approximately $1,300 and
$1,600, respectively, for the companys
share of undistributed earnings of equity
affiliates.
upon the merger of chevron and texaco,
the authorized common stock of
chevrontexaco was increased from 2billion
shares of $0.75 par value to 4billion
shares of $0.75 par value. under the terms of the merger
agreement, approximately 425million shares
of chevrontexaco common stock were issued
in exchange for all of the outstanding
shares of texaco common stock based upon an
exchange ratio of 0.77 of a chevrontexaco
share for each texaco share. texacos
common stock held in treasury was canceled
at the effective time of the merger.
in 1998, in connection with the
renewal of chevrons stockholder rights
plan, chevron declared a dividend
distribution on each outstanding share of
its common stock of one right to purchase
participating preferred stock. the rights
issued under the plan became exercisable,
unless redeemed earlier by chevrontexaco,
if a person or group commenced a tender or
exchange offer or acquired or obtained the
right to acquire 10percent or more of the
outstanding shares of common stock without
the prior consent of chevrontexaco. in
october2002, the
stockholder rights agreement was amended so
that the rights would expire in november
2003, five years earlier than the initial
expiration date in november2008. no event
made the rights exercisable prior to their
expiration in november2003.
until june2001, there were 1,200
shares of texaco cumulative variable rate
preferred stock, called market auction
preferred shares (maps), outstanding, with
an aggregate value of $300. the maps were
redeemed in june2001, at a liquidation
preference of $250,000 per share, plus
premium and accrued and unpaid dividends.
at december31, 2003, 30million shares
of chevrontexacos authorized but unissued
common stock were reserved for issuance
under the chevrontexaco corporation
long-term incentive plan (ltip), which was
approved by the stockholders in 1990.
through the end of 2003, all of the plans
common stock requirements were met from the
companys treasury stock, and there had been
no issuances of reserved shares.
note 8.
financial and derivative instruments
commodity derivative instruments
chevrontexaco is exposed to market risks
related to price volatility of crude oil,
refined products, natural gas and refinery
feedstock.
the company uses derivative commodity
instruments to manage this exposure on a
small portion of its activity, including:
firm commitments and anticipated
transactions for the purchase or sale of
crude oil; feedstock purchases for company
refineries; crude oil and refined products
inventories; and fixed-price contracts to
sell natural gas and natural gas liquids.
the company also uses derivative
commodity instruments for limited trading
purposes.
the company maintains a policy of
requiring that an international swaps and
derivatives association agreement govern
derivative contracts with certain
counterparties to mitigate credit risk.
depending on the nature of the derivative
transaction, bilateral collateral
arrangements may also be required. when the
company is engaged in more than one
outstanding derivative
transaction with the same counterparty
and also has a legally enforceable netting
agreement with that counterparty, the net
mark-to-market exposure represents the
netting of the positive and negative
exposures with that counterparty and a
reasonable measure of the companys credit
risk. it is the companys policy to use
other netting agreements with certain
counterparties with which it conducts
significant transactions.
the fair values of the outstanding
contracts are reported on the consolidated
balance sheet as accounts and notes
receivable, accounts payable, long-term
receivables  net, and deferred credits
and other noncurrent obligations. gains and
losses on the companys risk management
activities are reported as either sales and
other operating revenues or purchased
crude oil and products, whereas trading
gains and losses are reported as other
income. these activities are reported under
operating activities in the consolidated
statement of cash flows.
foreign currency the company enters into
forward exchange contracts, generally with
terms of 180days or less, to manage some of
its foreign currency exposures. these
exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions, including foreign
currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180
days. the forward exchange contracts are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet
with resulting gains and losses reflected in
income.
fs-33
table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note 8. financial and derivative instruments  continued
the fair values of the outstanding
contracts are reported on the consolidated
balance sheet as accounts and notes
receivable or accounts payable, with
gains and losses reported as other
income. these activities are reported
under operating activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows.
interest rates the company enters into
interest rate swaps as part of its overall
strategy to manage the interest rate risk
on its debt. under the terms of the swaps,
net cash settlements are based on the
difference between fixed-rate and
floating-rate interest amounts calculated
by reference to agreed notional principal
amounts. interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the companys fixed-rate debt
are accounted for as fair value hedges,
whereas interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the companys floating-rate debt
are recorded at fair value on the balance
sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income.
during 2003, no new swaps were
initiated. at year-end 2003, the interest
rate swaps outstanding related to fixed-rate
debt, and their weighted average maturity
was approximately 4.6years.
fair values of the interest rate swaps
are reported on the consolidated balance
sheet as accounts and notes receivable or
accounts payable, with gains and losses
reported directly in income as part of
interest and debt expense. these
activities are reported under operating
activities in the consolidated statement
of cash flows.
fair value fair values are derived either
from quoted market prices or, if not
available, the present value of the
expected cash flows. the fair values
reflect the cash that would have been
received or paid if the instruments were
settled at year-end.
long-term debt of $7,229 and $7,296
had estimated fair values of $7,709 and
$7,971 at december31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
for interest rate swaps, the
notional principal amounts of $665 and
$665 had estimated fair values of $65
and $70 at december31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
the company holds cash equivalents and
u.s. dollar marketable securities in
domestic and offshore portfolios.
eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes, time
deposits and commercial paper are the
primary instruments held. cash equivalents
and marketable securities had fair values
of $3,803 and $2,506 at december31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. of these balances,
$2,803 and $1,682 at the respective
year-ends were classified as cash
equivalents that had average maturities
under 90days. the remainder, classified as
marketable securities, had average
maturities of approximately 3.5years.
concentrations of credit risk the companys
financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of its cash equivalents,
marketable securities, derivative financial
instruments and trade receivables. the
companys short-term investments are placed
with a wide array of financial institutions
with high credit ratings. this diversified
investment policy limits the companys
exposure both to credit risk and to
concentrations of credit risk. similar
standards of diversity and creditworthiness
are applied to the companys counterparties
in derivative instruments.
the trade receivable balances,
reflecting the companys diversified
sources of revenue, are dispersed among the
companys broad customer base worldwide. as
a consequence, concentrations of credit
risk are limited. the company routinely
assesses the financial strength of its
customers. when the financial strength of a
customer is not considered sufficient,
letters of credit are the principal
security obtained to support lines of
credit.
investment in dynegy notes and preferred
stock at the beginning of 2003, the company
held $1,500 aggregate principal amount of
dynegy seriesb preferred stock, which was
due for redemption at par value in november
2003. in august, the company exchanged its
preferred stock for $225 in cash, $225 face
value of dynegy
junior unsecured subordinated notes due 2016
and $400 face value of dynegy seriesc
convertible preferred stock with a stated
maturity of 2033.
the company recorded the junior notes
and seriesc preferred stock on the date of
exchange at their fair values of $170 and
$270, respectively, for a total of $440.
together with the $225 cash, the total
amount recorded on the date of exchange was
$665. a gain of $365 was included in net of income at that date for the
difference between the $665 fair value
received and the net balance sheet amount of
$300 associated with the seriesb shares.
at december31, 2003, the estimated
fair values of the junior notes and seriesc
shares totaled $530. the $90 difference from
the $440 recorded in august was recorded to
investments and advances, with an
offsetting amount in other comprehensive
income. future temporary changes in the
estimated fair values of the new securities
likewise will be reported in other
comprehensive income. however, if any
future decline in fair value is deemed to be
other than temporary, a charge against
income in the period would be recorded.
interest that accrues on the notes and
dividends payable on the preferred stock is
recognized in income each period.
note 9.
operating segments and geographic data
chevrontexaco separately manages its
exploration and production; refining,
marketing and transportation; and chemicals

worldwide basis. corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the
operating segments. however, operating
segments are billed for the direct use of
corporate services. non-billable costs and
merger-related items remain at the
corporate level. included in net income for

segment sales and other operating revenues
operating segment sales and other operating
revenues, including internal transfers, for
the years 2003, 2002 and 2001 are presented
in the following table. sales from the
transfer of products between segments are
at prices that approximate market prices.
revenues for the exploration and production
segment are derived primarily from the
production of crude oil and natural gas, as
well as the sale of third-party production
of natural gas. revenues for the refining,
marketing and transportation segment are
derived from the refining and marketing of
petroleum products, such as gasoline, jet
fuel, gas oils, kerosene, lubricants,
residual fuel oils and other products
derived from crude oil. this segment also
generates revenues from the transportation
and trading of crude oil and
refined products. chemicals segment
revenues are derived from the manufacture
and sale of lube oil and fuel additives.
revenues from all other activities
include coal mining operations, power and
gasification businesses, insurance
operations, real estate activities, and
technology companies.
other than the united states, the only
country where chevron-texaco generates
significant revenues is the united kingdom,
where revenues amounted to $12,121, $10,816
and $10,350 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

litigation
unocal patent chevron, texaco and four
other oil companies (refiners)filed suit
in 1995, contesting the validity of a
patent (393 patent) granted to unocal
corporation (unocal) for certain
reformulated gasoline blends.
chevrontexaco sells reformulated gasolines
in california in certain months of the
year.
in march2000, the u.s. court of
appeals for the federal circuit upheld a
september1998 district court decision that
unocals patent was valid and
enforceable and assessed damages of 5.75
cents per gallon for gasoline produced
during the summer of 1996 that infringed on
the claims of the patent.
in february2001, the u.s. supreme
court concluded it would not review the
lower courts ruling, and the case was sent
back to the district court for an
accounting of all infringing gasoline
produced after august1, 1996. the district
court ruled that the per-gallon damages
awarded by the jury are limited to
infringement that occurs in california
only. additionally, the u.s. patent and
trademark office (uspto)granted three
petitions by the refiners to re-examine the
validity of unocals 393 patent and has
twice rejected all of the claims in the
393 patent. those rejections have been
appealed by unocal to the uspto board of
appeals. the district court judge requested
further briefing and advised that she would
not enter a final judgment in this case
until the uspto had completed its
re-examination of the 393 patent.
during 2002 and 2003, the uspto granted
two petitions for re-examination of another
unocal patent, the 126 patent. the uspto
has rejected the validity of the claims of
the 126 patent, which could affect a
larger share of u.s. gasoline production.
separately, in march2003, the federal trade
commission (ftc)
fs-36
table of contents
note 10. litigation  continued
filed a complaint against unocal alleging
that its conduct during the pendency of the
patents was in violation of antitrust law.
in november2003, the administrative law
judge dismissed the complaint brought by
the ftc. the ftc has appealed the decision.
unocal has obtained additional patents
that could affect a larger share of u.s.
gasoline production. chevrontexaco believes
these additional patents are invalid,
unenforceable and/or not infringed. the
companys financial exposure in the event
of unfavorable conclusions to the patent
litigation and regulatory reviews may
include royalties, plus interest, for
production of gasoline that is proved to
have infringed the patents. the competitive
and financial effects on the companys refining and marketing operations, although
presently indeterminable, could be material.
chevrontexaco has been accruing in the
normal course of business any future
estimated liability for potential
infringement of the 393 patent covered by
the 1998 trial courts ruling.
in 2000, prior to the merger, chevron
and texaco made payments to unocal
totaling approximately $30million for the
original court ruling, including interest
and fees.
mtbe another issue involving the company is
the petroleum industrys use of methyl
tertiary butyl ether (mtbe)as a gasoline
additive and its potential environmental
impact through seepage into groundwater.
along with other oil companies, the
company is a party to more than 60 lawsuits
and claims related to the use of the
chemical mtbe in certain oxygenated
gasolines. these actions may require the
company to correct or ameliorate the
alleged effects on the environment of prior
release of mtbe by the company or other
parties. additional lawsuits and claims
related to the use of mtbe, including
personal-injury claims, may be filed in
the future.
the companys ultimate exposure
related to these lawsuits and claims is not
currently determinable, but could be
material to net income in any one period.
chevrontexaco has reduced the use of mtbe
in gasoline it manufactures in the united
states, including the complete phase-out of
mtbe in california before the end of 2003.

lease commitments
certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets
are included as part of properties, plant
and equipment, at cost. such leasing
arrangements involve tanker charters, crude
oil production and processing equipment,
service stations, and other facilities.
other leases are classified as operating
leases and are not capitalized. the
payments on such leases are recorded as
expense. details of the capitalized leased
assets are as follows:

contingent rentals are based on
factors other than the passage of time,
principally sales volumes at leased service
stations. certain leases include escalation
clauses for adjusting rentals to reflect
changes in price indices, renewal options
ranging from one to 25years, and/or
options to purchase the leased property
during or at the end of the initial or
renewal lease period for the fair market
value or other specified amount at that
time.
at december31, 2003, the estimated
future minimum lease payments (net of
noncancelable sublease rentals) under
operating and capital leases, which at

restructuring and reorganization costs
in connection with various reorganizations
and restructurings across several
businesses and corporate departments,
during 2003 the company recorded before-tax
charges of $258 ($146 after tax) for
estimated termination benefits for
approximately 4,500 employees. nearly half
of the liability related to the global
downstream business, including the effect
of its reorganization along functional
lines rather than the geographic configuration used previously. substantially all
of the employee reductions are expected to
occur by early 2005.
activity for the companys liability
related to reorganizations and
restructurings in 2003 is summarized in the
following table:
amounts before tax

balance at january1, 2003

(24
)
balance at december31, 2003
$
an approximate $100 liability remained
for employee severance charges recorded in
2002 and 2001. the balance related
primarily to deferred payment options
elected by certain employees who terminated
before the end of 2003 and were paid in
january2004.

assets held for sale
at december31, 2003, the company classified $1,100 of net properties, plant and
equipment as assets held for sale on the
consolidated balance sheet. the asset
dispositions are expected to occur during
2004, substantially all of which related to
the u.s. upstream business segment.
these anticipated sales, consisting of
interests in several hundred individual
properties, relate to the companys plan to
dispose of certain assets in the overall
portfolio that do not provide sufficient
long-term value.
no significant gains or losses were
recorded in 2003 for the held-for-sale
assets. revenues and earnings associated
with the assets were likewise insignificant in 2003 and earlier years.

descriptions of major affiliates are as follows:
tengizchevroil chevrontexaco has a 50
percent equity ownership interest in
tengizchevroil (tco), a joint venture formed
in 1993 to develop the tengiz and korolev
oil fields in kazakhstan over a 40-year
period. upon formation of the joint venture,
the company incurred an obligation of $420,
payable to the republic of kazakhstan upon
attainment of a dedicated export system with
the capability of the greater of 260,000
barrels of oil per day or tcos production
capacity. as a part of the 2001 transaction,
the company paid $210 of the $420
obligation. an additional $210 was paid in
2003 to settle the remaining obligation. the
$420 was also included in the carrying value
of the original investment, as the company
believed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
its full payment would be made.
equilon enterprises llc and motiva
enterprises llc until february2002, the
company had equity interests in equilon and
motiva  joint ventures engaged in u.s.
refining and marketing activities. under
mandate of the ftc as a condition of the
merger, the companys ownership interests
were placed in trust on october9, 2001.
the trust completed the dispositions of the
companys investments in equilon and motiva
in february2002. see note 2 on page fs-30
for additional information on equilon and
motiva.
lg-caltex oil corporation chevrontexaco
owns 50percent of lg-caltex, a joint
venture formed in 1967 between the lg group
and caltex to engage in importing, refining and marketing of petroleum products
and petrochemicals in south korea.
star petroleum refining company ltd.
chevrontexaco has a 64percent equity
ownership interest in star petroleum refining company limited (sprc), which owns
the star refinery at map ta phut,
thailand. the petroleum authority of
thailand owns the remaining 36percent of
sprc.
caltex australia ltd. chevrontexaco has a 50
percent equity ownership interest in caltex
australia limited (cal). the remaining 50
percent of cal is publicly owned. during
2002, the company wrote down its investment
in cal by $136 to its
estimated fair value at september30, 2002.
at december31, 2003, the fair value of
chevrontexacos share of cal common stock
was $465. the aggregate carrying value of
the companys investment in cal was
approximately $90 lower than the amount of
underlying equity in cal net assets.
chevron phillips chemical company llc
chevrontexaco owns 50percent of cpchem,
formed in july2000 when chevron merged
most of its petrochemicals businesses with
those of phillips petroleum company.
because cpchem is a limited liability
company, chevrontexaco records the
provision for income taxes and related tax
liability applicable to its share of the
ventures income separately in its
consolidated financial statements. at
december31, 2003, the companys carrying
value of its investment in cpchem was
approximately $130 lower than the amount of
underlying equity in cpchems net assets.
dynegy inc. chevrontexaco owns an
approximate 26percent equity interest in
the common stock of dynegy, an energy
merchant engaged in power generation,
natural gas liquids processing and
marketing, and regulated energy delivery.
the company also holds investments in
dynegy notes and preferred stock.
fs-38
table of contents
note 14. investments and advances  continued
investment in dynegy common stock at
december31, 2003, the carrying value of the
companys investment in dynegy common stock
was approximately $150. this amount was
about $425 below the companys proportionate
interest in dynegys underlying net assets.
this difference resulted from write-downs of
the investment in 2002 for declines in the
market value of the common shares below the
companys carrying value that were deemed to
be other than temporary. the approximate
$425 difference has been assigned to the
extent practicable to specific dynegy
assets and liabilities, based upon the
companys analysis of the various factors
giving rise to the decline in value of the
dynegy shares. the companys equity share of
dynegys reported earnings is adjusted
quarterly to reflect the difference between
these allocated values and dynegys
historical book values. the
market value of the companys investment in
dynegys common stock at december31, 2003
was $415.

preferred stock refer to note 8 on page

in 2003, the before-tax income,
including related corporate and other
charges, for u.s. operations was $5,701,
compared with a before-tax loss of $2,140 in
2002 and before-tax income of $1,778 in
2001. for international operations,
before-tax income was $7,069, $6,296 and

note 16. taxes  continued
in 2003, the effective tax rate was
about 42percent. the decrease in the
effective tax rate in 2003 compared with
2002 resulted from a lower proportion of
international taxable income, which is taxed
at higher rates than u.s. taxable income,
and the absence in 2003 of the 2002 tax
effects of the capital losses discussed in
the next paragraph.
the increase in the 2002 effective tax
rate from 2001 was due to a number of
factors. one reason was that u.s.
before-tax income (generally subject to a
lower tax rate) was a significantly
smaller percentage of overall before-tax
income in 2002. another major factor was
that the impairment of the investments in
dynegy and caltex australia were capital
losses for which no offsetting capital
gains were available.
the company records its deferred taxes
on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies
those net amounts as current or noncurrent
based on the balance sheet classification
of the related assets or liabilities.
the reported deferred tax balances

the valuation allowance relates to
foreign tax credit carry-forwards, tax loss
carryforwards and temporary differences for
which no benefit is expected to be
realized. the decrease in the valuation
allowance relates primarily to the
expiration of foreign tax credits and to
the release of the valuation allowance on
certain net operating losses, which
management believes will now be realized.
tax loss carryforwards exist in many
foreign jurisdictions and expire at various
times beginning 2004 through 2010. however,
some of these tax loss carryforwards do not
have an expiration date.

it is the companys policy for
subsidiaries included in the u.s.
consolidated tax return to record income tax
expense as though they filed separately,
with the parent recording the adjustment to
income tax expense for the effects of
consolidation. income taxes are accrued for
retained earnings of international
subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures
intended to be remitted. income taxes are
not accrued for unremitted earnings of
international operations that have been or
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
undistributed earnings of international
consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for
which no deferred income tax provision has
been made for possible future remittances
totaled approximately $10,541 at december
31, 2003. substantially all of this amount
represents earnings reinvested as part of
the companys ongoing business. it is not
practicable to estimate the amount of taxes
that might be payable on the eventual
remittance of such earnings. on remittance,
certain countries impose withholding taxes
that, subject to certain limitations, are
then available for use as tax credits
against a u.s. tax liability, if any.

the company periodically enters into
interest rate swaps on a portion of its

at december31, 2003, the company had
$4,285 of committed credit facilities with
banks worldwide, which permit the company to
refinance short-term obligations on a
long-term basis. the facilities support the
companys commercial paper borrowings.
interest on borrowings under the terms of
specific agreements may be based on the
london interbank offered rate or bank prime
rate. no amounts were outstanding under
these credit agreements during 2003 or at
year-end.
at december31, 2003 and 2002, the
company classified $4,285 and $4,110,
respectively, of short-term debt as
long-term. settlement of these obligations
is not expected to require the use of
working capital in 2004, as the company has
both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis.

new accounting standards
in january2003, the financial accounting
standards board (fasb)issued interpretation
no.46, consolidation of variable interest
entities (fin 46). fin 46 amended arb 51,
consolidated financial statements, and
established standards for determining under
what circumstances a variable interest
entity (vie)should be consolidated by its
primary beneficiary. fin 46 also requires
disclosures about vies that the company is
not required to consolidate but in which it
has a significant variable interest. on
december17, 2003, the fasb issued fin 46-r,
which not only included amendments to fin
46, but also required application of the
interpretation to all affected entities no
later than march31, 2004, for calendar-year
reporting companies. however, companies must
have applied the interpretation to
special-purpose entities by december31,
2003. the adoption of fin 46-r as it relates
to special-purpose entities did not have a
material impact on the companys results of
operations, financial position or
liquidity, and the company does not expect a
material impact upon its full adoption of
the interpretation as of march31, 2004.
note 20.
accounting for mineral interests investment
the securities and exchange commission (sec)
has questioned certain public companies in
the oil, gas and mining industries as to the
proper accounting for, and reporting of
acquired contractual mineral interests under
fasb statement no.141, business
combinations (fas 141), and fasb statement
no.142, goodwill and intangible assets
(fas 142). these accounting standards became
effective for the company on july1, 2001,
and january1, 2002, respectively.
at issue is whether such mineral
interest costs should be classified on the
balance sheet as part of properties, plant
and equipment or as intangible assets.
the company will continue to classify these
costs as properties, plant and equipment
and apportion them to expense in future
periods under the companys existing
accounting policy until authoritative
guidance is provided.
for chevrontexaco, the net book values
of this category of mineral interest
investment at december31, 2003 and 2002,
were $3.8billion and $4.1billion,
respectively. if reclassification of these
balances becomes necessary, the companys
statements of income and cash flows would
not be affected. however, additional
disclosures related to intangible assets
would be required as prescribed under the
associated accounting standards.
note 21.
employee benefit plans
the company has defined benefit pension
plans for many employees and provides for
certain health care and life insurance plans
for some active and qualifying retired
employees. the company typically funds only
those defined benefit plans where legal
funding is required. in the united states,
this includes all qualified tax-exempt
plans subject to the employee retirement
income security act (erisa)minimum funding
standard. the company does not
fs-42
table of contents
note 21. employee benefit plans  continued
typically fund domestic nonqualified
tax-exempt pension plans or international
pension plans that are not subject to legal
funding requirements because contributions
to these pension plans may be less tax efficient and investment returns may be less
attractive than the companys other
investment alternatives.
the companys annual contributions for
medical and dental benefits are limited to
the lesser of actual medical and dental
claims or a defined fixed per-capita
amount. life insurance benefits are paid by
the company and annual contributions are
based on actual plan experience.
the company uses a measurement date of
december31 to value its pension and other
postretirement benefit plan obligations.
in december2003, the medicare
prescription drug, improvement and
modernization act of 2003 (the act) became
law.
the act introduces a prescription drug
benefit under medicare (medicare partd)
as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans, such as
the company, that provide a benefit that
is at least actuarially equivalent to
medicare partd. the company is currently
evaluating the impact of the legislation to
its benefit plan design and accounting.
the company has elected, in accordance with
fasb staff position no.fas 106-1,
accounting and disclosure requirements
related to the medicare prescription drug,
improvement and modernization act of 2003,
to defer recognition of the act in the
companys measurement of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation and net
postretirement benefit cost in its financial statements and the accompanying
notes. specific accounting guidance for
the federal subsidy is pending and, when
issued, could require the company to change
previously reported information.

discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets were updated quarterly for the main u.s. pension plan.
the company employs a rigorous process
to determine the estimates of long-term
rate of return on pension assets. these
estimates are primarily driven by actual
historical asset-class returns and advice
from external actuarial firms while
incorporating specific asset-class risk
factors. asset allocations are regularly
updated using pension plan asset/liability
studies, and the determination of the
companys estimates of long-term rates of
return are consistent with these studies.
at december31, 2003, the estimated
long-term rate of return on u.s. pension
plan assets, which account for about 70
percent of the companys pension plan
assets, was 7.8percent, compared with rates
of 7.8 and 9.0percent at the end of 2002
and 2001, respectively. the year-end
market-related value of u.s. pension plan
assets used in the determination of pension
expense was based on the market values in
the preceding three months, as opposed to
the maximum allowable period of five years
under u.s. accounting rules. management
considers the three-month time period long
enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-to-day market
volatility and yet still be contemporaneous
to the end of the year.

the u.s. pension plans invest
primarily in asset categories with sufficient size, liquidity and cost efficiency
to permit investments of reasonable size.
the u.s. pension plans invest in asset
categories that provide diversification
benefits and are easily measured. maximum
and minimum holding ranges for each of
these asset categories are set by the
chevrontexaco board of directors for the
primary u.s. pension plan. actual asset
allocation within these approved ranges is
based on a variety of economic and market
conditions and consideration of specific
asset category risk. to assess the plans
investment performance, a long-term asset
allocation policy benchmark has been
established.
equities include investments in the
companys common stock in the amount of $6
and $4 at december31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. the other asset category
includes minimal investments in private
equity limited partnerships.
in early 2004, the company
contributed about $535 to the u.s. plans.

year. contributions in 2004 to the
international pension plans are estimated
at $200, while 2003 contributions were
$214. the actual contribution amounts are
dependent upon investment returns, changes
in pension obligations, regulatory
environments and other economic factors.
the company anticipates funding u.s.

employee savings investment plan eligible
employees of chevrontexaco and certain of
its subsidiaries participate in the
chevrontexaco employee savings investment
plan (esip). in 2002, the employees thrift
plan of texaco inc., employees savings plan
of chevrontexaco global energy inc.
(formerly caltex corporation), stock plan of
chevrontexaco global energy
inc. and employees thrift plan of fuel and
marine marketing llc were merged into the
chevrontexaco esip. charges to expense for
these plans were $160, $161 and $157 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
employee stock ownership plans (esop)
within the chevron-texaco employee savings
investment plan, the company has
established an employee stock ownership
plan. in 1989, chevron established a
leveraged employee stock ownership plan
(lesop)as a constituent part of the esop.
the lesop provides partial prefunding of
the companys future commitments to the
esip, which will result in annual income
tax savings for the company.
in 1988, texaco established a
leveraged employee stock ownership plan as
a component of the employees thrift plan of
texaco inc. during 2002, the employees
thrift plan of texaco inc. was subsumed
into the chevrontexaco esip.
as permitted by american institute of
certified public accountants (aicpa)
statement of position 93-6, employers
accounting for employee stock ownership
plans, the company has elected to
continue its practices, which are based on
statement of position 76-3, accounting
practices for certain
employee stock ownership plans, and
subsequent consensus of the emerging issues
task force of the financial accounting
standards board. the debt of the lesops is
recorded as debt, and shares pledged as
collateral are reported as deferred
compensation and benefit plan trust in the
consolidated balance sheet and the
consolidated statement of stockholders
equity.
the company reports compensation
expense equal to lesop debt principal
repayments less dividends received by the
lesops. interest incurred on the lesop debt
is recorded as interest expense. dividends
paid on lesop shares are reflected as a
reduction of retained earnings. all lesop
shares are considered outstanding for
earnings-per-share computations.
expense recorded for the lesops was
$24, $98 and $75 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, including $28, $32 and $43 of
interest expense related to lesop debt. all
dividends paid on the lesop shares held are
used to service the lesop debt. the
dividends used were $61, $49 and $86 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
the company made lesop contributions
of $26, $102 and $75 in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, to satisfy lesop debt
service in excess of dividends received by
the lesop. the lesop shares were pledged as
collateral for the debt. shares are
released from a suspense account and
allocated to the accounts of plan
participants, based on the debt service
deemed to be paid in the year in proportion
to the total of current-year and remaining
debt service. the (credit)charge to
compensation expense was $(4), $66 and $32
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. lesop

benefit plan trust texaco established a
benefit plan trust for funding obligations
under some of its benefit plans. at
year-end 2003, the trust contained 7.1
million shares of chevrontexaco treasury
stock. the company intends to continue to
pay its obligations under the benefit
plans. the trust will sell the shares or
use the dividends from the shares to pay
benefits only to the extent that the
company does not pay such benefits. the
trustee will vote the shares held in the
trust as instructed by the trusts beneficiaries. the shares held in the trust are
not considered outstanding for
earnings-per-share purposes until
distributed or sold by the trust in payment
of benefit obligations.
management incentive plans chevrontexaco
has two incentive plans, the management
incentive plan (mip)and the long-term
incentive plan (ltip)for officers and
other regular salaried employees of the
company and its subsidiaries who hold
positions of significant responsibility.
the plans were expanded in 2002 to include
former employees of texaco and caltex. the
mip is an annual cash incentive plan that
links awards to performance results of the
prior year. the cash awards may be
deferred by conversion to stock units or
other investment fund alternatives. awards
under the ltip may take the form of, but
are not limited to, stock options,
restricted stock, stock units and nonstock
grants. texaco also had a cash incentive
program and a stock incentive plan (sip)
that included stock options, restricted
stock and other incentive awards for
executives, directors and key employees.
awards under the caltex ltip were in the
form of performance units and stock
appreciation rights. charges to

other incentive plans the company has a
program that provides eligible employees
with an annual cash bonus if the company
achieves certain financial and safety
goals. charges for the program were $151,
$158 and $154 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,

stock options
the company applies apb opinion no.25 and
related interpretations in accounting for
its stock-based compensation programs, which
are described below. stock-based
compensation expense (credit)recognized in
connection with these programs was $2, $(2)
and $111 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
refer to note 1 on page fs-30 for the
pro forma effect on net income and earnings
per share had the company applied the
fair-value-recognition provisions of fas
no.123.
broad-based employee stock options in 1998,
chevron granted to all its eligible
employees an option that varied from 100 to
300 shares of stock or equivalents,
dependent on the employees salary or job
grade. these options vested after two years
in february 2000. options for 4,820,800
shares were awarded at an exercise price of
$76.3125 per share. outstanding option
shares were 2,366,311 at the end of 2001.
in 2002, exercises of 295,985 and
forfeitures of 61,151 reduced the
outstanding option shares to 2,009,175 at
the end of the year. in 2003, exercises of
11,630 and forfeitures of 61,050 reduced
the outstanding option shares to 1,936,495
at the end of the year. the options expire
in february2008. the company recorded
expense (credit)of $2, $(2) and $1 for
these options in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
the fair value of each option share on
the date of grant under fas no.123 was
estimated at $19.08 using the average
results of black-scholes models for the
preceding 10years. the 10-year averages of
each assumption used by the black-scholes
models were: a risk-free interest rate of
7.0percent, a dividend yield of 4.2
percent, an expected life of seven years and
a volatility of 24.7percent.
long-term incentive plan stock options
granted under the ltip extend for 10years
from the date of grant. effective with
options granted in june2002, one third of
the options vest on each of the first,
second and third anniversaries of the date
of grant. prior to this change, options
granted by chevron vested one year after the
date of grant, whereas options granted by
texaco under its sip vested over a two-year
period at a rate of 50percent each year.
the maximum number of shares that may be
granted each year is 1percent of the total
outstanding shares of common stock as of
january 1 of such year.
on the closing of the merger in
october2001, outstanding options granted
under the texaco sip were converted to
chevrontexaco options at the merger
exchange rate of 0.77. these options
retained a provision for restored options.
this feature enables a participant who
exercises a stock option by exchanging
previously acquired common stock or who
has shares withheld to satisfy tax
withholding obligations to receive new
options equal to the number of shares
exchanged or withheld. the restored options
are fully exercisable six months after the
date of grant, and the exercise price is the
fair market value of the common stock on the
day the restored option is granted.
restricted shares granted under the former
texaco plan contained a performance element
that had to be satisfied in order for all
or a specified portion of the shares to
vest. upon the merger, all restricted shares
became vested and converted to
chevrontexaco shares at the merger exchange
ratio of 0.77. apart from the restored
options, no further awards may be granted
under the former texaco plans. no amount for
these plans was charged to compensation
expense in 2003 or 2002; $110 of expense was
recorded in 2001. restricted performance
shares granted under sip in 2001 totaled
392,000 at an average fair value of $91.05
per share.
the fair market value of each stock
option granted is estimated on the date of

other contingencies and commitments
income taxes the company estimates its income tax expense and liabilities
annually. these liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual
taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for
which income taxes have been estimated. the u.s. federal income tax liabilities
have been settled through 1996 for chevrontexaco (formerly chevron), 1993 for
chevrontexaco global energy inc. (formerly caltex), and 1991 for texaco.
california franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for chevron
and 1987 for texaco. settlement of open tax years, as well as tax issues in
other countries where the company conducts its businesses, is not expected to
have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of
the company, and in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made
for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to
future examination.
guarantees at december31, 2003, the company and its subsidiaries provided
guarantees, either directly or indirectly, of $917 for notes and other
contractual obligations of affiliated companies and $256 for third parties, as
discussed, by major category, below. there are no amounts being carried as
liabilities for the companys obligations under these guarantees. of the $917
guarantees provided to affiliates, $716 related to borrowings for capital
projects or general corporate purposes. these guarantees were undertaken to
achieve lower interest rates and generally cover the construction period of the
capital projects. approximately 75percent of the amounts guaranteed will
expire in 2004, with the remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015.
under the terms of the guarantees, the company would be required to fulfill
the guarantee should an affiliate be in default of its loan terms, generally
for the full amounts disclosed. there are no recourse provisions, and no assets
are held as collateral for these guarantees.
another $201 of the affiliate guarantees related to obligations in connection
with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of the companys
cogeneration affiliates. under the terms of these guarantees, the company may
be required to make payments under certain conditions if the affiliates do not
perform under the agreements. there are no provisions for recourse to third
parties, and no assets are held as collateral for these pricing guarantees.
guarantees of $256 have been provided to third parties, including approximately
$110 of construction loans to host governments in the companys international
upstream operations. the other $146 was provided principally as conditions of
sale of the companys interest in certain operations, to provide a source of
liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with company marketing
programs. no amounts of the companys obligations under these guarantees are
recorded as liabilities. about 75percent of the total amounts guaranteed will
expire in 2004, with the remainder expiring after 2004. the company would be
required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in
default of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts
disclosed. approximately $100 of the guarantees have recourse provisions, which
enable the company to recover any payments made under the terms of the
guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties assets.
at december31, 2003, chevrontexaco had outstanding guarantees for
approximately $238 of equilon debt and leases. following the february2002
disposition of its interest in equilon, the company received an indemnification from shell oil company for any claims arising from the guarantees. the
company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees. approximately 50
percent of the amounts guaranteed will expire within the 2004-2008 period, with
the guarantees of the remaining amounts expiring by 2019.
indemnities the company also provided certain indemnities of contingent
liabilities of equilon and motiva to shell oil company (shell) and saudi refining inc. in connection with the february2002 sale of the companys interests
in those investments. the indemnities cover general contingent liabilities,
including those associated with the unocal patent litigation. the company would
be required to perform should the indemnified liabilities become actual losses
and could be required to make maximum future payments of $300. the company has
paid approximately $28 under these contingencies and has disputed approximately
$34 in claims submitted by shell under these indemnities. shell requested
arbitration of this dispute, and it is expected to occur in mid-2004. there are
no recourse provisions enabling recovery of any amounts from third parties nor
are any assets held as collateral. within five years of the february2002
sale, at the buyers option, the company also may be required to purchase
certain assets from shell for their net book value, as determined at the time
of the companys purchase. those assets consist of 12 separate lubricant
facilities, two of which were tendered to and purchased by the company in late
2003 for a de minimis price.
the company has also provided certain indemnities pertaining to the contingent
environmental liabilities related to assets originally contributed by texaco to
the equilon and motiva joint ventures and environmental conditions that existed
prior to the formation of equilon and motiva or that occurred during the
periods of chevrontexacos ownership interests in the joint ventures. in
general, the environmental conditions and events that are subject to these
indemnities must have arisen prior to december2001. claims relating to equilon
must be asserted no later than february2009, and claims relating to motiva
must be asserted no later than february2012. under the terms of the
indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future
payments. the company has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims
under these indemnities. the company holds no assets as collateral and has made
no payments under the indemnities.

notes to the consolidated financial statements
millions of dollars, except per-share amounts
note 23. other contingencies and commitments  continued
the amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities
recorded by equilon or motiva prior to september30, 2001, for any specific
incident.
securitization the company securitizes certain retail and trade accounts
receivable in its downstream business through the use of qualifying special
purpose entities (spes). at december31, 2003, approximately $1,000,
representing about 11percent of chevrontexacos total current accounts
receivables balance, were securitized. chevrontexacos total estimated financial exposure under these arrangements at december31, 2003, was
approximately $75. these arrangements have the effect of accelerating
chevrontexacos collection of the securitized amounts. in the event of the spes
experiencing major defaults in the collection of receivables, chevrontexaco
believes that it would have no loss exposure connected with third-party
investments in these securitization arrangements.
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput
agreements, and take-or-pay agreements the company and its subsidiaries have
certain other contingent liabilities relating to long-term unconditional
purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements, and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers financing arrangements. the
agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage
capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary
course of the companys business. the aggregate amounts of required payments
under these various commitments are 2004  $1,200; 2005  $1,100; 2006
$1,000; 2007  $1,000; 2008  $1,000; 2009 and after  $1,900. total payments
under the agreements were $1,400 in 2003, $1,200 in 2002 and $1,500 in 2001.
the most significant take-or-pay agreement calls for the company to purchase
approximately 55,000 barrels per day of refined products from an equity affiliate refiner in thailand. this purchase agreement is in conjunction with the
financing of a refinery owned by the affiliate and expires in 2009. the
future estimated commitments under this contract are: 2004  $700; 2005  $800;
2006  $800; 2007  $800; 2008  $800 and 2009  $800.
minority interests the company has commitments related to preferred shares of
subsidiary companies, which are accounted for as minority interest. texaco
capital llc, a wholly owned finance subsidiary, has issued $65 of deferred
preferred shares, seriesc. dividends amounting to $60 on seriesc, at a rate
of 7.17percent compounded annually, will be paid at the redemption date in
february2005, unless earlier redemption occurs. early redemption may result
upon the occurrence of certain specific events. mvp production inc., a
subsidiary, redeemed variable rate cumulative preferred shares of $75 owned by
one minority holder during 2003.
environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the company
to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior
release of chemical or petroleum substances, including mtbe, by the
company or
other parties. such contingencies may exist for various sites, including but
not limited to: superfund sites and refineries, oil fields, service stations,
terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. the
amount of such future cost is indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown
magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the
corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the companys
liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from third parties. while the company has provided
for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable,
the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations
in the period in which they are recognized. the company does not expect these
costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such
expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the companys
competitive position relative to other u.s. or international petroleum or
chemicals concerns.
global operations chevrontexaco and its affiliates have operations in more
than 180 countries. areas in which the company and its affiliates have major
operations include the united states, canada, australia, the united kingdom,
norway, denmark, france, partitioned neutral zone between kuwait and saudi
arabia, republic of congo, angola, nigeria, chad, equatorial guinea, democratic
republic of congo, south africa, indonesia, the philippines, singapore, china,
thailand, venezuela, argentina, brazil, colombia, trinidad and tobago, and
south korea. the companys caspian pipeline consortium (cpc)affiliate
operates in russia and kazakhstan. the companys tengizchevroil affiliate
operates in kazakhstan. the companys chevron phillips chemical company llc
affiliate manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a
worldwide basis, with manufacturing facilities in the united states, puerto
rico, singapore, china, south korea, saudi arabia, qatar, mexico and belgium.
the companys operations, particularly exploration and production, can be
affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the
various countries in which it operates, including the united states. as has
occurred in the past, actions could be taken by host governments to increase
public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses and/or
to impose additional taxes or royalties on the companys operations.
in certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and
taxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the
safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries.
internal unrest or strained relations between a host government and the company
or other governments may affect the companys operations. those developments
have, at times, significantly affected the companys related operations and
results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of
current and future activity in such countries.
equity redetermination for oil and gas producing operations, ownership
agreements may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in
estimated oil and gas reserves. these activities, individually or together, may
result in gains or losses that could be material to earnings in any given
period. one such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for chevrontexacos interests in four producing zones at the
fs-48
table of contents
note 23. other contingencies and commitments  continued
naval petroleum reserve at elk hills, california, for the time when the
remaining interests in these zones were owned by the u.s. department of energy.
a wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
chevrontexaco currently estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability
at approximately $200. at the same time, a possible maximum net amount that
could be owed to chevrontexaco is estimated at about $50. the timing of the
settlement and the exact amount within this range of estimates is uncertain.
other contingencies chevrontexaco receives claims from and submits claims to
customers, trading partners, u.s. federal, state and local regulatory bodies,
host governments, contractors, insurers, and suppliers. the amounts of these
claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy
periods to resolve.
the company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their
operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure
assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve
competitiveness and profitability. these activities, individually or together,
may result in gains or losses in future periods.
note 24.
earnings per share
basic earnings per share (eps)is based upon net income less preferred stock
dividend requirements and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other
compensation awards that are invested in chevrontexaco stock units by certain
officers and employees of the company and the companys share of stock
transactions of affiliates, which, under the applicable accounting rules may
be recorded directly to the companys retained earnings instead of net income.
diluted eps includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects
of outstanding stock options awarded under the companys stock option programs
(see note 22, stock options on pages fs-46 and fs-47). the following table

fas 143  asset retirement obligations
the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no.143,
accounting for asset retirement obligations (fas 143), effective january1,
2003. this accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation that is recorded when there is a legal obligation
associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability
can be reasonably estimated. obligations associated with the retirement of
these assets require recognition in certain circumstances: (1)the present
value of a liability and offsetting asset for an asset retirement obligation
(aro), (2)the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the
asset, and (3)the periodic review of the aro liability estimates and discount
rates. fas 143 primarily affects the companys accounting for oil and gas
producing assets and differs in several respects from previous accounting under
fas 19, financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing
companies.
in the first quarter 2003, the company recorded a net after-tax
charge of $200 for the cumulative effect of the adoption of fas 143, including
the companys share of amounts attributable to equity affiliates. the
cumulative-effect adjustment also increased the following balance sheet
categories: properties, plant and equipment, $2,568; accrued liabilities,
$115; and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations, $2,674.
noncurrent deferred income taxes decreased by $21.
upon adoption, no significant legal obligations to retire refining, marketing and transportation
(downstream)and chemical long-lived assets generally were recognized, as
indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevented estimation
of the fair value of the associated aro. the company performs periodic reviews
of its downstream and chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and
circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.
other
than the cumulative-effect net charge, the effect of the new accounting
standard on net income in 2003 was not materially different from what the
result would have been under fas 19 accounting. included in depreciation,
depletion and amortization were $52 related to the depreciation of the aro
asset and $132 related to the accretion of the aro liability.
the following table illustrates what the companys net income before
extraordinary items, net income and related per share amounts would have been
if the provisions of fas 143 had been applied retroactively:

amount excludes cumulative-effect charge of $200 ($0.18 per basic and

includes benefit of $5 and $2 for 2002 and 2001, respectively, which
represent the reversal of fas 19 depreciation related to abandonment offset
partially by proforma expenses for the depreciation and accretion of the aro
asset and liability, net of tax. there is a de minimis effect to net income per
basic or diluted share.
reported net income before extraordinary items was $1.07 per basic and
diluted share for 2002 and $3.71 per basic share ($3.70  diluted) for 2001.
reported net income was $1.07 per basic and diluted share for 2002 and
$3.10 per basic share ($3.09  diluted) for 2001.
prior to the implementation of fas 143, the company had recorded a provision
for abandonment that was part of accumulated depreciation, depletion and
amortization. upon implementation of fas 143, the provision for abandonment
was reversed and aro liability was recorded. the amount of the abandonment
reserve at the end of each year and the proforma aro liability were as follows:

table v  reserve quantity information
the companys estimated net proved
underground oil and gas reserves and changes
thereto for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001
are shown in the following table. proved
reserves are estimated by company asset
teams composed of earth scientists and
reservoir engineers. these proved reserve
estimates are reviewed annually by the
companys reserves advisory committee to
ensure that rigorous professional standards
and the reserves definitions prescribed by
the u.s. securities and exchange commission
are consistently applied throughout the
company.
proved reserves are the estimated
quantities that geologic and engineering
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty
to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions. due to the inherent
uncertainties and the limited nature of
reservoir data, estimates of underground
reserves are subject to change as additional
information becomes available.
proved reserves do not include
additional quantities that may result from
extensions of currently proved areas or
from applying secondary or tertiary
recovery processes not yet tested and
determined to be economic.
proved developed reserves are the
quantities expected to be recovered through
existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.
net reserves exclude royalties and
interests owned by others and reflect
contractual arrangements and royalty
obligations in effect at the time of the
estimate.

information on canadian oil sands net proved reserves not included above:
in addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, chevrontexaco has significant interests in proved oil sands reserves in canada associated with the athabasca
project. for internal management purposes, chevrontexaco views these reserves and their development as an integral part of total upstream operations. however, u.s. securities
and exchange commission regulations define these reserves as mining-related and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves. net proved oil sands reserves were 171million
barrels as of december31, 2003. production began in late 2002.
the oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is found on page fs-58.
fs-57
table of contents
supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities  continued
unaudited
table vi  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves
the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows, related to the
preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is
calculated in accordance with the
requirements of fas no.69. estimated future
cash inflows from production are computed by
applying year-end prices for oil and gas to
year-end quantities of estimated net proved
reserves. future price changes are limited
to those provided by contractual
arrangements in existence at the end of each
reporting year. future development and
production costs are those estimated future
expenditures necessary to develop and
produce year-end estimated proved reserves
based on year-end cost indices, assuming
continuation of year-end economic
conditions, and include estimated costs for
asset retirement obligations. estimated
future income taxes are calculated by
applying appropriate year-end statutory tax
rates. these rates reflect allowable
deductions and tax credits and are applied
to estimated future pretax net cash flows,
less the tax basis of related
assets.
discounted future net cash flows are
calculated using 10percent midperiod
discount factors. discounting requires a
year-by-year estimate of when future
expenditures will be incurred and when
reserves will be produced.
the information provided does not
represent managements estimate of the
companys expected future cash flows or
value of proved oil and gas reserves.
estimates of proved reserve quantities are
imprecise and change over time as new
information becomes available. moreover,
probable and possible reserves, which may
become proved in the future, are excluded
from the calculations. the arbitrary
valuation prescribed under fas no.69
requires assumptions as to the timing and
amount of future development and production
costs. the calculations are made as of
december31 each year and should not be
relied upon as an indication of the
companys future cash flows or value of its
oil and gas reserves.
