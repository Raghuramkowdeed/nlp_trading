DISCLOSURES

ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION,

WE

HAVE ALSO DIVIDED OUR BUSINESS INTO EIGHT REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FOR FINANCIAL

REPORTING PURPOSES. INFORMATION ABOUT OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, INCLUDING

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, APPEARS IN NOTE 25 ON PAGES A-29 THROUGH A-33 OF

THE APPENDIX.

OTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATIONS IN 2004 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2005, INCLUDING RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN OPERATIONS IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE FROM

"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" ON PAGES A-36 THROUGH A-61 OF THE

APPENDIX.

COMPANY

STRENGTHS

CATERPILLAR

IS THE LEADER IN CONSTRUCTION AND MINING EQUIPMENT, DIESEL AND NATURAL GAS

ENGINES AND INDUSTRIAL GAS TURBINES IN OUR SIZE RANGE. ANNUAL SALES AND REVENUES

TOP $30 BILLION, MAKING CATERPILLAR THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER IN ITS INDUSTRY.

CATERPILLAR IS ALSO A LEADING U.S. EXPORTER, WITH MORE THAN ONE-HALF OF ITS

SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT

DEALERS, CATERPILLAR BUILDS LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AROUND THE

WORLD. FOR OVER 75 YEARS, THE CATERPILLAR NAME HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE

HIGHEST LEVEL OF QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT

CATERPILLAR

PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES ARE SOLD WORLDWIDE INTO A VARIETY OF

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. IN ALL MARKETS, WE COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT

PERFORMANCE, CUSTOMER SERVICE, QUALITY AND PRICE. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE

INTENSITY OF COMPETITION RESULTS IN PRICE DISCOUNTING IN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY

OR REGION. SUCH PRICE DISCOUNTING PUTS PRESSURE ON MARGINS AND CAN NEGATIVELY

IMPACT OPERATING PROFIT.

OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES, CERTAIN COMPETITORS ENJOY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES INHERENT TO

OPERATING IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.

PAGE 1

MACHINERY

THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR CATERPILLAR'S MACHINERY BUSINESS CONSISTS OF GLOBAL

COMPETITORS, REGIONAL COMPETITORS, AND SPECIALIZED LOCAL COMPETITORS. PRINCIPAL

GLOBAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE KOMATSU, VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT (PART OF THE

VOLVO GROUP AB), CNH GLOBAL, HITACHI CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY, JOHN DEERE (PART OF

DEERE & CO.), TEREX, JCB, AND INGERSOLL-RAND. EACH HAS PARTICULAR REGIONAL

POCKETS OF STRENGTH. JOHN DEERE CONSTRUCTION AND FORESTRY DIVISION (PART OF

DEERE & CO.), FOR EXAMPLE, IS A PRINCIPAL COMPETITOR IN NORTH AMERICA. SOME

COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD RANGES OF PRODUCTS WHICH COMPETE WITH CATERPILLAR.

OTHERS, LIKE INGERSOLL-RAND, ONLY OFFER A LIMITED RANGE OF PRODUCTS

THAT COMPETE WITH CATERPILLAR.

DURING

2004, THE MACHINERY BUSINESS IN GENERAL ENJOYED AN INCREASE IN INDUSTRY DEMAND.

MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS SAW SALES AND OPERATING PROFITS IMPROVE FROM YEARS OF

STAGNANT SALES AND DIFFICULT PROFITABILITY. THE SHARP INDUSTRY UPTURN CREATED

SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES IN ADDITION TO THE MATERIAL COST CHALLENGES OF HIGH

COMMODITY PRICES FOR ALL COMPETITORS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS CONTINUED TO FACE

DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CHALLENGES. ASIA-BASED COMPETITORS WERE IMPACTED THE MOST

BY THE INDUSTRY SLOWDOWN IN CHINA. EUROPE-BASED COMPETITORS WERE MOST IMPACTED

BY THE STRONG EURO. MOST NORTH AMERICA-BASED COMPETITORS BENEFITED FROM THE VERY

STRONG NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY UPTURN. WHILE THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE

MACHINERY BUSINESS CONTINUED TO BE INTENSE, THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE INDUSTRY

AS A WHOLE IMPROVED.

ENGINES

CATERPILLAR

OPERATES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE ENGINE/TURBINE MANUFACTURING AND PACKAGING

ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES DIESEL, HEAVY FUEL AND NATURAL GAS

RECIPROCATING ENGINES FOR THE ON- AND OFF-HIGHWAY MOBILE MARKETS - AS WELL AS

IN THE PACKAGING

AREA, CATERPILLAR ALSO FACES A WIDE VARIETY OF GENERATOR SET PACKAGERS AND OTHER

ENGINE AND TURBINE-RELATED PACKAGING COMPETITORS. NORTH AMERICA-BASED PACKAGERS

INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO GENERAL ELECTRIC CO., CUMMINS INC., KOHLER CO.,

KATOLIGHT CORP., GENERAC POWER SYSTEMS, INC., MULTIQUIP INC., DETROIT DIESEL

JENBACHER, SDMO, HIMOINSA S.L., MITSUBISHI HEAVY INDUSTRIES, LTD., ATLAS COPCO

AB, KAWASAKI HEAVY INDUSTRIES, LTD., AKSA POWER GENERATION (KAZANCI HOLDING) AND

MANY OTHER REGIONAL PACKAGERS DISPERSED AROUND THE WORLD. THESE PACKAGERS SOURCE

EMISSION COMPLIANT AS WELL AS NON-COMPLIANT ENGINES AND TURBINES AND OTHER

COMPONENTS FROM DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS, AND MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS

REGIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH A VARIETY OF COMPANY OWNED, INDEPENDENT,

ON-LINE AND MULTI-BRAND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

PAGE 2

IN THE NORTH

AMERICA MARKET, HEAVY-DUTY AND MIDRANGE ON-HIGHWAY TRUCK ENGINE COMPETITORS

CONTINUED TO MARKET EMISSION CERTIFIED ENGINES MEETING THE JANUARY 1, 2004

UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) EMISSION LIMITS USING COOLED

EXHAUST GAS RE-CIRCULATION TECHNOLOGY (EGR). IN ADDITION, THE INDUSTRY CONTINUED

TO INVEST HEAVILY IN NEW TECHNOLOGY TO MEET FUTURE ON- AND OFF-HIGHWAY EMISSION

REGULATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. FURTHERMORE, COMPETITORS FORMED

OR CONTINUED JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS IN AN EFFORT TO SHARE DEVELOPMENT

COSTS, STRENGTHEN CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, REACH NEW MARKETS AND LEVERAGE CORE

COMPETENCIES. MOREOVER, KEY COMPONENT SUPPLIERS SUCH AS DELPHI CORP., BOSCH

GMBH, DENSO CORP., STANADYNE CORP. AND FLEETGUARD INC. (PART OF CUMMINS INC.)

CONTINUED TO PLAY VISIBLE ROLES AS EMISSION TECHNOLOGY DRIVERS, PARTNERS, AND

KEY SUPPLIERS TO THE RECIPROCATING ENGINE BUSINESS.

DURING

2004, CATERPILLAR COMPLETED THE INTRODUCTION OF ITS FULL LINE OF ACERT® ENGINES

INTO THE NORTH AMERICA ON-HIGHWAY TRUCK MARKET, AND CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN ITS

LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THIS MARKET. IN ADDITION, CATERPILLAR ESTABLISHED ITSELF

AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF TRUCK ENGINES FOR THE SPECIALTY, BUS AND RECREATIONAL

VEHICLE (RV) MARKETS. CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF CATERPILLAR ACERT ENGINE

PERFORMANCE, QUALITY AND RELIABILITY IS STRONG. AS A RESULT OF STRONG INDUSTRY

GROWTH, CATERPILLAR EXPERIENCED SOME HEAVY-DUTY ACERT ENGINES CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS IN 2004.

CATERPILLAR ALSO

FOCUSED 2004 INVESTMENT AND RESOURCES ON LEVERAGING ITS SUCCESS WITH ACERT

ENGINES IN ON-HIGHWAY TRUCK MARKETS INTO OFF-ROAD MARKETS, AS WELL AS THE

REMAINDER OF ITS ENGINE PLATFORMS. THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ACERT TECHNOLOGY ARE

VERY FLEXIBLE AND SCALEABLE, AND ARE BEING APPLIED AS NEEDED BASED ON ENGINE

PLATFORM AND APPLICATION. WE HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT 13 CATERPILLAR MACHINE MODELS

ARE BEING UPGRADED TO ACERT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY, AND 6 OF THESE 13 MODELS ARE

ALREADY SHIPPING. A FULL LINE OF SEVEN ACERT INDUSTRIAL ENGINES HAS BEEN

RELEASED, AND PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO LEVERAGE ACERT TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT

CATERPILLAR'S BUSINESSES AND ENGINE PLATFORMS. WE EXPECT THIS TO ESTABLISH

CATERPILLAR AS THE FIRST COMPANY TO OFFER A FULL LINE OF TIER 3/STAGE 3A

EMISSION COMPLIANT OFF-HIGHWAY ENGINES.

WE BELIEVE ACERT

PROVIDES CATERPILLAR A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE TO MEET

EMISSION AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN

DEVELOPING AND LEVERAGING ACERT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS. WHILE

CATERPILLAR IS ABLE TO LEVERAGE ITS ACERT TECHNOLOGY DIRECTLY INTO ITS

OFF-HIGHWAY BUSINESSES, OUR COMPETITORS MUST PURSUE ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES OR

FURTHER DEVELOP THEIR EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES TO MEET OFF-HIGHWAY MARKET NEEDS AND

EMISSION REQUIREMENTS.

FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS

CAT FINANCIAL,

INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE, IS A WHOLLY OWNED FINANCE SUBSIDIARY OF CATERPILLAR.

CAT FINANCIAL'S PRIMARY BUSINESS IS TO PROVIDE RETAIL-FINANCING ALTERNATIVES FOR

CATERPILLAR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS AND CATERPILLAR DEALERS AROUND THE WORLD. SUCH

RETAIL FINANCING IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF FINANCING OF CATERPILLAR EQUIPMENT,

MACHINERY AND ENGINES. IN ADDITION, CAT FINANCIAL ALSO PROVIDES FINANCING FOR

VEHICLES, POWER GENERATION FACILITIES AND MARINE VESSELS THAT, IN MOST CASES,

INCORPORATE CATERPILLAR PRODUCTS.

IN

ADDITION TO RETAIL FINANCING,

CAT FINANCIAL

DEALER RECEIVABLES FROM CATERPILLAR.

THE

VARIOUS FINANCING PLANS OFFERED BY CAT FINANCIAL ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE

OPPORTUNITY FOR SALES OF CATERPILLAR PRODUCTS AND GENERATE FINANCING INCOME FOR

CAT FINANCIAL. CAT FINANCIAL'S ACTIVITY IS CONDUCTED PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED

STATES, WITH ADDITIONAL OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES IN ASIA, AUSTRALIA, CANADA,

INFORMATION ON THE ABOVE AND CAT FINANCIAL'S CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK,

PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 21 ON PAGES A-26 AND A-27 OF THE

APPENDIX.

THE RETAIL

FINANCING BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FINANCING FOR USERS OF

CATERPILLAR EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, PRINCIPALLY

COMMERCIAL BANKS AND FINANCE AND LEASING COMPANIES. CAT FINANCIAL'S COMPETITORS

INCLUDE CIT GROUP, CITIBANK, GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION AND LOCAL

BANKS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR COMPETITOR MANUFACTURERS USE BELOW-MARKET

INTEREST RATE PROGRAMS (SUBSIDIZED BY THE MANUFACTURER) TO ASSIST MACHINE SALES.

CATERPILLAR AND CAT FINANCIAL WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE A BROAD ARRAY OF

FINANCIAL MERCHANDISING PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD TO MEET THESE COMPETITIVE

OFFERS.

CAT

FINANCIAL'S RESULTS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON CATERPILLAR DEALERS' ABILITY TO

SELL EQUIPMENT AND CUSTOMERS' WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO FINANCING OR LEASING

AGREEMENTS WITH IT. IT IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FROM ITS

FINANCING SOURCES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS INFLATION AND MARKET

INTEREST RATES.

CAT

FINANCIAL HAS A "MATCH FUNDING" POLICY WHEREBY THE INTEREST RATE PROFILE (FIXED

RATE OR FLOATING RATE) OF ITS DEBT PORTFOLIO LARGELY MATCHES THE INTEREST RATE

PROFILE OF ITS RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO PLUS RETAINED INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED

WHOLESALE RECEIVABLES WITHIN ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT

POLICY, CAT FINANCIAL USES INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MODIFY THE

DEBT STRUCTURE TO MATCH THESE ASSETS. THIS "MATCH FUNDING" REDUCES THE

VOLATILITY OF MARGINS BETWEEN INTEREST-BEARING ASSETS AND INTEREST-BEARING

LIABILITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHICH DIRECTION INTEREST RATES MOVE. CAT FINANCIAL

ALSO USES THESE INSTRUMENTS TO GAIN AN ECONOMIC AND/OR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

THROUGH A LOWER COST OF BORROWED FUNDS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY CHANGING THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF EXISTING DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR ENTERING INTO NEW AGREEMENTS IN

COMBINATION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF NEW DEBT. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING MATCH

FUNDING, PLEASE SEE NOTE 3 ON PAGES A-12 AND A-13 OF THE APPENDIX.

IN MANAGING FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK FOR CAT FINANCIAL'S OPERATIONS, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO MINIMIZE

EARNINGS VOLATILITY RESULTING FROM CONVERSION AND THE REMEASUREMENT OF NET

FOREIGN CURRENCY BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS. THIS POLICY ALLOWS THE USE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE RISK OF CURRENCY MISMATCH BETWEEN THE

RECEIVABLE AND DEBT PORTFOLIO. NONE OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS

ARE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE.

PAGE 4

CAT FINANCIAL

PROVIDES FINANCING ONLY WHEN ACCEPTABLE CRITERIA ARE MET. CREDIT DECISIONS ARE

BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CUSTOMER'S CREDIT HISTORY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

AND EQUIPMENT APPLICATION. CAT FINANCIAL TYPICALLY MAINTAINS A SECURITY INTEREST

IN RETAIL-FINANCED EQUIPMENT AND REQUIRES PHYSICAL DAMAGE INSURANCE COVERAGE ON

FINANCED EQUIPMENT. CAT FINANCIAL FINANCES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CATERPILLAR

DEALERS' SALES AND INVENTORY OF CATERPILLAR EQUIPMENT, ESPECIALLY IN NORTH

AMERICA. CAT FINANCIAL'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IS IMPROVED BY MARKETING PROGRAMS,

SUBSIDIZED BY CATERPILLAR AND/OR CATERPILLAR DEALERS, WHICH ALLOW IT TO OFFER

BELOW-MARKET INTEREST RATES. UNDER THESE PROGRAMS, CATERPILLAR, OR THE DEALER,

SUBSIDIZES AN AMOUNT AT THE OUTSET OF THE TRANSACTION, WHICH CAT FINANCIAL THEN

RECOGNIZES AS REVENUE OVER THE TERM OF THE FINANCING. TRANSACTION PROCESSING

TIME AND THE SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO DRIVE CAT FINANCIAL IN ITS

EFFORTS TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO CUSTOMERS AND IMPROVE INTERNAL PROCESSING

EFFICIENCIES. WE BELIEVE CAT FINANCIAL'S WEB-BASED CAT FINANC

EXPRESS

SM

TRANSACTION

PROCESSING AND INFORMATION TOOL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES,

FRANCE, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA HELPS TO GIVE CAT FINANCIAL A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

IN THOSE AREAS. CAT FINANC

EXPRESS

COLLECTS

INFORMATION ON-LINE TO PROVIDE FINANCE QUOTES AND CREDIT DECISIONS AND THEN

PRINTS THE RELATED DOCUMENTS, ALL IN A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME.

WE CONTINUED TO

MAKE PROGRESS ON OUR STRATEGY TO ESTABLISH A MARKET LEADERSHIP POSITION IN CHINA

IN 2004. IN JANUARY, CATERPILLAR SHIPPED THE 10,000

TH

CAT HYDRAULIC

EXCAVATOR FROM CATERPILLAR XUZHOU LTD. THIS ACHIEVEMENT DEMONSTRATED THE

COMPANY'S COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING A STRONG PRESENCE IN CHINA AND ITS EXCELLENT

EXECUTION BY COMMITTED PEOPLE. IN APRIL, THE CHINESE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE

GRANTED CATERPILLAR (CHINA) FINANCIAL LEASING CO., LTD. A BUSINESS LICENSE TO

PROVIDE LEASING SERVICES IN CHINA. BY NOVEMBER, CATERPILLAR (CHINA) FINANCIAL

LEASING CO., LTD. HAD ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF ITS FIRST CUSTOMER LEASE

CONTRACTS. ALSO IN NOVEMBER, CATERPILLAR ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE

AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN SHANDONG SEM MACHINERY CO., LTD.

(SEM), ONE OF CHINA'S KEY WHEEL LOADER MANUFACTURERS. CATERPILLAR LOGISTICS

SERVICES INC., A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CATERPILLAR, LAUNCHED A PROJECT TO

DEVELOP A PARTS DISTRIBUTION CENTER BASED IN CHINA TO SERVE THE COMPANY'S

DEALERS AND THEIR BRANCHES. EACH ACCOMPLISHMENT IN CHINA CONTINUED CATERPILLAR'S

RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS BUSINESS MODEL IN CHINA, INCLUDING FINANCING,

LOGISTICS, DISTRIBUTION, PROCUREMENT, RENTAL AND USED EQUIPMENT.

2004 ALSO MARKED

CATERPILLAR'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE EXPANSION OF CATERPILLAR REMANUFACTURING

SERVICES' BUSINESS TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR MANUFACTURERS AND CUSTOMERS IN

INDUSTRIES BEYOND THOSE CATERPILLAR CURRENTLY SERVES. THIS EXPANSION OF

CATERPILLAR'S REMANUFACTURING STRATEGY BUILDS ON OUR SUCCESSFUL SERVICES

BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES CATERPILLAR LOGISTICS SERVICES AND FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS. IN AUGUST, WE ANNOUNCED THE ACQUISITIONS OF WILLIAMS TECHNOLOGIES,

INC. - A LEADING REMANUFACTURER OF AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS, TORQUE CONVERTERS,

AND ENGINES FOR AUTOMOTIVE AND MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY TRUCK APPLICATIONS,

LOCATED IN SUMMERVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA - AND WEALDSTONE ENGINEERING LTD., ONE OF

EUROPE'S LEADING REMANUFACTURERS OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL ENGINES LOCATED IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM. THESE TWO ACQUISITIONS PROVIDE CATERPILLAR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

LEVERAGE OUR CORE REMANUFACTURING STRENGTHS TO PROVIDE REMANUFACTURING SERVICES

TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS IN THE DIESEL ENGINE AND AUTOMOTIVE

INDUSTRIES.

WE ALSO CONTINUED

TO LEVERAGE OUR AWARD-WINNING ACERT TECHNOLOGY TO SOLIDIFY OUR POSITION AS THE

EMISSIONS REDUCTION LEADER IN BOTH ON- AND OFF-HIGHWAY APPLICATIONS. IN JULY,

SHORTLY AFTER TWO CATERPILLAR EMPLOYEES, JIM WEBER AND SCOTT LEMAN, RECEIVED THE

NATIONAL INVENTORS OF THE YEAR AWARD FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERS

ASSOCIATION, CATERPILLAR BECAME THE FIRST COMPANY TO OFFER A FULL LINE OF EPA

TIER 3 COMPLIANT ENGINES IN THE 175-300 HORSEPOWER RANGE. ACERT TECHNOLOGY

ENABLED US TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT AHEAD OF THE JANUARY 2005 AND JANUARY 2006

PLANNED IMPLEMENTATION DATES. IN NOVEMBER, OUR NEW D8T TRACK-TYPE TRACTOR

POWERED BY A CATERPILLAR ENGINE USING ACERT TECHNOLOGY BECAME THE FIRST MACHINE

TO MEET EPA TIER 3 STANDARDS, AND 6 OF AN ADDITIONAL 12 MACHINE UPGRADES TO

ACERT TECHNOLOGY HAVE ALREADY BEGUN SHIPPING. THESE MILESTONES CONTINUE TO

ESTABLISH THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR ACERT TECHNOLOGY, DEMONSTRATING THE COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE IT PROVIDES TO CATERPILLAR AND THE VALUE IT PROVIDES TO OUR CUSTOMERS

AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE.

ORDER

BACKLOG

THE

DOLLAR AMOUNT OF BACKLOG BELIEVED TO BE FIRM WAS APPROXIMATELY $9.1 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND $4.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. OF THE TOTAL BACKLOG,

APPROXIMATELY $613 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND $320 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, WAS NOT EXPECTED TO BE FILLED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. OUR BACKLOG IS

GENERALLY HIGHEST IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS BECAUSE OF SEASONAL BUYING

TRENDS IN OUR INDUSTRY.

DEALERS

OUR

MACHINES ARE DISTRIBUTED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH A WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATION OF DEALERS

(DEALER NETWORK

),

53

LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND 145 LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WORLDWIDE, THESE DEALERS SERVE 178 COUNTRIES AND

OPERATE

3,324

PLACES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING

1,437

DEALER

RENTAL OUTLETS.

RECIPROCATING

ENGINES ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE DEALER NETWORK AND TO OTHER

MANUFACTURERS FOR USE IN THEIR PRODUCTS. SOME OF THE RECIPROCATING ENGINES

MANUFACTURED BY PERKINS ARE ALSO SOLD THROUGH A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF 170

DISTRIBUTORS LOCATED IN 150 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THE ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION

SYSTEMS MANUFACTURED BY FG WILSON ARE SOLD THROUGH A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF 250

DEALERS LOCATED IN 170 COUNTRIES.

THESE DEALERS DO

NOT DEAL EXCLUSIVELY WITH OUR PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES SALES AND

SERVICING OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE THE DEALERS' PRINCIPAL BUSINESS. TURBINES AND

LARGE MARINE RECIPROCATING ENGINES ARE SOLD THROUGH SALES FORCES EMPLOYED BY

SOLAR TURBINES AND MAK, RESPECTIVELY. OCCASIONALLY, THESE EMPLOYEES ARE ASSISTED

BY INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES.

THE COMPANY'S

RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH INDEPENDENT DEALER WITHIN THE DEALER NETWORK IS

MEMORIALIZED IN A STANDARD SALES AND SERVICE AGREEMENT. PURSUANT TO THIS

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY GRANTS THE DEALER THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE AND SELL ITS

PRODUCTS AND TO SERVICE THE PRODUCTS IN A SPECIFIED GEOGRAPHIC REGION. PRICES TO

DEALERS ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY AFTER RECEIVING INPUT FROM DEALERS ON

TRANSACTIONAL PRICING IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY ALSO AGREES TO DEFEND ITS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TO PROVIDE WARRANTY AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO THE

DEALER. THE AGREEMENT FURTHER GRANTS THE DEALER A NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO THE

COMPANY'S TRADEMARKS, SERVICE MARKS AND BRAND NAMES.

IN EXCHANGE FOR

THESE RIGHTS, THE AGREEMENT OBLIGATES THE DEALER TO DEVELOP AND PROMOTE THE SALE

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS TO CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS IN THE DEALER'S

REGION. EACH DEALER SPECIFICALLY AGREES TO EMPLOY ADEQUATE SALES AND SUPPORT

PERSONNEL TO MARKET, SELL AND PROMOTE THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, DEMONSTRATE AND

EXHIBIT THE PRODUCTS, PERFORM THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS, INFORM

THE COMPANY CONCERNING ANY FEATURES THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE SAFE OPERATION OF ANY

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MAINTAIN DETAILED BOOKS AND RECORDS OF THE

DEALER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, SALES AND INVENTORIES AND MAKE THESE BOOKS AND

RECORDS AVAILABLE AT THE COMPANY'S REASONABLE REQUEST.

THESE SALES AND

SERVICE AGREEMENTS ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL BY EITHER PARTY UPON 90 DAYS WRITTEN

NOTICE AND TERMINATE AUTOMATICALLY IF THE DEALER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION

OR UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF COMPARABLE ACTION SEEKING PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS.

PATENTS

AND TRADEMARKS

OUR

PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY UNDER THE BRANDS "CATERPILLAR," "CAT," DESIGN

VERSIONS OF "CAT" AND "CATERPILLAR," "SOLAR TURBINES," "MAK," "PERKINS," "FG

WILSON" AND "OLYMPIAN." WE OWN A NUMBER OF PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS RELATING TO

THE PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE, WHICH HAVE BEEN OBTAINED OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS.

THESE PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS HAVE BEEN OF VALUE IN THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS

AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE OF VALUE IN THE FUTURE. WE DO NOT REGARD ANY OF OUR

BUSINESS AS BEING DEPENDENT UPON ANY SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF

PATENTS.

PAGE 7

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

WE HAVE ALWAYS

PLACED STRONG EMPHASIS ON PRODUCT-ORIENTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OR IMPROVED MACHINES, ENGINES AND MAJOR COMPONENTS. IN

2004, 2003, AND 2002, WE SPENT $928

MILLION,

$669 MILLION, AND

$656 MILLION, OR 3.1 PERCENT, 2.9 PERCENT, AND 3.3 PERCENT OF OUR SALES AND

REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY, ON OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

EMPLOYMENT

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2004, WE EMPLOYED 76,920 PERSONS OF WHOM

38,792

WERE LOCATED

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. FROM A GLOBAL, ENTERPRISE PERSPECTIVE, WE BELIEVE OUR

RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR EMPLOYEES IS VERY GOOD. WE BUILD AND MAINTAIN A

PRODUCTIVE, MOTIVATED WORKFORCE BY TREATING ALL EMPLOYEES FAIRLY AND

EQUITABLY.

IN

THE UNITED STATES, MOST OF OUR 38,128 EMPLOYEES ARE AT-WILL EMPLOYEES AND,

THEREFORE, NOT SUBJECT TO ANY TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT. AT

SELECT BUSINESS UNITS, CERTAIN HIGHLY SPECIALIZED EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN HIRED

UNDER EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS THAT SPECIFY A TERM OF EMPLOYMENT AND SPECIFY PAY AND

OTHER BENEFITS.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THERE WERE 11,465 U.S. HOURLY PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES WHO

WERE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS LABOR UNIONS. THE

UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW)

REPRESENTS 9,450 CATERPILLAR EMPLOYEES UNDER A SIX-YEAR CENTRAL LABOR AGREEMENT

THAT WILL EXPIRE MARCH 1, 2011. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS

(IAM) REPRESENTS 1,999 EMPLOYEES UNDER LABOR AGREEMENTS EXPIRING ON APRIL 30,

2005, AND MAY 29, 2005. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE DURING PERIODS WHEN

LABOR UNREST OR WORK STOPPAGE BY UNION-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES HAS OCCURRED, WE DO

NOT EXPECT THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EVENTS, IF ANY, ARISING IN CONNECTION

WITH THE EXPIRATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.

OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS

IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE MANDATORY OR CUSTOMARY. THE

PROVISIONS OF THESE AGREEMENTS CORRESPOND IN EACH CASE WITH THE REQUIRED OR

CUSTOMARY TERMS IN THE SUBJECT JURISDICTION.

SALES

SALES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE 54 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES FOR

2004

,

56

PERCENT

FOR 2003, AND 55

PERCENT FOR 2002.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

THE

COMPANY IS REGULATED BY FEDERAL, STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

GOVERNING OUR USE OF SUBSTANCES AND CONTROL OF EMISSIONS IN ALL OUR OPERATIONS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE EXISTING LAWS HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

WE

ARE CLEANING UP HAZARDOUS WASTE AT A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS, OFTEN WITH OTHER

COMPANIES, PURSUANT TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. WHEN IT IS LIKELY WE WILL PAY

CLEAN-UP COSTS AT A SITE AND THOSE COSTS CAN BE ESTIMATED, THE COSTS ARE CHARGED

AGAINST OUR EARNINGS. IN DOING THAT ESTIMATE, WE DO NOT CONSIDER AMOUNTS

EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHERS.

THE

AMOUNT RECORDED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP IS NOT MATERIAL AND

IS INCLUDED IN

STATEMENT 3 ON PAGE A-7 OF THE APPENDIX UNDER "ACCRUED EXPENSES."

IF

A RANGE OF LIABILITY ESTIMATES IS AVAILABLE ON A PARTICULAR SITE, WE ACCRUE AT

THE LOWER END OF THAT RANGE.

WE

CANNOT ESTIMATE COSTS ON SITES IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF CLEAN-UP. CURRENTLY,

WE HAVE SEVERAL SITES IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF CLEAN-UP, AND THERE IS NO MORE

THAN A REMOTE CHANCE THAT A MATERIAL AMOUNT FOR CLEAN-UP AT ANY INDIVIDUAL SITE

OR AT ALL SITES IN THE AGGREGATE WILL BE REQUIRED.

PAGE 8

PURSUANT TO A

CONSENT DECREE CATERPILLAR ENTERED WITH THE EPA, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO

MEET CERTAIN EMISSION STANDARDS BY OCTOBER 2002. THE DECREE PROVIDES THAT IF

ENGINE MANUFACTURERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THE STANDARDS AT THAT TIME, THEY WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO PAY A NON-CONFORMANCE PENALTY (NCP) ON EACH ENGINE SOLD THAT DID

NOT MEET THE STANDARD. THE AMOUNT OF THE NCP WOULD BE BASED ON HOW CLOSE TO

MEETING THE STANDARD THE ENGINE CAME - THE MORE OUT OF COMPLIANCE THE HIGHER THE

PENALTY. THE COMPANY BEGAN INTRODUCTION OF FULLY COMPLIANT ACERT ENGINES IN 2003

AND BY THE END OF 2003 CATERPILLAR WAS ONLY PRODUCING FULLY COMPLIANT ENGINE

MODELS. AS A RESULT, NCPS WERE NOT PAYABLE FOR ANY ENGINES BUILT IN 2004. NCPS

OF $153 MILLION WERE PAID IN 2003.

IN ADDITION, THE

CONSENT DECREE REQUIRED CATERPILLAR TO PAY A FINE OF $25 MILLION, WHICH WAS

EXPENSED IN 1998 AND TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TOTALING $35 MILLION IN

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED PRODUCTS BY JULY 7, 2007. TOTAL QUALIFYING INVESTMENTS TO

DATE FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE $34.9 MILLION, OF WHICH $5.9 MILLION WAS MADE DURING

2004. CATERPILLAR EXPECTS TO REACH THE $35 MILLION REQUIREMENT DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2005. A FUTURE BENEFIT IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED FROM THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS RELATED TO CATERPILLAR'S ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

TECHNOLOGIES IT DEVELOPED IN COMPLYING WITH ITS ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT

OBLIGATIONS. IN SHORT, CATERPILLAR EXPECTS TO RECEIVE A POSITIVE NET RETURN ON

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS BY BEING ABLE TO MARKET THE TECHNOLOGY IT

DEVELOPED.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

GENERAL

INFORMATION

CATERPILLAR'S

OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY INTEGRATED. ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF OUR PLANTS ARE

INVOLVED PRIMARILY IN THE PRODUCTION OF EITHER MACHINES OR ENGINES, SEVERAL

PLANTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE MANUFACTURING OF BOTH. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL PLANTS

ARE INVOLVED IN THE MANUFACTURING OF COMPONENTS WHICH ARE USED IN THE ASSEMBLY

OF BOTH MACHINES AND ENGINES. CATERPILLAR'S PARTS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ARE

INVOLVED IN THE STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PARTS FOR MACHINES AND ENGINES.

ALSO, THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON AT OUR TECHNICAL CENTER

(AS DESCRIBED BELOW) INVOLVE BOTH MACHINES AND ENGINES.

PROPERTIES

WE OWN ARE BELIEVED TO BE GENERALLY WELL MAINTAINED AND ADEQUATE FOR PRESENT

USE. THROUGH PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WE EXPECT THESE PROPERTIES TO REMAIN

ADEQUATE FOR FUTURE NEEDS. PROPERTIES WE LEASE ARE COVERED BY LEASES EXPIRING

OVER TERMS OF GENERALLY 1 TO 10 YEARS. WE ANTICIPATE NO DIFFICULTY IN RETAINING

OCCUPANCY OF ANY LEASED FACILITIES, EITHER BY RENEWING LEASES PRIOR TO

EXPIRATION OR BY REPLACING THEM WITH EQUIVALENT LEASED FACILITIES.

HEADQUARTERS

OUR

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS ARE IN PEORIA, ILLINOIS. ADDITIONAL MARKETING

HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE

ITEM 3. LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

WE ARE A PARTY TO

LITIGATION MATTERS AND CLAIMS THAT ARE NORMAL IN THE COURSE OF OUR OPERATIONS,

AND, WHILE THE RESULTS OF SUCH LITIGATION AND CLAIMS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH

CERTAINTY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES, BASED ON THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL, THE FINAL

OUTCOME OF ANY SINGLE PROCEEDING OR ALL PROCEEDINGS IN THE AGGREGATE WOULD NOT

HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

ON

JANUARY 16, 2002, CATERPILLAR COMMENCED AN ACTION IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE

TENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT OF ILLINOIS IN PEORIA, ILLINOIS, AGAINST NAVISTAR

INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION CORPORATION AND INTERNATIONAL TRUCK AND ENGINE

CORPORATION (COLLECTIVELY NAVISTAR). THE LAWSUIT ARISES OUT OF A LONG-TERM

PURCHASE CONTRACT BETWEEN CATERPILLAR AND NAVISTAR EFFECTIVE MAY 31, 1988, AS

AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT). THE PENDING COMPLAINT

ALLEGES THAT NAVISTAR BREACHED ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS BY: (I) PAYING

CATERPILLAR $8.08 LESS PER FUEL INJECTOR THAN THE AGREED UPON PRICE FOR NEW UNIT

INJECTORS DELIVERED BY CATERPILLAR; (II) REFUSING TO PAY CONTRACTUALLY AGREED

UPON SURCHARGES OWED AS A RESULT OF NAVISTAR ORDERING LESS THAN PLANNED VOLUMES

OF REPLACEMENT UNIT INJECTORS; AND (III) REFUSING TO PAY CONTRACTUALLY AGREED

UPON INTEREST STEMMING FROM NAVISTAR'S LATE PAYMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

THE NET PAST DUE RECEIVABLE FROM NAVISTAR REGARDING THE FOREGOING AND INCLUDED

IN "LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES - TRADE AND OTHER" IN STATEMENT 3 ON PAGE A-7 OF THE

APPENDIX TOTALED $139 MILLION. THE PENDING COMPLAINT ALSO HAS CLAIMS ALLEGING

THAT FRANKLIN POWER PRODUCTS, INC., NEWSTREAM ENTERPRISES, AND NAVISTAR,

COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY, FAILED TO PAY THE APPLICABLE PRICE FOR SHIPMENTS

OF UNIT INJECTORS TO FRANKLIN AND NEWSTREAM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE NET

PAST DUE RECEIVABLES FOR THE FOREGOING, INCLUDED IN "LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES -

TRADE AND OTHER" IN STATEMENT 3 ON PAGE A-7 OF THE APPENDIX TOTALED $13 MILLION.

THE PENDING COMPLAINT FURTHER ALLEGES THAT STURMAN INDUSTRIES, INC., AND STURMAN

ENGINE SYSTEMS, INC., COLLUDED WITH NAVISTAR TO UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY THAT STURMAN

INDUSTRIES, INC., MISAPPROPRIATED FROM CATERPILLAR TO HELP NAVISTAR DEVELOP ITS

G2 FUEL SYSTEM, AND TORTIOUSLY INTERFERED WITH THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND

CATERPILLAR'S PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH NAVISTAR. THE PENDING

COMPLAINT FURTHER ALLEGES THAT THE TWO PARTIES' COLLUSION LED NAVISTAR TO SELECT

STURMAN ENGINE SYSTEMS, INC., AND ANOTHER COMPANY, INSTEAD OF CATERPILLAR, TO

DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE THE G2 FUEL SYSTEM.

ON

MAY 7, 2002, INTERNATIONAL TRUCK AND ENGINE CORPORATION (INTERNATIONAL)

COMMENCED AN ACTION AGAINST CATERPILLAR IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF DUPAGE COUNTY,

ILLINOIS, THAT ALLEGES CATERPILLAR BREACHED VARIOUS ASPECTS OF A LONG-TERM

AGREEMENT TERM SHEET. IN ITS FIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT, INTERNATIONAL SEEKS A

DECLARATION FROM THE COURT THAT THE TERM SHEET CONSTITUTES A LEGALLY BINDING

CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF HEAVY-DUTY ENGINES AT SPECIFIED PRICES THROUGH THE END

OF 2006, ALLEGES THAT CATERPILLAR BREACHED THE TERM SHEET BY RAISING CERTAIN

PRICES EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2002, AND ALSO ALLEGES THAT CATERPILLAR BREACHED AN

OBLIGATION TO NEGOTIATE A COMPREHENSIVE LONG-TERM AGREEMENT REFERENCED IN THE

TERM SHEET. INTERNATIONAL HAS ALSO ASSERTED A CLAIM FOR "UNJUST ENRICHMENT"

RELATED TO CERTAIN REVENUES RECEIVED BY CATERPILLAR FROM ANOTHER CUSTOMER.

INTERNATIONAL SEEKS DAMAGES "IN AN AMOUNT TO BE DETERMINED AT TRIAL" AND

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. CATERPILLAR DENIES INTERNATIONAL'S CLAIMS AND HAS FILED A

COUNTERCLAIM SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT THE TERM SHEET HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY

TERMINATED. CATERPILLAR ALSO ASSERTS THAT INTERNATIONAL HAS RELEASED CATERPILLAR

FROM CERTAIN OF ITS CLAIMS. ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2003, THE APPELLATE COURT OF

ILLINOIS, RULING ON AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL, ISSUED AN ORDER CONSISTENT WITH

CATERPILLAR'S POSITION THAT, EVEN IF THE COURT SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINES THAT THE

TERM SHEET IS A BINDING CONTRACT, IT IS INDEFINITE IN DURATION AND WAS THEREFORE

TERMINABLE AT WILL BY CATERPILLAR AFTER A REASONABLE PERIOD. CATERPILLAR

ANTICIPATES THAT A TRIAL CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN JUNE 2005 WILL ADDRESS

ALL REMAINING ISSUES IN THIS MATTER. THIS MATTER IS NOT RELATED TO THE BREACH OF

CONTRACT ACTION BROUGHT BY CATERPILLAR AGAINST NAVISTAR CURRENTLY PENDING IN THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF PEORIA COUNTY, ILLINOIS.

IN

2004, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IMPOSED RETALIATORY TARIFFS ON CERTAIN U.S. ORIGIN

GOODS AS A RESULT OF A WTO DECISION THAT FOUND THE EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME

EXCLUSION (ETI) PROVISIONS OF THE FSC REPEAL AND EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME

EXCLUSION ACT OF 2000 CONSTITUTED A PROHIBITED EXPORT SUBSIDY. THESE TARIFFS,

WHICH BEGAN IN MARCH OF 2004 AT 5 PERCENT, INCREASED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT PER

MONTH. GIVEN THE MAKEUP OF THE FINAL RETALIATION LIST, SOME CATERPILLAR PARTS

AND COMPONENTS WERE SUBJECT TO THESE TARIFFS. HOWEVER, THESE TARIFFS HAVE NOT

MATERIALLY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES, THE

COMPANY HAS PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN THE EU, RUSSIA, ASIA, AND SOUTH AMERICA.

PRODUCTS SOLD INTO THE EU FROM THESE PLANTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS

RETALIATORY TARIFF. THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (ACT), ENACTED ON

OCTOBER

22, 2004, PHASES-OUT THE ETI PROVISIONS. AS A RESULT, THE EU HAS LIFTED THE

SANCTIONS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005 PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A WTO REVIEW TO

DETERMINE WHETHER CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ACT ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE RULING

AGAINST THE FSC/ETI REGIME.

PAGE 14

IN A LETTER DATED

NOVEMBER 15, 2004, THE EPA PROPOSED A CIVIL PENALTY OF $641,392 TO CATERPILLAR

FOR THE ALLEGED FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN

AIR ACT. THE EPA ALLEGES THAT CATERPILLAR CONSTRUCTED A FACILITY IN EMPORIA,

KANSAS, AND FAILED TO COMPLY WITH SECTION 112(G)(2)(B) OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

CATERPILLAR SOLD THE EMPORIA FACILITY IN DECEMBER 2002. WE ARE SEEKING A

SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER WITH ALL CONCERNED PARTIES AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

CERTAIN STATEMENTS

CONTAINED IN OUR MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING AND

INVOLVE UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RESULTS. THE WORDS

"BELIEVES," "EXPECTS," "ESTIMATES," "ANTICIPATES," "WILL BE", "SHOULD" AND

SIMILAR WORDS OR EXPRESSIONS IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE ON BEHALF

OF CATERPILLAR. UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE FACTORS THAT AFFECT INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS MATTERS SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY AND THE MARKETS IT

SERVES.

WORLD

ECONOMIC FACTORS

THE WORLD ECONOMY

HAD ITS BEST RECOVERY IN YEARS IN 2004 AND WE EXPECT THAT RECOVERY TO CONTINUE,

BUT AT A SOMEWHAT SLOWER PACE, IN 2005. THAT OUTLOOK ASSUMES CENTRAL BANKS WILL

CAUTIOUSLY RAISE INTEREST RATES SO AS NOT TO SLOW GROWTH TOO MUCH. LOW INTEREST

RATES, AND CONTINUED GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH, SHOULD ENCOURAGE FURTHER GROWTH IN

CONSTRUCTION AND MINING. SHOULD CENTRAL BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES AGGRESSIVELY,

BOTH THE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND OUR MACHINERY AND ENGINES SALES LIKELY

WOULD BE WEAKER.

THE U.S. ECONOMY IS

GROWING AT MORE THAN A THREE PERCENT RATE, WHICH UP TO NOW HAS NOT CREATED AN

INFLATION PROBLEM. WHILE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS RAISED INTEREST RATES, WE

ASSUME THE CONTINUATION OF MODERATE GROWTH AND LOW INFLATION WILL RESULT IN

INTEREST RATES OF NO MORE THAN 3.5 PERCENT BY THE END OF 2005. LONG-TERM

INTEREST RATES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE LESS THAN SHORT-TERM RATES. THAT ENVIRONMENT

SHOULD SUPPORT FURTHER GROWTH IN CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING, HELPING TO KEEP

COMMODITY PRICES FAVORABLE. SHOULD FINANCIAL CONDITIONS TIGHTEN NOTICEABLY,

CAUSING ECONOMIC GROWTH TO SLOW BELOW 3 PERCENT, EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN

MACHINERY AND ENGINES SALES LIKELY WOULD BE LOWER THAN PROJECTED.

OUR PROJECTION OF

INCREASED SALES OF MACHINERY AND ENGINES IN EUROPE, AFRICA, MIDDLE EAST (EAME)

ASSUMES THAT LOW INTEREST RATES WILL ALLOW SLIGHTLY FASTER ECONOMIC GROWTH IN

EUROPE AND THAT FAVORABLE COMMODITY PRICES WILL EXTEND HEALTHY RECOVERIES IN

BOTH AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST (AME) AND THE CIS. KEY RISKS ARE THAT THE EUROPEAN

CENTRAL BANK WILL RAISE INTEREST RATES SHARPLY TO REDUCE INFLATION OR THAT

COMMODITY PRICES COLLAPSE. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR

RESULTS.

FAVORABLE COMMODITY

PRICES, INCREASED CAPITAL INFLOWS AND AN IMPROVED FOREIGN DEBT SITUATION ARE

EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANOTHER YEAR OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN LATIN AMERICA. AS

A RESULT, WE PROJECT THAT BOTH MINING PRODUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION SPENDING WILL

INCREASE, SUPPORTING AN INCREASE IN MACHINERY AND ENGINES SALES. THIS FORECAST

IS VULNERABLE TO A SIGNIFICANT WEAKENING IN COMMODITY PRICES, A SLOWING IN WORLD

ECONOMIC GROWTH OR WIDESPREAD INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.

IN ASIA/PACIFIC, WE

PROJECT SALES GROWTH IN AUSTRALIA, INDIA AND THE DEVELOPING ASIAN ECONOMIES WILL

OFFSET A FURTHER DECLINE IN CHINA. CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE CONTINUED GROWTH IN

COAL DEMAND, LOW DOMESTIC INTEREST RATES IN MOST COUNTRIES, FURTHER GAINS IN

EXPORTS AND CONTINUED GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CHINA. SOME DEVELOPMENTS THAT

COULD LOWER EXPECTED RESULTS INCLUDE REDUCED DEMAND FOR THERMAL AND COKING COAL,

SIGNIFICANT REVALUATIONS OF REGIONAL CURRENCIES, RESTRICTIONS ON REGIONAL

EXPORTS AND SHARP INTEREST RATE HIKES, PARTICULARLY IN CHINA.

COMMODITY

PRICES

COMMODITIES

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SALES OPPORTUNITY, WITH PRICES AND PRODUCTION AS KEY

DRIVERS. PRICES HAVE IMPROVED SHARPLY OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF AND OUR

OUTLOOK ASSUMES CONTINUED GROWTH IN WORLD INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION WILL CAUSE

METALS PRICES TO REMAIN HIGH ENOUGH IN 2005 TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER MINE

INVESTMENT. ANY UNEXPECTED WEAKENING IN WORLD INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, HOWEVER,

COULD CAUSE PRICES TO DROP SHARPLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR RESULTS.

PAGE 16

COAL PRODUCTION AND

PRICES IMPROVED LAST YEAR AND OUR SALES HAVE BENEFITED. WE EXPECT THESE TRENDS

TO CONTINUE IN 2005. SHOULD COAL PRICES SOFTEN, DUE TO A SLOWING IN WORLD

ECONOMIC GROWTH OR OTHERWISE, THE ONGOING SALES RECOVERY WOULD BE

VULNERABLE.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRICES INCREASED SHARPLY OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS DUE TO STRONG DEMAND AND HIGH

CAPACITY USAGE. HIGHER ENERGY PRICES DID NOT HALT ECONOMIC RECOVERIES LAST YEAR

SINCE A STRONG DEMAND BOOSTED PRICES AND WORLD PRODUCTION INCREASED. HIGH PRICES

ARE ENCOURAGING MORE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND WE EXPECT INCREASED

PRODUCTION IN 2005 WILL CONSTRAIN PRICE INCREASES. HOWEVER, SHOULD SIGNIFICANT

SUPPLY CUTS OCCUR, SUCH AS FROM OPEC PRODUCTION CUTS OR POLITICAL UNREST IN A

MAJOR PRODUCING COUNTRY, THE RESULTING OIL SHORTAGES AND PRICE SPIKES COULD SLOW

ECONOMIES, POTENTIALLY WITH A DEPRESSING IMPACT ON OUR SALES.

MONETARY

AND FISCAL POLICIES

FOR MOST COMPANIES

OPERATING IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES IMPLEMENTED IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND

ACCORDINGLY, DEMAND FOR A PRODUCT. IN GENERAL, HIGHER THAN EXPECTED INTEREST

RATES, REDUCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING, HIGHER TAXES, EXCESSIVE CURRENCY

MOVEMENTS, AND UNCERTAINTY OVER KEY POLICIES ARE SOME FACTORS LIKELY TO LEAD TO

SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LOWER INDUSTRY DEMAND.

WITH ECONOMIC DATA

LOOKING MORE FAVORABLE, CENTRAL BANKS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE STARTED

RAISING INTEREST RATES FROM THE LOWEST RATES IN DECADES. OUR OUTLOOK ASSUMES

THAT CENTRAL BANKS WILL TAKE GREAT CARE TO ENSURE THAT ECONOMIC RECOVERIES

CONTINUE AND THAT INTEREST RATES WILL REMAIN LOW THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST PERIOD.

SHOULD CENTRAL BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN ANTICIPATED,

BOTH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OUR SALES COULD SUFFER.

BUDGET DEFICITS IN

MANY COUNTRIES HAVE INCREASED, WHICH HAS LIMITED THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO

BOOST ECONOMIES WITH TAX CUTS AND MORE SPENDING. OUR OUTLOOK ASSUMES THAT

GOVERNMENTS WILL NOT AGGRESSIVELY RAISE TAXES AND SLASH SPENDING TO DEAL WITH

THEIR BUDGET IMBALANCES. SUCH ACTIONS COULD DISRUPT GROWTH AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT

OUR SALES.

POLITICAL

FACTORS

POLITICAL FACTORS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD CAN IMPACT GLOBAL COMPANIES. OUR OUTLOOK ASSUMES

THAT NO MAJOR DISRUPTIVE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC POLICIES OCCUR IN EITHER THE UNITED

STATES OR OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER TAXING OR

SPENDING POLICIES COULD REDUCE ACTIVITIES IN SECTORS IMPORTANT TO OUR

BUSINESSES, THEREBY REDUCING SALES.

OUR OUTLOOK ASSUMES

THAT THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT MILITARY CONFLICTS IN EITHER NORTH

KOREA OR THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. SUCH MILITARY CONFLICTS COULD

SEVERELY DISRUPT SALES INTO COUNTRIES AFFECTED, AS WELL AS NEARBY

COUNTRIES.

OUR OUTLOOK ALSO

ASSUMES THAT THERE WILL BE NO MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACKS. IF THERE IS A MAJOR

TERRORIST ATTACK, CONFIDENCE COULD BE UNDERMINED, POTENTIALLY CAUSING A SHARP

DROP IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND OUR SALES. ATTACKS IN MAJOR DEVELOPED ECONOMIES

WOULD BE THE MOST DISRUPTIVE.

OUR

OUTLOOK ASSUMES THAT EFFORTS BY COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THEIR EXPORTS WILL NOT

RESULT IN RETALIATORY COUNTERMEASURES BY OTHER COUNTRIES TO BLOCK SUCH EXPORTS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION. OUR OUTLOOK INCLUDES A NEGATIVE IMPACT

FROM THE PHASE-OUT OF THE EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION (ETI) AS ENACTED BY

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT). HOWEVER, OUR OUTLOOK DOES NOT

INCLUDE ANY IMPACT FROM THE PROVISION OF THE ACT ALLOWING PREFERENTIAL TAX

TREATMENT OF THE REPATRIATION OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS IN 2005. FURTHER, OUR OUTLOOK

ASSUMES ANY OTHER TAX LAW CHANGES WILL NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAXES.

CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS

THE COMPANY HAS

COSTS AND REVENUES IN MANY CURRENCIES AND IS THEREFORE EXPOSED TO RISKS ARISING

FROM CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. OUR OUTLOOK ASSUMES NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

CURRENCY VALUES FROM CURRENT RATES. SHOULD CURRENCY RATES CHANGE SHARPLY, OUR

RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY'S

LARGEST MANUFACTURING PRESENCE IS IN THE UNITED STATES, SO ANY UNEXPECTED

STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR TENDS TO RAISE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY COSTS TO OUR END

USERS AND REDUCE OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS.

PAGE 17

DEALER

PRACTICES

THE COMPANY SELLS

PRIMARILY THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT DEALER NETWORK. DEALERS CARRY INVENTORIES OF

BOTH NEW AND RENTAL EQUIPMENT AND ADJUST THOSE INVENTORIES BASED ON THEIR

ASSESSMENTS OF FUTURE NEEDS. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS CAN IMPACT OUR RESULTS EITHER

POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY. THE CURRENT OUTLOOK ASSUMES DEALERS WILL INCREASE

INVENTORIES IN LINE WITH HIGHER DELIVERIES. SHOULD DEALERS CONTROL INVENTORIES

MORE TIGHTLY, OUR SALES WOULD BE LOWER.

FINANCIAL

PRODUCTS DIVISION FACTORS

INHERENT IN THE

OPERATION OF CAT FINANCIAL IS THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CUSTOMERS. THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF EACH CUSTOMER, AND THE RATE OF DELINQUENCIES, REPOSSESSIONS

AND NET LOSSES ON CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RELEVANT INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE

AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE OF THE CUSTOMER'S

MANAGEMENT TEAM, COMMODITY PRICES, POLITICAL EVENTS, AND THE SUSTAINED VALUE OF

THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. ADDITIONALLY, INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS CREATE A DEGREE

OF RISK TO OUR OPERATIONS BY AFFECTING THE AMOUNT OF OUR INTEREST PAYMENTS AND

THE VALUE OF OUR FIXED RATE DEBT. OUR MATCH FUNDING POLICY MANAGES INTEREST RATE

RISK BY MATCHING THE INTEREST RATE PROFILE (FIXED RATE OR FLOATING RATE) OF OUR

DEBT PORTFOLIO WITH THE INTEREST RATE PROFILE OF OUR RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO

WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS. TO ACHIEVE OUR MATCH FUNDING OBJECTIVES, WE ISSUE

DEBT WITH SIMILAR INTEREST RATE PROFILE TO OUR RECEIVABLES AND ALSO USE INTEREST

RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

CHANGES AND IN SOME CASES TO LOWER OUR COST OF BORROWED FUNDS. IF INTEREST RATES

MOVE UPWARD MORE SHARPLY THAN ANTICIPATED, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. WITH RESPECT TO OUR INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

OPERATIONS, CHANGES IN THE EQUITY AND BOND MARKETS COULD CAUSE AN IMPAIRMENT OF

THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THUS REQUIRING A NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO

EARNINGS.

OTHER

FACTORS

THE RATE OF

INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING, HOUSING STARTS, COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND MINING

PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE AN INTEGRAL

COMPONENT OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND AS THESE ACTIVITIES INCREASE OR DECREASE IN

THE UNITED STATES OR ABROAD, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED.

PROJECTED COST

SAVINGS OR SYNERGIES FROM ALLIANCES WITH NEW PARTNERS COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS COULD INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WAGES, ENERGY AND/OR MATERIAL COSTS, AND/OR HIGHER

THAN EXPECTED FINANCING COSTS DUE TO UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN TAX, TRADE,

ENVIRONMENTAL, LABOR, SAFETY, PAYROLL OR PENSION POLICIES IN ANY OF THE

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE ALLIANCES CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THERE WERE 11,465 U.S. HOURLY PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES WHO

WERE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS LABOR UNIONS. THE

UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW)

REPRESENTS 9,450 CATERPILLAR EMPLOYEES UNDER A SIX-YEAR CENTRAL LABOR AGREEMENT

THAT WILL EXPIRE MARCH 1, 2011. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS

(IAM) REPRESENTS 1,999 EMPLOYEES UNDER LABOR AGREEMENTS EXPIRING ON APRIL 30,

2005, AND MAY 29, 2005. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE DURING PERIODS WHEN

LABOR UNREST OR WORK STOPPAGE BY UNION-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES HAS OCCURRED, WE DO

NOT EXPECT THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EVENTS, IF ANY, ARISING IN CONNECTION

WITH THE EXPIRATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.

RESULTS MAY BE

IMPACTED POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY BY CHANGES IN THE SALES MIX. OUR OUTLOOK

ASSUMES A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF SALES AS WELL AS A PRODUCT MIX OF SALES. IF

ACTUAL RESULTS VARY FROM THIS PROJECTED GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX OF SALES, OUR

RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE COMPANY

OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR OUTLOOK DEPENDS ON A

FORECAST OF THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF INDUSTRY SALES. AN UNEXPECTED REDUCTION IN

THAT SHARE COULD RESULT FROM PRICING OR PRODUCT STRATEGIES PURSUED BY

COMPETITORS, UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OR MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES, A FAILURE TO

PRICE THE PRODUCT COMPETITIVELY, OR AN UNEXPECTED BUILDUP IN COMPETITORS' NEW

MACHINE OR DEALER OWNED RENTAL FLEETS, LEADING TO SEVERE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

MACHINE RENTAL RATES AND/OR USED EQUIPMENT PRICES.

PAGE 18

THE

ENVIRONMENT REMAINS COMPETITIVE FROM A PRICING STANDPOINT. OUR 2005 SALES

OUTLOOK ASSUMES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING WORLDWIDE

MACHINE PRICE INCREASES COMMUNICATED TO DEALERS WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF

JANUARY 3, 2005. WHILE WE EXPECT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WILL ABSORB THESE PRICE

ACTIONS, DELAYS IN THE MARKETPLACE ACCEPTANCE WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR

RESULTS. MOREOVER, ADDITIONAL PRICE DISCOUNTING TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION COULD RESULT IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED PRICE REALIZATION.

IN GENERAL, OUR

RESULTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, PARTICULARLY THOSE

ORIGINATING IN CONSTRUCTION, MINING AND ENERGY. DEVELOPMENTS REDUCING SUCH

ACTIVITIES ALSO TEND TO LOWER OUR SALES. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS MENTIONED

ABOVE, OUR RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY OF THE

FOLLOWING.

·

ANY SUDDEN

DROP IN CONSUMER OR BUSINESS CONFIDENCE;

·

DELAYS IN

LEGISLATION NEEDED TO FUND PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION;

·

REGULATORY OR

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT SLOW ACTIVITY IN KEY INDUSTRIES;

AND/OR

·

UNEXPECTED

COLLAPSES IN STOCK MARKETS.

THIS DISCUSSION OF

UNCERTAINTIES IS BY NO MEANS EXHAUSTIVE, BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT

FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR OUTLOOK. OBVIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS GENERAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DO NOT WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION, BUT ARE NOTED

TO FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE MYRIAD OF CONTINGENCIES THAT MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY'S

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED.

UNDER

THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN

EVALUATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED

UNDER EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(E). BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER AND OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS ANNUAL

THE

MANAGEMENT OF CATERPILLAR INC. (COMPANY) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT

THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF

THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE. MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, WE USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY

THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL — INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE BASED ON

THOSE CRITERIA.

OUR MANAGEMENT'S

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS
