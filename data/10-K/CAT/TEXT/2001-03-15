PRINCIPAL LINES OF BUSINESS

CATERPILLAR OPERATES IN THREE PRINCIPAL LINES OF BUSINESS.

MACHINERY

- DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND MARKETING OF

CONSTRUCTION, MINING, AGRICULTURAL, AND FORESTRY MACHINERY - TRACK AND

WHEEL TRACTORS, TRACK AND WHEEL LOADERS, PIPELAYERS, MOTOR GRADERS,

WHEEL TRACTOR-SCRAPERS, TRACK AND WHEEL EXCAVATORS, BACKHOE LOADERS,

MINING SHOVELS, LOG SKIDDERS, LOG LOADERS, OFF-HIGHWAY TRUCKS,

ARTICULATED TRUCKS, PAVING PRODUCTS, TELESCOPIC HANDLERS, SKID STEER

LOADERS, AND RELATED PARTS.

- DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND MARKETING OF ENGINES

FOR CATERPILLAR

MACHINERY,

ON-HIGHWAY TRUCKS AND LOCOMOTIVES;

MARINE, PETROLEUM, CONSTRUCTION, INDUSTRIAL, AGRICULTURAL, AND OTHER

APPLICATIONS; ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION SYSTEMS; AND RELATED PARTS.

RECIPROCATING ENGINES MEET POWER NEEDS RANGING FROM 5 TO OVER 22,000

HORSEPOWER (4 TO OVER 16 200 KILOWATTS). TURBINES RANGE FROM 1,340 TO

18,000 HORSEPOWER (1000 TO 13 500 KILOWATTS).

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

- FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS AND DEALERS

FOR THE PURCHASE AND LEASE OF CATERPILLAR AND NONCOMPETITIVE RELATED

EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS SOME FINANCING FOR CATERPILLAR SALES TO DEALERS.

ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS FORMS OF INSURANCE TO CUSTOMERS AND DEALERS TO

HELP SUPPORT THE PURCHASE AND LEASE OF OUR EQUIPMENT. THIS LINE OF

BUSINESS CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF CATERPILLAR FINANCIAL SERVICES

CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND CATERPILLAR INSURANCE SERVICES

CORPORATION.

DUE TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN

ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION,

WE HAVE ALSO DIVIDED OUR BUSINESS INTO

EIGHT OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS, INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, IS INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE FROM NOTE 20 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON

PAGES A-17 THROUGH A-19 OF THE APPENDIX.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

WE CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN OUR

MACHINERY AND ENGINES'

LINES

OF BUSINESS UNDER HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INTENSE PRICE

COMPETITION. WE PLACE GREAT EMPHASIS UPON THE HIGH QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF

OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR DEALERS' SERVICE SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH NO ONE COMPETITOR IS

BELIEVED TO PRODUCE ALL OF THE SAME TYPES OF MACHINES AND ENGINES, THERE ARE

NUMEROUS COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, WHICH COMPETE WITH US IN THE SALE OF EACH

OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS'

LINE OF BUSINESS ALSO

CONDUCTS BUSINESS UNDER HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS. FINANCING FOR USERS OF

CATERPILLAR PRODUCTS IS AVAILABLE THROUGH A VARIETY OF COMPETITIVE SOURCES,

PRINCIPALLY COMMERCIAL BANKS AND FINANCE AND LEASING COMPANIES. WE EMPHASIZE

PROMPT AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE TO MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND OFFER VARIOUS

FINANCING PLANS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS

AND GENERATE FINANCING INCOME FOR OUR COMPANY.

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS'

ACTIVITY

IS PRIMARILY CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH ADDITIONAL OFFICES IN ASIA,

AUSTRALIA, CANADA, EUROPE, AND LATIN AMERICA.

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATIONS IN 2000 AND OUTLOOK FOR

2001, INCLUDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN OPERATIONS, ARE INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE FROM "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" ON PAGES A-22

THROUGH A-30 OF THE APPENDIX.

ACQUISITIONS

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000 WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH

DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO CREATE A GLOBAL ENGINE ALLIANCE TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE,

MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE MEDIUM-DUTY ENGINES AND FUEL SYSTEMS FOR SALE TO

THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS AND FOR CAPTIVE USE. THE ALLIANCE WILL CREATE A

MEDIUM-DUTY ENGINE JOINT VENTURE, A FUEL SYSTEMS JOINT VENTURE, RESEARCH AND

ENGINEERING COOPERATION, AND COMBINED PURCHASING VOLUME FOCUSED ON PROCUREMENT

SYNERGIES. THE ALLIANCE IS EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2001.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 1999 WE ACQUIRED THE REMAINING

51% INTEREST IN FG WILSON.

FG WILSON IS A LEADING PACKAGER OF DIESEL-POWERED GENERATOR SETS. DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 1998, WE ACQUIRED THE NET ASSETS OF PERKINS LTD. AND THE STOCK

OF SEVERAL RELATED SUBSIDIARIES FOR $1.328 BILLION. PERKINS IS A LEADING

MANUFACTURER OF SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED ENGINES. BOTH ACQUISITIONS WERE ACCOUNTED

FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

DEALERS

MACHINES ARE DISTRIBUTED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH A WORLDWIDE

ORGANIZATION OF DEALERS, 63 LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND 157 LOCATED OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES. WORLDWIDE, THESE DEALERS HAVE OVER 2,700 PLACES OF BUSINESS

(INCLUDING ABOUT 650 RENTAL STORES) AND SERVE 171 COUNTRIES. RECIPROCATING

ENGINES ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE WORLDWIDE DEALER ORGANIZATION AND TO

OTHER MANUFACTURERS FOR USE IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY THEM. SOME OF THE

RECIPROCATING ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY PERKINS ARE ALSO SOLD THROUGH THEIR

WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTOR NETWORK. OUR DEALERS DO NOT DEAL EXCLUSIVELY WITH OUR

PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES SALES AND SERVICING OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE OUR

DEALERS' PRINCIPAL BUSINESS. TURBINES AND LARGE MARINE RECIPROCATING ENGINES ARE

SOLD THROUGH SALES FORCES EMPLOYED BY SOLAR AND MAK, RESPECTIVELY. OCCASIONALLY,

THESE EMPLOYEES ARE ASSISTED BY INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY UNDER THE MARKS

"CATERPILLAR," "CAT," DESIGN VERSIONS OF "CAT" AND

"CATERPILLAR," "SOLAR," "MAK,"

"PERKINS," "FG WILSON," AND "OLYMPIAN." WE OWN A

NUMBER OF PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE, WHICH

HAVE BEEN OBTAINED OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. THESE PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS HAVE

BEEN OF VALUE IN THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE OF VALUE IN

THE FUTURE. WE DO NOT REGARD ANY OF OUR BUSINESS AS BEING DEPENDENT UPON ANY

SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF PATENTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE HAVE ALWAYS PLACED STRONG EMPHASIS ON PRODUCT-ORIENTED RESEARCH

AND ENGINEERING RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OR IMPROVED MACHINES, ENGINES

AND MAJOR COMPONENTS. IN 2000, 1999, AND 1998, WE SPENT $854 MILLION, $814

MILLION, AND $838 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON OUR RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING

PROGRAMS. OF THESE AMOUNTS, $649 MILLION IN 2000, $626 MILLION IN 1999, AND $643

MILLION IN 1998 WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW PRIME PRODUCTS, MAJOR COMPONENT

DEVELOPMENT AND MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE REMAINDERS WERE

ATTRIBUTABLE TO ENGINEERING

2

COSTS INCURRED DURING THE EARLY PRODUCTION PHASE AS WELL AS

ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE EXISTING PRODUCTS.

EMPLOYMENT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, WE EMPLOYED 68,440 PERSONS OF WHOM 30,780 WERE

LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

SALES

SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE 50% OF CONSOLIDATED SALES FOR

2000, 50% FOR 1999, AND 49% FOR 1998.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY IS REGULATED BY FEDERAL,

STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS GOVERNING OUR USE OF SUBSTANCES AND

CONTROL OF EMISSIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE EXISTING LAWS HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

WE ARE CLEANING UP HAZARDOUS WASTE AT A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS,

OFTEN WITH OTHER COMPANIES, PURSUANT TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. WHEN IT IS

LIKELY WE WILL PAY CLEAN-UP COSTS AT A SITE AND THOSE COSTS CAN BE ESTIMATED,

THE COSTS ARE CHARGED AGAINST OUR EARNINGS. IN DOING THAT ESTIMATE, WE DO NOT

CONSIDER AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHERS.

THE AMOUNT SET ASIDE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP IS NOT

MATERIAL AND IS INCLUDED IN "ACCRUED EXPENSES" IN STATEMENT 3 OF THE

APPENDIX. IF A RANGE OF LIABILITY ESTIMATES IS AVAILABLE ON A PARTICULAR SITE,

WE ACCRUE THE LOWER END OF THAT RANGE.

WE CANNOT ESTIMATE COSTS ON SITES IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF

CLEAN-UP. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE FIVE OF THESE SITES, AND THERE IS NO MORE THAN A

REMOTE CHANCE THAT A MATERIAL AMOUNT FOR CLEAN-UP WILL BE REQUIRED.

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RESULTS. THE WORDS "BELIEVES,"

"EXPECTS," "ESTIMATES," "ANTICIPATES," "WILL

BE" AND SIMILAR WORDS OR EXPRESSIONS IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

MADE ON BEHALF OF CATERPILLAR. UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE FACTORS THAT AFFECT

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS MATTERS SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY AND THE

MARKETS IT SERVES.

8

WORLD ECONOMIC FACTORS

OUR CURRENT OUTLOOK CALLS FOR A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH IN THE U.S.

ECONOMY IN EARLY 2001, BUT GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO PICK UP MOMENTUM IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR THROUGH 2002. SHOULD RECENT INTEREST RATE REDUCTIONS FAIL TO

STIMULATE THE U.S. ECONOMY AS EXPECTED, LEADING TO A MORE PROTRACTED SLOWDOWN OR

RECESSION IN 2001, THEN SALES OF MACHINES AND ENGINES WOULD DECLINE SHARPLY THIS

YEAR AND COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN 2002 AS WELL. THE OUTLOOK ALSO PROJECTS

THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN ASIA PACIFIC, EUROPE, AFRICA

& MIDDLE EAST AND LATIN AMERICA. IF, FOR ANY REASON, THESE PROJECTED GROWTH

RATES FALTER, SALES WOULD LIKELY BE LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN THE AFFECTED

REGION. IN GENERAL, RENEWED CURRENCY SPECULATION, SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE

STOCK MARKETS, FURTHER OIL OR ENERGY PRICE INCREASES, POLITICAL DISRUPTIONS OR

MUCH HIGHER INTEREST RATES COULD RESULT IN WEAKER THAN ANTICIPATED ECONOMIC

GROWTH AND WORLDWIDE SALES OF BOTH MACHINES AND ENGINES COULD BE LOWER THAN

EXPECTED AS A RESULT.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY COULD ALSO BE DELAYED OR WEAKENED BY

GROWING BUDGET OR CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS OR INAPPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT POLICIES.

IN PARTICULAR, OUR OUTLOOK ASSUMES THAT THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT REMAINS

COMMITTED TO STIMULATING THEIR ECONOMY WITH APPROPRIATE MONETARY AND FISCAL

POLICIES AND THAT THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT FOLLOWS THROUGH WITH PROMISED FISCAL

AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS. A REVERSAL BY EITHER GOVERNMENT COULD RESULT IN ECONOMIC

UNCERTAINTY AND A WEAKER ECONOMY. OUR OUTLOOK ALSO ASSUMES THAT CURRENCY AND

STOCK MARKETS REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE AND THAT WORLD OIL PRICES MOVE DOWN, ON

AVERAGE, FROM THE RELATIVELY ELEVATED LEVELS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000. IF

CURRENCY MARKETS WERE TO EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VOLATILITY, AND/OR

STOCK MARKETS WERE TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY, INTEREST RATES COULD MOVE HIGHER,

WHICH WOULD PROBABLY RESULT IN SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LOWER SALES. IN

ADDITION, AN ERUPTION OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST COULD LEAD TO OIL

SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS AND RESUMED UPWARD PRESSURE ON OIL PRICES. IN THIS CASE,

INFLATION PRESSURES WOULD MOVE UP AGAIN AND INTEREST RATES WOULD BE HIGHER THAN

CURRENTLY PROJECTED, LEADING TO SLOWER WORLD ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POTENTIALLY TO

LOWER COMPANY SALES.

THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY HAS IMPROVED, BUT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

UNCERTAINTY REMAINS HIGH AND AN UNEXPECTED DETERIORATION COULD IMPACT WORLDWIDE

STOCK OR CURRENCY MARKETS, WHICH IN TURN COULD WEAKEN COMPANY SALES.

COMMODITY PRICES

THE OUTLOOK FOR OUR SALES ALSO DEPENDS ON COMMODITY PRICES. CONSISTENT WITH

OUR OUTLOOK FOR MODERATE WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 2001, ALTHOUGH COPPER AND

ALUMINUM PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER, INDUSTRIAL METALS PRICES AS A WHOLE

ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT FLAT ON AVERAGE IN 2001. OIL PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO

DECLINE FROM AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT $30 TO $32 A BARREL IN 2000 TO AN AVERAGE OF

$25 TO $30 A BARREL IN 2001. AGRICULTURAL PRICES ARE LIKELY TO BE FLAT. BASED ON

THIS FORECAST, EQUIPMENT SALES INTO SECTORS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CRUDE OIL

PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE UP IN 2001. INDUSTRY SALES TO THE INDUSTRIAL METALS

AND AGRICULTURE EQUIPMENT MARKETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT FLAT IN 2001.

WEAKER THAN ANTICIPATED WORLD ECONOMIC GROWTH COULD LEAD TO

SHARP DECLINES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED SALES INTO INDUSTRIAL

METALS, OIL AND AGRICULTURE.

9

MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES

FOR MOST COMPANIES OPERATING IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY, MONETARY AND FISCAL

POLICIES IMPLEMENTED IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND, ACCORDINGLY, DEMAND FOR A PRODUCT. IN THE UNITED STATES,

THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE FROM CURRENT

LEVELS OF 6% TO A RANGE OF 5% TO 5.5% IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2001. IF THE FEDERAL

RESERVE DOES NOT LOWER RATES ACCORDINGLY, AND ADD SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO THE

BANKING SYSTEM TO GENERATE THE PROJECTED ACCELERATION IN GROWTH IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2001, THEN MACHINE AND ENGINE INDUSTRY DEMAND COULD BE LOWER THAN

EXPECTED, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN LOWER COMPANY SALES. SIMILARLY, IF THE

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK RAISES RATES IN 2001, THEN MACHINE AND ENGINE DEMAND IN

EUROPE COULD BE LOWER THAN EXPECTED.

IN GENERAL, HIGH INTEREST RATES, REDUCTIONS IN GOVERNMENT

SPENDING, HIGHER TAXES, SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS, AND UNCERTAINTY OVER

KEY POLICIES ARE SOME FACTORS LIKELY TO LEAD TO SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND LOWER

INDUSTRY DEMAND. THE CURRENT OUTLOOK IS FOR SLOWER U.S. GROWTH IN 2001, BUT NOT

A RECESSION. IF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THE U.S. WERE TO ENTER A RECESSION, THEN

DEMAND FOR COMPANY PRODUCTS COULD FALL IN THE U.S. AND CANADA AND WOULD ALSO BE

LOWER THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD.

POLITICAL FACTORS

POLITICAL FACTORS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON GLOBAL

COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST U.S. EXPORTERS AS A PERCENTAGE OF

SALES. INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FISCAL POLICIES IMPLEMENTED IN THE U.S. THIS YEAR

COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS ABROAD. U.S. FOREIGN

RELATIONS WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND ANY RELATED RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED COULD ALSO

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FOREIGN SALES. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

EXPECTED POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA, ASIA, AND EUROPE, AFRICA AND

THE MIDDLE EAST WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN 2001 THAT COULD AFFECT U.S.

TRADE POLICIES AND/OR DE-STABILIZE LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS LEADING TO LOWER

COMPANY SALES.

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ARE ALSO AN UNKNOWN FOR GLOBAL COMPANIES. THE COMPANY

HAS FACILITIES IN MAJOR SALES AREAS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND SIGNIFICANT COSTS

AND REVENUES IN MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES. THIS DIVERSIFICATION GREATLY REDUCES THE

OVERALL IMPACT OF CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ON RESULTS. HOWEVER, IF THE U.S. DOLLAR

STRENGTHENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THE CONVERSION OF NET NON-U.S. DOLLAR

PROCEEDS TO U.S. DOLLARS WOULD SOMEWHAT ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS. FURTHER, SINCE THE COMPANY'S LARGEST MANUFACTURING PRESENCE IS IN THE

U.S., A SUSTAINED OVERVALUED DOLLAR COULD HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR

GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS.

DEALER PRACTICES

A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE MADE THROUGH ITS INDEPENDENT DEALER

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. DEALER PRACTICES, SUCH AS CHANGES IN INVENTORY LEVELS FOR

BOTH NEW AND RENTAL EQUIPMENT, ARE NOT WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CONTROL (PRIMARILY

BECAUSE THESE PRACTICES DEPEND UPON THE DEALER'S ASSESSMENT OF ANTICIPATED

SALES AND THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF INVENTORY) AND MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. IN PARTICULAR, THE OUTLOOK ASSUMES

THAT INVENTORY TO SALES RATIOS WILL BE SOMEWHAT LOWER AT THE END OF 2001 THAN AT

THE END OF 2000. IF DEALERS REDUCE INVENTORY LEVELS MORE THAN ANTICIPATED,

COMPANY SALES WILL BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

10

OTHER FACTORS

THE RATE OF INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING, HOUSING STARTS, COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION

AND MINING PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE

AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND AS THESE ACTIVITIES INCREASE OR

DECREASE IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED. IN 1999, THE SIX-YEAR FEDERAL HIGHWAY BILL DID NOT BOOST U.S. SALES AS

MUCH AS ANTICIPATED DUE TO DELAYS IN GETTING MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR HIGHWAYS

UNDERWAY. IN 2000, THERE WAS A MATERIAL INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF HIGHWAY

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS, WHICH HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON SALES OF CERTAIN TYPES OF

EQUIPMENT. IF FUNDING FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION IN 2001 IS DELAYED, OR IS

CONCENTRATED ON BRIDGE REPAIR, SALES COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

PROJECTED COST SAVINGS OR SYNERGIES FROM ALLIANCES WITH NEW

PARTNERS COULD ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS. THESE

FACTORS COULD INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WAGES, ENERGY

AND/OR MATERIALS COSTS, AND/OR HIGHER THAN EXPECTED FINANCING COSTS DUE TO

UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN CENTRAL BANK INTEREST RATE POLICIES. COST SAVINGS COULD

ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN TAX, TRADE, ENVIRONMENTAL,

LABOR, SAFETY, PAYROLL OR PENSION POLICIES IN ANY OF THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE

ALLIANCES CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS.

RESULTS MAY BE IMPACTED POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY BY CHANGES

IN THE SALES MIX. OUR OUTLOOK ASSUMES A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF SALES AS WELL

AS A PRODUCT MIX OF SALES.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR OUTLOOK DEPENDS

ON A FORECAST OF THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF INDUSTRY SALES. A REDUCTION IN THAT

SHARE COULD RESULT FROM PRICING OR PRODUCT STRATEGIES PURSUED BY COMPETITORS,

UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OR MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES, A FAILURE TO PRICE THE

PRODUCT COMPETITIVELY, OR AN UNEXPECTED BUILDUP IN COMPETITORS' NEW MACHINE OR

DEALER OWNED RENTAL FLEETS.

THE ENVIRONMENT ALSO REMAINS VERY COMPETITIVE FROM A PRICING

STANDPOINT. ADDITIONAL PRICE DISCOUNTING WOULD RESULT IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED

PRICE REALIZATION.

THIS DISCUSSION OF UNCERTAINTIES IS BY NO MEANS EXHAUSTIVE

BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR OUTLOOK.

OBVIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DO NOT

WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT ARE NOTED TO FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE MYRIAD OF

CONTINGENCIES THAT MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED.
