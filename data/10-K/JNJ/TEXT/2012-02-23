THE BUSINESS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS CONDUCTED BY MORE THAN 250 OPERATING COMPANIES LOCATED IN 60 COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE

UNITED STATES, WHICH SELL PRODUCTS IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER SEGMENTS OF BUSINESSCONSUMER,

PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS. HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THOSE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO THOSE DEVELOPED BY SUBSIDIARIES ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN COMPARABLE U.S. ACTIVITIES

BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL CLIMATE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES ARE

GENERALLY READILY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. WHERE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, THE TEMPORARY UNAVAILABILITY OF THOSE RAW MATERIALS WOULD NOT LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS

AND OF OBTAINING PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE MEANS. THESE TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED. JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS

IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES.

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH

YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS REFLECTS INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR ADVERTISING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT

REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE

PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THIS ALSO INCLUDES PROTECTING THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN CONTINUING

RESEARCH AND IN MAINTAINING SALES FORCES. IN ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS SUBSIDIARIES BUSINESSES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES RELATE TO THE PROCESSES OF DISCOVERING, TESTING

AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATING PRODUCT EFFICACY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PRIOR TO LAUNCH. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WITH THE AIM OF DELIVERING HIGH

QUALITY AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS. WORLDWIDE COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $7.5 BILLION, $6.8 BILLION AND $7.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. MAJOR RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE LOCATED NOT

ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO IN BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

ENVIRONMENT

JOHNSON & JOHNSONS

OPERATING COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE

COMPANYS COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO, HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

REGULATION

MOST OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD

INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATION. IN

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG, DEVICE, DIAGNOSTICS AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY,

MANUFACTURING, ADVERTISING, LABELING AND SAFETY REPORTING. THE EXERCISE OF BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE FDA) CONTINUES TO RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR FDA

CLEARANCE OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE A SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND

LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE UNITED STATES, ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG PRICES AND PROFITS AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PARTICULAR DRUGS OR RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE PARTICULAR MEDICAL

DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT FORCE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE UTILIZATION AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF HEALTH CARE.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES OPERATE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS THAT

MAY SUBJECT THOSE COMPANIES TO ACTIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT

RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY HAVE COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY IN THE

UNITED STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AND RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

DURING THE FIRST FISCAL
