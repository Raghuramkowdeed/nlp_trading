THE BUSINESS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS CONDUCTED BY MORE THAN 230 OPERATING COMPANIES LOCATED IN 60 COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER “– SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS – CONSUMER,” “– PHARMACEUTICAL” AND “– MEDICAL DEVICES.” HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE THOSE DEVELOPED IN THE U.S. AND BY SUBSIDIARIES ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN COMPARABLE U.S. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL CLIMATE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY FINANCIAL INSTABILITY IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY READILY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.  WHERE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, THE TEMPORARY UNAVAILABILITY OF THOSE RAW MATERIALS WOULD NOT LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

PATENTS

THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION ON THEIR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES WHERE POSSIBLE. THEY OWN, OR ARE LICENSED UNDER, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES RELATING TO THEIR PRODUCTS, PRODUCT USES, FORMULATIONS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES FACE PATENT CHALLENGES FROM THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING CHALLENGES SEEKING TO MANUFACTURE AND MARKET GENERIC AND BIOSIMILAR VERSIONS OF THE COMPANY'S KEY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIOR TO EXPIRATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS COVERING THOSE PRODUCTS. SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS INVOLVING THE COMPANY'S PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 21, “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS—INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY” OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT.

SALES OF THE COMPANY’S LARGEST PRODUCT, REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB), ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9.7% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2016. ACCORDINGLY, THE PATENTS RELATED TO THIS PRODUCT ARE BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY.

THERE ARE TWO SETS OF PATENTS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO REMICADE

®

. THE FIRST SET OF PATENTS IS CO-OWNED BY JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON, AND NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER (NYU). JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC. HAS AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO NYU'S INTERESTS IN THE PATENTS. THESE PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED IN ALL COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE ONE REMAINING PATENT, WHICH EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2018, STANDS REJECTED FOLLOWING

2

REEXAMINATION PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED BY A THIRD PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO). THE PATENT HAS ALSO BEEN HELD INVALID BY THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS.  THE DECISIONS BY THE USPTO AND THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT HAVE BEEN APPEALED TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. THE APPEALS ARE PENDING.

THE SECOND SET OF PATENTS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO REMICADE

®

WAS GRANTED TO THE KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF RHEUMATOLOGY  IN EUROPE, CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES. JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC. HAS LICENSES (EXCLUSIVE FOR HUMAN ANTI-TNF ANTIBODIES AND SEMI-EXCLUSIVE FOR NON-HUMAN ANTI-TNF ANTIBODIES) TO THESE PATENTS, WHICH EXPIRE IN 2017 OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND 2018 IN THE UNITED STATES.  CERTAIN OF THESE PATENTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED AND INVALIDATED, AND OTHERS ARE UNDER REVIEW IN VARIOUS PATENT OFFICES AROUND THE WORLD AND ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LITIGATION IN CANADA.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ANY EXTENSIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PATENTS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO REMICADE

®

. IN 2016, A THIRD PARTY RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR SALE OF ITS INFLIXIMAB BIOSIMILAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTRODUCED ITS BIOSIMILAR TO THE U.S. MARKET IN LATE 2016. FOR A MORE EXTENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF LEGAL MATTERS REGARDING THE PATENTS RELATED TO REMICADE

®

, SEE NOTE 21 “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY – PHARMACEUTICAL – REMICADE

®

RELATED CASES” OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT.

IN ADDITION TO COMPETING IN THE IMMUNOLOGY MARKET WITH REMICADE

®

, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY MARKETING STELARA

®

(USTEKINUMAB), SIMPONI

®

(GOLIMUMAB) AND SIMPONI ARIA

®

(GOLIMUMAB), NEXT GENERATION IMMUNOLOGY PRODUCTS WITH REMAINING PATENT LIVES OF UP TO SEVEN YEARS.

TRADEMARKS

THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS AND OF OBTAINING PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE MEANS. THESE TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES.

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS REFLECTS INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR ADVERTISING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY. COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY SOURCED, INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS PROTECTING THE UNDERLYING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN CONTINUING RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY’S CONSUMER PRODUCTS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES RELATE TO THE PROCESSES OF DISCOVERING, TESTING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATING PRODUCT EFFICACY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PRIOR TO LAUNCH. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WITH THE AIM OF DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS. WORLDWIDE COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $9.1 BILLION, $9.0 BILLION AND $8.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.  RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

ENVIRONMENT

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY’S COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT CHANGE DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATION. IN THE U.S., THE DRUG, DEVICE AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, MANUFACTURING, ADVERTISING, LABELING AND SAFETY REPORTING. THE EXERCISE OF BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE "FDA") CONTINUES TO RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR FDA APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE A SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE U.S., ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG PRICES AND PROFITS AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PARTICULAR DRUGS, OR TO RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE PARTICULAR MEDICAL DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT FORCE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE UTILIZATION AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF HEALTH CARE GENERALLY.

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (THE "ACA").  THESE HAVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE U.S. HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY WITH MUCH REMAINING UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE ACA, AND POTENTIAL MODIFICATION OR REPEAL OF ACA PROVISIONS, WILL ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE INDUSTRY.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS THAT MAY SUBJECT IT TO ACTIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY HAVE COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AND RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

FURTHER, THE COMPANY RELIES ON GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, AND PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESSES, THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT SOURCING, SUPPLY AND PRICING OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.  THESE PROCESSES ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO LENGTHY REGULATORY APPROVALS.

RISK FACTORS

THE COMPANY FACES A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT AND THE COMPANY’S OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC, INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW. INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS AND THAT THE FOLLOWING IS NOT MEANT TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES. IF KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, POTENTIALLY IN A MATERIAL WAY.

4

ONE OF THE COMPANY’S KEY PRODUCTS, REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB), IS EXPERIENCING BIOSIMILAR COMPETITION, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN U.S. SALES OF REMICADE

®.

THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO PATENTS COVERING ITS LARGEST PRODUCT, REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB) (ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 9.7% OF THE COMPANY’S TOTAL REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2016), AND CONTINUES TO ASSERT CERTAIN PATENTS RELATED TO THE PRODUCT. IN APRIL 2016, THE FDA APPROVED FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES AN INFLIXIMAB BIOSIMILAR TO BE MARKETED BY A SUBSIDIARY OF PFIZER INC. IN OCTOBER 2016, THE NOTICE OF LAUNCH PERIOD UNDER THE U.S. BIOLOGICS PRICE COMPETITION AND INNOVATION ACT (THE BPCIA) PASSED AND IN NOVEMBER 2016 PFIZER BEGAN SHIPMENT OF AN INFLIXIMAB BIOSIMILAR TO WHOLESALERS IN THE UNITED STATES. SALES OF AN INFLIXIMAB BIOSIMILAR IN THE U.S. MARKET WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN U.S. SALES OF REMICADE

®.

GLOBAL SALES IN THE COMPANY’S PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HEALTHCARE REFORMS AND INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES.

SALES OF THE COMPANY’S PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRODUCTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY REIMBURSEMENTS BY THIRD-PARTY PAYERS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. AS PART OF VARIOUS EFFORTS TO CONTAIN HEALTHCARE COSTS, THESE PAYERS ARE PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES AT WHICH PRODUCTS WILL BE REIMBURSED. IN THE UNITED STATES, INCREASED PURCHASING POWER OF ENTITIES THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND PRIVATE SECTOR BENEFICIARIES, IN PART DUE TO CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION AMONG HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, COULD RESULT IN FURTHER PRICING PRESSURES. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, NUMEROUS MAJOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE EU AND JAPAN, HAVE PERVASIVE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN FUNDING HEALTHCARE AND, IN THAT REGARD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IMPOSE PRICE CONTROLS, LIMIT ACCESS TO, OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR, THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS, OR REDUCE THE VALUE OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, FINES AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS INVOLVING VARIOUS ISSUES SUCH AS PATENT DISPUTES, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND CLAIMS THAT THEIR PRODUCT SALES, MARKETING AND PRICING PRACTICES VIOLATE VARIOUS ANTITRUST, UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES AND/OR CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 21, “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” UNDER NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION. THE COMPANY COULD IN THE FUTURE BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS AS A RESULT OF SETTLEMENTS OR JUDGMENTS IN THESE MATTERS, POTENTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ACCRUALS. THE RESOLUTION OF, OR INCREASE IN ACCRUALS FOR, ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THAT PERIOD. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF COST AND AVAILABILITY FACTORS, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2005, THE COMPANY CEASED PURCHASING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE.

PRODUCT RELIABILITY, SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS CONCERNS CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LEAD TO LITIGATION AND CAUSE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE.

CONCERNS ABOUT PRODUCT SAFETY, WHETHER RAISED INTERNALLY OR BY REGULATORS OR CONSUMER ADVOCATES, AND WHETHER OR NOT BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, CAN RESULT IN SAFETY ALERTS, PRODUCT RECALLS, GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, REGULATORY ACTION ON THE PART OF THE FDA (OR ITS COUNTERPART IN OTHER COUNTRIES), PRIVATE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, PAYMENT OF FINES AND SETTLEMENTS, DECLINING SALES AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CAN ALSO RESULT IN DAMAGE TO BRAND IMAGE, BRAND EQUITY AND CONSUMER TRUST IN THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS. PRODUCT RECALLS HAVE IN THE PAST, AND COULD IN THE FUTURE, PROMPT GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND INSPECTIONS, THE SHUTDOWN OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, CONTINUED PRODUCT SHORTAGES AND RELATED SALES DECLINES, SIGNIFICANT REMEDIATION COSTS, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, POSSIBLE CIVIL PENALTIES AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR EXPOSURES TO ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S OPERATING RESULTS.

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TAX REFORM PROPOSALS IN THE U.S., BELGIUM AND SWITZERLAND, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. A CHANGE IN STATUTORY TAX RATE MAY RESULT IN THE REVALUATION OF THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE RELEVANT JURISDICTION IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE NEW TAX LAW IS ENACTED, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A MATERIAL EXPENSE OR BENEFIT RECORDED TO THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS FOR THAT PERIOD.  FOR A DISCUSSION OF RISKS OF CHANGES IN TAX RATES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING BELGIUM, PLEASE SEE “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION—OTHER INFORMATION—ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS” IN ITEM 7 OF THIS REPORT.

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS AND FILES TAX RETURNS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES AND CURRENTLY HAS TAX AUDITS IN PROGRESS WITH MANY TAX AUTHORITIES.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING (BEPS) PROJECT, STARTING IN 2017, COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE MORE INFORMATION TO TAX AUTHORITIES ON OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH MAY LEAD TO GREATER AUDIT SCRUTINY OF PROFITS EARNED IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELY OUTCOMES OF ITS TAX AUDITS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ITS TAX RESERVES. HOWEVER, ANY TAX AUTHORITY

5

COULD TAKE A POSITION ON TAX TREATMENT THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY’S EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN TAX LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF RESERVES.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY SECURE AND DEFEND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY OWNS OR LICENSES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, DETERMINED BY PATENT OFFICES, COURTS AND LAWMAKERS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THESE RIGHTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES AND MATERIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PUBLIC POLICY, BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S., HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY UNFAVORABLE TOWARD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT IT WILL OBTAIN ADEQUATE PATENT PROTECTION FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER IMPORTANT MARKETS OR THAT SUCH PROTECTIONS, ONCE GRANTED, WILL LAST AS LONG AS ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED.

COMPETITORS ROUTINELY CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR EXTENT OF THE COMPANY’S OWNED OR LICENSED PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS THROUGH LITIGATION, INTERFERENCES, OPPOSITIONS AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS. THESE PROCEEDINGS ABSORB RESOURCES AND CAN BE PROTRACTED AS WELL AS UNPREDICTABLE. IN ADDITION, CHALLENGES THAT THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS INFRINGE THE PATENTS OF THIRD PARTIES COULD RESULT IN THE NEED TO PAY PAST DAMAGES AND FUTURE ROYALTIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPETITIVE POSITION AND SALES OF THE PRODUCTS IN QUESTION.

THE COMPANY HAS FACED INCREASING PATENT CHALLENGES FROM THIRD PARTIES SEEKING TO MANUFACTURE AND MARKET GENERIC AND BIOSIMILAR VERSIONS OF THE COMPANY'S KEY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIOR TO EXPIRATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS COVERING THOSE PRODUCTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF INNOVATIVE HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS MAY CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY, OR CLAIM NON-INFRINGEMENT, OF INNOVATOR PRODUCTS THROUGH THE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION, OR ANDA, PROCESS WITH THE FDA. THE BPCIA, ENACTED IN 2010, WHICH CREATED A NEW REGULATORY PATHWAY FOR THE APPROVAL BY THE FDA OF BIOSIMILAR ALTERNATIVES TO INNOVATOR-DEVELOPED BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS, ALSO CREATED MECHANISMS FOR BIOSIMILAR APPLICANTS TO CHALLENGE THE PATENTS ON THE INNOVATOR BIOLOGICS. THE INTER PARTES REVIEW (IPR) PROCESS WITH THE USPTO, CREATED UNDER THE 2011 AMERICA INVENTS ACT, IS ALSO BEING USED BY COMPETITORS TO CHALLENGE PATENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, A KEY PATENT FOR ZYTIGA

®

IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO PATENT LITIGATION AND SEVERAL IPR PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY GENERIC COMPANIES SEEKING TO INVALIDATE THE PATENT.

IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING ITS PATENTS AGAINST SUCH CHALLENGES, OR UPON THE “AT-RISK” LAUNCH (DESPITE PENDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION) BY THE GENERIC OR BIOSIMILAR FIRM OF ITS PRODUCT, THE COMPANY CAN LOSE A MAJOR PORTION OF REVENUES FOR THE REFERENCED PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY’S PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 21, “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS—INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY” OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT.

THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCT MARKETS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN ALL THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND IN ALL GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS. THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES OF ALL SIZES ON THE BASIS OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, REAL OR PERCEIVED PRODUCT ADVANTAGES, PRICING AND AVAILABILITY AND RATE OF REIMBURSEMENT. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN SECURING RIGHTS TO ACQUISITIONS, COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. COMPETITION FOR RIGHTS TO PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND ACQUISITION COSTS AND ONEROUS AGREEMENT TERMS FOR THE COMPANY. COMPETITORS’ DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE OR LESS COSTLY PRODUCTS, AND/OR THEIR ABILITY TO SECURE PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND SUCCESSFULLY MARKET PRODUCTS AHEAD OF US, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT SALES OF THE COMPANY’S EXISTING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS ITS ABILITY TO BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET DESPITE SIGNIFICANT PRIOR INVESTMENT IN THE RELATED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

FOR THE COMPANY’S PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES, LOSS OF PATENT EXCLUSIVITY FOR A PRODUCT OFTEN IS FOLLOWED BY A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN SALES AS COMPETITORS GAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR GENERIC AND OTHER COMPETING PRODUCTS AND ENTER THE MARKET. SIMILAR COMPETITION CAN BE TRIGGERED BY THE LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR A BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT. FOR THE COMPANY’S MEDICAL DEVICE BUSINESSES, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, PRODUCT QUALITY, REPUTATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO COMPETITIVENESS. DEVELOPMENT BY OTHER COMPANIES OF NEW OR IMPROVED PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES COULD THREATEN TO MAKE THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES LESS DESIRABLE, LESS ECONOMICAL OR OBSOLETE. THE COMPANY’S CONSUMER BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER BRANDED PRODUCTS AND RETAILERS’ PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDS.  IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO SUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENTIATE AND MARKET ITS BRAND NAME CONSUMER PRODUCTS, THIS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

6

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES OR DELAYS IN THE COMPANY’S INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND INDICATIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM SUCCESS.

THE COMPANY’S CONTINUED GROWTH AND SUCCESS DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND DEVELOP NEW AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THE EVOLVING HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF PATIENTS, PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS. DEVELOPMENT OF SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES IS ALSO NECESSARY TO OFFSET REVENUE LOSSES WHEN THE COMPANY’S EXISTING PRODUCTS LOSE MARKET SHARE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS COMPETITION AND LOSS OF PATENT EXCLUSIVITY. NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 22% OF 2016 SALES. THE COMPANY CANNOT BE CERTAIN WHEN OR WHETHER IT WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, LICENSE OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE COMPANIES, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, WHETHER PARTICULAR PRODUCT CANDIDATES WILL BE GRANTED REGULATORY APPROVAL, AND, IF APPROVED, WHETHER THE PRODUCTS WILL BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANY PURSUES PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS THROUGH COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. IN ALL OF THESE CONTEXTS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND MEDICAL DEVICES, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES OVER MANY YEARS. ONLY A VERY FEW BIOPHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS RESULT IN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCTS. THE PROCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO DISCERN PATIENTS’ AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS’ FUTURE NEEDS; DEVELOP PROMISING NEW COMPOUNDS, STRATEGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES; ACHIEVE SUCCESSFUL CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS; SECURE EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS ON A TIMELY BASIS; AND, IF AND WHEN THEY REACH THE MARKET, SUCCESSFULLY DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING PRODUCTS AND APPROACHES TO TREATMENT. NEW PRODUCTS OR ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED QUICKLY OR SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE MARKETPLACE DUE TO PRODUCT AND PRICE COMPETITION, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES OR HEALTHCARE PURCHASING PATTERNS, RESISTANCE BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OR UNCERTAINTY OVER THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. EVEN FOLLOWING INITIAL REGULATORY APPROVAL, THE SUCCESS OF A PRODUCT CAN BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY SAFETY AND EFFICACY FINDINGS IN LARGER REAL WORLD PATIENT POPULATIONS, AS WELL AS MARKET ENTRY OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING REGULATORY SCRUTINY WHICH IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE COSTS AND EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, LEGAL ACTIONS AND PENALTIES.

LIKE OTHER COMPANIES IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND LEGAL ACTION, BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. REGULATORY ISSUES REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES (CGMP) (AND COMPARABLE QUALITY REGULATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES) BY MANUFACTURERS OF DRUGS, DEVICES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS CAN LEAD TO FINES AND PENALTIES, PRODUCT RECALLS, PRODUCT SHORTAGES, INTERRUPTIONS IN PRODUCTION, DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT APPROVALS AND LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETING, PRICING AND SALE OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND LEGAL ACTIONS INCLUDING UNDER THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT, THE MEDICAID REBATE PROGRAM, FEDERAL AND STATE FALSE CLAIMS ACTS, STATE UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES ACTS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. INCREASED SCRUTINY OF HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY BUSINESS PRACTICES IN RECENT YEARS BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN THE U.S., AND ANY RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS, CARRY RISK OF SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DEBARMENT FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS. ANY SUCH DEBARMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS AND LITIGATION BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 21, “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS” UNDER NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT.

THE COMPANY FACES A VARIETY OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY.

THE COMPANY’S EXTENSIVE OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE ACCOMPANIED BY CERTAIN FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE LISTED BELOW.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

: IN FISCAL 2016, APPROXIMATELY 47% OF THE COMPANY’S SALES OCCURRED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., WITH APPROXIMATELY 22% IN EUROPE, 8% IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, EXCLUDING THE U.S., AND 17% IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC AND AFRICA REGION. CHANGES IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR IMPACT THE COMPANY’S REVENUES AND EXPENSES. WHILE THE COMPANY USES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON ITS CASH FLOWS, UNHEDGED EXPOSURES CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE WEAKENING OR STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE TRANSLATION EFFECTS WHEN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANY’S NON-U.S. BUSINESS ACTIVITY ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS.

INFLATION AND CURRENCY DEVALUATION RISKS

: THE COMPANY FACES CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING PROFITABILITY OF OPERATIONS IN ECONOMIES EXPERIENCING HIGH INFLATION RATES. THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED FOR OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA AS HIGHLY INFLATIONARY, AS THE PRIOR THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE INFLATION RATE SURPASSED 100%. WHILE THE COMPANY STRIVES TO MAINTAIN PROFIT MARGINS IN THESE AREAS THROUGH COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND PERIODIC PRICE INCREASES, IT MIGHT EXPERIENCE OPERATING LOSSES AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED INFLATION. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY DEVALUATIONS IN COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING HIGH INFLATION RATES OR SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S OPERATING RESULTS.

7

ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS

: THE ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FROM COUNTRIES WHERE GOVERNMENT PRICE CONTROLS OR OTHER MARKET DYNAMICS RESULT IN LOWER PRICES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LIMITED QUANTITIES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR PERSONAL USE, FOREIGN IMPORTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE ILLEGAL UNDER CURRENT U.S. LAW. HOWEVER, THE VOLUME OF ILLEGAL IMPORTS CONTINUES TO RISE AS THE ABILITY OF PATIENTS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN THE LOWER-PRICED IMPORTS HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY.

ANTI-BRIBERY AND OTHER REGULATIONS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL AND FOREIGN LAWS THAT GOVERN ITS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENTS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THOSE LAWS INCLUDE THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA), WHICH PROHIBITS U.S. PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, FROM PROMISING, OFFERING, OR GIVING ANYTHING OF VALUE TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS WITH THE CORRUPT INTENT OF INFLUENCING THE FOREIGN OFFICIAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING THE COMPANY OBTAIN OR RETAIN BUSINESS OR GAIN ANY IMPROPER ADVANTAGE. THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS IS HEAVILY REGULATED AND THEREFORE INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION WITH FOREIGN OFFICIALS. ALSO, IN MANY COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S., THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO PRESCRIBE HUMAN PHARMACEUTICALS ARE EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PURCHASERS OF HUMAN PHARMACEUTICALS ARE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES; THEREFORE, THE COMPANY’S INTERACTIONS WITH THESE PRESCRIBERS AND PURCHASERS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER THE FCPA. IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE FCPA, VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE U.K BRIBERY ACT 2010, AIMED AT PREVENTING AND PENALIZING CORRUPT AND ANTICOMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR. ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER THESE LAWS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS, WHICH COULD INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR CIVIL PENALTIES, CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES, INCLUDING EXCLUSION FROM HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS.

OTHER LEGAL, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RISKS

. OTHER RISKS INHERENT IN CONDUCTING BUSINESS GLOBALLY INCLUDE.

•

PROTECTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS SUCH AS TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND IMPORT/EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS;

•

COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL REGULATIONS AND LAWS INCLUDING, IN SOME COUNTRIES, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS RESTRICTING THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE OR SELL ITS PRODUCTS IN THE RELEVANT MARKET;

•

DIMINISHED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS;

•

POTENTIAL NATIONALIZATION OR EXPROPRIATION OF THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN ASSETS; AND

•

DISRUPTIONS TO MARKETS DUE TO WAR, ARMED CONFLICT, TERRORISM, SOCIAL UPHEAVALS OR PANDEMICS.

INTERRUPTIONS AND DELAYS IN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS, SALES AND REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY’S MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS REQUIRES THE TIMELY DELIVERY OF SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF COMPLEX, HIGH-QUALITY COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS. THESE SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE 119 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AS WELL AS SOURCING FROM HUNDREDS OF SUPPLIERS AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY HAS IN THE PAST, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE, FACE UNANTICIPATED INTERRUPTIONS AND DELAYS IN MANUFACTURING THROUGH ITS INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL SUPPLY CHAIN. MANUFACTURING DISRUPTIONS CAN OCCUR FOR MANY REASONS INCLUDING REGULATORY ACTION, PRODUCTION QUALITY DEVIATIONS OR SAFETY ISSUES, LABOR DISPUTES, SITE-SPECIFIC INCIDENTS (SUCH AS FIRES), NATURAL DISASTERS, RAW MATERIAL SHORTAGES, POLITICAL UNREST AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. SUCH DELAYS AND DIFFICULTIES IN MANUFACTURING CAN RESULT IN PRODUCT SHORTAGES, DECLINES IN SALES AND REPUTATIONAL IMPACT AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT REMEDIATION AND RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDRESSING THE SHORTAGE.

AN INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENT, INCLUDING A CYBERSECURITY BREACH, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS OR REPUTATION

TO MEET BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, THE COMPANY RELIES ON BOTH INTERNAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, AND THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES AND THEIR VENDORS, TO PROCESS AND STORE SENSITIVE DATA, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL RESEARCH, BUSINESS PLANS, FINANCIAL INFORMATION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND PERSONAL DATA.  THE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY THREATS, WHICH AFFECT COMPANIES GLOBALLY, POSE A RISK TO THE SECURITY AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE IT SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPANY’S SENSITIVE DATA.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY ASSESSES THESE THREATS AND MAKES INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE INTERNAL PROTECTION, DETECTION, AND RESPONSE CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS ENSURE THE COMPANY’S THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS HAVE REQUIRED CAPABILITIES AND CONTROLS, TO ADDRESS THIS RISK. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM INFORMATION OR CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS; HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENTLY CHANGING ATTACK TECHNIQUES, ALONG WITH THE INCREASED VOLUME AND SOPHISTICATION OF THE ATTACKS, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE COMPANY TO BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. THIS IMPACT COULD RESULT IN REPUTATIONAL, COMPETITIVE, OPERATIONAL OR OTHER BUSINESS HARM AS WELL AS FINANCIAL COSTS AND REGULATORY ACTION.

IN ADDITION TO THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NUMEROUS OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE ALSO DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT UNDER “BUSINESS – RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.”

THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY SEEK TO OWN THEIR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ALTHOUGH SOME, PRINCIPALLY IN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, ARE LEASED. OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES ARE OFTEN LEASED.  THE COMPANY ALSO ENGAGES CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING ALL OF ITS PROPERTIES IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION AND REPAIR, AND THE FACILITIES ARE WELL UTILIZED.

MCNEIL-PPC, INC. (NOW JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONSUMER INC.) (MCNEIL-PPC) CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER A CONSENT DECREE, SIGNED IN 2011 WITH THE FDA, WHICH GOVERNS CERTAIN MCNEIL CONSUMER HEALTHCARE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, AND REQUIRES MCNEIL-PPC TO REMEDIATE THE FACILITIES IT OPERATES IN LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA, FORT WASHINGTON, PENNSYLVANIA, AND LAS PIEDRAS, PUERTO RICO (THE "CONSENT DECREE"). THE FORT WASHINGTON FACILITY WAS VOLUNTARILY SHUT DOWN IN APRIL 2010, AND SUBSEQUENTLY MANY PRODUCTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER MANUFACTURING SITES AND SUCCESSFULLY REINTRODUCED TO THE MARKET. AFTER MCNEIL-PPC SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ALL REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN THE CONSENT DECREE WORKPLANS FOR THE LANCASTER AND LAS PIEDRAS MANUFACTURING SITES AND COMPLETED THE STEPS REQUIRED FOR THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION OF THE FORT WASHINGTON PLANT, A THIRD-PARTY CGMP EXPERT SUBMITTED WRITTEN CERTIFICATIONS TO THE FDA FOR ALL THREE MANUFACTURING SITES.  FOLLOWING FDA INSPECTIONS IN 2015, MCNEIL-PPC RECEIVED NOTIFICATIONS FROM THE FDA THAT ALL THREE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IN FORT WASHINGTON STARTED AS OF SEPTEMBER 2015.

UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE, AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE FROM THE FDA OF BEING IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, EACH OF THE THREE FACILITIES IS SUBJECT TO A FIVE-YEAR AUDIT PERIOD BY A THIRD-PARTY CGMP EXPERT. THUS, A THIRD-PARTY EXPERT WILL CONTINUE TO REASSESS THE SITES AT VARIOUS TIMES FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. A DISCUSSION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THIS MATTER CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 21 “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS – MCNEIL CONSUMER HEALTHCARE” OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS

JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) HAVE APPROXIMATELY 126,400 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS IN THE HEALTH CARE FIELD. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD WITH THE PRIMARY FOCUS ON PRODUCTS RELATED TO HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING.

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED INTO THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: CONSUMER, PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES. THE CONSUMER SEGMENT INCLUDES A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS USED IN THE BABY CARE, ORAL CARE, BEAUTY (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS SKIN CARE), OVER-THE-COUNTER PHARMACEUTICAL, WOMEN’S HEALTH AND WOUND CARE MARKETS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND SOLD BOTH TO RETAIL OUTLETS AND DISTRIBUTORS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT IS FOCUSED ON FIVE THERAPEUTIC AREAS, INCLUDING IMMUNOLOGY, INFECTIOUS DISEASES, NEUROSCIENCE, ONCOLOGY, AND CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC DISEASES. PRODUCTS IN THIS SEGMENT ARE DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, WHOLESALERS, HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS FOR PRESCRIPTION USE. THE MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT INCLUDES A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS USED IN THE ORTHOPAEDIC, SURGERY, CARDIOVASCULAR, DIABETES CARE AND VISION CARE FIELDS WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED TO WHOLESALERS, HOSPITALS AND RETAILERS, AND USED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PROFESSIONAL FIELDS BY PHYSICIANS, NURSES, HOSPITALS, EYE CARE PROFESSIONALS AND CLINICS.

THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS THE PRINCIPAL MANAGEMENT GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRATEGIC OPERATIONS AND ALLOCATION OF THE RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY. THIS COMMITTEE OVERSEES AND COORDINATES THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CONSUMER, PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

IN ALL OF ITS PRODUCT LINES, THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH COMPANIES BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS PROTECTING THE UNDERLYING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY’S SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN CONTINUING RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY’S CONSUMER PRODUCTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

MANAGEMENT’S OBJECTIVES

THE COMPANY MANAGES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK WITH OUR CREDO AS THE FOUNDATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT OUR STRATEGIC OPERATING PRINCIPLES: BEING BROADLY BASED IN HUMAN HEALTH CARE, MANAGING THE BUSINESS FOR THE LONG TERM, HAVING A DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT APPROACH, AND BEING COMMITTED TO OUR PEOPLE AND VALUES, ARE CRUCIAL TO SUCCESSFULLY MEETING THE DEMANDS OF THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. TO THIS END, MANAGEMENT IS FOCUSED ON OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGIC GROWTH DRIVERS: CREATING VALUE THROUGH INNOVATION, EXPANDING OUR GLOBAL REACH WITH A LOCAL FOCUS, EXCELLENCE IN EXECUTION AND LEADING WITH PURPOSE.

THE COMPANY IS BROADLY BASED IN HUMAN HEALTH CARE, AND IS COMMITTED TO CREATING VALUE BY DEVELOPING ACCESSIBLE, HIGH QUALITY, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 22% OF 2016 SALES. IN 2016, $9.1 BILLION, OR 12.7% OF SALES, WAS INVESTED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, REFLECTING MANAGEMENT’S COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING NEW AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEET EVOLVING HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND SUSTAIN THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM GROWTH.

OUR DIVERSE BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN 230 OPERATING COMPANIES LOCATED IN 60 COUNTRIES ARE THE KEY DRIVERS OF THE COMPANY’S SUCCESS. MAINTAINING THE COMPANY’S DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT APPROACH, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LEVERAGING THE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES OF THE ENTERPRISE, POSITIONS THE COMPANY WELL TO INNOVATE, EXECUTE STRATEGIC PLANS AND REACH MARKETS GLOBALLY, AS WELL AS ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES OF THE LOCAL MARKETS.

IN ORDER TO REMAIN A LEADER IN HEALTH CARE, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO MAINTAIN A PURPOSE-DRIVEN ORGANIZATION AND IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING GLOBAL BUSINESS LEADERS WHO CAN ACHIEVE THESE GROWTH OBJECTIVES. BUSINESSES ARE MANAGED FOR THE LONG-TERM IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN MARKET LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AND ENABLE GROWTH, WHICH PROVIDES AN ENDURING SOURCE OF VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR CREDO UNIFIES ALL JOHNSON & JOHNSON EMPLOYEES IN ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVES, AND PROVIDES A COMMON SET OF VALUES THAT SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE COMPANY’S RESPONSIBILITIES TO PATIENTS, CONSUMERS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE FOUNDATIONAL VALUES, ITS STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND LONG-TERM GROWTH DRIVERS, ALONG WITH ITS OVERALL MISSION OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, WILL ENABLE JOHNSON & JOHNSON TO CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY.

SALES GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY MARKET GROWTH, U.S. SALES OF THE TRAUMA TFNA NAILING SYSTEM, WORLDWIDE SALES OF THE HIP PRIMARY STEM PLATFORM AND THE ATTUNE

®

THE ACQUISITION OF NEUWAVE MEDICAL, INC. ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO GROWTH. THE OPERATIONAL DECLINE IN GENERAL SURGERY WAS DUE TO LOWER SALES OF WOMEN'S HEALTH AND UROLOGY PRODUCTS AND PRICING PRESSURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH OF SUTURES. THE OPERATIONAL DECLINE IN SPECIALTY SURGERY WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES OF ACCLARENT PRODUCTS AND ADVANCED STERILIZATION PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE U.S., DIVESTITURES AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN STERILMED PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH OF MENTOR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

THE DIABETES CARE FRANCHISE SALES WERE $1.8 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 7.2% FROM 2015, WHICH REPRESENTED AN OPERATIONAL DECLINE OF 5.9% AND A NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT OF 1.3%.

MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT.

IN 2016, THE MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT INCOME BEFORE TAX AS A PERCENT TO SALES WAS 22.2% VERSUS 27.2% IN 2015. THE DECREASE IN THE INCOME BEFORE TAX AS A PERCENT TO SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GAINS OF $1.4 BILLION RELATED TO DIVESTITURES, HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSE OF $0.8 BILLION AND A HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $0.1 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2015. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WRITE-DOWN OF $0.3 BILLION RELATED TO ACCLARENT IN 2015 AND FAVORABLE SELLING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2016.

IN 2015, THE MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT INCOME BEFORE TAX AS A PERCENT TO SALES WAS 27.2% VERSUS 28.9% IN 2014 PRIMARILY DUE TO A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $0.6 BILLION, AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WRITE-DOWN OF $0.3 BILLION RELATED TO ACCLARENT, AND LOWER GAINS OF $0.5 BILLION ON DIVESTITURES AS COMPARED TO 2014.

RESTRUCTURING.

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS IN ITS MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ANNUALIZED PRE-TAX COST SAVINGS OF $800 MILLION TO $1.0 BILLION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED BY THE END OF 2018.

SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING.

PROVISION FOR TAXES ON INCOME.

THE WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 16.5% IN

2016

, 19.7% IN

2015

AND 20.6% IN

2014

. THE 2016 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED BY 3.2% AS COMPARED TO 2015. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY ADOPTED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR THE REPORTING OF ADDITIONAL TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WERE EXERCISED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR. THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW STANDARD REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL 2016 BY 1.8% VERSUS 2015. THE REMAINDER OF THE CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE LOWER EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SETTLEMENT OF SEVERAL UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN 2016 VERSUS 2015.

THE DECREASE IN THE 2015 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, AS COMPARED TO 2014 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASES IN TAXABLE INCOME IN LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS RELATIVE TO HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A TAX BENEFIT RESULTING FROM A RESTRUCTURING OF INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS AFFECTED BY THE ITEMS MENTIONED BELOW.

THE INCREASE IN THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, AS COMPARED TO 2013, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING: THE DIVESTITURE OF THE ORTHO-CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS BUSINESS AT AN APPROXIMATE 44% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, LITIGATION ACCRUALS AT LOW TAX RATES, THE MIX OF EARNINGS INTO HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY THE U.S., THE ACCRUAL OF AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF THE BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG FEE, WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE, AND ADDITIONAL U.S. TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A PLANNED INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS FROM CURRENT YEAR FOREIGN EARNINGS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  THESE INCREASES TO THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A TAX BENEFIT OF $0.4 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONOR MEDSYSTEMS DIVESTITURE.

THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS ALSO REDUCED AS THE COMPANY ADJUSTED ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF (I) THE FEDERAL APPEALS COURT’S DECISION IN OMJ PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.’S LITIGATION REGARDING CREDITS UNDER FORMER SECTION 936 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND (II) A SETTLEMENT OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2006 - 2009.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY & CASH FLOWS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE $19.0 BILLION AT THE END OF 2016 AS COMPARED TO $13.7 BILLION AT THE END OF 2015. THE PRIMARY SOURCES AND USES OF CASH THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE $5.3 BILLION INCREASE WERE APPROXIMATELY $18.8 BILLION OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OFFSET BY $4.8 BILLION NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, AND $8.6 BILLION NET CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES, AND $0.2 BILLION DUE TO THE EFFECT ON EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD $22.9 BILLION IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT THE END OF 2016 AND $24.6 BILLION AT THE END OF 2015. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $18.8 BILLION WAS THE RESULT OF $16.5 BILLION OF NET EARNINGS AND $4.9 BILLION OF NON-CASH EXPENSES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND ASSETS WRITE-DOWNS, REDUCED BY $0.6 BILLION FROM NET GAINS ON SALE OF ASSETS/BUSINESSES, $0.3 BILLION RELATED TO DEFERRED TAXES AND $2.4 BILLION RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES AND OTHER CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES.  ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF OPERATING CASH FLOW OF $0.7 BILLION RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND A DECREASE IN OTHER CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES USE OF $4.8 BILLION WAS PRIMARILY FOR ACQUISITIONS, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED OF $4.5 BILLION AND ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $3.2 BILLION. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE NET SALE OF INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.8 BILLION AND $1.3 BILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS/BUSINESSES.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES USE OF $8.6 BILLION WAS PRIMARILY FOR DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS OF $8.6 BILLION AND $9.0 BILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK. FINANCING ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDED A SOURCE OF $7.9 BILLION FROM NET PROCEEDS OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT AND $1.2 BILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED/EMPLOYEE WITHHOLDING TAX ON STOCK AWARDS, NET.

IN 2016, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS INC. FOR APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION AND ON JANUARY 26, 2017, SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A DEFINITIVE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE ACTELION LTD. FOR APPROXIMATELY $30.0 BILLION. ABBOTT MEDICAL OPTICS CLOSED ON FEBRUARY 27, 2017. THE COMPANY WILL USE CASH HELD BY THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY FOR THESE ACQUISITIONS.

24

ON OCTOBER 13, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AUTHORIZING THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE UP TO $10.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017, $7.3 BILLION HAS BEEN REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO TIME LIMIT AND MAY BE DELAYED OR SUSPENDED FOR PERIODS OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. ANY SHARES ACQUIRED WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO FINANCE THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THROUGH AVAILABLE CASH AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE PREVIOUS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED ON JULY 21, 2014, AUTHORIZING THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE UP TO $5.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, WAS COMPLETED ON APRIL 28, 2015.

IN 2016, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO HAVE ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET.  THE COMPANY HAD A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION THAT EXPIRED ON FEBRUARY 26, 2017.  THE COMPANY PLANS TO FILE A NEW SHELF REGISTRATION ON FEBRUARY 27, 2017 WHICH WILL ENABLE IT TO ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES ON A TIMELY BASIS. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON BORROWINGS, SEE NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT OPERATING CASH FLOWS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO FUND OPERATING NEEDS IN 2017.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

GLOBAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES CONTINUES TO BE LIMITED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS GLOBALLY AND ADHERENCE TO INTERNAL CREDIT POLICIES AND CREDIT LIMITS. ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN ITALY, SPAIN, GREECE AND PORTUGAL (THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION) HAVE IMPACTED CERTAIN PAYMENT PATTERNS, WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LONGER THAN THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE U.S. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  THE TOTAL NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE IN THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017 AND $1.3 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 3, 2016. APPROXIMATELY $0.7 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017 AND APPROXIMATELY $0.8 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 3, 2016 OF THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER, VISION CARE AND DIABETES CARE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES CUSTOMERS WHICH ARE IN LINE WITH HISTORICAL COLLECTION PATTERNS.

THE REMAINING BALANCE OF NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CERTAIN GOVERNMENT OWNED OR SUPPORTED HEALTH CARE CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES LOCAL AFFILIATES. THE TOTAL NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE FOR THESE CUSTOMERS WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION AT JANUARY 1, 2017 AND $0.5 BILLION AT JANUARY 3, 2016.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE CUSTOMERS AND, IN SOME CASES, LATE PAYMENTS WITH INTEREST. FOR CUSTOMERS WHERE PAYMENT IS EXPECTED OVER PERIODS OF TIME LONGER THAN ONE YEAR, REVENUE AND TRADE RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME FOR COLLECTION. ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED FOR THESE CUSTOMERS, BUT HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL TO DATE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THESE CUSTOMERS ON PAYMENT PLANS, MONITOR THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS AS NECESSARY.

FINANCING AND MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY USES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCT COSTS.  GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE OFFSET BY THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS.  A 10% APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR FROM THE JANUARY 1, 2017 MARKET RATES WOULD INCREASE THE UNREALIZED VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S FORWARD CONTRACTS BY $23 MILLION.  CONVERSELY, A 10% DEPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR FROM THE JANUARY 1, 2017 MARKET RATES WOULD DECREASE THE UNREALIZED VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S FORWARD CONTRACTS BY $28 MILLION.  IN EITHER SCENARIO, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE FORWARD CONTRACT WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, AND THEREFORE, WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON FUTURE ANTICIPATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY HEDGES THE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND THE EFFECT ON CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, BY ENTERING INTO CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS.  A 1% CHANGE IN THE SPREAD BETWEEN U.S. AND FOREIGN INTEREST RATES ON THE COMPANY’S INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WOULD EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE THE UNREALIZED VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S SWAP CONTRACTS BY APPROXIMATELY $82 MILLION.  IN EITHER SCENARIO, AT MATURITY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE SWAP CONTRACT WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, AND THEREFORE, WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON FUTURE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. FURTHER, THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY OF ONLY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH PARTIES THAT HAVE AT LEAST AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING.  THE COUNTER-PARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE COUNTER-PARTY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE RISK OF LOSS IS REMOTE.

THE COMPANY INVESTS IN BOTH FIXED RATE AND FLOATING RATE INTEREST EARNING SECURITIES WHICH CARRY A DEGREE OF INTEREST RATE RISK. THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF FIXED RATE SECURITIES MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DUE TO A RISE IN INTEREST RATES, WHILE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES MAY PRODUCE LESS INCOME THAN PREDICTED IF INTEREST RATES FALL.  A 1% (100 BASIS POINTS) CHANGE IN SPREAD ON THE COMPANY’S INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE INVESTMENTS WOULD EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE THE UNREALIZED VALUE OF CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CURRENT MARKETABLE SECURITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $336 MILLION.

25

THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO SUBSTANTIAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AT NUMEROUS BANKS WORLDWIDE.  IN SEPTEMBER 2016, THE COMPANY SECURED A NEW 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY. TOTAL CREDIT AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY APPROXIMATES $10 BILLION, WHICH EXPIRES ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2017.  INTEREST CHARGED ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT LINE AGREEMENT IS BASED ON EITHER BIDS PROVIDED BY BANKS, THE PRIME RATE OR LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATES (LIBOR), PLUS APPLICABLE MARGINS. COMMITMENT FEES UNDER THE AGREEMENT ARE NOT MATERIAL.

TOTAL BORROWINGS AT THE END OF

2016

AND

2015

WERE $27.1 BILLION AND $19.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE IN BORROWINGS BETWEEN 2016 AND 2015 WAS A RESULT OF FINANCING FOR THE COMPANY'S SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN 2016, NET CASH (CASH AND CURRENT MARKETABLE SECURITIES, NET OF DEBT) WAS $14.8 BILLION COMPARED TO NET CASH OF $18.5 BILLION IN 2015.  TOTAL DEBT REPRESENTED 27.8% OF TOTAL CAPITAL (SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND TOTAL DEBT) IN 2016 AND 21.8% OF TOTAL CAPITAL IN 2015. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY PER SHARE AT THE END OF

2016

WAS $26.02 COMPARED TO $25.82 AT YEAR-END

2015

, AN INCREASE OF 0.8%.

A SUMMARY OF BORROWINGS CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OTHER INFORMATION

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (GAAP).  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THAT MANAGEMENT MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR REVENUES, EXPENSES, ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OTHER RELATED DISCLOSURES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY OR MAY

26

NOT DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE UNDERSTANDING OF CERTAIN KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE ESSENTIAL IN ACHIEVING MORE INSIGHT INTO THE COMPANY’S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THESE KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCOME TAXES, LEGAL AND SELF-INSURANCE CONTINGENCIES, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED AWARDS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES WHEN GOODS ARE SHIPPED OR DELIVERED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER. PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN REBATES, SALES INCENTIVES, TRADE PROMOTIONS, COUPONS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REDUCTIONS IN SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED.

PRODUCT DISCOUNTS GRANTED ARE BASED ON THE TERMS OF ARRANGEMENTS WITH DIRECT, INDIRECT AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PRICES CHARGED BY COMPETITORS.  REBATES, WHICH INCLUDE THE MEDICAID REBATE PROVISION, ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON CONTRACTUAL TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, PATIENT OUTCOMES, TREND ANALYSIS AND PROJECTED MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES MARKET CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTS OR GROUPS OF PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF WHOLESALER AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SELL-THROUGH AND MARKET RESEARCH DATA, AS WELL AS INTERNALLY GENERATED INFORMATION.

SALES RETURNS ARE ESTIMATED AND RECORDED BASED ON HISTORICAL SALES AND RETURNS INFORMATION.  PRODUCTS THAT EXHIBIT UNUSUAL SALES OR RETURN PATTERNS DUE TO DATING, COMPETITION OR OTHER MARKETING MATTERS ARE SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATED AND ANALYZED AS PART OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR SALES RETURN ACCRUALS.

SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES REPRESENT A RESERVE FOR PRODUCTS THAT MAY BE RETURNED DUE TO EXPIRATION, DESTRUCTION IN THE FIELD, OR IN SPECIFIC AREAS, PRODUCT RECALL.  THE RETURNS RESERVE IS BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURN TRENDS BY PRODUCT AND BY MARKET AS A PERCENT TO GROSS SALES.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY ISSUES CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS FOR RETURNED GOODS.  THE COMPANY’S SALES RETURNS RESERVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE U.S. GAAP GUIDANCE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WHEN RIGHT OF RETURN EXISTS.  SALES RETURNS RESERVES ARE RECORDED AT FULL SALES VALUE.  SALES RETURNS IN THE CONSUMER AND PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENTS ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY NOT RESALABLE.  SALES RETURNS FOR CERTAIN FRANCHISES IN THE MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT ARE TYPICALLY RESALABLE BUT ARE NOT MATERIAL.  THE COMPANY INFREQUENTLY EXCHANGES PRODUCTS FROM INVENTORY FOR RETURNED PRODUCTS.  THE SALES RETURNS RESERVE FOR THE TOTAL COMPANY HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY 1.0% OF ANNUAL NET TRADE SALES DURING THE FISCAL REPORTING YEARS

2016

,

2015

AND

2014.

PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS PRODUCT LISTING ALLOWANCES AND COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING ARRANGEMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN THE YEAR INCURRED. CONTINUING PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE COUPONS AND VOLUME-BASED SALES INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.  THE REDEMPTION COST OF CONSUMER COUPONS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL REDEMPTION EXPERIENCE BY PRODUCT AND VALUE.  VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATED SALES VOLUMES FOR THE INCENTIVE PERIOD AND ARE RECORDED AS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD. THE COMPANY ALSO EARNS SERVICE REVENUE FOR CO-PROMOTION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS.  FOR ALL YEARS PRESENTED, SERVICE REVENUES WERE 1% OR LESS OF THE TOTAL REVENUES AND ARE INCLUDED IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS.  THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS TO BE DEFERRED OR RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE REVENUE GENERATING ACTIVITIES.   AMOUNTS DUE FROM COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EACH ACTIVITY IS PERFORMED OR DELIVERED, BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE. UPFRONT FEES RECEIVED AS PART OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ON COLLABORATIONS.

REASONABLY LIKELY CHANGES TO ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE THE ACCRUALS FOR REBATES, RETURNS AND PROMOTIONS ARE NOT ANTICIPATED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DISCLOSES THE IMPACT OF CHANGES TO ASSUMPTIONS IN THE QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL FILING IN WHICH THERE IS A MATERIAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT.

INCOME TAXES.

INCOME TAXES ARE RECORDED BASED ON AMOUNTS REFUNDABLE OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING AND TAX REPORTING, RECORDED AS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX REGULATIONS AND RATES. FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES MAY AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS U.S. GAAP, WHICH PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

AT

JANUARY 1, 2017

AND

JANUARY 3, 2016

, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS OF UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY $66.2 BILLION AND $58.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AT

JANUARY 1, 2017

AND

JANUARY 3, 2016

, THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES HELD BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF $41.3 BILLION AND $38.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO REINVEST THESE EARNINGS IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. IF THE COMPANY DECIDED AT A LATER DATE TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO THE U.S., THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOR THE NET TAX EFFECTS ON THESE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT DETERMINE THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, AS SUCH DETERMINATION IS NOT PRACTICAL.

SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING INCOME TAXES.

LEGAL AND SELF INSURANCE CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AS THESE ARISE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT AS TO THE PROBABILITY OF LOSSES AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY HAS SELF INSURANCE THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY. IN ADDITION TO ACCRUALS IN THE SELF INSURANCE PROGRAM, CLAIMS THAT EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE ARE ACCRUED WHEN LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECORDS INSURANCE RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS FROM THIRD-PARTY INSURERS WHEN RECOVERY IS PROBABLE.  AS APPROPRIATE, RESERVES AGAINST THESE RECEIVABLES ARE RECORDED FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS THAT MAY NOT BE COLLECTED FROM THIRD-PARTY INSURERS.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE PROVISIONS OF U.S. GAAP WHEN RECORDING LITIGATION RELATED CONTINGENCIES.  A LIABILITY IS RECORDED WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  THE BEST ESTIMATE OF A LOSS WITHIN A RANGE IS ACCRUED; HOWEVER, IF NO ESTIMATE IN THE RANGE IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER, THE MINIMUM AMOUNT IS ACCRUED.

29

SEE NOTES 1 AND 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING PRODUCT LIABILITY AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

LONG-LIVED AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE COMPANY ASSESSES CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MAKES ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN EVALUATING THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  AS THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME, IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

THE COMPANY SPONSORS VARIOUS RETIREMENT AND PENSION PLANS, INCLUDING DEFINED BENEFIT, DEFINED CONTRIBUTION AND TERMINATION INDEMNITY PLANS, WHICH COVER MOST EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.  THESE PLANS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE DISCOUNT RATE, EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, MORTALITY RATES, EXPECTED SALARY INCREASES, HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES AND ATTRITION RATES.  SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THESE RATES AND THE EFFECT A RATE CHANGE TO THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND WOULD HAVE ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS TO EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR SERVICES. BASED ON THE TYPE OF EQUITY INSTRUMENT, THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING EITHER THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL AND MONTE CARLO VALUATION MODEL, AND IS EXPENSED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD. THE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE ARE THE EXPECTED LIFE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY, RISK-FREE RATE AND EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD.  FOR PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IS CALCULATED FOR EACH OF THE THREE COMPONENT GOALS AT THE DATE OF GRANT.  THE FAIR VALUES FOR THE SALES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GOALS OF EACH PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT WERE ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE SHARES AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD, DISCOUNTED FOR DIVIDENDS, WHICH ARE NOT PAID ON THE PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS DURING THE VESTING PERIOD.  THE FAIR VALUE FOR THE RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN GOAL OF EACH PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT WAS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE MONTE CARLO VALUATION MODEL.  SEE NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2017.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS

THE COMPANY IS AWARE THAT ITS PRODUCTS ARE USED IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE, FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, POLICYMAKERS, CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RISING COST OF HEALTH CARE.  IN RESPONSE TO THESE CONCERNS, THE COMPANY HAS A LONG-STANDING POLICY OF PRICING PRODUCTS RESPONSIBLY. FOR THE PERIOD 2006 - 2016, IN THE UNITED STATES, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF THE COMPANY’S NET PRICE INCREASES FOR HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS (PRESCRIPTION AND OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUGS, HOSPITAL AND PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS) WAS BELOW THE U.S. CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI).

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES WHERE THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THESE SITUATIONS AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS. INFLATION RATES CONTINUE TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ON THE WAY COMPANIES OPERATE.  THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED FOR OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA AS HIGHLY INFLATIONARY, AS THE PRIOR THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE INFLATION RATE SURPASSED 100%.  IN THE FACE OF INCREASING COSTS, THE COMPANY STRIVES TO MAINTAIN ITS PROFIT MARGINS THROUGH COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND PERIODIC PRICE INCREASES.

THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS AND OFFERINGS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES. THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015, THE NUMBER OF THE COMPANY’S TRANSACTIONS CONDUCTED AT THE OFFICIAL RATE DECLINED FROM PRIOR QUARTERS.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER LIKELY THAT ALL OUTSTANDING NET MONETARY ASSETS WOULD BE SETTLED AT THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT RATE OF 6.3 BOLIVARES FUERTES TO ONE U.S. DOLLAR. THEREFORE IN 2015, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $161 MILLION TO REVALUE ITS NET MONETARY ASSETS IN VENEZUELA AT ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT’S ALTERNATIVE EXCHANGE RATES (SIMADI) AND IMPAIR ITS NON-MONETARY ASSETS. AFTER THE REVALUATION, AS OF JANUARY 3, 2016, THE COMPANY’S VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARIES REPRESENTED LESS THAN 0.1% OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DO BUSINESS IN GREECE, THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017, THE COMPANY’S GREEK SUBSIDIARIES REPRESENTED 0.3% AND 0.4% OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY.

ON JUNE 23, 2016, THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.) HELD A REFERENDUM IN WHICH VOTERS APPROVED AN EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.U.), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “BREXIT.”  GIVEN THE LACK OF COMPARABLE PRECEDENT, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT FINANCIAL, TRADE, REGULATORY AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.K. FROM THE E.U. WILL HAVE.  BREXIT CREATES GLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, WHICH MAY CAUSE, AMONG OTHER CONSEQUENCES, VOLATILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES, ADDITIONAL COST CONTAINMENT BY THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AND CHANGES IN REGULATIONS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE AND OTHER RELATED EFFECTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017, THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY’S U.K. SUBSIDIARIES REPRESENTED LESS THAN 3% OF BOTH THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND FISCAL TWELVE MONTHS REVENUES.

30

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  A 1% CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AS COMPARED TO ALL FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAD SALES, INCOME OR EXPENSE IN 2016 WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $330 MILLION AND INCOME BY $105 MILLION.

GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES, CONSIDER VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO MAKE CHANGES TO TAX LAWS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE INCREASING OR DECREASING EXISTING STATUTORY TAX RATES. A CHANGE IN STATUTORY TAX RATE IN ANY COUNTRY WOULD RESULT IN THE REVALUATION OF THE COMPANY’S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THAT PARTICULAR JURISDICTION IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE NEW TAX LAW IS ENACTED.  THIS CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN AN EXPENSE OR BENEFIT RECORDED TO THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.  THE COMPANY CLOSELY MONITORS THESE PROPOSALS AS THEY ARISE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT OPERATES. CHANGES TO THE STATUTORY TAX RATE MAY OCCUR AT ANY TIME, AND ANY RELATED EXPENSE OR BENEFIT RECORDED MAY BE MATERIAL TO THE FISCAL QUARTER AND YEAR IN WHICH THE LAW CHANGE IS ENACTED.

THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING A PROPOSED CHANGE TO ITS CORPORATE TAX CODE, INCLUDING A PROPOSAL TO LOWER ITS STATUTORY TAX RATE. IF ENACTED, THE PROPOSED CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN REVALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WITH A CORRESPONDING CHARGE TO TAX EXPENSE THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD.  BASED ON THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES FOR EVERY 1% THAT THE STATUTORY TAX IS LOWERED THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL ONE-TIME TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $60-75 MILLION. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET DESCRIBED AS “INTERNATIONAL R&D CAPITALIZED FOR TAX” IN NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS IN BELGIUM.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO CHANGES IN ITS CORPORATE TAX CODE. THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO LOWERING THE STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE RULES ON HOW INTERNATIONAL INCOME EARNED BY THE COMPANY IS TAXED IN THE U.S.  THE IMPACT OF THESE PROPOSALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD AND ON FUTURE PERIODS.

AS THE BELGIAN OR U.S. GOVERNMENTS ARE STILL CONSIDERING THESE PROPOSALS, IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHEN OR IF THEY WILL BE ENACTED.

THE COMPANY FACES VARIOUS WORLDWIDE HEALTH CARE CHANGES THAT MAY CONTINUE TO RESULT IN PRICING PRESSURES THAT INCLUDE HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT AND GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION RELATING TO SALES, PROMOTIONS AND REIMBURSEMENT OF HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS.

CHANGES IN THE BEHAVIOR AND SPENDING PATTERNS OF PURCHASERS OF HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING DELAYING MEDICAL PROCEDURES, RATIONING PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF PHYSICIAN VISITS AND FOREGOING HEALTH CARE INSURANCE COVERAGE, AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO OPERATES IN AN ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. FIRMS HAVE FILED ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS OR BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT APPLICATIONS WITH THE FDA OR OTHERWISE CHALLENGED THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF THE COMPANY'S PATENTS, SEEKING TO MARKET GENERIC OR BIOSIMILAR FORMS OF MANY OF THE COMPANY’S KEY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PRIOR TO EXPIRATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS COVERING THOSE PRODUCTS. IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING THE PATENT CLAIMS CHALLENGED IN THE RESULTING LAWSUITS, GENERIC OR BIOSIMILAR VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCTS AT ISSUE WILL BE INTRODUCED TO THE MARKET, RESULTING IN THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIAL MARKET SHARE AND REVENUE LOSSES FOR THOSE PRODUCTS, AND WHICH MAY RESULT IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN ANY ASSOCIATED INTANGIBLE ASSET.  THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT ONE OR MORE COMPETITORS COULD LAUNCH A GENERIC OR BIOSIMILAR VERSION OF THE PRODUCT AT ISSUE FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN THOUGH ONE OR MORE VALID PATENTS ARE IN PLACE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE THE DISCUSSION ON “REMICADE

RELATED CASES” AND “LITIGATION AGAINST FILERS OF ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS” IN NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS REGARDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AND OTHER MATTERS; GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS; AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LEGAL MATTERS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY WILL BE INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED FOR CERTAIN LITIGATION MATTERS AND CONTINUES TO MONITOR EACH RELATED LEGAL ISSUE AND ADJUST ACCRUALS FOR NEW INFORMATION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 450-20-25.  FOR THESE AND OTHER LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS CURRENTLY DISCLOSED FOR WHICH A LOSS IS PROBABLE OR REASONABLY POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS BEYOND THE AMOUNTS ALREADY ACCRUED.  AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR LEGAL CONTINGENCIES OFTEN RESULT FROM A COMPLEX SERIES OF JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE ABILITY TO MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER DAMAGES SOUGHT IN THE PROCEEDINGS ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED OR INDETERMINATE; SCIENTIFIC AND LEGAL DISCOVERY HAS NOT COMMENCED OR IS NOT COMPLETE; PROCEEDINGS ARE IN EARLY STAGES; MATTERS PRESENT LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES; THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTS IN DISPUTE; OR THERE ARE NUMEROUS PARTIES INVOLVED.

IN THE COMPANY'S OPINION, BASED ON ITS EXAMINATION OF THESE MATTERS, ITS EXPERIENCE TO DATE AND DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNSEL, THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, NET OF LIABILITIES ACCRUED IN THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION. HOWEVER, THE RESOLUTION OF, OR INCREASE IN ACCRUALS FOR, ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THAT PERIOD.

SEE NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED.

126,400

EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS IN THE HEALTH CARE FIELD.  THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD AND ITS PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON PRODUCTS RELATED TO HUMAN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING.

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED INTO

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

DURING THE FISCAL FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2016-09 COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION: IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. THE AMENDMENTS IN THE UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016 AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANY ENTITY IN ANY INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIOD. DURING THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO EARLY ADOPT THIS STANDARD. THE UPDATE REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

•

ALL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AND DEFICIENCIES TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION OR AN INCREASE TO THE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON INCOME. PREVIOUSLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED THESE BENEFITS DIRECTLY TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE TAX BENEFIT FOR THE COMPANY WAS

$353 MILLION

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2016. THE STANDARD DOES NOT PERMIT RETROACTIVE PRESENTATION OF THIS BENEFIT TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.

•

THE TAX BENEFIT OR DEFICIENCY IS REQUIRED TO BE CLASSIFIED AND PRESENTED AS A CASH FLOW TO/FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. IT WAS PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED AS A CASH FLOW TO/FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.  AS PERMITTED IN THE STANDARD, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO ADOPT THIS RECLASSIFICATION ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS AND THEREFORE PRIOR FISCAL YEARS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS HAVE NOT BEEN RECAST FOR THIS PROVISION.

•

CLARIFIES THAT ALL CASH PAYMENTS MADE TO TAXING AUTHORITIES ON EMPLOYEES’ SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A CASH OUTFLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THIS RECLASSIFICATION IS REQUIRED TO BE RECAST RETROSPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2016,

$269 MILLION

WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CASH OUTFLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND

$290 MILLION

AND

$239 MILLION

, OF CASH OUTFLOW WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM AN OPERATING ACTIVITY TO A FINANCING ACTIVITY (PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS/EMPLOYEE WITHHOLDING TAX ON STOCK AWARDS, NET) IN THE FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

•

IN THE DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION, WHEN APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD FOR SHARES THAT COULD BE REPURCHASED, THE ASSUMED PROCEEDS NO LONGER INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS TAX BENEFIT. THIS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION.

DURING THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER OF 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2015-03: SIMPLIFYING THE PRESENTATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. THIS UPDATE REQUIRES CAPITALIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS TO BE PRESENTED AS A REDUCTION TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF DEBT INSTEAD OF BEING CLASSIFIED AS A DEFERRED CHARGE. THIS UPDATE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY FOR ALL ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015 AND IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THIS UPDATE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL POSITION.

40

DURING THE FISCAL THIRD QUARTER OF 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2015-16 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING FOR MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE REQUIRE THAT AN ACQUIRER RECOGNIZE ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD IN THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE ADJUSTMENT AMOUNTS ARE DETERMINED. THIS UPDATE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY FOR ALL ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS UPDATE WITH EARLIER APPLICATION PERMITTED FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED. THIS UPDATE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING THE FISCAL THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2014-15: DISCLOSURE OF UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT AN ENTITY’S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE, FOR EACH ANNUAL AND INTERIM REPORTING PERIOD, WHETHER THERE ARE CONDITIONS AND EVENTS, CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE, THAT RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT AN ENTITY’S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED OR ARE AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED. IF SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT IS RAISED, ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES AROUND MANAGEMENT’S PLAN TO ALLEVIATE THESE DOUBTS ARE REQUIRED. THIS UPDATE BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ANNUAL PERIODS AND INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016.  THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CURRENT DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

NOT ADOPTED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017

THIS UPDATE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE FUTURE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS IT WILL DEPEND ON THE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE.

DURING THE FISCAL FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2016-07 INVESTMENTS - EQUITY METHOD AND JOINT VENTURES (TOPIC 323): SIMPLIFYING THE TRANSITION TO THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.  THE AMENDMENTS IN THE UPDATE ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT WHEN AN INVESTMENT QUALIFIES FOR THE USE OF THE EQUITY METHOD AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF OWNERSHIP INTEREST OR DEGREE OF INFLUENCE, AN INVESTOR MUST ADJUST THE INVESTMENT, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND RETAINED EARNINGS RETROACTIVELY ON A STEP BY STEP BASIS AS IF THE EQUITY METHOD HAD BEEN IN EFFECT DURING ALL PREVIOUS PERIODS THAT THE INVESTMENT HAD BEEN HELD.  THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016. THE AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY UPON THEIR EFFECTIVE DATE TO INCREASES IN THE LEVEL OF OWNERSHIP INTEREST OR DEGREE OF INFLUENCE THAT RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE EQUITY METHOD. EARLIER ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANY ENTITY IN ANY INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIOD. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING THE FISCAL THIRD QUARTER OF 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2016-15 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (TOPIC 230): CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS.

THIS UPDATE REMOVES THE CURRENT EXCEPTION IN US GAAP PROHIBITING ENTITIES FROM RECOGNIZING CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSES OR BENEFITS RELATED TO TRANSFER OF ASSETS, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY. THE CURRENT EXCEPTION TO DEFER THE RECOGNITION OF ANY TAX IMPACT ON THE TRANSFER OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY UNTIL IT IS SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY REMAINS UNAFFECTED. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED AND SHOULD BE IN THE FIRST INTERIM PERIOD IF AN ENTITY ISSUES INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE FUTURE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER OF 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2015-11: SIMPLIFYING THE MEASUREMENT OF INVENTORY. THIS UPDATE REQUIRES INVENTORY TO BE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  NET REALIZABLE VALUE IS THE ESTIMATED SELLING PRICES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, LESS REASONABLY PREDICTABLE COSTS OF COMPLETION, DISPOSAL AND TRANSPORTATION.  THIS UPDATE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY FOR ALL ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016.  THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY WITH EARLIER APPLICATION PERMITTED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF AN INTERIM OR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD. THIS UPDATE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL POSITION.

DURING THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2014-09: REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHICH, ALONG WITH AMENDMENTS ISSUED IN 2015 AND 2016, WILL REPLACE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CURRENT U.S. GAAP GUIDANCE ON THIS TOPIC AND ELIMINATE INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE.  EARLY ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS PERMITTED BUT NOT BEFORE THE ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE FOR ALL ANNUAL PERIODS AND INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017.  THE GUIDANCE PERMITS TWO METHODS OF ADOPTION: FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD (RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO EACH PRIOR REPORTING PERIOD PRESENTED) OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD (RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING THE GUIDANCE RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION AND PROVIDING CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES). WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE STANDARD, PRELIMINARILY, IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE STANDARD TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ASSESS ALL IMPLICATIONS OF THE STANDARD, METHOD OF ADOPTION AND RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR MODIFICATIONS, CLARIFICATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BY THE FASB THAT MAY AFFECT CURRENT CONCLUSIONS.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM DATE OF PURCHASE AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE AS CURRENT MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY OF MAKING INVESTMENTS ONLY WITH COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE AT LEAST AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING.  THE COMPANY INVESTS ITS CASH PRIMARILY IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (RRAS).

RRAS ARE COLLATERALIZED BY DEPOSITS IN THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND OBLIGATIONS FOR AN AMOUNT NOT LESS THAN

102%

OF THEIR VALUE.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECORD AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS THE COMPANY IS NOT PERMITTED TO SELL OR REPLEDGE THE ASSOCIATED COLLATERAL.  THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY THAT THE COLLATERAL HAS AT LEAST AN A (OR EQUIVALENT) CREDIT RATING.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES A THIRD PARTY CUSTODIAN TO MANAGE THE EXCHANGE OF FUNDS AND ENSURE THAT COLLATERAL RECEIVED IS MAINTAINED AT

102%

OF THE VALUE OF THE RRAS ON A DAILY BASIS.  RRAS WITH STATED MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS HELD TO MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST AND REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN EARNINGS. INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE CARRIED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

42

RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS OTHERWISE, THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS LONG TERM. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENT IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND RE-EVALUATES SUCH DETERMINATION AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE.  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT AND ADJUSTS THESE INVESTMENTS TO THEIR FAIR VALUE WHEN A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY.  IF LOSSES ON THESE SECURITIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS.

BUILDING AND BUILDING EQUIPMENT

20 - 30 YEARS

LAND AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

10 - 20 YEARS

MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT

2 - 13 YEARS

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES CERTAIN COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, INCLUDED IN MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, WHEN INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH DEVELOPING OR OBTAINING COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE.  CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE SOFTWARE, WHICH GENERALLY RANGE FROM

3

TO

8

YEARS.

THE COMPANY REVIEWS LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO ASSESS RECOVERABILITY USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.  WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN OPERATING OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OCCUR, AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT MAY BE PERFORMED ON THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS.  IF THE ASSET IS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE LOSS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET’S FAIR VALUE AND ITS CARRYING VALUE.  IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY WILL ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE USING A DISCOUNTED VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES WHEN THE GOODS ARE SHIPPED OR DELIVERED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.  PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN REBATES, SALES INCENTIVES, TRADE PROMOTIONS, COUPONS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REDUCTIONS IN SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED.

PRODUCT DISCOUNTS GRANTED ARE BASED ON THE TERMS OF ARRANGEMENTS WITH DIRECT, INDIRECT AND OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PRICES CHARGED BY COMPETITORS.  REBATES, WHICH INCLUDE MEDICAID, ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON CONTRACTUAL TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, PATIENT OUTCOMES, TREND ANALYSIS AND PROJECTED MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES MARKET CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTS OR GROUPS OF PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF WHOLESALER AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SELL-THROUGH AND MARKET RESEARCH DATA, AS WELL AS INTERNALLY GENERATED INFORMATION.

SALES RETURNS ARE GENERALLY ESTIMATED AND RECORDED BASED ON HISTORICAL SALES AND RETURNS INFORMATION.  PRODUCTS THAT EXHIBIT UNUSUAL SALES OR RETURN PATTERNS DUE TO DATING, COMPETITION OR OTHER MARKETING MATTERS ARE SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATED AND ANALYZED AS PART OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR SALES RETURNS ACCRUALS.

SALES RETURNS ALLOWANCES REPRESENT A RESERVE FOR PRODUCTS THAT MAY BE RETURNED DUE TO EXPIRATION, DESTRUCTION IN THE FIELD, OR IN SPECIFIC AREAS, PRODUCT RECALL.  THE RETURNS RESERVE IS BASED ON HISTORICAL RETURN TRENDS BY PRODUCT AND BY MARKET AS A PERCENT TO GROSS SALES.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES, THE COMPANY GENERALLY ISSUES CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS FOR RETURNED GOODS.  THE COMPANY’S SALES RETURNS RESERVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP GUIDANCE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WHEN RIGHT OF RETURN EXISTS.  SALES RETURNS RESERVES ARE RECORDED AT FULL SALES VALUE.  SALES RETURNS IN THE CONSUMER AND PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENTS ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY NOT RESALABLE.  SALES RETURNS FOR CERTAIN FRANCHISES IN THE MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT ARE TYPICALLY RESALABLE BUT ARE NOT MATERIAL. THE COMPANY INFREQUENTLY EXCHANGES PRODUCTS FROM INVENTORY FOR RETURNED PRODUCTS.  THE SALES RETURNS RESERVE FOR THE TOTAL COMPANY HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY

1.0%

OF ANNUAL SALES TO CUSTOMERS DURING THE FISCAL REPORTING YEARS

2016

,

2015

AND

2014.

PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS PRODUCT LISTING ALLOWANCES AND COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING ARRANGEMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN THE YEAR INCURRED.  CONTINUING PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE COUPONS AND VOLUME-BASED SALES INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.  THE REDEMPTION COST OF CONSUMER COUPONS IS BASED ON HISTORICAL REDEMPTION EXPERIENCE BY PRODUCT AND VALUE.  VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED SALES VOLUMES FOR THE INCENTIVE PERIOD AND ARE RECORDED AS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD.  THE COMPANY ALSO EARNS SERVICE REVENUE FOR CO-PROMOTION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND INCLUDES IT IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS.  THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS TO BE DEFERRED OR RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS INCURRED WERE

$974 MILLION

,

$996 MILLION

AND

$1,068 MILLION

IN

2016

,

2015

AND

2014

, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECEIVED FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING IS LESS THAN

0.5%

OF SALES TO CUSTOMERS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD.

43

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

THE AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE ON U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES BE ASSESSED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR 2016 IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER. FUTURE IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED ANNUALLY IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER, OR SOONER IF WARRANTED. PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET UNTIL THE UNDERLYING PROJECT IS COMPLETED, AT WHICH POINT THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET, OR ABANDONED, AT WHICH POINT THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE WRITTEN OFF OR PARTIALLY IMPAIRED.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE FINITE USEFUL LIVES CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES, AND ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN WARRANTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  SEE NOTE 5 FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP, ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.  FAIR VALUE IS THE EXIT PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY.  FAIR VALUE IS A MARKET-BASED MEASUREMENT DETERMINED USING ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING AN ASSET OR LIABILITY.  THE AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY TO PRIORITIZE THE INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE, WITH LEVEL 1 HAVING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND LEVEL 3 HAVING THE LOWEST. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGE TRANSACTION, AND IF SO, THE TYPE OF HEDGE TRANSACTION.

THE COMPANY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGED ITEMS AND DERIVATIVES.  THE OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDES REASONS FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVES.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STRATEGY ARE: (1) MINIMIZE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE’S IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; (2) PROTECT THE COMPANY’S CASH FLOW FROM ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES; (3) ENSURE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; AND (4) MANAGE THE ENTERPRISE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  SEE NOTE 6 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

PRODUCT LIABILITY

ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS ARE RECORDED, ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED BASED ON EXISTING INFORMATION AND ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED ESTIMATES WHERE APPLICABLE.  THE ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY ACCRUES AN ESTIMATE OF THE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS NEEDED TO DEFEND EACH MATTER WHEN THOSE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

AS A RESULT OF COST AND AVAILABILITY FACTORS, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2005, THE COMPANY CEASED PURCHASING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE.  THE COMPANY HAS SELF INSURANCE THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY. IN ADDITION TO ACCRUALS IN THE SELF INSURANCE PROGRAM, CLAIMS THAT EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE ARE ACCRUED WHEN LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF PRIOR COVERAGE, RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A RECOVERY WILL BE REALIZED. AS APPROPRIATE, RESERVES AGAINST THESE RECEIVABLES ARE RECORDED FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS THAT MAY NOT BE COLLECTED FROM THIRD-PARTY INSURERS.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

GLOBAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES CONTINUES TO BE LIMITED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS GLOBALLY AND ADHERENCE TO INTERNAL CREDIT POLICIES AND CREDIT LIMITS. ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN ITALY, SPAIN, GREECE AND PORTUGAL (THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION) HAVE IMPACTED CERTAIN PAYMENT PATTERNS, WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN LONGER THAN THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE U.S. AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  THE TOTAL NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE IN THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION WAS APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION

AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2017

AND APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION

AS OF

JANUARY 3, 2016

.  APPROXIMATELY

$0.7 BILLION

AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2017

AND APPROXIMATELY

$0.8 BILLION

AS OF

JANUARY 3, 2016

OF THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER, VISION CARE AND DIABETES CARE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES CUSTOMERS WHICH ARE IN LINE WITH HISTORICAL COLLECTION PATTERNS.

THE REMAINING BALANCE OF NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN REGION HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CERTAIN GOVERNMENT OWNED OR SUPPORTED HEALTH CARE CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICES LOCAL AFFILIATES. THE TOTAL NET TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE FOR THESE CUSTOMERS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$0.4 BILLION

AT

JANUARY 1, 2017

AND

$0.5 BILLION

AT

JANUARY 3, 2016

.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THESE CUSTOMERS AND, IN SOME CASES, LATE PAYMENTS WITH INTEREST. FOR CUSTOMERS WHERE PAYMENT IS EXPECTED OVER PERIODS OF TIME LONGER THAN ONE YEAR, REVENUE AND TRADE RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD OF TIME FOR COLLECTION. ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED FOR THESE CUSTOMERS, BUT HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL TO DATE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THESE CUSTOMERS ON PAYMENT PLANS, MONITOR THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS AS NECESSARY.

44

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  UPFRONT AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS MADE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UP TO THE POINT OF REGULATORY APPROVAL.  PAYMENTS MADE TO THIRD PARTIES SUBSEQUENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE RELATED PRODUCT.  AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED FOR SUCH PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INTANGIBLES, NET OF ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS, TYPICALLY WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL OR BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE DRUG CANDIDATES OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  THESE ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY INVOLVE TWO (OR MORE) PARTIES WHO ARE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COLLABORATION AND ARE EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS DEPENDENT ON THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF THE ACTIVITIES.  THESE COLLABORATIONS USUALLY INVOLVE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES BY ONE OR MORE PARTIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SELLING AND DISTRIBUTION.  OFTEN, THESE COLLABORATIONS REQUIRE UPFRONT, MILESTONE AND ROYALTY OR PROFIT SHARE PAYMENTS, CONTINGENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN FUTURE EVENTS LINKED TO THE SUCCESS OF THE ASSET IN DEVELOPMENT.  AMOUNTS DUE FROM COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE BECAUSE THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT SERVICES IS NOT CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS.  IN GENERAL, THE INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION FOR THESE COLLABORATIONS IS AS FOLLOWS.

, RESPECTIVELY.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES ARE RECORDED BASED ON AMOUNTS REFUNDABLE OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN U.S. GAAP ACCOUNTING AND TAX REPORTING, RECORDED AS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX REGULATIONS AND RATES.  FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES MAY AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY HAS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS U.S. GAAP WHICH PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

AT

JANUARY 1, 2017

AND

JANUARY 3, 2016

, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNTS OF UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$66.2 BILLION

AND

$58.0 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.  AT

JANUARY 1, 2017

AND

JANUARY 3, 2016

, THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES HELD BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN THE AMOUNTS OF

$41.3 BILLION

AND

$38.2 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO REINVEST THESE EARNINGS IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. IF THE COMPANY DECIDED AT A LATER DATE TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS TO THE U.S., THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOR THE NET TAX EFFECTS ON THESE AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT DETERMINE THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, AS SUCH DETERMINATION IS NOT PRACTICAL.

SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING INCOME TAXES.

45

NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE REFLECTS THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD OCCUR IF SECURITIES WERE EXERCISED OR CONVERTED INTO COMMON STOCK USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED.  ESTIMATES ARE USED WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, REBATES, ALLOWANCES AND INCENTIVES, PRODUCT LIABILITIES, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, CONTINGENCIES AND INTANGIBLE ASSET AND LIABILITY VALUATIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY OR MAY NOT DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE PROVISIONS OF U.S. GAAP WHEN RECORDING LITIGATION RELATED CONTINGENCIES.  A LIABILITY IS RECORDED WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  THE BEST ESTIMATE OF A LOSS WITHIN A RANGE IS ACCRUED; HOWEVER, IF NO ESTIMATE IN THE RANGE IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER, THE MINIMUM AMOUNT IS ACCRUED.

ANNUAL CLOSING DATE

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE CONCEPT OF A FISCAL YEAR, WHICH ENDS ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO THE END OF THE MONTH OF DECEMBER.  NORMALLY EACH FISCAL YEAR CONSISTS OF

52 WEEKS, BUT EVERY FIVE OR SIX YEARS THE FISCAL YEAR CONSISTS OF 53 WEEKS

, AND THEREFORE INCLUDES ADDITIONAL SHIPPING DAYS, AS WAS THE CASE IN 2015, AND WILL BE THE CASE AGAIN IN 2020.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES OF FUTURE INTERCOMPANY PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY PURCHASES OF MATERIALS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY.  THE COMPANY USES CROSS CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISK PRIMARILY RELATED TO BORROWINGS.  THE COMPANY ALSO USES EQUITY COLLAR CONTRACTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS. ALL THREE TYPES OF DERIVATIVES ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS AN INSTRUMENT TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO FIXED RATE BORROWINGS.  THESE DERIVATIVES ARE TREATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.  THE COMPANY USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  THESE FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, THEREBY OFFSETTING THE CURRENT EARNINGS EFFECT OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES, OR THAT CONTAIN CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES OR REQUIREMENTS TO POST COLLATERAL (EXCLUDING EQUITY COLLAR CONTRACT) BY EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE COUNTER-PARTY. FOR EQUITY COLLAR CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY PLEDGED THE UNDERLYING HEDGED MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES TO THE COUNTER-PARTY AS COLLATERAL. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY MONITORS COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS CREDIT NON-PERFORMANCE RISK TO BE LOW, BECAUSE THE COMPANY PRIMARILY ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE AT LEAST AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING.  REFER TO THE TABLE ON SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE CONTAINED IN THIS FOOTNOTE FOR RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH THESE COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2017

, THE COMPANY HAD NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING FOR FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, CROSS CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND EQUITY COLLAR CONTRACTS OF

$36.0 BILLION

,

$2.3 BILLION

,

$1.8 BILLION

AND

$0.3 BILLION

RESPECTIVELY.

ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.  CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED EACH PERIOD IN CURRENT EARNINGS OR OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS DESIGNATED AS PART OF A HEDGE TRANSACTION, AND IF SO, THE TYPE OF HEDGE TRANSACTION.

THE DESIGNATION AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS MADE AT THE ENTRANCE DATE OF THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT.  AT INCEPTION, ALL DERIVATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE.  CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE THAT IS DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE AND IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ARE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND ARE THEN RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME ACCOUNT AS THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.  GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF HEDGED DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ARE RECORDED TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR THROUGH THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION ACCOUNT.  ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER EACH DERIVATIVE CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES OF HEDGED ITEMS.  IF AND WHEN A DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED.  HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS, IF ANY, IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET FOR FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, CROSS CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, NET INVESTMENT HEDGES AND EQUITY COLLAR CONTRACTS. FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS, IF ANY, IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS WITHIN INTEREST EXPENSE.  FOR THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD, HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS NOT MATERIAL.

DURING THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER OF 2016, THE COMPANY DESIGNATED ITS EURO DENOMINATED NOTES ISSUED IN MAY 2016 WITH DUE DATES RANGING FROM 2022 TO 2035 AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN OF ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE THE EURO AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES.

DURING 2016, THE CHANGE IN THE CARRYING VALUE DUE TO REMEASUREMENT OF THESE EURO NOTES RESULTED IN A

$375 MILLION

PRETAX GAIN REFLECTED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2017

, THE BALANCE OF DEFERRED NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS

$285 MILLION

AFTER-TAX.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND NOTE 13. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE AMOUNTS RELATED TO FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WILL BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS OVER THE

NEXT 12 MONTHS

AS A RESULT OF TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THAT PERIOD.  THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS HEDGING TRANSACTION EXPOSURE IS

18 MONTHS

, EXCLUDING INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS, NET INVESTMENT HEDGES AND EQUITY COLLAR CONTRACTS.  THE AMOUNT ULTIMATELY REALIZED IN EARNINGS MAY DIFFER AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES AT MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE.

FAIR VALUE IS THE EXIT PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY.  FAIR VALUE IS A MARKET-BASED MEASUREMENT DETERMINED USING ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING AN ASSET OR LIABILITY.  THE AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY TO PRIORITIZE THE INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  THE LEVELS WITHIN THE HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW WITH LEVEL 1 HAVING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND LEVEL 3 HAVING THE LOWEST.

THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT (I.E. FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS) IS THE AGGREGATION BY CURRENCY OF ALL FUTURE CASH FLOWS DISCOUNTED TO ITS PRESENT VALUE AT THE PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES AND SUBSEQUENTLY CONVERTED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AT THE CURRENT SPOT FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT FAIR VALUES OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OR MATURITY, OR THAT THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.  THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS EQUITY INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 AND DEBT SECURITIES WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES WHICH WOULD REQUIRE REVISED VALUATIONS UNDER THIS STANDARD THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE FOLLOWING THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS ARE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.

LEVEL 1 — QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2 — SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS.

LEVEL 3 — SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.

THE COMPANY’S SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF

THE COMPANY HAS SUBSIDIARIES OPERATING IN PUERTO RICO UNDER VARIOUS TAX INCENTIVES.

THE 2016 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED BY

3.2%

AS COMPARED TO 2015. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, THE COMPANY ADOPTED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR THE REPORTING OF ADDITIONAL TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WERE EXERCISED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR. THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW STANDARD REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF FISCAL 2016 BY

1.8%

VERSUS 2015.

THE REMAINDER OF THE CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE LOWER EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SETTLEMENT OF SEVERAL UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN 2016 VERSUS 2015.

THE DECREASE IN THE 2015 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, AS COMPARED TO 2014, WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASES IN TAXABLE INCOME IN LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS RELATIVE TO HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A TAX BENEFIT RESULTING FROM A RESTRUCTURING OF INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS AFFECTED BY THE ITEMS MENTIONED BELOW.

THE INCREASE IN THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, AS COMPARED TO 2013, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING: THE DIVESTITURE OF THE ORTHO-CLINICAL DIAGNOSTICS BUSINESS AT AN APPROXIMATE

44%

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, LITIGATION ACCRUALS AT LOW TAX RATES, THE MIX OF EARNINGS INTO HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY THE U.S., THE ACCRUAL OF AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF THE BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG FEE, WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE, AND ADDITIONAL U.S. TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A PLANNED INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS FROM CURRENT YEAR FOREIGN EARNINGS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  THESE INCREASES TO THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A TAX BENEFIT OF

$0.4 BILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONOR MEDSYSTEMS DIVESTITURE.

THE 2014 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS ALSO REDUCED AS THE COMPANY ADJUSTED ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF (I) THE FEDERAL APPEALS COURT’S DECISION IN OMJ PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.’S LITIGATION REGARDING CREDITS UNDER FORMER SECTION 936 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND (II) A SETTLEMENT OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2006 - 2009.  THE IMPACT OF THE SETTLEMENT IS REFLECTED IN THE U.S. TAX ON INTERNATIONAL INCOME AND THE ALL OTHER LINE ITEMS WITHIN THE ABOVE RECONCILIATION.

THE ITEMS NOTED ABOVE REFLECT THE KEY DRIVERS OF THE RATE RECONCILIATION.

THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF

AT

JANUARY 1, 2017

, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS AND FILES TAX RETURNS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES AND CURRENTLY HAS TAX AUDITS IN PROGRESS WITH A NUMBER OF TAX AUTHORITIES.  THE IRS HAS COMPLETED ITS AUDIT FOR THE TAX YEARS THROUGH 2009 AND IS CURRENTLY AUDITING THE TAX YEARS 2010-2012.  IN OTHER MAJOR JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS, THE YEARS REMAIN OPEN GENERALLY BACK TO THE YEAR 2004. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AUDITS MAY BE COMPLETED BY TAX AUTHORITIES IN SOME JURISDICTIONS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF ANY OTHER FUTURE TAX PAYMENTS RELATING TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ARE CLASSIFIED AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AFTER TAX INTEREST EXPENSE OF

PENSIONS AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS VARIOUS RETIREMENT AND PENSION PLANS, INCLUDING DEFINED BENEFIT, DEFINED CONTRIBUTION AND TERMINATION INDEMNITY PLANS, WHICH COVER MOST EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.  THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS, PRIMARILY HEALTH CARE, TO ALL ELIGIBLE U.S. RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS.

MANY INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS AND THE COST TO THE COMPANY IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2015 ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE EMPLOYEE’S COMPENSATION DURING THE LAST

THREE

TO

FIVE

YEARS BEFORE RETIREMENT AND THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF SERVICE. IN 2014, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN WAS AMENDED TO ADOPT A NEW BENEFIT FORMULA, EFFECTIVE FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2015. THE BENEFITS ARE CALCULATED USING A NEW FORMULA BASED ON EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION OVER TOTAL YEARS OF SERVICE.

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE PLANS UNDER WHICH FUNDS ARE DEPOSITED WITH TRUSTEES, ANNUITIES ARE PURCHASED UNDER GROUP CONTRACTS, OR RESERVES ARE PROVIDED.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT FUND RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS IN ADVANCE AND HAS THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THESE PLANS IN THE FUTURE.

IN 2016 AND 2015 THE COMPANY USED

UNRECOGNIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING FUTURE SERVICE FOR EACH PLAN.  FOR PLANS WITH NO ACTIVE EMPLOYEES, THEY ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY.  THE AMORTIZATION OF GAINS AND

PRIOR SERVICE COSTS/BENEFITS FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING FUTURE SERVICE OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AT THE TIME OF THE PLAN AMENDMENT.  PRIOR SERVICE COST/BENEFIT FOR THE OTHER U.S. BENEFIT PLANS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE TO FULL ELIGIBILITY AGE OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AT THE TIME OF THE PLAN AMENDMENT.

THE COMPANY’S DISCOUNT RATES ARE DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING CURRENT YIELD CURVES REPRESENTING HIGH QUALITY, LONG-TERM FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS.  THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE DURATION OF PLAN LIABILITIES. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2016, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHODOLOGY IN DETERMINING SERVICE AND INTEREST COST FROM THE SINGLE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE APPROACH TO DURATION SPECIFIC SPOT RATES ALONG THAT YIELD CURVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS, WHICH MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED IS A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATE.  PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE IN METHODOLOGY, THE COMPANY MEASURED SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS UTILIZING A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE USED TO MEASURE THE PLAN OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED FOR THIS CHANGE AS A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE AND, ACCORDINGLY, HAS ACCOUNTED FOR IT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.  THIS CHANGE DOES NOT IMPACT THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE 2016 FULL YEAR RESULTS.

THE EXPECTED RATES OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTIONS REPRESENT THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS GLOBALLY. THE ASSESSMENT IS DETERMINED USING PROJECTIONS FROM EXTERNAL FINANCIAL SOURCES, LONG-TERM HISTORICAL AVERAGES, ACTUAL RETURNS BY ASSET CLASS AND THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASS ALLOCATIONS BY MARKET.

EACH PENSION PLAN IS OVERSEEN BY A LOCAL COMMITTEE OR BOARD THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERALL ADMINISTRATION AND INVESTMENT OF THE PENSION PLANS.  IN DETERMINING INVESTMENT POLICIES, STRATEGIES AND GOALS, EACH COMMITTEE OR BOARD CONSIDERS FACTORS INCLUDING, LOCAL PENSION RULES AND REGULATIONS; LOCAL TAX REGULATIONS; AVAILABILITY OF INVESTMENT VEHICLES (SEPARATE ACCOUNTS, COMMINGLED ACCOUNTS, INSURANCE FUNDS, ETC.); FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS; RATIO OF ACTIVES TO RETIREES; DURATION OF LIABILITIES; AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS INCLUDING: DIVERSIFICATION, LIQUIDITY OF LOCAL MARKETS AND LIQUIDITY OF BASE CURRENCY.  A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY’S PENSION FUNDS ARE OPEN TO NEW ENTRANTS AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON-GOING PLANS.  PERMITTED INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY LIQUID AND/OR LISTED, WITH LITTLE RELIANCE ON ILLIQUID AND NON-TRADITIONAL INVESTMENTS SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS.

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS

THE PLAN HAS AN ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DOCUMENTED PROCESS FOR DETERMINING FAIR VALUES.  FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE.  IF LISTED PRICES OR QUOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON MODELS THAT PRIMARILY USE, AS INPUTS, MARKET-BASED OR INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED MARKET PARAMETERS, INCLUDING YIELD CURVES, INTEREST RATES, VOLATILITIES, EQUITY OR DEBT PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND CREDIT CURVES.

WHILE THE PLAN BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

VALUATION HIERARCHY

THE AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY TO PRIORITIZE THE INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  THE LEVELS WITHIN THE HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED IN THE TABLE BELOW WITH LEVEL 1 HAVING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND LEVEL 3 HAVING THE LOWEST.

A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT’S CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR THE INVESTMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

•

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

— CASH AND QUOTED SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE OR THE AMOUNT HELD ON DEPOSIT BY THE CUSTODIAN BANK.  OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE THROUGH INVESTMENT VEHICLES VALUED USING THE NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FUND.  THE NAV IS BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OWNED BY THE FUND, MINUS ITS LIABILITIES, AND THEN DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING.  THE NAV IS A QUOTED PRICE IN A MARKET THAT IS NOT ACTIVE AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

•

GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES

— A LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED ON THE MAJOR MARKET ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ARE TRADED.  WHERE QUOTED PRICES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, THE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.  IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC SECURITY, THEN FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING PRICING MODELS, QUOTED PRICES OF SECURITIES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.  WHEN QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR A SECURITY ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

•

DEBT INSTRUMENTS

— A LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED ON THE MAJOR MARKET ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ARE TRADED.  WHERE QUOTED PRICES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET, THE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1.  IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SPECIFIC SECURITY, THEN FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BY USING PRICING MODELS, QUOTED PRICES OF SECURITIES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.  LEVEL 3 DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE PRICED BASED ON UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.

•

EQUITY SECURITIES

— COMMON STOCKS ARE VALUED AT THE CLOSING PRICE REPORTED ON THE MAJOR MARKET ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES ARE TRADED.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMMON STOCK IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY.

•

COMMINGLED FUNDS

— THESE INVESTMENT VEHICLES ARE VALUED USING THE NAV PROVIDED BY THE FUND ADMINISTRATOR.  THE NAV IS BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OWNED BY THE FUND, MINUS ITS LIABILITIES, AND THEN DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING.  ASSETS IN THE LEVEL 2 CATEGORY HAVE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE.

61

•

INSURANCE CONTRACTS

— THE INSTRUMENTS ARE ISSUED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES.  THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON NEGOTIATED VALUE AND THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNT PORTFOLIOS AS WELL AS CONSIDERING THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF THE ISSUER.  THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS ARE GOVERNMENT, ASSET-BACKED AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.  IN GENERAL, INSURANCE CONTRACTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 AS THERE ARE NO QUOTED PRICES NOR OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR PRICING.

•

OTHER ASSETS

— OTHER ASSETS ARE REPRESENTED PRIMARILY BY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL LOANS AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES THAT ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS CORPORATE DEBT.  OTHER ASSETS THAT ARE EXCHANGE LISTED AND ACTIVELY TRADED ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1, WHILE INACTIVELY TRADED ASSETS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

.  ALL OPTIONS ARE GRANTED AT THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW PRICES OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ON THE DATE OF GRANT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD WAS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL THAT USES THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  FOR 2014 GRANTS, EXPECTED VOLATILITY REPRESENTS A BLENDED RATE OF 4-YEAR DAILY HISTORICAL AVERAGE VOLATILITY RATE, AND A 5-WEEK AVERAGE IMPLIED VOLATILITY RATE BASED ON AT-THE-MONEY TRADED JOHNSON & JOHNSON OPTIONS WITH A LIFE OF 2 YEARS. FOR 2016 AND 2015 GRANTS, EXPECTED VOLATILITY REPRESENTS A BLENDED RATE OF 10-YEAR WEEKLY HISTORICAL OVERALL VOLATILITY RATE, AND A 5-WEEK AVERAGE IMPLIED VOLATILITY RATE BASED ON AT-THE-MONEY TRADED JOHNSON & JOHNSON OPTIONS WITH A LIFE OF 2 YEARS. FOR ALL GRANTS, HISTORICAL DATA IS USED TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION. THE RISK-FREE RATE WAS BASED ON THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD CURVE IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF GRANT.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS REGARDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, COMMERCIAL AND OTHER MATTERS; GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS; AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THEIR BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LEGAL MATTERS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY WILL BE INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LITIGATION MATTERS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED FOR THESE MATTERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR EACH RELATED LEGAL ISSUE AND ADJUST ACCRUALS AS MIGHT BE WARRANTED BASED ON NEW INFORMATION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 450-20-25. FOR THESE AND OTHER LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW FOR WHICH A LOSS IS PROBABLE OR REASONABLY POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS BEYOND THE AMOUNTS ALREADY ACCRUED. AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR LEGAL CONTINGENCIES OFTEN RESULT FROM A COMPLEX SERIES

71

OF JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE ABILITY TO MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER DAMAGES SOUGHT IN THE PROCEEDINGS ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED OR INDETERMINATE; SCIENTIFIC AND LEGAL DISCOVERY HAS NOT COMMENCED OR IS NOT COMPLETE; PROCEEDINGS ARE IN EARLY STAGES; MATTERS PRESENT LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES; THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTS IN DISPUTE; OR THERE ARE NUMEROUS PARTIES INVOLVED.

IN THE COMPANY'S OPINION, BASED ON ITS EXAMINATION OF THESE MATTERS, ITS EXPERIENCE TO DATE AND DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNSEL, THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, NET OF LIABILITIES ACCRUED IN THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION. HOWEVER, THE RESOLUTION OF, OR INCREASE IN ACCRUALS FOR, ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THAT PERIOD.

PRODUCT LIABILITY

JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS INVOLVING MULTIPLE PRODUCTS. CLAIMANTS IN THESE CASES SEEK SUBSTANTIAL COMPENSATORY AND, WHERE AVAILABLE, PUNITIVE DAMAGES. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ASC 450-20 BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, WHICH IN SOME CASES MAY BE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES AN ESTIMATE OF THE LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS NEEDED TO DEFEND EACH MATTER WHEN THOSE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. FOR CERTAIN OF THESE MATTERS, THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS SUCH AS ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SETTLEMENTS, DAMAGES AND OTHER LOSSES. TO THE EXTENT ADVERSE VERDICTS HAVE BEEN RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECORD AN ACCRUAL UNTIL A LOSS IS DETERMINED TO BE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. PRODUCT LIABILITY ACCRUALS CAN REPRESENT PROJECTED PRODUCT LIABILITY FOR THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS AROUND THE WORLD, EACH IN DIFFERENT LITIGATION ENVIRONMENTS AND WITH DIFFERENT FACT PATTERNS. CHANGES TO THE ACCRUALS MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE CASES INCLUDE THE DEPUY ASRTM XL ACETABULAR SYSTEM AND DEPUY ASRTM HIP RESURFACING SYSTEM, THE PINNACLE

HIP RESURFACING SYSTEM USED IN HIP REPLACEMENT SURGERY. CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST DEPUY AND JOHNSON & JOHNSON. THE NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS IS EXPECTED TO FLUCTUATE AS CERTAIN LAWSUITS ARE SETTLED OR DISMISSED AND ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS ARE FILED.

1,800

ADDITIONAL PATIENTS. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE AGREEMENTS IS COVERED BY EXISTING ACCRUALS. THIS SETTLEMENT PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BRING TO A CLOSE SIGNIFICANT ASR HIP LITIGATION ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON ARE SUBJECT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO PATENT, TRADEMARK AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THEIR BUSINESSES.

ALTHOUGH THESE SUBSIDIARIES BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES AND ALLEGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ALL SIGNIFICANT PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS. A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS, RESULT IN LOSS OF SALES DUE TO LOSS OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY, REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF PAST DAMAGES AND FUTURE ROYALTIES, AND MAY RESULT IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR ANY ASSOCIATED INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE MATTERS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

RELATED CASES

U.S. PROCEEDINGS

IN SEPTEMBER 2013, JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC. (JBI) AND NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER (NYU) RECEIVED AN OFFICE ACTION FROM THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) REJECTING THE CLAIMS IN U.S. PATENT NO. 6,284,471 RELATING TO REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB) (THE '471 PATENT) IN A REEXAMINATION PROCEEDING INSTITUTED BY A THIRD PARTY.  THE '471 PATENT IS CO-OWNED BY JBI AND NYU, AND NYU GRANTED JBI AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO NYU’S RIGHTS UNDER THE PATENT. THE '471 PATENT EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2018. FOLLOWING SEVERAL OFFICE ACTIONS BY THE PATENT EXAMINER, INCLUDING TWO FURTHER REJECTIONS, AND RESPONSES BY JBI, THE USPTO ISSUED A FURTHER ACTION MAINTAINING ITS REJECTION OF THE '471 PATENT. JBI FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE USPTO'S PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD. IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING THE EXAMINER'S REJECTION. JBI HAS FILED AN APPEAL TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT.

IN AUGUST 2014, CELLTRION HEALTHCARE CO. LTD. AND CELLTRION INC. (TOGETHER, CELLTRION) FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOR APPROVAL TO MAKE AND SELL ITS OWN INFLIXIMAB BIOSIMILAR. IN MARCH 2015, JBI FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS AGAINST CELLTRION AND HOSPIRA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION (HOSPIRA), WHICH HAS EXCLUSIVE U.S. MARKETING RIGHTS FOR CELLTRION'S INFLIXIMAB BIOSIMILAR, SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT THEIR BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT INFRINGES OR POTENTIALLY INFRINGES SEVERAL JBI PATENTS, INCLUDING THE '471 PATENT AND U.S. PATENT NO. 7,598,083 (THE '083 PATENT). IN AUGUST 2016, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED BOTH CELLTRION'S AND HOSPIRA'S MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF INVALIDITY OF THE '471 PATENT. JBI HAS APPEALED THOSE DECISIONS TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. THIS CASE AND THE APPEAL OF THE REEXAMINATION OF THE '471 PATENT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED COMPANION CASES AND WILL BE HEARD BY THE SAME PANEL OF JUDGES IN THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT.

IN JUNE 2016, JBI FILED TWO ADDITIONAL PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS ASSERTING THE '083 PATENT, ONE AGAINST CELLTRION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS AND THE OTHER AGAINST HYCLONE LABORATORIES, INC., THE MANUFACTURER OF THE CELL CULTURE MEDIA THAT CELLTRION USES TO MAKE ITS BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT, IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH. ALTHOUGH THE '083 PATENT IS ALREADY ASSERTED IN THE EXISTING LAWSUIT AGAINST CELLTRION, THE ADDITIONAL LAWSUIT EXPANDS THE CLAIMS TO INCLUDE ANY USE OF THE CELL CULTURE MEDIA MADE IN THE UNITED STATES TO MANUFACTURE CELLTRION'S BIOSIMILAR. THIS ADDITIONAL LAWSUIT AGAINST CELLTRION HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE EXISTING LAWSUIT DISCUSSED ABOVE. HOSPIRA HAS MOVED TO DISMISS ALL COUNTS OF THE LAWSUIT RELATED TO THE '083 PATENT AS TO IT. CELLTRION HAS MOVED TO DISMISS ALL COUNTS OF THE LAWSUIT RELATED TO THE '083 PATENT WITHOUT PREJUDICE FOR FAILURE TO JOIN ALL THE CO-OWNERS OF THE ‘083 PATENT AS PLAINTIFFS.

AS A RESULT, INTERACTION WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IS ONGOING. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION BROUGHT BY, AND INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE LISTED BELOW. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CRIMINAL CHARGES AND SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND/OR CIVIL PENALTIES OR DAMAGES COULD RESULT FROM GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OR LITIGATION.

AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE (AWP) LITIGATION

JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND SEVERAL OF ITS PHARMACEUTICAL SUBSIDIARIES (THE J&J AWP DEFENDANTS), ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, ARE DEFENDANTS IN A SERIES OF LAWSUITS IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT THE PRICING AND MARKETING OF CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AMOUNTED TO FRAUDULENT AND OTHERWISE ACTIONABLE CONDUCT BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANIES ALLEGEDLY REPORTED AN INFLATED AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE (AWP) FOR THE DRUGS AT ISSUE. PAYORS ALLEGED THAT THEY USED THOSE AWPS IN CALCULATING PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. MANY OF THESE CASES, BOTH FEDERAL ACTIONS AND STATE ACTIONS REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT, WERE CONSOLIDATED FOR PRE-TRIAL PURPOSES IN A MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION (MDL) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE CASES INCLUDED THREE CLASSES OF PRIVATE PERSONS OR ENTITIES THAT PAID FOR ANY PORTION OF THE PURCHASE OF THE DRUGS AT ISSUE BASED ON AWP, AND STATE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT MADE MEDICAID PAYMENTS FOR THE DRUGS AT ISSUE BASED ON AWP.

IN UTAH, THE CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WERE DISMISSED BY THE COURT IN 2013, BUT THE STATE MAY APPEAL THE DISMISSAL AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF SIMILAR PENDING MATTERS AGAINST OTHER DEFENDANTS. IN THE AWP CASE AGAINST THE J&J AWP DEFENDANTS BROUGHT BY THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, FOLLOWING A TRIAL IN 2010, THE PENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH COURT FOUND IN FAVOR OF THE COMMONWEALTH WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN OF ITS CLAIMS UNDER THE PENNSYLVANIA UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW, AND IN FAVOR OF THE J&J AWP DEFENDANTS ON THE COMMONWEALTH’S REMAINING CLAIMS.  FOLLOWING AN APPEAL TO THE PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT THAT VACATED THAT JUDGMENT, THE COMMONWEALTH COURT ENTERED A SUBSEQUENT JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE J&J AWP DEFENDANTS ON ALL CLAIMS.  THAT SUBSEQUENT JUDGMENT HAS BEEN UPHELD BY THE PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT IN A SUCCESSIVE APPEAL.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS, OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, OF EQUITY, AND OF CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT JANUARY 1, 2017 AND JANUARY 3, 2016, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 1, 2017

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013) ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR AND PRESENTS CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF SHARE BASED PAYMENTS IN 2016.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND REPORT, BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT, WHETHER THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AS TO THE RELIABILITY OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF EXTERNAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED, HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS.  THEREFORE, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT ALL MISSTATEMENTS.  MOREOVER, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017.  IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY USED THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN “INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013).”  THESE CRITERIA ARE IN THE AREAS OF CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, RISK ASSESSMENT, CONTROL ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, AND MONITORING.  THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTING, EVALUATING AND TESTING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

BASED ON THE COMPANY’S PROCESSES AND ASSESSMENT, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017, THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH APPEARS HEREIN.
