THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE

 MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS.

HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF

DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY

AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

INCLUDE NOT ONLY THOSE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO

THOSE DEVELOPED BY SUBSIDIARIES ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN COMPARABLE U.S.

ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL CLIMATE IS

INFLUENCED BY RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND POLITICAL

UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW

MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO JOHNSON & JOHNSONS

OPERATING COMPANIES BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY READILY

AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.

PATENTS

AND TRADEMARKS

JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND ITS OPERATING COMPANIES HAVE MADE A

PRACTICE OF OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION ON THEIR PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES WHERE POSSIBLE. THEY OWN OR ARE LICENSED UNDER A

NUMBER OF PATENTS RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON IN THE OPERATION OF ITS

BUSINESSES. SALES OF THE COMPANYS TWO LARGEST PRODUCTS,

RISPERDAL

®

AND

REMICADE

®

,

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6% AND 5% OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS TOTAL REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR FISCAL 2007.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PATENTS RELATED TO THESE PRODUCTS ARE BELIEVED

TO BE MATERIAL TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON AS A WHOLE.

DURING 2004 THROUGH 2006,

DURAGESIC

®

/FENTANYL

TRANSDERMAL (FENTANYL TRANSDERMAL SYSTEM) LOST ITS BASIC PATENT

PROTECTION AND IS SUBJECT TO GENERIC COMPETITION IN THE UNITED

STATES AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE BASIC PATENTS

COVERING

EPREX

®

(EPOETIN ALFA) HAVE EXPIRED AND INCREASED BIOSIMILAR COMPETITION

IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IS EXPECTED.

DURAGESIC

®

/FENTANYL

TRANSDERMAL SALES DECLINED BY 10.1% TO $1.2 BILLION IN 2007

AS COMPARED TO 2006, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF GENERIC COMPETITION.

COMBINED SALES OF

DURAGESIC

®

/FENTANYL

TRANSDERMAL AND

EPREX

®

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 4% OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS WORLDWIDE SALES IN 2007. THE MATERIAL PATENTS

THAT EXPIRED IN 2007 OR WILL EXPIRE IN 2008 ARE RELATED TO

RISPERDAL

®

,

WHICH EXPIRED IN THE UNITED STATES IN DECEMBER 2007, AND

TOPAMAX

®

,

WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN THE UNITED STATES IN SEPTEMBER

2008. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED A PEDIATRIC EXTENSION FOR

®

ORAL FROM THE FDA, WHICH GRANTS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED

STATES THROUGH JUNE 2008. THE COMPANY IS ON TARGET TO FILE FOR A

PEDIATRIC EXTENSION FOR

TOPAMAX

®

,

WHICH, IF OBTAINED FROM THE FDA, WOULD GRANT MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL MARCH 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES HAVE MADE A

PRACTICE OF SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS AND OF

OBTAINING PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE

MEANS. THESE TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH PRODUCTS ARE

MARKETED. JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS IN

THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF

ITS BUSINESSES.

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF

SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF EACH YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS REFLECTS

INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR ADVERTISING AND

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, JOHNSON & JOHNSONS

OPERATING COMPANIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LARGE AND SMALL,

LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. COMPETITION IS STRONG IN ALL

PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE

COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, INVOLVING

THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS

AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF

NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT TO JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESSES. THIS ALSO

INCLUDES PROTECTING THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENTS IN CONTINUING RESEARCH AND MULTIPLE SALES FORCES. IN

ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE

OF THE PRODUCTS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS CONSUMER

BUSINESSES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND

PROMOTION.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF JOHNSON

& JOHNSONS SUBSIDIARIES BUSINESSES. MAJOR

RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE LOCATED NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES

BUT ALSO IN AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE,

GERMANY, INDIA, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE AND THE UNITED

KINGDOM. THE COSTS OF WORLDWIDE COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH

ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS,

IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING PRODUCTS, TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF PRODUCTS

AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION

OF CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS, EXCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT CHARGES, AMOUNTED TO $7,680 MILLION,

$7,125 MILLION AND $6,462 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS

2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED

DIRECTLY TO INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENT

JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO

A VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

MEASURES. JOHNSON & JOHNSON BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS

COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. JOHNSON & JOHNSONS COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND IS NOT

EXPECTED TO, HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

REGULATION

MOST OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN

WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD

INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

DRUG, DEVICE, DIAGNOSTICS AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES HAVE LONG BEEN

SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES,

PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, MANUFACTURING,

ADVERTISING, LABELING AND SAFETY REPORTING. THE EXERCISE OF

BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE FDA CONTINUES TO RESULT IN

INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED

FOR FDA CLEARANCE OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES AND A CORRESPONDING

INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS

ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE A

SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL

AGENCIES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE UNITED

STATES, ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG PRICES AND PROFITS

AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR

PARTICULAR DRUGS OR RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE PARTICULAR

MEDICAL DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT FORCE IN THE

MARKET

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO DRUG AND MEDICAL

DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE UTILIZATION

AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF HEALTH CARE. IN THE UNITED STATES,

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT

AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 AND THE DEFICIT REDUCTION ACT OF

2005 MAY CAUSE UNCERTAINTY IN REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS IN CERTAIN

PRODUCT SEGMENTS.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES OPERATE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE

POWERS THAT MAY SUBJECT THOSE COMPANIES TO SUCH ACTIONS AS

PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO

INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY HAVE

COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED

STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AND

RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE RISK OF

SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

AT THE END

OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE

AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, THE

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING.

UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND

REPORT, BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT, WHETHER THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AS TO THE RELIABILITY

OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED, HAS INHERENT LIMITATIONS. THEREFORE, INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE

ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PREPARATION AND MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT ALL MISSTATEMENTS.

MOREOVER, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 30, 2007. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, THE

COMPANY USED THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. THESE

CRITERIA ARE IN THE AREAS OF CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, RISK

ASSESSMENT, CONTROL ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION,

AND MONITORING. THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EXTENSIVE

DOCUMENTING, EVALUATING AND TESTING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

BASED ON THE COMPANYS PROCESSES AND ASSESSMENT, AS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2007, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2007 HAS BEEN

AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH APPEARS
