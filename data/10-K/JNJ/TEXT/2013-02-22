127,600employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. johnson& johnson is a holding company, which has more than 275 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. the companys primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. johnson& johnson was incorporated in the state of new jersey in 1887.the companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. the executive committee of johnson& johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the company. this committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices and diagnostics business segments. in line with the principle of decentralized management, senior management groups at u.s. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans, as well as the day-to-day operations of those companies, and each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.segments of businessthe company is organized into three business segments: consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices and diagnostics. additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under the caption managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and note18 segments of business and geographic areas under notes to consolidated financial statements of the annual report, filed as exhibit13 to this report on form10-k.consumerthe consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms. the baby care franchise includes the johnsons baby line of products. major brands in the skin care franchise include the aveeno; clean& clear; johnsons adult; neutrogena; roc; lubriderm; dabao; and vendme product lines. brands in the oral care franchise include the listerine and rembrandt   oral care lines, as well as reach   interdental products. the wound care franchise includes band-aid brand adhesive bandages and neosporin first aid products. major brands in the womens health franchise are  carefree pantiliners; o.b. tampons and stayfree sanitary protection products. the principal nutritional line is splenda no calorie sweetener.  over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of tylenol acetaminophen products; sudafed cold, flu and allergy products; zyrtec allergy products; motrin ib ibuprofen products; and pepcid ac  acid controller. these products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world.pharmaceuticalthe pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, contraceptive,  gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, infectious diseases, neurology, oncology, pain management, thrombosis and vaccines. these products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use. key products in the pharmaceutical segment include: remicade (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; stelara (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; simponi (golimumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, and active ankylosing spondylitis; velcade (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; zytiga  (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; prezista

include products to treat cardiovascular disease; orthopaedic and neurological products; blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; general surgery, biosurgical, and energy products; professional diagnostic products; infection prevention products; and disposable contact lenses. these products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers both directly and through surgical supply and other distributors.geographic areasthe business of johnson& johnson is conducted by more than 275 operating companies located in 60countries, including the united states, which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. the products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under segments of business consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices and diagnostics. however, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. the products sold in international business include not only those developed in the united states, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad.investments and activities in some countries outside the united states are subject to higher risks than comparable u.s.activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties.raw materialsraw materials essential to the company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources.  where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company. patents and trademarksthe company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. they own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses. sales of the companys largest product, remicade (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.1% of the company's total revenues for fiscal 2012. accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company.in june of 2011, levaquin lost market exclusivity and became subject to generic competition in the united states.  sales of levaquin, in the united states, declined approximately 94% in 2012 as compared to 2011.the companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. these trademarks are protected by registration in the united states and other countries where such products are marketed. the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.seasonalityworldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. this reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.competitionin all of their product lines, the company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. the development of new and innovative products is important to the companys success in all areas of its business. this also includes protecting the companys portfolio of intellectual property. the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. in addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.2table of contentsresearch and developmentresearch activities represent a significant part of the companys businesses. research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $7.7 billion, $7.5 billion and $6.8billion for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  major research facilities are located not only in the united states, but also in belgium, brazil, canada, china, france, germany, india, israel, japan, the netherlands, singapore, switzerland and the united kingdom. environmentthe company is subject to a variety of u.s.and international environmental protection measures. the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. the companys compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.regulationmost of the companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. in the united states, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the u.s. food and drug administration (the "fda") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the united states.the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. in the united states, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care.following the u.s. supreme court decision in june 2012 upholding the patient protection and affordable care act (the "aca"), there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those u.s. government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the aca. these have both positive and negative impacts on the u.s. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca will ultimately affect the industry.the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. in some cases, the companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.in addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the united states, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.available informationthe companys main corporate website address is www.jnj.com. copies of the companys quarterly reports on form10-q, annual report on form10-k and current reports on
