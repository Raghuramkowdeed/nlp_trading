GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSON IS CONDUCTED BY SUBSIDIARIES LOCATED IN 56 COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ARE SELLING PRODUCTS IN

VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRODUCTS MADE

AND SOLD IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE

DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER BUSINESS  CONSUMER,

 PHARMACEUTICAL AND

 MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS.

HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF

DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY

AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

INCLUDE NOT ONLY THOSE WHICH WERE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED

STATES, BUT ALSO THOSE WHICH WERE DEVELOPED BY SUBSIDIARIES

ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN

COMPARABLE U.S. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL

CLIMATE IS INFLUENCED BY RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES BUSINESSES ARE

GENERALLY READILY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS MADE A PRACTICE OF

OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION ON ITS PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES WHERE

POSSIBLE. JOHNSON & JOHNSON OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A

NUMBER OF PATENTS RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESS. SALES OF THE

COMPANYS TWO LARGEST PRODUCTS,

RISPERDAL

®

AND

PROCRIT

®

/EPREX

®

,

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6% AND 7% OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS TOTAL REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR FISCAL 2005.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PATENTS RELATED TO THESE PRODUCTS ARE BELIEVED

TO BE MATERIAL IN RELATION TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON AS A WHOLE.

DURING 2004, 2005 AND 2006,

DURAGESIC

®

(FENTANYL TRANSDERMAL SYSTEM) IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND

EPREX

®

(EPOETIN ALFA) IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE LOST OR WILL LOSE

THEIR BASIC PATENT PROTECTION AND ARE OR WILL BE SUBJECT TO

GENERIC COMPETITION.

DURAGESIC

®

SALES DECLINED BY 23.9% TO $1.6 BILLION IN 2005 AS COMPARED

TO 2004, DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF GENERIC COMPETITION

PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES. REGARDING

EPREX

®

,

GENERIC COMPETITION WILL BE LIMITED IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO THE

LACK OF APPROVED GENERIC COMPOUNDS. COMBINED SALES OF

DURAGESIC

®

AND

EPREX

®

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5% OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS WORLDWIDE SALES IN 2005. THE ONLY MATERIAL PATENT

SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS IS RELATED TO

RISPERDAL

®

,

WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN THE UNITED STATES IN DECEMBER

2007, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A PEDIATRIC EXTENSION.

2

JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS MADE A PRACTICE OF

SELLING ITS PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS AND OF OBTAINING

PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE MEANS. JOHNSON

& JOHNSONS TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE ITS PRODUCTS ARE

MARKETED. JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS IN

THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF

ITS BUSINESS.

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT

DEGREE OF SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS

REFLECTS INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR

ADVERTISING AND RESEARCH GRANTS.

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, JOHNSON &

JOHNSON COMPANIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LARGE AND SMALL,

LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. COMPETITION IS STRONG IN ALL

PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE

COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, INVOLVING

THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS

AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF

NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT TO JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THIS

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN

CONTINUING RESEARCH AND MULTIPLE SALES FORCES. IN ADDITION, THE

DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE

PRODUCTS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS CONSUMER BUSINESSES

INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

RESEARCH

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE IMPORTANT TO ALL SEGMENTS

OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS BUSINESS. MAJOR RESEARCH

FACILITIES ARE LOCATED NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO IN

AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY,

JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE COSTS OF

WORLDWIDE COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING PRODUCTS,

TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF PRODUCTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENTAL

REGULATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS,

EXCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGES, AMOUNTED

TO $6,312 MILLION, $5,203 MILLION AND

$4,684 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2005, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED DIRECTLY TO INCOME IN THE

YEAR IN WHICH INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENT

DURING THE PAST YEAR JOHNSON & JOHNSON

COMPANIES WERE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. JOHNSON & JOHNSON

BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS

WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. JOHNSON

& JOHNSONS COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT

AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

REGULATION

MOST OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS BUSINESS IS

SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL

TREND IS TOWARD REGULATION OF INCREASING STRINGENCY. IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE DRUG, DEVICE, DIAGNOSTICS AND COSMETIC

INDUSTRIES HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS

FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY,

EFFICACY, MANUFACTURING, ADVERTISING AND LABELING. THE EXERCISE

OF BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE FDA CONTINUES TO RESULT IN

INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED

FOR FDA CLEARANCE OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES AND A CORRESPONDING

INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS

ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND

CONTINUE TO BE A SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION

BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE

WORLD. IN THE UNITED STATES, ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG

PRICES AND PROFITS AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE

PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PARTICULAR DRUGS OR RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE

PARTICULAR MEDICAL DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT

3

FORCE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION

IS BEING PAID TO DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE

DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE UTILIZATION AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF

HEALTH CARE. THERE IS ALSO UNCERTAINTY IN THE UNITED STATES AS

TO THE IMPACT OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT, WHICH WAS ENACTED IN 2003.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW

JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMPANIES OPERATE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE

POWERS THAT MAY SUBJECT THOSE COMPANIES TO SUCH ACTIONS AS

PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO

INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH

CARE INDUSTRY HAVE COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY

IN THE UNITED STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL, AND RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE

RISK OF SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
