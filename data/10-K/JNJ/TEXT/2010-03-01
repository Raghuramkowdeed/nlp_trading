1.business
general
johnson& johnson and its subsidiaries have
approximately 115,500employees worldwide engaged in the
research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range
of products in the health care field. johnson&
johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating
companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the
world. johnson& johnsons primary focus has been
on products related to human health and well-being.
johnson& johnson was incorporated in the state of new
jersey in 1887.
the companys structure is based on the principle of
decentralized management. the executive committee of
johnson& johnson is the principal management group
responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources
of the company. this committee oversees and coordinates the
activities of the consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices
and diagnostics business segments. each subsidiary within the
business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens
of the country where it is located.

pharmaceutical
the pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following
therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic,
cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal,
hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
urology and virology. these products are distributed directly to
retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for

table of contents

health care professional markets is done both directly and

geographic
areas
the international business of johnson & johnson is
conducted by subsidiaries located in 59 countries outside the
united states, which are selling products in virtually all
countries throughout the world. the products made and sold in
the international business include many of those described above
under  segments of business
consumer, pharmaceutical and
medical devices and diagnostics.
however, the principal markets, products and methods of
distribution in the international business vary with the country
and the culture. the products sold in international business
include not only those developed in the united states, but also
those developed by subsidiaries abroad.
investments and activities in some countries outside the united
states are subject to higher risks than comparable u.s.
activities because the investment and commercial climate is
influenced by restrictive economic policies and political
uncertainties.
raw
materials
raw materials essential to johnson & johnsons
operating companies businesses are generally readily
available from multiple sources.
patents
and trademarks
johnson & johnson and its subsidiaries have made a practice
of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes
where possible. they own or are licensed under a number of
patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance
to johnson & johnson in the operation of its businesses.
sales of the companys largest product,
remicade
(infliximab), accounted for approximately 7% of johnson &
johnsons total revenues for fiscal 2009. accordingly, the
patents related to this product are believed to be material to
johnson& johnson.
during 2007 through 2009,
risperdal
(risperidone) oral and
topamax
(topiramate) lost basic patent protection and market exclusivity
and became subject to generic competition in the united states
and international markets.
risperdal
oral sales declined by 57.7% and 37.8% in 2009 and 2008,
respectively.
topamax
lost market exclusivity in march 2009 and sales declined by
57.9% as compared to 2008. the next significant patent scheduled
to expire on december20, 2010 is for
levaquin
(levofloxacin), which accounted for 2.5% of the companys
2009 sales. a pediatric extension for
levaquin
was granted by the u.s. food and drug administration
(fda), which extends market exclusivity in the
united states through june20, 2011.
johnson & johnsons operating companies have made a
practice of selling their products under trademarks and of
obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. these trademarks are protected by registration in the
united states and other countries where such products are
marketed. johnson & johnson considers these trademarks in
the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of
its businesses.
seasonality
worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of
seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth
quarter of each year than in other quarters. this reflects
increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and
research and development activity.
table of contents
competition
in all of their product lines, johnson & johnsons
operating companies compete with companies both large and small,
and both local and global, located throughout the world.
competition exists in all product lines without regard to the
number and size of the competing companies involved. competition
in research, involving the development and the improvement of
new and existing products and processes, is particularly
significant. the development of new and innovative products is
important to johnson & johnsons success in all areas
of its business. this also includes protecting the
companys portfolio of intellectual property. the
competitive environment requires substantial investments in
continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. in
addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for
the companys consumer products involves significant
expenditures for advertising and promotion.
research
and development
research activities represent a significant part of johnson
& johnsons subsidiaries businesses. major
research facilities are located not only in the united states,
but also in belgium, brazil, canada, china, france, germany,
india, israel, japan, the netherlands, singapore and the united
kingdom. the costs of worldwide company-sponsored research
activities relating to the development of new products,
improvement of existing products, technical support of products
and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection
of consumers and patients (excluding purchased in-process
research and development charges for fiscal 2008 and 2007),
amounted to $7.0billion, $7.6billion and
$7.7billion for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. these costs are charged directly to expense, or
directly against income, in the year in which incurred.
environment
johnson & johnsons operating companies are subject to
a variety of u.s. and international environmental protection
measures. johnson & johnson believes that its operations
comply in all material respects with applicable environmental
laws and regulations. johnson & johnsons compliance
with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not
expected to, have a material effect upon its capital
expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
regulation
most of johnson & johnsons businesses are subject to
varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in
which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward
increasingly stringent regulation. in the united states, the
drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies,
primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing,
advertising, labeling and safety reporting. the exercise of
broad regulatory powers by the fda continues to result in
increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required
for fda clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding
increase in the expense of product introduction. similar trends
are also evident in major markets outside of the united states.
the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a
subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental
agencies and legislative bodies around the world. in the united
states, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits
and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for
particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular
medical devices. payers have become a more potent force in the
market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and
medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device
utilization and the quality and costs of health care.
the regulatory agencies under whose purview johnson &
johnsons operating companies operate have administrative
powers that may subject those companies to such actions as
product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other
civil and criminal sanctions. in some cases, johnson &
johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to
initiate product recalls.
in addition, business practices in the health care industry have
come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the united
states, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and
resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of
significant civil and criminal penalties.

the company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of
proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental
response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as
superfund, and comparable state laws, in which the primary
relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. while
it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these
proceedings, in the opinion of the company, such proceedings
would not have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations, cash flows or financial position of the company.

controls
and procedures
disclosure controls and procedures.at the end
of the period covered by this report, the company evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures. the companys disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or
submits under the exchange act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
secs rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company
in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act
is accumulated and communicated to the companys
management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. williamc. weldon, chairman and chief executive
officer, and dominic j. caruso, chief financial officer,
reviewed and participated in this evaluation. based on this
evaluation, messrs.weldon and caruso concluded that, as of
the end of the period covered by this report, the companys
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
managements report on internal control over financial
reporting.under section 404 of the
sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, management is required to assess the
effectiveness of the companys internal control over
financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and
report, based on that assessment, whether the companys
internal control over financial reporting is effective.
management of the company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
the companys internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability
of the companys financial reporting and the preparation of
external financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.
internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well
designed, has inherent limitations. therefore, internal control
over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
the companys management has assessed the effectiveness of
the companys internal control over financial reporting as
of january3, 2010. in making this assessment, the company
used the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in
internal control-integrated framework. these
criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk
assessment, control activities, information and communication,
and monitoring. the companys assessment included extensive
documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.
based on the companys processes and assessment, as
described above, management has concluded that, as of
january3, 2010, the companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective.
the effectiveness of the companys internal control over
financial reporting as of january3, 2010 has been audited
by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the
report of independent registered public accounting
firm on page64 of the annual report, which is
incorporated herein by reference and filed as exhibit13 to
this report on
form10-k.
changes in internal control over financial
reporting.during the fiscal quarter ended
january3, 2010, there were no changes in the
companys internal control over financial reporting
identified in connection with the evaluation of such referred to
above in this item9a that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys
internal control over financial reporting.
