GEOGRAPHIC

AREAS

THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS

CONDUCTED BY SUBSIDIARIES LOCATED IN 59 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, WHICH ARE SELLING PRODUCTS IN VIRTUALLY ALL

COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD IN

THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE

UNDER  SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS 

CONSUMER,  PHARMACEUTICAL AND

 MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS.

HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF

DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY

AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

INCLUDE NOT ONLY THOSE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO

THOSE DEVELOPED BY SUBSIDIARIES ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN COMPARABLE U.S.

ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL CLIMATE IS

INFLUENCED BY RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND POLITICAL

UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW

MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO JOHNSON & JOHNSONS

OPERATING COMPANIES BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY READILY

AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.

PATENTS

AND TRADEMARKS

JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE

OF OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION ON THEIR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES

WHERE POSSIBLE. THEY OWN OR ARE LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF

PATENTS RELATING TO THEIR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,

WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE

TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES.

SALES OF THE COMPANYS LARGEST PRODUCT,

REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB), ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7% OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS TOTAL REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2009. ACCORDINGLY, THE

PATENTS RELATED TO THIS PRODUCT ARE BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL TO

JOHNSON & JOHNSON.

DURING 2007 THROUGH 2009,

RISPERDAL

®

(RISPERIDONE) ORAL AND

TOPAMAX

®

(TOPIRAMATE) LOST BASIC PATENT PROTECTION AND MARKET EXCLUSIVITY

AND BECAME SUBJECT TO GENERIC COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES

AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

RISPERDAL

®

ORAL SALES DECLINED BY 57.7% AND 37.8% IN 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

TOPAMAX

®

LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN MARCH 2009 AND SALES DECLINED BY

57.9% AS COMPARED TO 2008. THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT PATENT SCHEDULED

TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 20, 2010 IS FOR

LEVAQUIN

®

(LEVOFLOXACIN), WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 2.5% OF THE COMPANYS

2009 SALES. A PEDIATRIC EXTENSION FOR

LEVAQUIN

®

WAS GRANTED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

(FDA), WHICH EXTENDS MARKET EXCLUSIVITY IN THE

UNITED STATES THROUGH JUNE 20, 2011.

JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES HAVE MADE A

PRACTICE OF SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS AND OF

OBTAINING PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE

MEANS. THESE TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH PRODUCTS ARE

MARKETED. JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS IN

THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF

ITS BUSINESSES.

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF

SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF EACH YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS REFLECTS

INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR ADVERTISING AND

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, JOHNSON & JOHNSONS

OPERATING COMPANIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LARGE AND SMALL,

AND BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL, LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE

NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION

IN RESEARCH, INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF

NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY

SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IS

IMPORTANT TO JOHNSON & JOHNSONS SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS

OF ITS BUSINESS. THIS ALSO INCLUDES PROTECTING THE

COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN

CONTINUING RESEARCH AND IN MAINTAINING SALES FORCES. IN

ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR

THE COMPANYS CONSUMER PRODUCTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT

EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF JOHNSON

& JOHNSONS SUBSIDIARIES BUSINESSES. MAJOR

RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE LOCATED NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES,

BUT ALSO IN BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY,

INDIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE AND THE UNITED

KINGDOM. THE COSTS OF WORLDWIDE COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH

ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS,

IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING PRODUCTS, TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF PRODUCTS

AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION

OF CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS (EXCLUDING PURCHASED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGES FOR FISCAL 2008 AND 2007),

AMOUNTED TO $7.0 BILLION, $7.6 BILLION AND

$7.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EXPENSE, OR

DIRECTLY AGAINST INCOME, IN THE YEAR IN WHICH INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENT

JOHNSON & JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO

A VARIETY OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

MEASURES. JOHNSON & JOHNSON BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS

COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. JOHNSON & JOHNSONS COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND IS NOT

EXPECTED TO, HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

REGULATION

MOST OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN

WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD

INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

DRUG, DEVICE, DIAGNOSTICS AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES HAVE LONG BEEN

SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES,

PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, MANUFACTURING,

ADVERTISING, LABELING AND SAFETY REPORTING. THE EXERCISE OF

BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE FDA CONTINUES TO RESULT IN

INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED

FOR FDA CLEARANCE OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES AND A CORRESPONDING

INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS

ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE A

SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL

AGENCIES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE UNITED

STATES, ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG PRICES AND PROFITS

AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR

PARTICULAR DRUGS OR RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE PARTICULAR

MEDICAL DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT FORCE IN THE

MARKET PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO DRUG AND

MEDICAL DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE

UTILIZATION AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF HEALTH CARE.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES OPERATE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE

POWERS THAT MAY SUBJECT THOSE COMPANIES TO SUCH ACTIONS AS

PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO

INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY HAVE

COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED

STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AND

RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE RISK OF

SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND

REPORT, BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT, WHETHER THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AS TO THE RELIABILITY

PREPARATION AND MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT ALL MISSTATEMENTS.

MOREOVER, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF JANUARY 3, 2010. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY

USED THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. THESE

CRITERIA ARE IN THE AREAS OF CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, RISK

ASSESSMENT, CONTROL ACTIVITIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION,

AND MONITORING. THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EXTENSIVE

DOCUMENTING, EVALUATING AND TESTING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

BASED ON THE COMPANYS PROCESSES AND ASSESSMENT, AS
