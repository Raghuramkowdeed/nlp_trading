GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OF JOHNSON &

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ARE SELLING PRODUCTS IN

VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRODUCTS MADE

AND SOLD IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE

DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER BUSINESS  CONSUMER,

 PHARMACEUTICAL AND

 MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS.

HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF

DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY

AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

INCLUDE NOT ONLY THOSE WHICH WERE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED

STATES, BUT ALSO THOSE WHICH WERE DEVELOPED BY SUBSIDIARIES

ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN

COMPARABLE U.S. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL

CLIMATE IS INFLUENCED BY RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES BUSINESSES ARE

GENERALLY READILY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS MADE A PRACTICE OF

OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION ON ITS PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES WHERE

POSSIBLE. JOHNSON & JOHNSON OWNS OR IS LICENSED UNDER A

NUMBER OF PATENTS RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESS. SALES OF THE

COMPANYS TWO LARGEST PRODUCTS,

RISPERDAL

®

/RISPERDAL

®

CONSTA

®

AND

PROCRIT

®

/EPREX

®

,

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 8% AND 6% OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS TOTAL REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR FISCAL 2006.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PATENTS RELATED TO THESE PRODUCTS ARE BELIEVED

TO BE MATERIAL TO JOHNSON & JOHNSON AS A WHOLE.

DURING 2004, 2005 AND 2006,

DURAGESIC

®

/FENTANYL

TRANSDERMAL (FENTANYL TRANSDERMAL SYSTEM) LOST ITS BASIC PATENT

PROTECTION AND IS SUBJECT TO GENERIC COMPETITION IN THE UNITED

STATES AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND

EPREX

®

(EPOETIN ALFA) LOST ITS BASIC PATENT PROTECTION AND IS SUBJECT

TO GENERIC COMPETITION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

DURAGESIC

®

/FENTANYL

TRANSDERMAL SALES DECLINED BY 18.3% TO $1.3 BILLION IN 2006

AS COMPARED TO 2005, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF GENERIC COMPETITION.

REGARDING

EPREX

®

,

GENERIC COMPETITION WILL BE LIMITED IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO THE

LACK OF APPROVED GENERIC COMPOUNDS. COMBINED SALES OF

DURAGESIC

®

/FENTANYL

TRANSDERMAL AND

EPREX

®

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5% OF JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS WORLDWIDE SALES IN 2006. THE ONLY MATERIAL

PATENTS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE

RELATED TO

2

RISPERDAL

®

,

WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN THE UNITED STATES IN DECEMBER

2007, AND

TOPAMAX

®

,

WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN THE UNITED STATES IN SEPTEMBER

2008. THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED DATA TO THE FDA IN ORDER TO

OBTAIN A PEDIATRIC EXTENSION FOR

RISPERDAL

®

,

WHICH, IF APPROVED, WOULD GRANT EXCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES

THROUGH JUNE 2008. THE

TOPAMAX

®

PATENT ALSO CARRIES THE POSSIBILITY OF A PEDIATRIC EXTENSION IN

THE UNITED STATES, WHICH, IF OBTAINED, WOULD GRANT EXCLUSIVITY

IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL MARCH 2009.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON HAS MADE A PRACTICE OF

SELLING ITS PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS AND OF OBTAINING

PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE MEANS. JOHNSON

& JOHNSONS TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE ITS PRODUCTS ARE

MARKETED. JOHNSON & JOHNSON CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS IN

THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF

ITS BUSINESS.

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT

DEGREE OF SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS

REFLECTS INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR

ADVERTISING AND RESEARCH GRANTS.

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, JOHNSON &

JOHNSON COMPANIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LARGE AND SMALL,

LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. COMPETITION IS STRONG IN ALL

PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE

COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, INVOLVING

THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS

AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF

NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT TO JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THIS

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN

CONTINUING RESEARCH AND MULTIPLE SALES FORCES. IN ADDITION, THE

DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE

PRODUCTS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS CONSUMER BUSINESSES

INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART

OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS BUSINESS. MAJOR RESEARCH

FACILITIES ARE LOCATED NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO IN

AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY,

INDIA, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

THE COSTS OF WORLDWIDE COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, IMPROVEMENT OF

EXISTING PRODUCTS, TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF PRODUCTS AND COMPLIANCE

WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS

AND PATIENTS, EXCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

CHARGES, AMOUNTED TO $7,125 MILLION, $6,462 MILLION

AND $5,344 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED DIRECTLY TO INCOME IN THE

YEAR IN WHICH INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENT

JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO A

VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

MEASURES. JOHNSON & JOHNSON BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS

COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. JOHNSON & JOHNSONS COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT, DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND IS

NOT EXPECTED TO, HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

REGULATION

MOST OF JOHNSON & JOHNSONS BUSINESS IS

SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE

COUNTRIES IN WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL

TREND IS TOWARD INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE DRUG, DEVICE, DIAGNOSTICS AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES

HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AND

STATE AGENCIES, PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY,

MANUFACTURING, ADVERTISING, LABELING AND SAFETY REPORTING. THE

EXERCISE OF BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE FDA CONTINUES TO

RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION

REQUIRED FOR FDA CLEARANCE OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES

3

AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF

PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR

MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND

CONTINUE TO BE A SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION

BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE

WORLD. IN THE UNITED STATES, ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG

PRICES AND PROFITS AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE

PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PARTICULAR DRUGS OR RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE

PARTICULAR MEDICAL DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT

FORCE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID

TO DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE DRUG AND MEDICAL

DEVICE UTILIZATION AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF HEALTH CARE. IN

THE UNITED STATES, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION

DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 AND THE DEFICIT

REDUCTION ACT OF 2005 MAY CAUSE UNCERTAINTY IN REIMBURSEMENT

LEVELS IN CERTAIN PRODUCT SEGMENTS.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW

JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMPANIES OPERATE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE

POWERS THAT MAY SUBJECT THOSE COMPANIES TO SUCH ACTIONS AS

PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER

CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, JOHNSON &

JOHNSONS OPERATING COMPANIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO

INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH

CARE INDUSTRY HAVE COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY

IN THE UNITED STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL, AND RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE

RISK OF SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
