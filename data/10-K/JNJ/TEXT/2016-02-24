energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; diabetes care products, such as blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; and disposable contact lenses.geographic areasthe business of johnson& johnson is conducted by more than 250 operating companies located in 60countries, including the u.s., in virtually all countries throughout the world. the products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under segments of business consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices. however, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. the products sold in international business include those developed in the united states and by subsidiaries abroad.investments and activities in some countries outside the u.s. are subject to higher risks than comparable u.s.activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.raw materialsraw materials essential to the company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources.  where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company.patents the company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. they own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the company in the operation of its businesses. sales of the companys largest product, remicade (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.4% of the company's total revenues for fiscal 2015. accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the company.there are two sets of patents related specifically to remicade (infliximab). the first set of patents is co-owned by janssen biotech, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of johnson & johnson, and nyu langone medical center (nyu). janssen biotech, inc. has an exclusive license to nyu's interests in the patents. these patents have expired in all countries outside the united states. in the united states, the latest of these patents expires in september 2018 and this patent stands rejected and is subject to reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the united states patent and trademark office. those proceedings are on going.the second set of patents specifically related to remicade was granted to the kennedy institute of rheumatology  in europe, canada, australia and the united states. janssen biotech, inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-tnf antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-tnf antibodies) to these patents that expire in 2017 outside of the united       2states and 2018 in the united states.  the validity of these patents has been challenged. certain claims have been invalidated and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in canada. the company does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to remicade. if any of the remicade related patents discussed above is found to be invalid, any such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the introduction of biosimilar versions of remicade. for a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to remicade, see note 21 legal proceedings  intellectual property  pharmaceutical  remicade related cases of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.in addition to competing in the immunology market with remicade, the company is currently marketing stelara (ustekinumab), simponi (golimumab) and simponi aria (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to eight years.trademarksthe companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. these trademarks are protected by registration in the united states and other countries where such products are marketed. the company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.seasonalityworldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. this reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.competitionin all of their product lines, the company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. the development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the companys product portfolio, is important to the company's success in all areas of its business. the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. in addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the companys consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.research and developmentresearch activities represent a significant part of the companys businesses. research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $9.0 billion, $8.5 billion and $8.2 billion for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  research facilities are located in the united states, belgium, brazil, canada, china, france, germany, india, israel, japan, the netherlands, singapore, switzerland and the united kingdom.environmentthe company is subject to a variety of u.s.and international environmental protection measures. the company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. the companys compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.regulationthe companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. in the u.s., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. the exercise of broad regulatory powers by the u.s. food and drug administration (the "fda") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for       3fda approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the u.s.the costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. in the u.s., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.u.s. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the patient protection and affordable care act (the "aca").  these have both positive and negative impacts on the u.s. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the aca will ultimately affect the industry.the regulatory agencies under whose purview the company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. in some cases, the companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.in addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the united states, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.further, the company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the company's products.  these processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals.available informationthe companys main corporate website address is www.jnj.com. copies of the companys quarterly reports on form10-q, annual report on form10-k and current reports on

segmentsdescription of the company and business segmentsjohnson& johnson and its subsidiaries (the company) have approximately 127,100employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. the company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.the company is organized into three business segments: consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices. the consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. these products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. the pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. the medical devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.  the executive committee of johnson& johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the company. this committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the consumer, pharmaceutical and medical devices business segments.in all of its product lines, the company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. the development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the company's product portfolio, is important to the companys success in all areas of its business. the competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. in addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.managements objectives the company manages within a strategic framework with our credo as the foundation. the company believes that our strategic operating principles: being broadly based in human health care, managing the business for the long term, having a decentralized management approach, and being committed to our people and values, are crucial to successfully meeting the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete. to this end, management is focused on our long-term strategic growth drivers: creating value through innovation, expanding our global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. the company is broadly based in human health care, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. new products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2015 sales. in 2015, $9.0billion, or 12.9% of sales, was invested in research and development, reflecting managements commitment to delivering new and differentiated products and services to meet evolving health care needs and sustain the companys long-term growth. our diverse businesses with more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries are the key drivers of the companys success. maintaining the companys decentralized management approach, while at the same time leveraging the extensive resources of the enterprise, positions the company well to innovate, execute strategic plans and reach markets globally, as well as address the needs and challenges of the local markets. in order to remain a leader in health care, the company strives to maintain a purpose-driven organization and is committed to developing global business leaders who can achieve these growth objectives. businesses are managed for the long-term in order to sustain market leadership positions and enable growth, which provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders.our credo unifies all johnson & johnson employees in achieving these objectives, and provides a common set of values that serve as the foundation of the companys responsibilities to patients, consumers and health care professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. the company believes that these foundational values, its strategic framework and long-term growth drivers, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people around the world, will enable johnson& johnson to continue to be a leader in the health care industry.      9results of operationsanalysis

olysio/sovriad (simeprevir) and incivo (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide operational sales growth.  in 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide operational sales growth was negative 2.0%. in 2014, sales of the company's hepatitis c products, olysio/sovriad (simeprevir) and incivo (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 2.8%, and the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide operational growth. in 2013, the acquisition of synthes, inc., net of the related divestiture, increased worldwide operational growth by 2.5%.sales by u.s.companies were $35.7billion in 2015, $34.8billion in 2014 and $31.9billion in 2013. this represents increases of 2.6% in 2015, 9.0% in 2014 and 7.0% in 2013. sales by international companies were $34.4billion in 2015, $39.5billion in 2014 and $39.4billion in 2013. this represents a decrease of 13.1% in 2015, and increases of 0.4% in 2014 and 5.4% in 2013.the five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, u.s.and international sales were 2.6%, 3.9% and 1.4%, respectively. the ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, u.s.and international sales were 3.3%, 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively.sales by companies in europe experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.1%, offset by a negative currency impact of 16.7%. sales by companies in the western hemisphere (excluding the u.s.) experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 2.6% offset by a negative currency impact of 18.2%.  sales by companies in the asia-pacific, africa region experienced a decline of 8.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 0.3% and a negative currency impact of 8.4%.2015 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for annual closing date details). the company estimated that the fiscal year 2015 growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. while the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.in 2015 and 2014, the company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of the total consolidated revenues.  in 2013, the company did not have a customer that represented 10% or more of total consolidated revenues.u.s.health care reformon july 28, 2014, the internal revenue service issued final regulations for the branded prescription drug fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee imposed on entities engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs (covered  entities), enacted by section 9008 of the patient protection and affordable care act.  the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur.  this change impacted covered entities and resulted in the need for all entities to record an additional expense in 2014 for the fee that would have otherwise been expensed when paid in 2015. the company accrued an additional $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014 due to this change. the fee associated with this accelerated expense was paid, as scheduled, in 2015 and had no cash impact in 2014.      10analysis of sales by business segmentsconsumer segmentconsumer segment sales in 2015 were $13.5billion, a decrease of 6.8% from 2014, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 9.5%.  u.s.consumer segment sales were $5.2billion, an increase of 2.5%.  international sales were $8.3billion, a decrease of 11.9%, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 14.6%.  in 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide consumer segment operational growth.major consumer franchise sales:% change(dollars in millions)20152014201315 vs. 1414 vs. 13otc$3,9754,1064,028(3.2)%1.9skin care3,5313,7583,704(6.0)1.5baby care2,0442,2392,295(8.7)(2.4)oral care1,5801,6471,622(4.1)1.5womens health1,2001,3021,568(7.8)(17.0)wound care/other1,1771,4441,480(18.5)(2.4)total consumer sales$13,50714,49614,697(6.8)%(1.4)the over-the-counter (otc) franchise sales of $4.0billion decreased 3.2% as compared to the prior year, which included 8.1% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 11.3%. operational growth was primarily driven by analgesics, upper respiratory, including zyrtec, and digestive health products. mcneil-ppc, inc. (now johnson & johnson consumer inc.) (mcneil-ppc) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the u.s. food and drug administration (fda), which governs certain mcneil consumer healthcare manufacturing operations and requires mcneil-ppc to remediate the facilities it operates in lancaster, pennsylvania; fort washington, pennsylvania; and las piedras, puerto rico (the consent decree).in february 2015, a third-party expert submitted written certification to the fda for all three manufacturing sites.following fda inspections in 2015, mcneil-ppc received notifications from the fda that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations.  under the consent decree, after receiving notice from the fda of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cgmp expert.  thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for at least five years. the skin care franchise sales of $3.5billion decreased 6.0% as compared to the prior year, which included 1.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. operational growth was primarily due to sales growth of   neutrogena and aveeno products partially offset by lower sales in china. the baby care franchise sales were $2.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior year, which included 1.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.9%. operational growth was primarily due to new product launches partially offset by competition in china.the oral care franchise sales were $1.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.1% as compared to the prior year, which included 5.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.3%.  operational growth was driven by increased sales of listerine products,  attributable to geographical expansion of new products and successful marketing campaigns. the womens health franchise sales were $1.2billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included 7.6% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 15.4%. operational growth outside the u.s. was driven by new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. the wound care/other franchise sales were $1.2billion in 2015, a decrease of 18.5% from 2014, primarily due to the splenda and benecol divestitures.  consumer segment sales in 2014 were $14.5billion, a decrease of 1.4% from 2013, which included 1.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 2.4%.  u.s.consumer segment sales were

pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 6.5% due to the introduction of competitive products to the company's hepatitis c products, olysio/sovriad (simeprevir) and incivo (telaprevir), and positively impacted by 1.4% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including managed medicaid rebates primarily in the cardiovascular/metabolism/other therapeutic area.

products achieved sales of $10.4billion in 2015, representing an increase of 2.1% as compared to the prior year. immunology products growth of 2.1% included operational growth of 6.9% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%. the increased sales of stelara (ustekinumab) and simponi/simponi aria (golimumab) were due to market growth and increased penetration ofsimponi aria. growth was partially offset by lower remicade (infliximab) sales to the company's distributor primarily due to the weakening of the euro and biosimilar competition in europe. the patents for remicade in certain countries in europe expired in february 2015. biosimilar versions of remicade have been introduced in certain markets outside the united states, resulting in a reduction in sales of remicade in those markets.        12additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in remicade sales in markets outside the united states. the timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of remicade in the united states is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the fda and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the biologics price competition and innovation act (the bpcia). on february 9, 2016, the arthritis advisory committee of the fda recommended by a vote of 21-3 to approve the first investigational biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications in the united states. there is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of remicade following fda approval (subject to compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the bpcia), even though one or more valid patents are in place.  introduction to the u.s. market of a biosimilar version of remicade will result in a reduction in u.s. sales of remicade. in 2015, u.s. sales of remicade were $4.5 billion. the launch of a biosimilar version of remicade in the u.s. is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows in 2016.  see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for legal matters regarding the remicade patents.infectious disease products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 34.7% from 2014, which included an operational decrease of 27.6% and a negative currency impact of 7.1%. competitive products to the company's hepatitis c products, olysio/sovriad (simeprevir) and incivo (telaprevir), had a significant negative impact on u.s. sales and will continue to have a negative impact on future sales. the decline of hepatitis c sales was partially offset by sales growth of edurant(rilpivirine) and sales of prezista/ prezcobix/rezolsta (darunavir/cobicistat). neuroscience products sales were $6.3billion, a decrease of 3.5% from 2014, which included an operational growth of 5.0% and a negative currency impact of 8.5%. the u.s. sales growth of concerta/methylphenidate was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors by the fda in november 2014. strong sales of invega sustenna/xeplion/invega trinza (paliperidone palmitate) were primarily due to increased market share and the launch of invega trinza. neuroscience products sales were negatively impacted by the u.s. divestiture of nucynta (tapentadol) and lower sales of risperdal consta (risperidone).oncology products achieved sales of $4.7billion in 2015, representing an increase of 5.3% as compared to the prior year. oncology products growth of 5.3% included operational growth of 17.7% and a negative currency impact of 12.4%. contributors to the growth were strong sales of imbruvica (ibrutinib) due to the approval of new indications, additional country launches and strong patient uptake.  additionally, sales of zytiga (abiraterone acetate) grew in the u.s. due to market growth partially offset by share decline, and strong growth in asia and latin america was partially offset by lower sales in europe due to competition. cardiovascular/metabolism/other products achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 15.1% as compared to the prior year due to strong sales of xarelto(rivaroxaban) and invokana/invokamet (canagliflozin).     procrit/eprex (epoetin alfa) sales were impacted by competition.       13during 2015, the company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional

$14.9billion, an increase of 5.0%, which included 8.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 3.3%. in 2013, pharmaceutical segment sales included a positive adjustment to previous

prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. the orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.3% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 6.0%. operational growth in the u.s. and europe regions was primarily driven by sales of the hip primary stem platform, the attune knee system, trauma tfna nailing system and sports medicine orthovisc/monovisc products. growth was negatively impacted by softer demand and a reduction in customer inventory levels primarily in china and continued pricing pressures.the surgery franchise sales were $9.2billion in 2015, a decrease of 5.1% from 2014, which included operational growth of 2.7% and a negative currency impact of 7.8%. operational growth in advanced surgery was driven by endocutter, biosurgical and energy products, primarily attributable to market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. operational growth in specialty surgery was primarily driven by mentor products. growth was partially offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products in general surgery.the vision care franchise sales were $2.6billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.5% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.2%.  operational growth in all the major regions was primarily driven by new product launches partially offset by lower price.the cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.0 billion, a decrease of 7.8% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.1% and a negative currency impact of 7.7%. strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and the success of the thermocool smarttouch catheter and was offset by the impact of divesting the cordis business. the company completed the divestiture of the cordis business to cardinal health on october 4, 2015. the cordis business generated annual net revenues of approximately $535 million and $780 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. for additional details see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.  the diabetes care franchise sales were $1.9billion, a decrease of 10.0% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.3%. the operational decline was primarily due to lower price partially offset by the success of the animas vibe products. on june 30, 2014, the company divested the ortho-clinical diagnostics business (the diagnostics franchise) to the carlyle group. for additional details see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.        15the medical devices segment sales in 2014 were $27.5billion, a decrease of 3.4% from 2013, which included an

2.7% as compared to the prior year, with operational growth of 0.5% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.2%. in 2014, the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business had a negative impact of 3.2% on the operational growth of the medical devices segment.analysis of consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on incomeconsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $19.2 billion as compared to $20.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of 6.6%. the decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of olysio/sovriad (simeprevir), negative currency impacts, a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. the decrease was partially offset by lower net litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion, a positive adjustment of $0.4 billion to previous reserve estimates including managed medicaid rebates, and higher gains of $0.3 billion from divestitures as compared to the prior year.  the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the cordis business, the splenda brand and the u.s. divestiture of nucynta versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business and the k-y brand. additionally, 2014 included an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee of $0.2 billion. consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $20.6billion in 2014 as compared to $15.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 32.9%. earnings before provision for taxes on income were favorable due to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of olysio/sovriad (simeprevir), positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost reduction efforts across many of the businesses.  additionally, 2014 included  higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion, lower in-process research and development costs of $0.4 billion and lower expenses of $0.1 billion related to the depuy asr hip program as compared to the fiscal year 2013. this was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee of $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion of higher synthes integration/transaction costs in 2014. the fiscal year 2013 includeda net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of elan american depositary shares.as a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2015 was 27.4% versus 27.7% in 2014.cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses:cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:% of

increase/(decrease) over the prior year0.8(1.1)(0.4)in 2015, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased slightly as compared to the prior year.  favorable mix between the segments was offset by $81 million associated with the restructuring activity in the medical devices segment, negative transactional currency and lower sales of olysio/sovriad (simeprevir) in 2015.  intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. there was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to incremental investment spending in all the segments and the impact from lower sales of olysio/sovriad (simeprevir), partially offset by favorable mix and the inclusion of an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee of $0.2 billion in 2014.in 2014, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased compared to the prior year. this was primarily the result of positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost improvements across many of the businesses. this was partially offset by pricing and the impact of negative transactional currency. in addition, 2013 included an inventory step-up charge of $0.1 billion related to the synthes acquisition. intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for both 2014 and 2013 was $1.4 billion. there was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to leveraged costs resulting from growth in the pharmaceutical business, particularly sales of olysio/sovriad (simeprevir), and cost containment initiatives across many of the businesses. this was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee of $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014.      16research and development expense: research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:201520142013(dollars in

company's business.  these expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch.  the company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. in 2015, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 6.5% compared to 2014. the increase as a percent to sales was attributable to increased investment spending primarily in the pharmaceutical segment, lower overall sales and business mix. in 2014, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 3.8% compared to 2013. the reduction as a percent to sales was primarily due to strong sales growth in the pharmaceutical business. research spending in the pharmaceutical segment increased in absolute dollars to $6.2 billion as compared to $5.8 billion primarily due to higher levels of spending to advance the company's pharmaceutical pipeline. in-process research and development (ipr&d): in 2015, the company recorded an ipr&d charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to covagen.  in 2014, the company recorded an ipr&d charge of $0.2 billion for the impairment of various ipr&d projects related to respivert, crucell, mentor and synthes for the delay or  discontinuation of certain development projects.  in 2013, the company recorded an ipr&d charge of $0.6 billion primarily for the impairment of various ipr&d projects related to crucell, corimmun and acclarent for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. other (income) expense, net:other (income) expense, net is the account where the company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by johnson & johnson innovation - jjdc, inc. (formerly johnson & johnson development corporation), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. the change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2015 was a favorable change of $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion and higher jjdc portfolio gains of $0.2 billion as compared to the prior year.  additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the cordis business, the splenda brand and the u.s. divestiture of nucynta versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business and the k-y brand. this was partially offset by higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015.the change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2014 was a favorable change of $2.6 billion as compared to the prior year.  the fiscal year 2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the depuy asr hip program as compared to 2013. this was partially offset by higher synthes integration/transaction costs of $0.2 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion primarily related to incivo (telaprevir) in 2014. additionally, the fiscal year 2013 included a higher net gain of $0.5 billion as compared to 2014 on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of elan american depositary shares. interest (income) expense:interest income in 2015 increased by $61 million as compared to 2014 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $38.4billion at the end of 2015, and averaged $35.7billion as compared to the $31.1billion average cash balance in 2014. the increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.interest expense in 2015 increased slightly as compared to 2014.  the average debt balance was $19.3billion in 2015 versus $18.5billion in 2014. the total debt balance at the end of 2015 was $19.9billion as compared to $18.8billion at the end of 2014. the higher debt balance of approximately $1.1 billion was an increase in commercial paper for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program. interest income in 2014 was comparable to the prior year. a higher balance in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was offset by lower interest rates. cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $33.1billion at the end of       172014, and averaged $31.1billion as compared to the $25.2billion average cash balance in 2013. the increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.interest expense in 2014 increased by $51 million as compared to 2013 due to a higher average debt balance. the average debt balance was $18.5billion in 2014 versus $17.2billion in 2013. the total debt balance at the end of 2014 was $18.8billion as compared to $18.2billion at the end of 2013. the higher debt balance of approximately $0.6 billion was due to increased borrowings in november 2014. the company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. the proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes.income before tax by segmentincome before tax by segment of business were as

percent to sales was 13.2%, versus 13.4% in 2014, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014.  in 2015, the consumer segment tax included a gain of $0.3 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the splenda brand.  in 2014, the consumer segment included a gain of $0.5 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the k-y brand. in 2014, the consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.4%, flat to the prior year. pharmaceutical segment:in 2015, the pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 37.3% versus 36.2% in 2014.the favorable income before tax was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2015 partially offset by a sales decline of olysio/sovriad(simeprevir), increased investment spending and negative currency impacts as compared to 2014.  included in 2015 was a gain of $1.0 billion on the u.s. divestiture of nucynta, as well as receipt of a contingent payment and a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including managed medicaid rebates. additionally, the pharmaceutical segment income before tax in 2014 was negatively impacted by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.3 billion primarily related to the write-down of incivo (telaprevir). in 2014, the pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 36.2% versus 32.6% in 2013.the favorable income before tax was attributable to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of olysio/sovriad (simeprevir), positive sales mix of higher margin products and cost containment initiatives realized in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. this was partially offset by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee and a $0.1 billion intangible asset write-down related to incivo (telaprevir). additionally, 2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of elan american depositary shares, and a positive adjustment of $0.2 billion to previous estimates for managed medicaid rebates, partially offset by higher write-downs of $0.4 billion for the impairment of ipr&d as compared to 2014. medical devices segment:in 2015, the medical devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 27.2% versus 28.9% in 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion, an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to acclarent, and lower gains of $0.5 billion on divestitures as compared to 2014.  in 2015, the medical devices segment included gains of $1.4 billion, primarily for the divestiture of the cordis business versus a gain of $1.9 billion recorded in 2014 for the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business. the 2015 income before tax was favorably impacted by lower net litigation expense of $0.9 billion, which included a gain from the litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with guidant, and lower synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014.       18in 2014, medical devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.9% versus 18.5% in 2013. the favorable income before tax was attributable to the net gain of $1.9 billion on the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business in 2014 and lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion as compared to 2013. restructuring:the company announced restructuring actions in its medical devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018, including approximately $200 million savings in 2016. the savings will provide the company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. the company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, of which $81 million is included in cost of products sold.  see note22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the restructuring.provision for taxes on income:the worldwide effective income tax rate was 19.7% in 2015, 20.6% in 2014 and 10.6% in 2013. the 2015 effective tax rate decrease of 0.9% as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates.  additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. the increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the u.s., the accrual of an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional u.s. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year.  these increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the conor medsystems divestiture.the 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals courts decision in omj pharmaceuticals, inc.s litigation regarding credits under former section 936 of the internal revenue code (see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the companys u.s. internal revenue service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009.the 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with scios, inc., and the inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the research and development tax credit and the controlled foreign corporation look-through provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in january 2013 and were retroactive to january 1, 2012.liquidity and capital resourcesliquidity& cash flowscash and cash equivalents were $13.7billion at the end of 2015 as compared to $14.5billion at the end of 2014.  the primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8billion decrease were approximately $19.3 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $7.7billion net cash used by investing activities, and $10.8 billion net cash used by financing activities, and $1.5 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. in addition, the company had $24.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2015 and $18.6 billion at the end of 2014. see note1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.cash flow from operations of $19.3billion was the result of $15.4billion of net earnings and $5.4 billion of non-cash charges and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, primarily related to acclarent and venezuela write-downs, reduced by $2.6 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, and $1.2 billion related to deferred taxes, accounts receivable and inventories.  additional sources of operating cash flow of $2.2 billion resulted from a decrease in other current and non-current assets and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. investing activities use of $7.7billion was primarily for net purchases of investments in marketable securities of $6.7 billion, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion, and acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $3.5 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses. financing activities use of $10.8billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.2 billion and $5.3 billion for the repurchase of common stock. financing activities also included a source of $1.4billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.3 billion of net proceeds from stock options exercised and associated tax benefits.on october 13, 2015, the company announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the company's shares of common stock. as of january 3, 2016, $1.0 billion has been repurchased under the program. the repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. the company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets. the previous share repurchase program approved on july 21, 2014, authorizing the company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the company's shares of common stock, was completed on april 28, 2015.      19 in 2015, the company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market.  the company has a shelf registration with the u.s. securities and exchange commission that enables the company to issue debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities on a timely basis. for additional details on borrowings, see note7 to the consolidated financial statements.the company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs in 2016.concentration of credit riskglobal concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. economic challenges in italy, spain, greece and portugal (the southern european region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the u.s. and other international markets.  the total net trade accounts receivable balance in the southern european region was approximately $1.3 billion as of january 3, 2016 and $1.8 billion as of december 28, 2014. approximately $0.8 billion as of january 3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of december 28, 2014 of the southern european region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the company's consumer, vision care and diabetes care businesses as well as certain pharmaceutical and medical devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns.the remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the southern european region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the pharmaceutical and medical devices local affiliates. the total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.5 billion at january 3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at december 28, 2014.  the company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. for customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. the company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary.financing and market riskthe company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. accordingly, the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs.  gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions.  a 10% appreciation of the u.s.dollar from the january3, 2016 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the companys forward contracts by $15million.  conversely, a 10% depreciation of the u.s.dollar from the january3, 2016 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the companys forward contracts by $18million.  in either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.the company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts.  a 1% change in the spread between u.s.and foreign interest rates on the companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the companys swap contracts by approximately $115million.  in either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. further, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  the counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. management believes the risk of loss is remote.the company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.  a 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the companys interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $314 million.the company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide.  in september 2015, the company secured a new 364-day credit facility. total credit available to the company approximates $10billion, which expires on september15, 2016.  interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or london interbank offered rates (libor), plus applicable margins. commitment fees under the agreement are not material.total borrowings at the end of 2015 and 2014 were $19.9billion and $18.8billion, respectively.  the increase in borrowings between 2015 and 2014 was a result of financing for the company's share repurchase program. in 2015, net cash       20(cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $18.5billion compared to net cash of $14.3billion in 2014.  total debt represented 21.8% of total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) in 2015 and 21.2% of total capital in 2014. shareholders equity per share at the end of 2015 was $25.82 compared to $25.06 at year-end 2014, an increase of 3.0%.a summary of borrowings can be found in note7 to the consolidated financial statements.contractual obligations and commitmentsthe companys contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans.  there are no other significant obligations. to satisfy these obligations, the company will use cash from operations.  the

discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the companys consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s.(gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. actual results may or may not differ from these estimates.  the company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the companys operating results and financial condition.  these key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.revenue recognition:the company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.      21product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors.  rebates, which include the medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served.  the company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information.  products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall.  the returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales.  in accordance with the companys accounting policies, the company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods.  the companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the u.s.gaap guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists.  sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value.  sales returns in the consumer and pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable.  sales returns for certain franchises in the medical devices segment are typically resalable but are not material.  the company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.  the sales returns reserve for the total company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2015, 2014 and 2013.promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs.  the redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value.  volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. the company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products.  for all years presented, service revenues were less than 1% of total revenues and are included in sales to customers.  these arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.in addition, the company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities.   amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative fair value. upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period.  see note1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements.  the company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.      22below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts

recorded as a contra asset.income taxes:income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between u.s. gaap accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities.  the company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.  the company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. the company follows u.s. gaap, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.at january3, 2016 and december28, 2014, the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $58.0 billion and $53.4 billion, respectively. at january3, 2016 and december28, 2014, the company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $38.2 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively.  the company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. the company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. if the company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the u.s., the company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. the company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.legal and self insurance contingencies: the company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business.  the accruals are based on managements judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. the company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. in addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.  additionally, the company records insurance receivable amounts from third-party insurers when recovery is probable.  as appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers.the company follows the provisions of u.s.gaap when recording litigation related contingencies.  a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  the best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.      24see notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.long-lived and intangible assets:the company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the companys property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets.  as these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the company to record impairment charges.employee benefit plans:the company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide.  these plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates.  see note10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the companys results of operations.stock based compensation:the company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the black-scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the black-scholes option valuation model and monte carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. the input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.  for performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. the fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. the fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the monte carlo valuation model.  see note17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.new accounting pronouncementsrefer to note1 to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of january3, 2016.economic and market factorsthe company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care.  in response to these concerns, the company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. for the period 2005- 2015, in the united states, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the companys net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the u.s.consumer price index (cpi).the company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. the company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate.  the company has accounted for operations in venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%.  in the face of increasing costs, the company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.the venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges. during 2015, the company primarily utilized the official government rate of 6.3 bolivares fuertes to one u.s. dollar in preparing its consolidated financial statements.  during 2014, the company applied to settle an outstanding dividend payable at one of the alternative foreign exchange rates.  as a result, the company has applied this alternative exchange rate to translate certain transactions, as appropriate.  through the fourth quarter of 2015, the number of the companys transactions conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters.  as a result, the company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 6.3 bolivares fuertes to one u.s. dollar. therefore, the company recorded a charge of $161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in venezuela at one of the governments alternative exchange rates (simadi) and impair its non-monetary assets. after the revaluation, as of january 3, 2016, the companys venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 0.1% of the company's consolidated assets and liabilities. due to continuing uncertain economic conditions in venezuela, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future. any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys 2016 full year results. while the company continues to do business in greece, the company closely monitors the economic situation. as of january 3, 2016, the companys greek subsidiaries represented 0.3% and 0.4% of the company's consolidated assets and revenues, respectively.the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  a 1% change in the value of the u.s.dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the company had sales, income or expense in 2015 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $340million and income by $90million.      25the company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the companys businesses.the company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. firms have filed abbreviated new drug applications or biosimilar biological product applications with the fda or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. in the event the company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset.  there is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.  for further information, see the discussion on remicade related cases and litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications in note21 to the consolidated financial statements.legal proceedingsjohnson & johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with accounting standards codification (asc) 450-20-25.  for these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued.  amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.in the company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position. however, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.see note21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.common stock market pricesthe companys common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol

 26cautionary factors that may affect future resultsthis annual report contains forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty.  forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as plans, expects, will, anticipates, estimates and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the companys strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events.  the company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the company believes that it has been reasonable in its expectations and assumptions.  investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or that known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the companys expectations and projections.  investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.  the company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges and uncertainties inherent in new product development, including uncertainty of clinical success and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success of new and existing products; challenges to patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the company to successfully execute strategic plans, including restructuring plans; the potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to the restructuring may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; significant adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; impact of business combinations and divestitures; market conditions and the possibility that the on-going share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued; significant changes in customer relationships or changes in behavior and spending patterns or financial distress of purchasers of health care products and services; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies; financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply chain; complex global supply chains with increasing regulatory requirements; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action; disruptions due to natural disasters; and the potential failure to meet obligations in compliance agreements with government bodies.a discussion of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in this report for the fiscal year ended

financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standard update 2015-04: practical expedient for the measurement date of an employers defined benefit obligation and plan assets. this update provides a practical expedient option to entities that have defined benefit plans and have a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a calendar month-end. this option allows an entity to elect to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the calendar month-end that is closest to its fiscal year-end. this update will be effective for the company for all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and if the practical expedient is elected by an entity, it is required to be adopted on a prospective basis. early adoption is permitted. the company has elected to adopt the practical expedient to measure its defined benefit plans. this election did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the fasb issued accounting standard update 2015-17 income taxes: balance sheet classification of deferred taxes.  to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. this update is required to be effective for allpublic companies for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. earlier application is permitted. the company has elected to early adopt this standard on a retrospective basis. the 2014 consolidated balance sheet reclassification reduced current assets by $3.6 billion, increased non-current assets by $2.8 billion and reduced liabilities by $0.8 billion.recently issued accounting standardsnot adopted as of january 3, 2016during the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the fasb issued accounting standard update 2016-01: recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. the standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entitys equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. this update will be effective for the company for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. the company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements.during the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the fasb issued accounting standard update 2015-03: simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. this update requires capitalized debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction to the carrying value of debt instead of being classified as a deferred charge, as currently required. this update will be effective for the company for all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and is required to be applied retroactively for all periods presented. this update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the companys financial position.       35during the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the fasb issued accounting standard update 2015-11: simplifying the measurement of inventory. this update requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  this update will be effective for the company for all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016.  the amendments in this update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. this update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the companys financial position.during the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the fasb issued accounting standard update 2015-16 business combinations: simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. the amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. this update will be effective for the company for all annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. this update is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.during the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2014-09:revenue from contracts with customers. this standard replaces substantially all current revenue recognition accounting guidance. during the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the fasb approved a one year deferral to the effective date to be adopted by all public companies for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption of this standard is permitted but not before the original effective date for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements.during the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance accounting standards update no. 2014-10: development stage entities: elimination of certain financial reporting requirements, including an amendment to variable interest entity guidance in topic 810, consolidation. the change in the current guidance will require the company to determine if it should consolidate one of these entities based on the change in the consolidation analysis. this update to the consolidation analysis will become effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the company's consolidated financial statements.during the fiscal third quarter of 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-15: disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern. this standard requires management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. if substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around managements plan to alleviate these doubts are required. this update will become effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods ending after december 15, 2016. this standard is not expected to have any impact on current disclosures in the financial statements.cash equivalentsthe company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities.  the company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  the company invests its cash primarily in reverse repurchase agreements (rras), government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities and money market funds.rras are collateralized by deposits in the form of government securities and obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value.  the company does not record an asset or liability as the company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral.  the company has a policy that the collateral has at least an a (or equivalent) credit rating.  the company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the rras on a daily basis.  rras with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.      36investmentsinvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets. management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date.  the company periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary.  if losses on these securities are considered to be other than temporary, the loss is recognized in earnings.property, plant and equipment and depreciationproperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  the company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:building and building equipment20- 30yearsland and leasehold improvements10- 20yearsmachinery and equipment2- 13yearsthe company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use.  capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8years.the company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows.  when certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets.  if the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value.  if quoted market prices are not available, the company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.revenue recognitionthe company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer.  provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors.  rebates, which include medicaid, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served.  the company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information.  products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales returns accruals.  sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall.  the returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales.  in accordance with the companys accounting policies, the company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods.  the companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with u.s.gaap guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists.  sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value.  sales returns in the consumer and pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable.  sales returns for certain franchises in the medical devices  segment are typically resalable but are not material. the company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.  the sales returns reserve for the total company has been approximately 1.0% of annual sales to customers during the fiscal reporting years2015, 2014 and 2013.promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred.  continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs.  the redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value.  volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold.  the company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers.  these arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.      37shipping and handlingshipping and handling costs incurred were $996 million, $1,068 million and $1,128 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense.  the amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in, first-out method.intangible assets and goodwillthe authoritative literature on u.s.gaap requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment.  the company completed the annual impairment test for 2015 in the fiscal fourth quarter. future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions.  see note5 for further details on intangible assets and goodwill.financial instrumentsas required by u.s.gaap, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability.  fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  the authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with level1 having the highest priority and level3 having the lowest. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.the company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives.  the overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives.  the objectives of this strategy are: (1)minimize foreign currency exposures impact on the companys financial performance; (2)protect the companys cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3)ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4)manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions.  see note6 for additional information on financial instruments.product liabilityaccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable.  the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available.  the company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  as a result of cost and availability factors, effective november1, 2005, the company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance.  the company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. in addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. based on the availability of prior coverage, receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. as appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers.concentration of credit riskglobal concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. economic challenges in italy, spain, greece and portugal (the southern european region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the u.s. and other international markets.  the total net trade accounts receivable balance in the southern european region was approximately $1.3 billion as of january3, 2016 and approximately $1.8 billion as of december28, 2014.  approximately $0.8 billion as of january3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of december28, 2014 of the southern european region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the company's consumer, vision care and diabetes care businesses as well as certain pharmaceutical and medical devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns.the remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the southern european region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the pharmaceutical and medical devices local affiliates. the total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers       38were approximately $0.5 billion at january3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at december28, 2014.  the company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. for customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. the company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary.research and developmentresearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred.  upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval.  payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product.  amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.the company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property.  these arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities.  these collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution.  often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development.  amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the companys operations.  in general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:nature/type of collaborationstatement of earnings presentationthird-party sale of productsales to customersroyalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)*cost of products soldroyalties received from collaborative partnerother income (expense), netupfront payments& milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval)research and development expenseresearch and development payments to collaborative partnerresearch and development expenseresearch and development payments received from collaborative partnerreduction of research and development expense*milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of goods sold over the useful life.for all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.the company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including xarelto, co-developed with bayer healthcare ag and imbruvica, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with pharmacyclics llc, an abbvie company.advertisingcosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.  advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and internet advertising, were $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.      39income taxesincome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between u.s. gaap accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities.  the company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.  future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. the company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. the company follows u.s. gaap which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.at january3, 2016 and december28, 2014, the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $58.0 billion and $53.4 billion, respectively.  at january3, 2016 and december28, 2014, the company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $38.2 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively.  the company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. the company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. if the company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the u.s., the company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. the company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical.see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.net earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.use of estimatesthe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s.requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.  estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.the company follows the provisions of u.s.gaap when recording litigation related contingencies.  a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.  the best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.annual closing datethe company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the sunday nearest to the end of the month of december.  normally each fiscal year consists of 52weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53weeks, as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020.reclassificationcertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.      402.cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securitiesat the end of 2015 and 2014, cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities were comprised

 intangible asset write-downs are included in other (income) expense, net.see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.6.fair value measurementsthe company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency.  the company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings.  both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  additionally, the company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings.  these derivatives are treated as fair value hedges.  the company may use forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.  additionally, the company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.  these forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.  the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features or requirements to post collateral by either the company or the counter-party. on an ongoing basis, the company monitors counterparty credit ratings.  the company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions.  as of january3, 2016, the company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $31.2 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.the designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract.  at inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective.  changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.  gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur.  gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account and are insignificant.  on an ongoing basis, the company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items.  if and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.  hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings in other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps. for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest expense.  for the current reporting period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material.      43as of january3, 2016, the balance of deferred net losses on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $36 millionafter-tax.  for additional information, see the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and note13. the company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period.  the maximum length of time over which the company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts.  the amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.the following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the fiscal years ended january3, 2016 and december28, 2014:(dollars in millions)gain/(loss)recognized in accumulated oci(1)gain/(loss)

foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments.      fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability.  fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  the authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.  the levels within the hierarchy are described below with level1 having the highest priority and level3 having the lowest.the fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e. forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the u.s.dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate.  the company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  the company also holds equity investments which are classified as level1 and debt securities which are classified as level 2. the company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value.the following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:level1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.level2 significant other observable inputs.level3 significant unobservable inputs.the companys significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of january3, 2016 and december28, 2014 were as follows:      4420152014(dollars in millions)level 1level 2level 3totaltotal (1)derivatives designated as hedging

compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates.  additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. the increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the ortho-clinical diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the u.s., the accrual of an additional year of the branded prescription drug fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional u.s. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year.  these increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the conor medsystems divestiture.      47the 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with scios, inc., and the inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the research and development tax credit and the controlled foreign corporation look-through provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in january 2013 and were retroactive to january 1, 2012.the 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals courts decision in omj pharmaceuticals, inc.s litigation regarding credits under former section 936 of the internal revenue code (see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the companys u.s. internal revenue service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009.  the impact of the settlement is reflected in the u.s. tax on international income and the all other line items within the above reconciliation.  the items noted above reflect the key drivers of the rate reconciliation.temporary differences and carryforwards for

company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities.  the irs has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012.  in other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the years remain open generally back to the year 2004. the company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. however, the company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.the company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities.  interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.  the company recognized after tax interest expense of $44 million, $12 million and $40 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the total amount of accrued interest was $366 million and $298 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.      489.employee related obligationsat the

and other benefit plansthe company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide.  the company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible u.s.retired employees and their dependents.many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the company is not significant.retirement plan benefits for employees hired before january 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employees compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. in 2014, the company announced that the u.s. defined benefit plan was amended to adopt a new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after january 1, 2015. the benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee compensation over total years of service.international subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. the company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has elected to early adopt a practical expedient beginning for the fiscal year end 2015 to measure its defined benefit plans using the calendar month end closest to its fiscal year end. in 2015 and 2014 the company used december31, 2015 and december28, 2014, respectively, as the measurement date for all u.s.and international retirement and other benefit plans.net periodic benefit costs for the companys defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2015, 2014 and 2013

losses for the u.s.pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan.  for plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy.  the amortization of gains and losses for the other u.s.benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.  total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.prior service costs/benefits for the u.s.pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment.  prior service cost/benefit for the other u.s.benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment.the following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:retirement plansother benefit

determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments.  the resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. for the fiscal year 2016, the company will change its methodology in determining service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans liability cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate.   prior to this change in methodology, the company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations.  the company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis.  this change will not impact the benefit obligation and will not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results.the expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. the assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market. in 2014, for measurement of u.s. retirement benefit obligations, the mortality assumption was updated to a newly established 2014 mortality table resulting in an increase to the projected benefit obligation.      50the following table displays the assumed health care

pension protection act of 2006.  international plans are funded in accordance with local regulations.  additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans.  for certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. consequently, the company has several pension plans that are not funded. in 2015, the company contributed $435 million and $317 million to its u.s.and international pension plans, respectively.the following table displays the funded status of  the company's u.s. qualified &

pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans.  in determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency.  a majority of the companys pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans.  permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.  the companys retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2015 and 2014 and target allocations for 2016 are as follows:percent ofplan assetstargetallocation201520142016worldwide retirement plansequity securities79%77%74%debt securities212326total plan assets100%100%100%determination of fair value of plan assetsthe plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values.  fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available.  if listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.while the plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.valuation hierarchythe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.  the levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with level1 having the highest priority and level3 having the lowest.a financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.short-term investments cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank.  other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the net asset value (nav) provided by the administrator of the fund.  the nav is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.  the nav is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as level2.government and agency securities a limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.  where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within level1 of the valuation hierarchy.  if quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.  when quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as level2.debt instruments a limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.  where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as level1.  if quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as level2.  level3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.equity securities common stocks are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.  substantially all common stock is classified within level1 of the valuation hierarchy.commingled funds these investment vehicles are valued using the nav provided by the fund administrator.  the nav is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.  assets in the level2 category have a quoted market price in a market that is not active.      54insurance contracts the instruments are issued by insurance companies.  the fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer.  the underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities.  in general, insurance contracts are classified as level3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing.other assets other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt.  other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as level1, while inactively traded assets are classified as level2.  most limited partnerships represent investments in private equity and similar funds that are valued by the general partners.  certain of these limited partnerships, as well as any other assets valued using unobservable inputs, are classified as level3.the following table sets forth the retirement plans' investments measured at fair value as of december31, 2015 and

low prices of the companys common stock on the new york stock exchange on the date of grant. the fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table.  for 2014 and 2013 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 4-year daily historical average volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded johnson& johnson options with a life of 2years.  for 2015 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded johnson& johnson options with a life of 2years. for all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. the risk-free rate was based on the u.s.treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.the average fair value of options granted was $10.68, $8.42 and $4.88, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:201520142013risk-free rate1.77%1.87%1.01%expected

share units and performance share unitsthe company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. the company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of johnson & johnson common stock after the end of a three-year performance period.  whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. the number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted.       59a summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity

governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.the company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. as of january 3, 2016, the company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated.  the company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with asc 450-20-25.  for these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. the ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. in the company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position.  however, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.product liabilitycertain subsidiaries of johnson & johnson are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages.  while these subsidiaries believe they have substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation.  the company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with asc 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited.  the company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter. for certain of these matters, the company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damage and other losses. product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.the most significant of these cases include the depuy asr xl acetabular system and depuy asr hip resurfacing system, the pinnacle acetabular cup system, pelvic meshes, risperdal, and xarelto.  as of january 3, 2016, in the united states there were approximately 5,300 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the depuy asr xl acetabular system and depuy asr hip resurfacing system, 8,700 with respect to the pinnacle acetabular cup system, 46,700 with respect to pelvic meshes, 10,700 with respect to risperdal, and 5,000 with respect to xarelto.in august2010, depuy orthopaedics, inc.

(jbi).  in october 2013, kennedy, along with jbi, janssen inc. and cilag gmbh international (both affiliates of jbi), filed a counterclaim for infringement against celltrion healthcare co., ltd., celltrion inc. (together, celltrion) and hospira.  the counterclaim alleges that the products described in celltrions and hospiras marketing applications to health canada for their subsequent entry biologics (seb) to remicade would infringe the feldman patents owned by kennedy. discovery in the patent action is ongoing. trial has been scheduled for september 2016.in january 2014, health canada approved celltrions seb to remicade, allowing celltrion to market its biosimilar version of remicade in canada, regardless of the pending patent action.  in june 2014, hospira received approval for its seb to remicade. in july 2014, janssen inc. (janssen) filed a lawsuit to compel the canadian minister of health to withdraw the notice of compliance for hospiras seb because hospira did not serve a notice of allegation on janssen to address the patent listed by janssen on the patent register. in march 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby health canada agreed to a consent judgment setting aside hospiras notice of compliance, subject to health canada's right to appeal, which appeal was filed in june 2015. nevertheless, hospira began marketing a biosimilar version of remicade as a distributor under celltrion's notice of compliance.if any of the remicade related patents discussed above is found to be invalid, any such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the introduction of biosimilar versions of remicade. biosimilar versions of remicade have been introduced in certain markets outside the united states, resulting in a reduction in sales of remicade in those markets. the timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of remicade in the united states is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the fda and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the bpcia. in february 2016, the arthritis advisory committee of the fda recommended approval of celltrions investigational biosimilar version of       69remicade by a vote of 21-3 across all eligible indications in the united states. there is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of remicade following fda approval (subject to compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the bpcia), even though one or more valid patents are in place. introduction to the u.s. market of a biosimilar version of remicade will result in a reduction in u.s. sales of remicade.litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (andas)the following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications (andas) with the fda, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the united states, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of johnson & johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.  these andas typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the applicable patents.  in the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the andas expire before the united states district court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the fda, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. in addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents.prezistaa number of generic companies have filed andas seeking approval to market generic versions of prezista. in november 2010, tibotec, inc.
