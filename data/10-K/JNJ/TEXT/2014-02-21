GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

THE BUSINESS OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS CONDUCTED BY MORE THAN 275 OPERATING COMPANIES LOCATED IN 60 COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, WHICH SELL PRODUCTS IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER “— SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS — CONSUMER,” “— PHARMACEUTICAL” AND “— MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS.” HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THOSE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO THOSE DEVELOPED BY SUBSIDIARIES ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN COMPARABLE U.S. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL CLIMATE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY READILY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.  WHERE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, THE TEMPORARY UNAVAILABILITY OF THOSE RAW MATERIALS WOULD NOT LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION ON THEIR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES WHERE POSSIBLE. THEY OWN OR ARE LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS RELATING TO THEIR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES. SALES OF THE COMPANY’S LARGEST PRODUCT, REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB), ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9.4% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2013. ACCORDINGLY, THE PATENTS RELATED TO THIS PRODUCT ARE BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY.

THERE ARE TWO SETS OF PATENTS RELATED TO REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB). THE FIRST SET OF PATENTS IS CO-OWNED BY JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON, AND NEW YORK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER (NYU). JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC. HAS AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO NYU'S INTERESTS IN THE PATENTS. PATENTS HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (CERTAIN OF THESE PATENTS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED BY SUPPLEMENTARY PATENT CERTIFICATES), AND AUSTRALIA.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PATENT EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2018.  THESE PATENTS EXPIRED IN CANADA IN MARCH 2012. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THE PATENT HAS

BEEN EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 2015 (GERMANY, SPAIN, UNITED KINGDOM, SWEDEN, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, SWITZERLAND, DENMARK, FRANCE,

GREECE, ITALY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE NETHERLANDS). IN AUSTRALIA, THE PATENT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2017.

THE SECOND SET OF PATENTS RELATED TO REMICADE

®

WAS GRANTED TO THE KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF RHEUMATOLOGY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN EUROPE, CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES. JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC. HAS AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO THESE PATENTS WHICH EXPIRE IN 2017 OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND 2018 IN THE UNITED STATES. THE VALIDITY OF THESE PATENTS HAS BEEN

CHALLENGED AND IS CURRENTLY IN LITIGATION.

LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR REMICADE

®

IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED MARKETS MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN SALES.  JOHNSON & JOHNSON DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ANY ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE PATENTS RELATED TO REMICADE

®.

IN ADDITION TO COMPETING IN THE IMMUNOLOGY MARKET WITH REMICADE

®

, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY MARKETING STELARA

®

(USTEKINUMAB), SIMPONI

®

(GOLIMUMAB) AND SIMPONI

®

ARIATM (GOLIMUMAB), NEXT GENERATION IMMUNOLOGY PRODUCTS WITH REMAINING PATENT LIVES OF 10 YEARS.

THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS AND OF OBTAINING PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE MEANS. THESE TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS REFLECTS INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR ADVERTISING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY’S SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THIS ALSO INCLUDES PROTECTING THE COMPANY’S PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN CONTINUING RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY’S CONSUMER PRODUCTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES RELATE TO THE PROCESSES OF DISCOVERING, TESTING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATING PRODUCT EFFICACY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PRIOR TO LAUNCH. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WITH THE AIM OF DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS. WORLDWIDE COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $8.2 BILLION, $7.7 BILLION AND $7.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.  MAJOR RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE LOCATED NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO IN BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

ENVIRONMENT

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY’S COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO, HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

REGULATION

MOST OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG, DEVICE, DIAGNOSTICS AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, MANUFACTURING, ADVERTISING, LABELING AND SAFETY REPORTING. THE EXERCISE OF BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE "FDA") CONTINUES TO RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR FDA CLEARANCE OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE A SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE UNITED STATES, ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG PRICES AND PROFITS AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PARTICULAR DRUGS OR RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE PARTICULAR MEDICAL DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT FORCE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE UTILIZATION AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF HEALTH CARE GENERALLY.

FOLLOWING THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IN JUNE 2012 UPHOLDING THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (THE "ACA"), THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE PACE OF REGULATORY ISSUANCES BY THOSE U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DESIGNATED TO CARRY OUT THE EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACA.  THESE HAVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE U.S. HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY WITH MUCH REMAINING UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE ACA WILL ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE INDUSTRY.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS THAT MAY SUBJECT IT TO ACTIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY HAVE COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AND RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING ALL OF ITS PROPERTIES IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION AND REPAIR, AND THE FACILITIES ARE WELL UTILIZED.

MCNEIL-PPC, INC. CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER A CONSENT DECREE, SIGNED IN 2011 WITH THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA), WHICH GOVERNS CERTAIN MCNEIL CONSUMER HEALTHCARE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.  MCNEIL CONTINUES TO OPERATE THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN LAS PIEDRAS, PUERTO RICO AND LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA AND HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS, HAVING MET THE REMEDIATION COMMITMENTS AT THOSE FACILITIES.  THE COMPANY ALSO SUCCESSFULLY REINTRODUCED MANY PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY MADE IN FORT WASHINGTON, PENNSYLVANIA, FROM OTHER SITES.  PLANTS OPERATING UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A SIMPLIFIED PORTFOLIO FOCUSED ON KEY BRANDS.
