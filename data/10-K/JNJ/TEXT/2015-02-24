THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE MANY OF THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER “- SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS - CONSUMER,” “- PHARMACEUTICAL” AND “- MEDICAL DEVICES.” HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARY WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE CULTURE. THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INCLUDE NOT ONLY THOSE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO THOSE DEVELOPED BY SUBSIDIARIES ABROAD.

INVESTMENTS AND ACTIVITIES IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE SUBJECT TO HIGHER RISKS THAN COMPARABLE U.S. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND COMMERCIAL CLIMATE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY FINANCIAL INSTABILITY IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES, RESTRICTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM UNCERTAINTIES.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY READILY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES.  WHERE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, THE TEMPORARY UNAVAILABILITY OF THOSE RAW MATERIALS WOULD NOT LIKELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

PATENTS

THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION ON THEIR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES WHERE POSSIBLE. THEY OWN OR ARE LICENSED UNDER A NUMBER OF PATENTS RELATING TO THEIR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES. SALES OF THE COMPANY’S LARGEST PRODUCT, REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB), ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9.2% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2014. ACCORDINGLY, THE PATENTS RELATED TO THIS PRODUCT ARE BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY.

THERE ARE TWO SETS OF PATENTS RELATED TO REMICADE

®

(INFLIXIMAB). THE FIRST SET OF PATENTS IS CO-OWNED BY JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON, AND NYU LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER (NYU). JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC. HAS AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO NYU'S INTERESTS IN THE PATENTS. PATENTS HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN THE UNITED STATES, CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (CERTAIN OF THESE PATENTS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED BY SUPPLEMENTARY PATENT CERTIFICATES), AND AUSTRALIA.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE LATEST PATENT EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER 2018. THE PATENT EXPIRED IN CANADA IN MARCH 2012. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THE PATENT WAS EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 2015 (GERMANY, SPAIN, UNITED KINGDOM, SWEDEN, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, SWITZERLAND, DENMARK, FRANCE,

GREECE, ITALY, LUXEMBOURG AND THE NETHERLANDS). IN AUSTRALIA, THE PATENT EXPIRES IN AUGUST 2015.

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PATENT EXPIRING IN 2018 IS SUBJECT TO REEXAMINATION PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED BY A THIRD PARTY. THOSE PROCEEDINGS ARE ON-GOING.

THE SECOND SET OF PATENTS RELATED TO REMICADE

®

WAS GRANTED TO THE KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF RHEUMATOLOGY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN EUROPE, CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES. JANSSEN BIOTECH, INC. HAS LICENSES (EXCLUSIVE FOR HUMAN ANTI-TNF ANTIBODIES AND SEMI-EXCLUSIVE FOR NON-HUMAN ANTI-TNF ANTIBODIES) TO THESE PATENTS THAT EXPIRE IN 2017 OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND 2018 IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE VALIDITY OF THESE PATENTS HAS BEEN

CHALLENGED. CERTAIN CLAIMS HAVE BEEN INVALIDATED AND OTHERS ARE UNDER REVIEW IN VARIOUS PATENT OFFICES AROUND THE WORLD AND ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LITIGATION IN CANADA.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ANY ADDITIONAL EXTENSIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE PATENTS RELATED TO REMICADE

®

. LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN SALES AS BIOSIMILAR VERSIONS OF REMICADE

®

ARE INTRODUCED TO THE MARKET.

TRADEMARKS

THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE A PRACTICE OF SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS UNDER TRADEMARKS AND OF OBTAINING PROTECTION FOR THESE TRADEMARKS BY ALL AVAILABLE MEANS. THESE TRADEMARKS ARE PROTECTED BY REGISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE SUCH PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THESE TRADEMARKS IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESSES.

SEASONALITY

WORLDWIDE SALES DO NOT REFLECT ANY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF SEASONALITY; HOWEVER, SPENDING HAS BEEN HEAVIER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR THAN IN OTHER QUARTERS. THIS REFLECTS INCREASED SPENDING DECISIONS, PRINCIPALLY FOR ADVERTISING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.

COMPETITION

IN ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES, THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES COMPETE WITH COMPANIES BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. COMPETITION EXISTS IN ALL PRODUCT LINES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE COMPETING COMPANIES INVOLVED. COMPETITION IN RESEARCH, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY SOURCED, INVOLVING THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY’S SUCCESS IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THIS ALSO INCLUDES PROTECTING THE COMPANY’S PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN CONTINUING RESEARCH. IN ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY’S CONSUMER PRODUCTS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES RELATE TO THE PROCESSES OF DISCOVERING, TESTING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATING PRODUCT EFFICACY AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PRIOR TO LAUNCH. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WITH THE AIM OF DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS. WORLDWIDE COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $8.5 BILLION, $8.2 BILLION AND $7.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.  MAJOR RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE LOCATED NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO IN BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.

ENVIRONMENT

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY’S COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS DID NOT DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO, HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

REGULATION

MOST OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, AND THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD INCREASINGLY STRINGENT REGULATION. IN THE U.S., THE DRUG, DEVICE, DIAGNOSTICS AND COSMETIC INDUSTRIES HAVE LONG BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, PRIMARILY AS TO PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, MANUFACTURING, ADVERTISING, LABELING AND SAFETY REPORTING. THE EXERCISE OF BROAD REGULATORY POWERS BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE "FDA") CONTINUES TO RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE AMOUNTS OF TESTING AND  DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED FOR FDA CLEARANCE OF NEW DRUGS AND DEVICES AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE ALSO EVIDENT IN MAJOR MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

THE COSTS OF HUMAN HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE A SUBJECT OF STUDY, INVESTIGATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE U.S., ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON DRUG PRICES AND PROFITS AND PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE DOCTORS TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PARTICULAR DRUGS OR RECOMMEND, USE OR PURCHASE PARTICULAR MEDICAL DEVICES. PAYERS HAVE BECOME A MORE POTENT FORCE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRICING, APPROPRIATE DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE UTILIZATION AND THE QUALITY AND COSTS OF HEALTH CARE GENERALLY.

FOLLOWING THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IN JUNE 2012 UPHOLDING THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (THE "ACA"), THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE PACE OF REGULATORY ISSUANCES BY THOSE U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DESIGNATED TO CARRY OUT THE EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACA.  THESE HAVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE U.S. HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY WITH MUCH REMAINING UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE ACA WILL ULTIMATELY AFFECT THE INDUSTRY.

THE REGULATORY AGENCIES UNDER WHOSE PURVIEW THE COMPANY OPERATES HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS THAT MAY SUBJECT IT TO ACTIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES MAY DEEM IT ADVISABLE TO INITIATE PRODUCT RECALLS.

IN ADDITION, BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY HAVE COME UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, AND RESULTING INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS CARRY THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

FURTHER, THE COMPANY RELIES ON GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, AND PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESSES, THAT ARE COMPLEX, ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT SOURCING, SUPPLY AND PRICING OF MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, AND WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO LENGTHY REGULATORY APPROVALS.

THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY SEEK TO OWN THEIR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ALTHOUGH SOME, PRINCIPALLY IN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, ARE LEASED. OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES ARE OFTEN LEASED.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING ALL OF ITS PROPERTIES IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION AND REPAIR, AND THE FACILITIES ARE WELL UTILIZED.

MCNEIL-PPC, INC. CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER A CONSENT DECREE, SIGNED IN 2011 WITH THE FDA, WHICH GOVERNS CERTAIN MCNEIL CONSUMER HEALTHCARE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS (THE “CONSENT DECREE”).  THE CONSENT DECREE REQUIRES MCNEIL-PPC TO REMEDIATE THE FACILITIES IT OPERATES IN LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA, FORT WASHINGTON, PENNSYLVANIA, AND LAS PIEDRAS, PUERTO RICO. THE FORT WASHINGTON FACILITY, WHICH WAS VOLUNTARILY SHUT DOWN IN APRIL 2010, WILL REMAIN SHUT DOWN UNTIL A THIRD-PARTY CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES (CGMP) EXPERT CERTIFIES THAT ITS OPERATIONS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, AND THE FDA CONCURS WITH THE THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION. MANY PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY MADE IN FORT WASHINGTON HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO OTHER MANUFACTURING SITES AND SUCCESSFULLY REINTRODUCED TO THE MARKET. THE LANCASTER AND LAS PIEDRAS FACILITIES CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE DRUGS WITH THIRD-PARTY OVERSIGHT. THIRD-PARTY OVERSIGHT WILL CEASE ONCE THE FDA HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FACILITIES APPEAR TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. EACH FACILITY OPERATING UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE IS SUBJECT TO A FIVE-YEAR AUDIT PERIOD BY A THIRD-PARTY CGMP EXPERT AFTER THE FACILITY HAS BEEN DEEMED BY THE FDA TO BE IN APPARENT COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW.  MCNEIL HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ALL REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN THE CONSENT DECREE WORKPLAN FOR THE LANCASTER AND LAS PIEDRAS MANUFACTURING SITES AND HAS COMPLETED THE STEPS REQUIRED FOR THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION OF THE FORT WASHINGTON PLANT. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE THIRD-PARTY CGMP EXPERT SUBMITTED WRITTEN CERTIFICATION TO THE FDA FOR ALL THREE MANUFACTURING SITES. THE TIMELINE FOR COMPLETION OF ANY FDA INSPECTION IS WITHIN THE FDA'S DISCRETION. A DISCUSSION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THIS MATTER CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING “GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS - MCNEIL CONSUMER HEALTHCARE” IN NOTE 21 “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” UNDER “NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” OF THE ANNUAL REPORT, FILED AS EXHIBIT 13 TO THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.
