ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Johnson & Johnson, employing approximately 101,800 people worldwide, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. With over 190 operating companies, it conducts business in virtually
all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson's primary interest, both
historically and currently, has been in products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was organized in the State of New Jersey in 1887.

     Johnson & Johnson is organized on the principle of decentralized
management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the allocation of the resources of the Company.
This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of U.S. and international
companies related to each of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices &
Diagnostics businesses. Each international subsidiary is, with some exceptions,
managed by citizens of the country where it is located.

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS; GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

     Johnson & Johnson's worldwide business is divided into three segments:
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices & Diagnostics. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and
geographic areas captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition -- Segments of Business, Consumer,
Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices & Diagnostics and Geographic Areas" on pages 27
through 29 and 49 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareowners for fiscal
year 2001.

     The Pharmaceutical segment's principal worldwide franchises are in the
antifungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, dermatology, gastrointestinal,
hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, psychotropic,
urology and women's health fields. These products are distributed both directly
and through wholesalers for use by health care professionals and the general
public. Prescription drugs in the antifungal field include NIZORAL
(ketoconazole), SPORANOX (itraconazole), TERAZOL (terconazole) and DAKTARIN
(miconazole nitrate) antifungal products. Prescription drugs in the
anti-infective field include FLOXIN (ofloxacin) and LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin).
Prescription drugs in the cardiovascular field include RETAVASE (reteplase), a
recombinant biologic cardiology care product for the treatment of acute
myocardial infarction to improve blood flow to the heart, and REOPRO (abciximab)
for the treatment of
<PAGE>

acute cardiac disease. Prescription drugs in the dermatology field include
RETIN-A MICRO (tretinoin), a dermatological cream for acne. Prescription drugs
in the gastrointestinal field include ACIPHEX (rabeprazole sodium, sold outside
the U.S. as PARIET), a proton pump inhibitor for treating erosive
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), symptomatic GERD and duodenal ulcers;
IMODIUM (loperamide HCl), an antidiarrheal; MOTILIUM (domperidone), a
gastrointestinal mobilizer; and REMICADE (infliximab), a novel monoclonal
antibody for treatment of certain Crohn's disease patients. REMICADE is also
indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

     Prescription drugs in the hematology field include PROCRIT (epoetin alfa,
sold outside the U.S. as EPREX), a biotechnology derived version of the human
hormone erythropoietin that stimulates red blood cell production, which
accounted for 10.4% of the Company's total revenues in 2001. Prescription drugs
in the immunology field include ORTHOCLONE OKT-3 (muromonab-CD3), for reversing
the rejection of kidney, heart and liver transplants. Prescription drugs in the
neurology field include REMINYL (galantamine), TOPAMAX (topiramate) and STUGERON
(cinnarizine). Prescription drugs in the oncology field include DOXIL
(doxorubicin), an anti-cancer treatment, ERGAMISOL (levamisole hydrochloride), a
colon cancer drug, and LEUSTATIN (cladribine), for hairy cell leukemia.
Prescription drugs in the pain management field include DURAGESIC (fentanyl
transdermal system, sold abroad as DUROGESIC), a transdermal patch for chronic
pain; ULTRACET (tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen) for the short-term
management of acute pain; and ULTRAM (tramadol hydrochloride), an analgesic for
moderate to moderately severe pain. Prescription drugs in the psychotropics
(central nervous system) field include RISPERDAL (risperidone) and HALDOL
(haloperidol), antipsychotic drugs, and CONCERTA (methylphenidate) for Attention
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Prescription drugs in the urology field include
DITROPAN XL (oxybutynin) for treatment of overactive bladder. Prescription drugs
in the women's health field include ORTHO-NOVUM (norethindrone/ethinyl
estradiol) and TRICILEST (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol, sold in the U.S. as
ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN) group of oral contraceptives and ORTHO-PREFEST (17 (beta)-
estradiol/norgestimate) for hormone replacement therapy. In 2001, sales to three
distributors, McKesson HBOC, Cardinal Distribution and AmerisourceBergen Corp.
accounted for 10.4%, 10.3% and 10.2%, respectively, of total revenues. These
sales were concentrated in the Pharmaceutical segment.

MEDICAL DEVICES & DIAGNOSTICS

     The Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of
products used by or under the direction of health care professionals, including,
suture and mechanical wound closure products, surgical equipment and devices,
wound management and infection prevention products, interventional and
diagnostic cardiology products, diagnostic equipment and supplies, joint
replacements and disposable contact lenses. These products are used principally
in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals,
diagnostic laboratories and clinics. Distribution to these markets is done both
directly and through surgical supply and other dealers.

INTERNATIONAL

     The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by
subsidiaries located in 54 countries outside the United States, which are
selling products in more than 175 countries throughout the world. The products
made and sold in the international business include many of those described
above under "Business -- Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices &
Diagnostics." However, the principal markets, products and methods of
distribution in the international business vary with the country and the
culture. The products sold in the international business include not only those
which were developed in the United States but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad.

     Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are
subject to higher risks than comparable domestic activities because the
investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies
and political uncertainties.

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson's business are generally
readily available from multiple sources.

                                        2
<PAGE>

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business. However, it is believed that except for the patents
related to PROCRIT/EXPREX, no single patent or related group of patents is
material in relation to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under
trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. Johnson & Johnson's trademarks are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson &
Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business.

SEASONALITY

     Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.

COMPETITION

     In all its product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small, located in the United States and abroad.
Competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is
important to Johnson & Johnson's success in all areas of its business. This
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces. In addition, the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of Johnson & Johnson's consumer products involve heavy expenditures
for advertising, promotion and selling.

RESEARCH

     Research activities are important to all segments of Johnson & Johnson's
business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States
but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom. The costs of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide research activities
relating to the development of new products, the improvement of existing
products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental
regulations for the protection of the consumer amounted to $3,591, $3,105, and
$2,768 million for fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These costs
are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred. All research was
sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.

ENVIRONMENT

     During the past year Johnson & Johnson was subject to a variety of federal,
state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes
that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson's compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

REGULATION

     Most of Johnson & Johnson's business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the United
States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA")

                                        3
<PAGE>

continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation
required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase
in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends toward product and
process regulation are also evident in a number of major countries outside of
the United States, especially in the European Economic Community where efforts
are continuing to harmonize the internal regulatory systems.

     The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices. Even in the absence of new government regulation, managed care has
become a more potent force in the market place and it is likely that increased
attention will be paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and
medical device utilization and the quality of health care.

     The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject Johnson & Johnson to such actions as
product recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In
some cases Johnson & Johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Johnson & Johnson and its worldwide subsidiaries operate 148 manufacturing
facilities occupying approximately 17 million square feet of floor space.

     The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of Johnson &
Johnson's business approximately as follows:

     In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson &
Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world.
Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under "Business -- Research."

     Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse
facilities are often leased.

     Johnson & Johnson's properties are maintained in good operating condition
and repair and are well utilized.

Lease Commitments" under "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 37
of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareowners for fiscal year 2001.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The information set forth in Note 18 "Legal Proceedings" under "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 46 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual
Report to Shareowners for fiscal year 2001 is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which
the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the
opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the
Company.
