ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Johnson & Johnson, employing approximately 110,600 people worldwide, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. Through over 200 operating companies, it conducts business in
virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson's primary interest, both
historically and currently, has been in products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was organized in the State of New Jersey in 1887.

     Johnson & Johnson is organized on the principle of decentralized
management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources
of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments.
Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed
by citizens of the country in which it is located.

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS

     Johnson & Johnson's worldwide business is divided into three segments:
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and
operating results under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition" on pages 28 through 37 and 61 of Johnson &
Johnson's Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2003 (the "Annual
Report"), which is filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.

CONSUMER

     The Consumer segment manufactures and markets a broad range of products
used in the baby and child care, skin care, oral and wound care and women's
health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical
products. Major brands include AVEENO skin care products; BAND-AID Brand
Adhesive Bandages; CAREFREE Panty Shields; CLEAN & CLEAR teen skin care
products; JOHNSON'S Baby line of products; MOTRIN IB ibuprofen products; PEPCID
AC Acid Controller from Johnson & Johnson -- Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.;
NEUTROGENA skin and hair care products; SPLENDA, a no calorie sweetener;
STAYFREE sanitary protection products; and the broad family of TYLENOL
acetaminophen products. These products are marketed principally to the general
public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail
outlets throughout the world.

PHARMACEUTICAL

     The Pharmaceutical segment's principal worldwide franchises are in the
antifungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology,
gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
psychotropic (central nervous system) and urology fields. These products are
distributed both directly and through wholesalers and health care professionals
for use by prescription by the general public. Key products in the
Pharmaceutical segment include: PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as
EPREX), a biotechnology derived product that stimulates red blood cell
production; DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system, sold abroad as DUROGESIC), a
treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system; RISPERDAL
(risperidone) and RISPERDAL CONSTA [(risperidone) long-acting injection], for
treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia; REMICADE (infliximab), a novel
monoclonal antibody therapy indicated to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis; LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN (ofloxacin), both
in the anti-infective field; TOPAMAX (topiramate), an anti-epileptic; ORTHO EVRA
(norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system), the first contraceptive
patch approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); DOXIL (doxorubicin),
an anti-cancer treatment; DITROPAN XL (oxybutynin chloride), for the treatment
of overactive bladder; REMINYL (galantamine), for patients with mild to moderate
Alzheimer's disease; and NATRECOR (nesiritide), a novel agent approved for
congestive heart failure.
<PAGE>

MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS

     The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of
products used by or under the direction of physicians, nurses, therapists,
hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Ethicon's
wound care and women's health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally
invasive surgical products; Cordis' circulatory disease management products;
LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics'
professional diagnostic products; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and
spinal products and Vistakon's disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these
health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical
supply and other dealers.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

     The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by
subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the United States, which are
selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products
made and sold in the international business include many of those described
above under "Business -- Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and
Diagnostics." However, the principal markets, products and methods of
distribution in the international business vary with the country and the
culture. The products sold in the international business include not only those
which were developed in the United States but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad.

     Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are
subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment
and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and
political uncertainties.

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson's operating companies'
businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business. Sales of PROCRIT and RISPERDAL each accounted for
over 5% of Johnson & Johnson's total revenues for 2003. Accordingly, the patents
related to these products are believed to be material in relation to Johnson &
Johnson as a whole.

     During the next two years, EPREX, DURAGESIC and certain contraceptive
products have or will lose their basic patent protection and will be subject to
generic competition. The expiration of a product patent typically results in a
loss of market exclusivity and can result in a significant reduction in sales.
Sales of these products account for approximately 6% of Johnson & Johnson's
annual worldwide sales.

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under
trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. Johnson & Johnson's trademarks are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson &
Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business.

SEASONALITY

     Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.

COMPETITION

     In all their product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small, located in the United States and abroad.
Competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and

                                        2
<PAGE>

size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the
development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing
products and processes, is particularly significant and results from time to
time in product and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved
products is important to Johnson & Johnson's success in all areas of its
business. This competitive environment requires substantial investments in
continuing research and in multiple sales forces. In addition, the winning and
retention of customer acceptance of the products of Johnson & Johnson's consumer
businesses involve heavy expenditures for advertising, promotion and selling.

RESEARCH

     Research activities are important to all segments of Johnson & Johnson's
business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States
but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom. The costs of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide research activities
relating to the development of new products, the improvement of existing
products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental
regulations for the protection of the consumer amounted to $4,684, $3,957, and
$3,591 million for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These costs
are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred. All research was
sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.

ENVIRONMENT

     During the past year Johnson & Johnson companies were subject to a variety
of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson
believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson's compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

REGULATION

     Most of Johnson & Johnson's business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the United
States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA
clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense
of product introduction. Similar trends toward product and process regulation
are also evident in a number of major countries outside of the United States,
especially in the European Economic Community where efforts are continuing to
harmonize the internal regulatory systems.

     The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices. Managed care has become a more potent force in the market place and it
is likely that increased attention will be paid to drug and medical device
pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality of
health care. There is also uncertainty as to the impact of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act which was enacted in the
latter part of 2003.

     The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject Johnson & Johnson to such actions as
product recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In
some cases Johnson & Johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily.

     In addition, sales and marketing practices in the health care industry have
come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and state attorney generals
and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant
civil and criminal penalties.

     In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson &
Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world.
Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under "Business -- Research."

     Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse
facilities are often leased.

     Johnson & Johnson's properties are maintained in good operating condition
and repair and are well utilized.

     For information regarding lease obligations see Note 4 "Rental Expense and
Lease Commitments" under "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 45
of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Segment

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The information set forth in Note 18 "Legal Proceedings" under "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 55 through 59 of the Annual Report is
incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form
10-K.

     The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which
the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the
opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the
Company.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ON
                          FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of

     Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our

Note 18 for which the dates are February 5, 2004 and February 24, 2004,
respectively, appearing in the 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders of Johnson &
Johnson (which report and consolidated financial statements are incorporated by
reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also included an audit of the
financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2) of this Form 10-K. In our
opinion, this financial statement schedule presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements.
