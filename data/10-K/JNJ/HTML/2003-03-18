                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Johnson & Johnson, employing approximately 108,300 people worldwide, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. With over 200 operating companies, it conducts business in virtually
all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson's primary interest, both
historically and currently, has been in products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was organized in the State of New Jersey in 1887.

     Johnson & Johnson is organized on the principle of decentralized
management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources
of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of
domestic and international companies which span the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and
Medical Devices & Diagnostics segments. Each international subsidiary is, with
some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country in which it is located.

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS

     Johnson & Johnson's worldwide business is divided into three segments:
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices & Diagnostics. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and
operating results captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition -- Description of Segments -- Consumer,
Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices & Diagnostics and Operating Results" on pages 28
through 34 and 57 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareholders for
fiscal year 2002.

CONSUMER

     The Consumer segment's principal products are personal care products,
including nonprescription drugs, adult skin and hair care products, baby care

independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world.

PHARMACEUTICAL

     The Pharmaceutical segment's principal worldwide franchises are in the
antifungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology,
gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
psychotropic (central nervous system) and urology fields. These products are
distributed both directly and through wholesalers and health care professionals
for use by prescription by the general public. Prescription drugs in the
antifungal field include NIZORAL (ketoconazole), SPORANOX (itraconazole),
TERAZOL (terconazole) and DAKTARIN (miconazole nitrate) antifungal products.
Prescription drugs in the anti-infective field include FLOXIN (ofloxacin) and
LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin). Prescription drugs in the cardiovascular field include
RETAVASE (reteplase), a recombinant biologic
<PAGE>

cardiology care product for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction to
improve blood flow to the heart, and REOPRO (abciximab) for the treatment of
acute cardiac disease. Prescription drugs in the dermatology field include
RETIN-A MICRO (tretinoin), a dermatological cream for acne. Prescription drugs
in the gastrointestinal field include ACIPHEX (rabeprazole sodium), a proton
pump inhibitor for treating erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and
duodenal ulcers (from which the Company derives service revenue as this product
is co-promoted in the U.S. with Eisai); IMODIUM (loperamide HCl), an
antidiarrheal; MOTILIUM (domperidone), a gastrointestinal mobilizer; and
REMICADE (infliximab), a novel monoclonal antibody for treatment of certain
Crohn's disease patients. REMICADE is also indicated for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis.

     Prescription drugs in the hematology field include PROCRIT (epoetin alfa,
sold outside the U.S. as EPREX), a biotechnology derived version of the human
hormone erythropoietin that stimulates red blood cell production, which
accounted for 11.8% of the Company's total revenues in 2002. Prescription drugs
in the immunology field include ORTHOCLONE OKT-3 (muromonab-CD3), for reversing
the rejection of kidney, heart and liver transplants. Prescription drugs in the
neurology field include REMINYL (galantamine), TOPAMAX (topiramate) and STUGERON
(cinnarizine). Prescription drugs in the oncology field include DOXIL
(doxorubicin), an anti-cancer treatment, ERGAMISOL (levamisole hydrochloride), a
colon cancer drug, and LEUSTATIN (cladribine), for hairy cell leukemia.
Prescription drugs in the pain management field include DURAGESIC (fentanyl
transdermal system, sold abroad as DUROGESIC), a transdermal patch for chronic
pain and ULTRACET (tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen) for the short-term
management of acute pain. Prescription drugs in the psychotropics (central
nervous system) field include RISPERDAL (risperidone) and HALDOL (haloperidol),
and CONCERTA (methylphenidate) for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

treatment of overactive bladder. Prescription drugs in the contraceptive field
include ORTHO-EVRA (norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system),
ORTHO-NOVUM (norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol) and TRICILEST
(norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol, sold in the U.S. as ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN) group of
oral contraceptives. In 2002, sales to three largest distributors,
AmerisourceBergen Corp., McKesson HBOC and Cardinal Distribution accounted for
10.3%, 9.8% and 9.2%, respectively, of total revenues.

MEDICAL DEVICES & DIAGNOSTICS

     The Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of
products used by or under the direction of physicians, nurses, therapists,
hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Ethicon's
wound care, surgical sports medicine and women's health products; Ethicon
Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive surgical products; Cordis' circulatory disease
management products; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products;
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products; DePuy's
orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal products and Vistakon's disposable
contact lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets is done
both directly and through surgical supply and other dealers.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

     The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by
subsidiaries located in 54 countries outside the United States, which are
selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products
made and sold in the international business include many of those described
above under "Description of Segments -- Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical
Devices & Diagnostics." However, the principal markets, products and methods of
distribution in the international business vary with the country and the
culture. The products sold in the international business include not only those
which were developed in the United States but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad.

     Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are
subject to higher risks than comparable domestic activities because the
investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies
and political uncertainties.

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson's business are generally
readily available from multiple sources.

                                        2
<PAGE>

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business. However, it is believed that except for the patents
related to PROCRIT/EXPREX, no single patent or related group of patents is
material in relation to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under
trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. Johnson & Johnson's trademarks are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson &
Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business.

SEASONALITY

     Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.

COMPETITION

     In all its product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small, located in the United States and abroad.
Competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is
important to Johnson & Johnson's success in all areas of its business. This
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces. In addition, the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of Johnson & Johnson's consumer products involve heavy expenditures
for advertising, promotion and selling.

RESEARCH

     Research activities are important to all segments of Johnson & Johnson's
business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States
but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom. The costs of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide research activities
relating to the development of new products, the improvement of existing
products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental
regulations for the protection of the consumer amounted to $3,957, $3,591, and
$3,105 million for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These costs
are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred. All research was
sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.

ENVIRONMENT

     During the past year Johnson & Johnson was subject to a variety of federal,
state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes
that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson's compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

REGULATION

     Most of Johnson & Johnson's business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the United
States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA")

                                        3
<PAGE>

continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation
required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase
in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends toward product and
process regulation are also evident in a number of major countries outside of
the United States, especially in the European Economic Community where efforts
are continuing to harmonize the internal regulatory systems.

     The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices. Even in the absence of new government regulation, managed care has
become a more potent force in the market place and it is likely that increased
attention will be paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and
medical device utilization and the quality of health care.

     The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject Johnson & Johnson to such actions as
product recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In
some cases Johnson & Johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Johnson & Johnson and its worldwide subsidiaries operate 154 manufacturing
facilities occupying approximately 16 million square feet of floor space.

     The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of Johnson &
Johnson's business approximately as follows:

business.

     In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson &
Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world.
Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under "Business -- Research."

     Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse
facilities are often leased.

     Johnson & Johnson's properties are maintained in good operating condition
and repair and are well utilized.

     For information regarding lease obligations see Note 4 "Rental Expense and
Lease Commitments" under "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 44
through 45 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year
2002. Segment information on additions to Johnson & Johnson's property, plant

Shareholders for fiscal year 2002.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The information set forth in Note 18 "Legal Proceedings" under "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 53 through 54 of Johnson & Johnson's
Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2002 is incorporated herein by
reference.

     The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which
the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the
opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the
Company.

       PURSUANT TO RULE 13A-14 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

     I, William C. Weldon, certify that:

          1.  I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Johnson &
     Johnson (the "registrant");

          2.  Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any
     untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
     necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
     which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
     covered by this annual report;

          3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
     financial information included in this annual report, fairly present in all
     material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
     flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
     annual report;

          4.  The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible
     for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
     defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) for the registrant and we
     have:

             a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
        material information relating to the registrant, including its
        consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
        entities, particularly during the period in which this annual report is
        being prepared;

             b) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
        controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
        date of this annual report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

             c) presented in this annual report our conclusions about the
        effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on our
        evaluation as of the Evaluation Date;

          5.  The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed,
     based on our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the
     audit committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
     the equivalent function):

             a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
        internal controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability
        to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
        identified for the registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in
        internal controls; and

             b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
        other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
        controls; and

          6.  The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in
     this annual report whether or not there were significant changes in
     internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect
     internal controls subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation,
     including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies
     and material weaknesses.
