ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Johnson & Johnson, employing approximately 109,900 people worldwide, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. Johnson & Johnson has over 200 subsidiaries that conduct business in
virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson's primary interest, both
historically and currently, has been in products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was organized in the State of New Jersey in 1887.

     Johnson & Johnson is organized on the principle of decentralized
management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources
of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments.
Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed
by citizens of the country in which it is located.

SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS

     Johnson & Johnson's worldwide business is divided into three segments:
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and
operating results under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition" on pages 28 through 38 and 64 of Johnson &
Johnson's Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2004 which is filed as
Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.

CONSUMER

     The Consumer segment manufactures and markets a broad range of products
used in the baby and child care, skin care, oral and wound care and women's
health care fields, as well as over-the-counter pharmaceutical and nutritional
products. Major brands include AVEENO skin care products; BAND-AID Brand
Adhesive Bandages; CAREFREE Pantiliners; CLEAN & CLEAR teen skin care products;
JOHNSON'S Baby line of products; MOTRIN IB ibuprofen products; PEPCID AC Acid
Controller from Johnson & Johnson - Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.;
NEUTROGENA skin and hair care products; RoC skin care products; SPLENDA, a no
calorie sweetener; STAYFREE sanitary protection products; and the broad family
of TYLENOL acetaminophen products. These products are marketed principally to
the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and
chain retail outlets throughout the world.

PHARMACEUTICAL

     The Pharmaceutical segment's principal worldwide franchises are in the
antifungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology,
gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
psychotropic (central nervous system) and urology fields. These products are
distributed both directly and through wholesalers and health care professionals
for use by prescription by the general public. Key products in the
Pharmaceutical segment include: PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as
EPREX), a biotechnology derived product that stimulates red blood cell
production; DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system, sold abroad as DUROGESIC), a
treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system; RISPERDAL
(risperidone) and RISPERDAL CONSTA (risperidone long-acting injection), for
treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia; REMICADE (infliximab), a novel
monoclonal antibody therapy indicated to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease,
rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin) and
FLOXIN (ofloxacin), both in the anti-infective field; TOPAMAX (topiramate), an
anti-epileptic and migraine prevention treatment; ORTHO EVRA
(norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system), the first contraceptive
patch approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO
(norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a low dose oral contraceptive; DOXIL
(doxorubicin), a cancer treatment; DITROPAN XL (oxybutynin chloride), for
<PAGE>

the treatment of overactive bladder; REMINYL (galantamine HBr), for patients
with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; NATRECOR (nesiritide), a novel agent
approved for congestive heart failure; VELCADE (bortezomib), an oncology
treatment; and CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) a product for the treatment of
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS

     The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of
products used by or under the direction of physicians, nurses, therapists,
hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Ethicon's
wound care and women's health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally
invasive surgical products; Cordis' circulatory disease management products;
LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics'
professional diagnostic products; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction,
spinal and sports medicine products and Vistakon's disposable contact lenses.
Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and
through surgical supply and other dealers.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

     The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by
subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the United States, which are
selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products
made and sold in the international business include many of those described
above under "Business -- Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and
Diagnostics." However, the principal markets, products and methods of
distribution in the international business vary with the country and the
culture. The products sold in international business include not only those
which were developed in the United States but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad.

     Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are
subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment
and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and
political uncertainties.

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson's operating companies'
businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business. Sales of the Company's two largest products, PROCRIT
and RISPERDAL, each accounted for over 5% of Johnson & Johnson's total revenues
for 2004. Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be
material in relation to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.

     During 2004 and 2005, DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system) in the United
States and EPREX in international markets have lost or will lose their basic
patent protection and will be subject to generic competition. The pediatric
exclusivity for the DURAGESIC patent expired in the U.S. in January 2005. The
first generic version of DURAGESIC has been launched. Foreign patent protection
related to DURAGESIC will expire during 2005. The Company expects that DURAGESIC
sales will decline in 2005 as compared to 2004.

     During 2004, patents related to EPREX in certain international markets
expired. Generic competition will be limited in the near term due to the lack of
biologically equivalent compounds. Sales of DURAGESIC and EPREX accounted for
over 7% of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide sales in 2004. There are no other major
product patents that are scheduled to expire during the next 2 years.

     Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under
trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. Johnson & Johnson's trademarks are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson &
Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business.

                                        2
<PAGE>

SEASONALITY

     Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.

COMPETITION

     In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small, located in the United States and abroad.
Competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is
important to Johnson & Johnson's success in all areas of its business. This
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces. In addition, the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of the products of Johnson & Johnson's consumer businesses involve
heavy expenditures for advertising, promotion and selling.

RESEARCH

     Research activities are important to all segments of Johnson & Johnson's
business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States
but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada and the United Kingdom. The costs
of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide research activities relating to the development
of new products, the improvement of existing products, technical support of
products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of the
consumer amounted to $5,203, $4,684 and $3,957 million for fiscal years 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. These costs are charged directly to income in the
year in which incurred. All research was sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.

ENVIRONMENT

     During the past year Johnson & Johnson companies were subject to a variety
of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson
believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson's compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.

REGULATION

     Most of Johnson & Johnson's business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the United
States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA
clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense
of product introduction. Similar trends toward product and process regulation
are also evident in a number of major countries outside of the United States,
especially in the European Economic Community where efforts are continuing to
harmonize the internal regulatory systems.

     The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices. Managed care has become a more potent force in the market place and it
is likely that increased attention will be paid to drug and medical device
pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality of
health care. There is also

                                        3
<PAGE>

uncertainty as to the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act which was enacted in the latter part of 2003.

     The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject Johnson & Johnson to such actions as
product recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In
some cases Johnson & Johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily.

     In addition, sales, marketing and other business practices in the health
care industry have come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and
state attorney generals and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the
risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

     While the Company's affiliates do not sell any COX-2 inhibitor medicines,
the recent developments involving those medicines (such as Vioxx and Celebrex)
are likely to have implications throughout the health care industry.

     In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson &
Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world.
Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under "Business -- Research."

     Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse
facilities are often leased.

     Johnson & Johnson's properties are maintained in good operating condition
and repair and are well utilized.

     For information regarding lease obligations see Note 4 "Rental Expense and
Lease Commitments" under "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 46
of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Segment
information on Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment is contained on page 64
of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The information set forth in Note 18 "Legal Proceedings" under "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 56 through 61 of the Annual Report
is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on
Form 10-K.

     The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which
the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the
opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the
Company.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     Not applicable.

     Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     DISCLOSURE CONTROLS.  At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that the Company records, processes, summarizes and reports
in a timely manner the information the Company must disclose in its reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and Robert J. Darretta, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation,
Messrs. Weldon and Darretta concluded that, as of the date of their evaluation,
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

     INTERNAL CONTROL.  Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting is included in this Report on Form 10-K in this Item 9A. During the
fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2005, there were no significant changes in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

     MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  Under
Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the
Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.

     Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as
to the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

     Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has
inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with

                                        8
<PAGE>

respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     The Company's management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005. In making this
assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in "Internal
Control-Integrated Framework." These criteria are in the areas of control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication,
and monitoring. The Company's assessment included extensive documenting,
evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting.

     Based on the Company's processes and assessment, as described above,
management has concluded that, as of January 2, 2005, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting was effective.

     Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears in the "Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm" on page 63 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated
herein by reference.
