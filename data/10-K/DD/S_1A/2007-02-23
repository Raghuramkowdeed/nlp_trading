RISK FACTORS

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS

RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS

BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY

FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO THE COMPANY OR THAT THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES TO BE IMMATERIAL ALSO COULD AFFECT

ITS BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE

INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT

BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

PRICE

INCREASES FOR ENERGY COSTS AND RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND

GROW EARNINGS.

THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE

SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS

BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE

COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL

AND NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WHEN POSSIBLE, THE

COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE

COMPANY HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY

AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE INCREASES,

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS

IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH PRICE INCREASES IS

LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE

COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY

AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS COULD IMPACT THE

COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON

ITS ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THIS ABILITY

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW

PRODUCTS, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OBTAIN

RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS, OBTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS,

TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND INTENSE COMPETITION, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

DEVELOPING, OR COULD BEGIN TO DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, WILL

ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. SALES OF THE

COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS COULD REPLACE SALES OF SOME OF ITS

CURRENT PRODUCTS, OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF EVEN A SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCT INTRODUCTION.

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND

ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND

ANTITRUST CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY

SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES,

OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES.

VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT

ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT,

SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE

ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE

CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND

INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF

THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED,

THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND PAST

OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES,

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND

THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF

POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST

OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY

COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS,

THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. THE COSTS

OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS

WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS

UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANYS ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS

AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON

WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS

INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATION, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE

TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT

MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF

OTHER PRPS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM GENETICALLY

ENHANCED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY SEEDS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE,

GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND COMPETITION.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE

PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

SEGMENT. DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS

GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE

DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY

TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF CROPS GROWN FROM THOSE SEEDS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE

STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES SUPPORTING THE USE OF

BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION MARKETS. SPEED IN

DISCOVERING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING

PRODUCTS BASED ON THEM TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS

COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANYS EXISTING OR CANDIDATE

PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND LAWS OR WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF ITS TOTAL SALES AND THAT CONTINUED GROWTH AND

PROFITABILITY WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF U.S. AND

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS,

AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO CHANGES IN A COUNTRYS OR REGIONS

ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRADE REGULATIONS AFFECTING

PRODUCTION, PRICING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, LOCAL LABOR

CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS, REDUCED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY OR

LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES,

BURDENSOME TAXES AND TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS.

INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CHANGING SOCIAL

AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TERRORISM, POLITICAL

HOSTILITIES AND WAR, COULD LEAD TO REDUCED INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH SALES.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,

ECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING INFLATION AND FLUCTUATIONS IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES

COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY

HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THERE ARE A LARGE

NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL

SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY

ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES

AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE RISKS COULD HAVE

AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT THE

COMPANYS FUTURE REVENUE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

INCREASE COSTS AND EXPENSES.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, INCREASING

COSTS FOR ENERGY, TEMPORARY PLANT

AND/OR

POWER

OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND NETWORK

DISRUPTIONS, COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR

CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, THEY COULD RESULT IN REDUCED

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR

IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS

OR TO RECEIVE RAW MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS, CREATE DELAYS AND

INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND RESULT IN THE NEED TO

IMPOSE EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY

MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD CAUSE BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM OR

WAR, NATURAL DISASTERS AND SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS. DESPITE THESE

EFFORTS, THE IMPACT FROM BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INABILITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE COMPANYS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE

PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS

ARE IMPORTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN

PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL

CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND

TRADE SECRETS. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY ACCESS AND USE SUCH PROPERTY. WHEN

MISAPPROPRIATION IS DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH

SITUATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR

INVESTIGATION AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL

IMPACT.
