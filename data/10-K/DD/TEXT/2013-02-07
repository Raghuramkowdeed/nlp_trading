IS AWAITING ACTION ON ABOUT 20,925

WORLDWIDE PATENT APPLICATIONS.  IN 2012, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED ABOUT 935 U.S. PATENTS AND ABOUT 2,910 INTERNATIONAL PATENTS.  DUPONT'S RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, AND TO VARYING DEGREES, IMPORTANT TO EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

TRADE SECRETS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  MANY OF THE PROCESSES USED TO MAKE DUPONT PRODUCTS ARE KEPT AS TRADE SECRETS WHICH, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAY BE LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES.  DUPONT VIGILANTLY PROTECTS ALL OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INCLUDING ITS TRADE SECRETS.  WHEN THE COMPANY DISCOVERS THAT ITS TRADE SECRETS HAVE BEEN UNLAWFULLY TAKEN, IT REPORTS THE MATTER TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTION, AS APPROPRIATE.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT

,

WHICH MAY INCLUDE CIVIL ACTIONS SEEKING REDRESS, RESTITUTION AND/OR DAMAGES BASED ON LOSS TO THE COMPANY AND/OR UNJUST ENRICHMENT.

OWNERSHIP OF AND ACCESS TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PA

RTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GERMPLASM, WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT TO PIONEER AND ITS COMPETITORS.  THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER COMPETES IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE USE AMONG COMPETITORS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING PATENT LAWSUITS, TO GAIN ADVANTAGE IN COMMERCIAL MARKETS.  IN SUPPORT OF ITS BUSINESS, PIONEER CONTINUES TO BUILD A LARGE COLLECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS RELATED TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GERMPLASM AND TO LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM OTHERS, INCLUDING COMPETITORS.  PIONEER ENDEAVORS TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND GROW EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS, AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO EARNINGS IN 2012 AS COMPARED TO 2011.  IN 2011, PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS WERE ABOUT $2.0 BILLION AS COMPARED TO 2010. LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ESTABLISHING A PRICE ON CARBON COULD CREATE INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS AND PRICE VOLATILITY. WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES. THE COMPANY TAKES ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE INCREASES, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH PRICE INCREASES IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS AND MANAGE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OPERATING RESULTS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF CURRENT, NEW AND DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ITS ABILITY TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THE COMPANY PLANS TO GROW EARNINGS BY FOCUSING ON SOLUTIONS TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND FOR FOOD PRODUCTIVITY, DECREASE DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUELS, AND PROTECT PEOPLE, ASSETS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY DEVELOPS NEW PRODUCTS THROUGH MULTIPLE METHODS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INTERNAL RESEARCH, COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND LICENSING TECHNOLOGY OR KNOW-HOW. DEVELOPING AND MARKETING NEW PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS, OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION, OBTAIN TECHNOLOGY OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND INTENSE COMPETITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING, OR IN WHICH IT WILL INVEST TO DEVELOP, WILL ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. NOT CURRENTLY MATCHING INVESTMENT CHOICES IN NEW PRODUCTS WITH MARKET NEED AND COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. SALES OF THE COMPANY'S NEW PRODUCTS COULD REPLACE SALES OF SOME OF ITS CURRENT PRODUCTS, OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF EVEN A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT INTRODUCTION.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES SUPPORTING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY AGRICULTURAL AND BIO-BASED PRODUCTS. SPEED IN DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING RELATED PRODUCTS TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OR CANDIDATE PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES. COMPETITORS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITIONS AND THE OUTCOMES CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. IF CHALLENGES ARE RESOLVED ADVERSELY, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS AND GENERATE SALES FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NOTED A TREND IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NUISANCE SUITS BEING FILED ON BEHALF OF STATES, COUNTIES, CITIES AND UTILITIES ALLEGING HARM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED, THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PROCESS SAFETY AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ISSUES.

FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY MANAGE SAFETY, HUMAN HEALTH, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITIES, STAKEHOLDERS, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD IMPACT PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE AND INFLUENCE THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO MANAGE PROCESS SAFETY RISKS, ISSUES COULD BE CREATED BY EVENTS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, ACTS OF SABOTAGE AND SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANY'S EXTERNAL PARTNERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION COSTS. THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE MATTER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

MARKET ACCEPTANCE, GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND COMPETITION COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES SEGMENTS. THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CHARACTERIZE THE GENETIC AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF PIONEER SEEDS PROVIDES PIONEER WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE PLACEMENT OF THOSE PRODUCTS ON CUSTOMER PLANTED AREA. INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES LEVERAGES THE COMPANY'S BIOTECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES TO DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF ENZYMES AND BIOMATERIALS. THESE PRODUCTS ENABLE COST AND PROCESS BENEFITS, BETTER PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES TO A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES SUCH AS ANIMAL NUTRITION, DETERGENTS, FOOD MANUFACTURING, ETHANOL PRODUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS COULD BE IMPACTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF COMMODITY GRAIN GROWN FROM THOSE SEEDS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS LENGTHY AND COMPLEX WITH REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN VARY BY INDUSTRY AND BY COUNTRY. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDER REACTION TO ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED IMPACTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ON SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRES SUBMITTING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND DATA, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. THE ABILITY TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATORY AGENCIES IS ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SELL EXISTING PRODUCTS OR COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND LAWS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

SALES TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONSTITUTE ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S 2012 REVENUE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS TOTAL SALES AND THAT CONTINUED GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. SALES FROM DEVELOPING MARKETS REPRESENT 34 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IN 2012 AND THE COMPANY'S GROWTH PLANS INCLUDE FOCUSING ON EXPANDING ITS PRESENCE IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN A COUNTRY'S OR REGION'S ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRADE REGULATIONS AFFECTING PRODUCTION, PRICING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, LOCAL LABOR CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS, REDUCED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY OR LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES, BURDENSOME TAXES AND TARIFFS AND

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

OTHER TRADE BARRIERS. INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CHANGING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TERRORISM, POLITICAL HOSTILITIES AND WAR, COULD LEAD TO REDUCED SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

ECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING INFLATION, DEFLATION AND FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NET MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES, FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE RISKS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY IN THE FUTURE BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INSTABILITY IN CREDIT MARKETS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, VOLATILE EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER CHALLENGES THAT COULD AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION. FURTHER, SUPPLIERS COULD EXPERIENCE SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY. ADVERSITY WITHIN CAPITAL MARKETS MAY IMPACT FUTURE RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THUS RESULTING IN GREATER FUTURE PENSION COSTS THAT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS. FUTURE WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED BY BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS.

BUSINESS AND/OR SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, PLANT AND/OR POWER OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND/OR NETWORK DISRUPTIONS, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF SABOTAGE, EMPLOYEE ERROR OR OTHER ACTIONS, GEO-POLITICAL ACTIVITY, WEATHER EVENTS AND NATURAL DISASTERS COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT, DETECT AND RECOVER FROM SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS; VIRUSES; BREACHES DUE TO EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS; OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS COULD RESULT IN MISUSE OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS, BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, LOSS OF PROPERTY INCLUDING TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION, LEGAL CLAIMS OR PROCEEDINGS, REPORTING ERRORS, PROCESSING INEFFICIENCIES, NEGATIVE MEDIA ATTENTION, LOSS OF SALES AND INTERFERENCE WITH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL LOSSES TO DATE RELATED TO SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL NOT SUFFER SUCH LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES. AS THESE THREATS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, PARTICULARLY AROUND CYBERSECURITY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENHANCE ITS CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, PROCESSES, PRACTICES AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, SUCH EVENTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INABILITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING PATENTS, PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION, TRADE SECRETS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, TRADEMARKS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER FORMS OF TRADE DRESS, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS, THEFT AND CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, AND OTHER SECURITY BREACHES. WHEN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE OR COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS ARE DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH SITUATIONS TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION, AS APPROPRIATE, AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT.

OVERVIEW

PURPOSE

DUPONT IS A SCIENCE COMPANY.  WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO FIND SUSTAINABLE, INNOVATIVE, MARKET-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CHALLENGES, MAKING LIVES BETTER, SAFER, AND HEALTHIER FOR PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.

STRATEGY

THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR GROWTH IS TO APPLY ITS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS THREE CHALLENGES DRIVEN BY GLOBAL POPULATION GROWTH.

FEEDING THE WORLD

,

REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS

AND

KEEPING

PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT SAFE

.  CRITICAL AREAS FOR THE COMPANY'S GROWTH ARE INNOVATION, DIFFERENTIAL MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY.  APPLYING SCIENCE TO DELIVER INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AND NEW PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE GENERATES SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH.  DIFFERENTIAL MANAGEMENT IS A DISCIPLINED PROCESS TO PRIORITIZE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES ACROSS BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES ALIGNED WITH GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO ACHIEVE FIXED COST, WORKING CAPITAL AND VARIABLE COST PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH DISCIPLINED BUSINESS PROCESSES CALLED DUPONT INTEGRATED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT (DIBM) AND DUPONT PRODUCTION SYSTEM (DPS).  DIBM FOCUSES ON THE BUSINESS SUPPLY CHAIN TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY AND OPTIMIZE WORKING CAPITAL, WHILE DPS FOCUSES ON PRODUCTIVITY OUTCOMES TO ELIMINATE OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE LEAD TIME, CYCLE TIME AND QUALITY.  THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THERE IS A COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH.

RESULTS

IN 2012, SALES WERE UP 3 PERCENT AS STRONG INCREASES  IN THE AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION & HEALTH, AND INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES SEGMENTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES FOR THE REMAINING SEGMENTS, PARTICULARLY PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS. THE LATTER HAD FINANCIAL RESULTS REFLECTING A DECLINING BUSINESS TREND AFTER REACHING CYCLICAL PEAKS FOR SALES AND EARNINGS IN 2011 AND THE FIRST HALF OF 2012.  TOTAL COMPANY SALES GREW 6 PERCENT IN DEVELOPING MARKETS, WHICH INCLUDE CHINA, INDIA, AND THE COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA, EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.  SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO SALES GROWTH.  THE COMPANY EXCEEDED ITS THREE-YEAR 2010-2012 PLAN OF $1 BILLION FIXED COST PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS AND $1 BILLION WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY.

ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

DIVESTITURE OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS

IN THIRD QUARTER 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH FLASH BERMUDA CO. LTD., A BERMUDA EXEMPTED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY FORMED BY AFFILIATES OF THE CARLYLE GROUP (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "CARLYLE") IN WHICH CARLYLE AGREED TO PURCHASE CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSETS COMPRISING THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS FOR APPROXIMATELY $4.9 BILLION IN CASH AND THE ASSUMPTION OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES. ON FEBRUARY 1, 2013, THE SALE OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS WAS COMPLETED, RESULTING IN ABOUT $4.0 BILLION IN AFTER-TAX PROCEEDS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

ACQUISITION OF DANISCO

IN 2011, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED DANISCO IN A TRANSACTION VALUED AT $6.4 BILLION, PLUS NET DEBT ASSUMED OF $0.6 BILLION.  AS PART OF THIS ACQUISITION, DUPONT INCURRED $85 MILLION IN TRANSACTION RELATED COSTS DURING 2011, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN COSTS OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.  IN 2011, THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED FROM DANISCO CONTRIBUTED NET SALES OF $1.7 BILLION AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DUPONT OF $(7) MILLION, WHICH EXCLUDES $30 MILLION AFTER-TAX ($39 MILLION PRE-TAX) OF ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEBT ISSUED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION. DANISCO'S CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED A $125 MILLION AFTER-TAX ($175 MILLION PRE-TAX) CHARGE RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE STEP-UP OF INVENTORIES ACQUIRED AND SOLD DURING 2011.  SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

SALES INCREASED 3 PERCENT, REFLECTING A 3 PERCENT NET INCREASE FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES, PRINCIPALLY THE DANISCO ACQUISITION, AND 4 PERCENT HIGHER LOCAL PRICES, PARTLY OFFSET BY 2 PERCENT LOWER VOLUME AND A 2 PERCENT NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT.  THE 2 PERCENT DECLINE IN WORLDWIDE SALES VOLUME PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS HIGHER AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION & HEALTH, AND INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES VOLUME, MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME FOR THE OTHER SEGMENTS COMBINED, PARTICULARLY PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS.  HIGHER LOCAL PRICES WERE DRIVEN PRINCIPALLY BY INCREASES FOR SEEDS, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, AND SPECIALTY POLYMERS.  CURRENCY EFFECT PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE WEAKER EURO AND BRAZILIAN REAL.  SALES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS OF $11.9 BILLION IMPROVED 6 PERCENT FROM 2011, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES IN THESE MARKETS INCREASED TO 34 PERCENT FROM 33 PERCENT IN 2011.

SALES INCREASED 22 PERCENT, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING HIGHER LOCAL SELLING PRICES AND THE SALES ADDED FROM BUSINESSES ACQUIRED FROM DANISCO. LOCAL SELLING PRICES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE, SEEDS, FLUOROPRODUCTS AND ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, WITH THE LATTER REFLECTING PASS THROUGH PRICING FOR HIGHER PRECIOUS METALS COSTS.  WORLDWIDE SALES VOLUME INCREASED 1 PERCENT AS STRONG VOLUME GROWTH IN AGRICULTURE WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATIONS, PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS AND PERFORMANCE MATERIALS. THE DECLINES OCCURRED PRIMARILY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, RESULTING FROM DESTOCKING IN PHOTOVOLTAICS, POLYMER AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CHAINS, AS WELL AS WEAKER DEMAND FOR COMPANY PRODUCTS SUPPLYING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND CONSTRUCTION. VOLUME GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA WAS DRIVEN BY AGRICULTURE AND SAFETY & PROTECTION. SALES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS OF $11.2 BILLION IMPROVED 29 PERCENT FROM 2010, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES IN THESE MARKETS INCREASED TO 33 PERCENT FROM 31 PERCENT IN 2010.

IN 2012, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX PROVISION ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $622 MILLION, REFLECTING A MARGINAL DECREASE FROM 2011. THE INCREASE IN THE 2012 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED TO 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, IN ADDITION TO THE ABSENCE OF CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESS TAX PROVISIONS IN 2012 (EXTENDED RETROACTIVELY TO 2012 IN FIRST QUARTER 2013).

IN 2011, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX PROVISION ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $626 MILLION, REFLECTING AN INCREASE FROM 2010 LARGELY DUE TO PRE-TAX EARNINGS GROWTH, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY OF HEDGING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS.

CORPORATE OUTLOOK

THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2013 SALES AND EARNINGS TO BENEFIT FROM MODEST GROWTH IN GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION.  THE COMPANY’S MARKET POSITION AND FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ENHANCED BY MARKET-DRIVEN INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY.  RAW MATERIAL, ENERGY AND FREIGHT COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO HIGHER SEED INPUT COSTS AND TITANIUM ORE.  CURRENCY IMPACT FOR THE FULL-YEAR 2013 VERSUS 2012 IS EXPECTED TO BE FLAT.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS A DYNAMIC MARKET ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING STRONG AGRICULTURE DEMAND AND SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS RELATED TO THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE TITANIUM DIOXIDE INDUSTRY AFFECTING THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT.

SEGMENT REVIEWS

SEGMENT SALES INCLUDE TRANSFERS TO ANOTHER BUSINESS SEGMENT.  PRODUCTS ARE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN SEGMENTS ON A BASIS INTENDED TO REFLECT, AS NEARLY AS PRACTICABLE, THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS.  SEGMENT PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) (PTOI) IS DEFINED AS INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES EXCLUDING EXCHANGE GAINS (LOSSES), CORPORATE EXPENSES AND INTEREST.  ALL REFERENCES TO PRICES ARE ON A U.S. DOLLAR (USD) BASIS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY.  A RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT SALES TO CONSOLIDATED NET SALES AND SEGMENT PTOI TO INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010 IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL SPENDING, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DEBT MATURITIES AND OTHER CASH NEEDS. THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES, BILATERAL CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS AND ASSET SALES. THE COMPANY'S CURRENT STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RATINGS PROVIDE EXCELLENT ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, SPENDING AND CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED.  THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS.  DEPENDING ON THESE CONDITIONS, THE PROCEEDS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY BE INVESTED IN CASH EQUIVALENTS OR MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

PURSUANT TO ITS CASH DISCIPLINE POLICY, THE COMPANY SEEKS FIRST TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND, TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST

FOR GROWTH IS COMPELLING. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROVIDE PRIMARY LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ALL SHORT-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES IS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED AND EXPECTED TO BE UTILIZED TO FUND LOCAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT SOURCES OF DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY TO FURTHER SUPPORT ITS ASSUMPTION THAT UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 CAN BE CONSIDERED REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.  THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION IN UNUSED CR

EDIT LINES WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO MEET SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING LETTERS OF CREDIT.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DEBT PORTFOLIO AND OCCASIONALLY MAY REBALANCE IT TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND AN OPTIMUM DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE. IN 2011, THE COMPANY ISSUED $2.0 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES AND $1.0 BILLION IN COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF DANISCO.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ASSUMED $0.7 BILLION IN DEBT AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION, WHICH WAS REFINANCED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER.

THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS IMPACT ITS ACCESS TO THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKET AND COST OF CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION AND STRONG INVESTMENT-GRADE RATING.  THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $593 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER EARNINGS, LOWER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION PLANS AND THE WEAKER DOLLAR, WHICH WAS HEDGED WITH FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS REFLECTED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER INVENTORY.

CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $4.9 BILLION IN 2012 COMPARED TO 2011. THE DECREASE WAS DUE MAINLY TO THE ABSENCE IN 2012 OF THE COMPANY'S DANISCO ACQUISITION IN 2011.

THE $3.8 BILLION INCREASE IN 2011 WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE PAYMENT FOR THE DANISCO ACQUISITION, HIGHER EXPENDITURES FOR THE PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND A NET INCREASE IN PAYMENTS FOR FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACT SETTLEMENTS; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN INVESTMENTS IN SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $1.8 BILLION IN 2012 AND 2011, AND $1.5 BILLION IN 2010. THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2013 PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TO BE ABOUT $1.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $0.1 BILLION OVER 2012.

THE $2.2 BILLION CHANGE IN 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BORROWINGS IN 2011 TO FINANCE THE DANISCO ACQUISITION AS COMPARED TO A DECREASE IN BORROWINGS IN 2010.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO COMMON AND PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS WERE $1.6 BILLION, $1.5 BILLION, AND $1.5 BILLION IN 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.  DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK WERE $1.70, $1.64, AND $1.64 IN 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARED IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2013 WAS THE COMPANY'S 434

FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT NOT RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANIES DO NOT CALCULATE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THE SAME MANNER AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S FREE CASH FLOW DEFINITION MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGIES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND THEREFORE INDICATES OPERATING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND IS AN INTEGRAL FINANCIAL MEASURE USED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ARE TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MEASURING THE COST AND BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY AS OF DECEMBER 31

ST

. THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS APPROPRIATE. AS PERMITTED BY GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PLAN'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS, THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT 76 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BENEFIT PLANS IN THE U.S.  IN THE U.S. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE, APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY, AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

WITHIN THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERAT

ION. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED R

ETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.

IN DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS RATHER THAN ITS FAIR VALUE. THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS IS CALCULATED BY AVERAGING MARKET RETURNS OVER 36 MONTHS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY BE A LAG IN RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A

RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSES, LIABILITIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS DISCUSSED UNDER "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 AND IN NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE.  THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $436 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.  AS REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP PRECISE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER PRPS AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.  THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS.  THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ACCRUALS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT AND STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS, SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR MATTER.  PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES.  IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS.  THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED, INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING THE MATTER THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND THE MATTER'S CURRENT STATUS.  CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION ACCRUAL WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A COURT PROCEEDING.  IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF, BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNED ON APPEAL.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION MATTERS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING TAXES THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S TAX ASSETS AND TAX LIABILITIES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES OR DECREASES THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN RECORDING A

31

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE COMPANY HAD A DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE OF $7.8 BILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $1.9 BILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ASSETS.  SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE.

VALUATION OF ASSETS

THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE MEASURED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED, INCLUDING IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES, IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. THE DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF FAIR VALUE TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS BASED ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND VALUATION METHODOLOGIES REQUIRING CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATES BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION, CURRENT MARKET DATA AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED IN THE COMPANY'S VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES, OPERATING MARGIN ESTIMATES, ROYALTY RATES, AND DISCOUNT RATES. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATES WERE DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION, THOSE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S NORMAL ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS.  TESTING FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME.  THE DYNAMIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES OPERATE, AND KEY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTED SELLING PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS.  ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  CHANGES IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIME IN WHICH SUCH IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS TO ENSURE THEY ARE ACHIEVING THEIR GREATEST POTENTIAL AND ARE ALIGNED WITH THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY. STRATEGIC DECISIONS INVOLVING A PARTICULAR GROUP OF ASSETS MAY TRIGGER AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE RELATED ASSETS. SUCH AN ASSESSMENT COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. DURING 2012, THE COMPANY RECORDED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS CHARGES OF $275 MILLION TO WRITE-DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSET GROUPS TO FAIR VALUE.  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THESE CHARGES.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN 2012, NO IMPAIRMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS USING THE INCOME APPROACH BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  THE INCOME APPROACH HAS BEEN GENERALLY SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL MARKET TRANSACTION ANALYSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FORECASTED CASH FLOW AND REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH RATES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF THE ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UTILIZED ARE BOTH REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES (OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS). APPROXIMATELY 76 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS. PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE PENSION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.

THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE U.S. ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS, BUT RECEIVE BENEFITS IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS' ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. THE COMPANY MADE A CONTRIBUTION OF $500 MILLION IN 2010 TO ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE IN 2011. IN JANUARY 2012, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED  $500 MILLION  TO ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND ANTICIPATES NO CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE MADE IN 2013. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN BEYOND 2013; HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF ANY CONTRIBUTIONS  IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS.  U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $848 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS IN 2012 AND ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL MAKE APPROXIMATELY $340 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2013 TO PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRE-TAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $261 MILLION, $312 MILLION AND $321 MILLION FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $260 MILLION IN 2013. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS REFLECT THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS, DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER 2012, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS U.S. PARENT COMPANY RETIREE MEDICAL AND DENTAL PLANS FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. BEGINNING IN 2013, THE COMPANY IS REPLACING THE COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMPANY SPONSORED PLANS WITH A NEW COMPANY-FUNDED HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENT (HRA). MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE PLAN PARTICIPANTS WILL ENROLL IN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLANS IN THE OPEN MARKET AND THE COMPANY WILL REIMBURSE THEIR HEALTH CARE EXPENSES WITH AN HRA BASED ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMENDED PLANS. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE WAS REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $46 MILLION IN 2012. FOR 2013, THE PLAN AMENDMENT IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE BY ABOUT $120 MILLION.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE CHANGES IN THE PLANS NOTED ABOVE IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CHARGES RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $74, $72 AND $71 FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ABOVE CHARGES FOR PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2012 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DECREASE IN DISCOUNT RATES AND LOWER RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PLAN AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S U.S. PARENT COMPANY RETIREE MEDICAL AND DENTAL PLANS. THE INCREASE IN LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2011 IS PRIMARILY RELATED  TO THE DECREASE IN DISCOUNT RATES.  SEE "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" UNDER THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE 30 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE COMPANY'S KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND THE DISCOUNT RATE (SEE NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2013, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE BY ABOUT $30 MILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, PRODUCT HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  SUCH RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY THE IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY, AND THE COMPANY MONITORS THESE CHANGES CLOSELY.  COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTS VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, MINIMIZE THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WATER USE AND DISCHARGES, INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS.  MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A GLOBAL UPWARD TREND IN THE AMOUNT AND COMPLEXITY OF PROPOSED CHEMICALS REGULATION.  THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ENVIRONMENTAL OPERATING COSTS

AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY INCURS COSTS FOR POLLUTION ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROLS AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT, EMISSIONS TESTING AND MONITORING, AND OBTAINING PERMITS.

LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA OR SUPERFUND) OR SIMILAR STATE LAWS AT ABOUT 415 SITES AROUND THE U.S., WITH ACTIVE REMEDIATION UNDER WAY AT APPROXIMATELY 160 OF THESE SITES.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED ITS LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 175 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN "DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS" WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANY'S, REPRESENTED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT FIVE NEW SITES DURING

2012

COMPARED WITH SIX AND TEN SIMILAR NOTICES IN 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS, AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

.  HOWEVER, BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY LOSS, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ACCRUED, RELATED TO REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT ANY INDIVIDUAL SITE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

IN

2012

, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $85 MILLION IN 2013.

IN THE U.S., ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CAA.  UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

CLIMATE CHANGE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE THAT PRESENTS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES. EXPANDING UPON SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTIONS MADE IN THE PERIOD 1990-2004, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT ACHIEVING IN 2011 YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS OF EIGHT PERCENT IN GHG EMISSIONS AND NINE PERCENT IN WATER CONSUMPTION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ACHIEVED A YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTION OF 2.4 PERCENT IN 2011 IN ENERGY USE FROM NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES. THE COMPANY CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED DEMANDS OF A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY.  ABOUT $1.9 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S 2012 REVENUE WAS GENERATED FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT HELP DIRECT AND DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS GHG EMISSIONS.

THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC POLICIES TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AND ENCOURAGE LOWER CARBON FORMS OF ENERGY.  LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CONTROL OR LIMIT GHG EMISSIONS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ENERGY SOURCE AND SUPPLY CHOICES AS WELL AS INCREASE THE COST OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM FOSSIL FUELS. SUCH EFFORTS ARE ALSO ANTICIPATED TO PROVIDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THE REGULATORY FUTURE, HELP GUIDE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND DRIVE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR LOW-CARBON AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES.

36

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

AT THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL, THERE ARE EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE.  SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ARE REGULATED UNDER THE EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME.  IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., POLICY DEBATE CONTINUES.  THE CURRENT UNSETTLED POLICY ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.S. ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY TO BUSINESS DECISIONS PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IF IN THE ABSENCE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION, STATES WERE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS MANDATING GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS, THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS COULD BE COMPETITIVELY DISADVANTAGED BY THE ADDED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF STATE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

IN 2010, EPA LAUNCHED A PHASED-IN SCHEME TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS FIRST FROM LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES UNDER CAA PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. AS A RESULT, LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO INSTALL BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY ON MAJOR NEW OR MODIFIED SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS.  THIS TYPE OF GHG EMISSIONS REGULATION BY EPA, IN THE ABSENCE OF OR IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL LEGISLATION, COULD RESULT IN MORE COSTLY, LESS EFFICIENT FACILITY-BY-FACILITY CONTROLS VERSUS A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT INCORPORATES POLICIES THAT PROVIDE AN ECONOMIC BALANCE THAT DOES NOT SEVERELY DISTORT MARKETS.  DIFFERENCES IN REGIONAL OR NATIONAL LEGISLATION COULD PRESENT CHALLENGES IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR COORDINATED GLOBAL POLICY ACTION.

REGISTRATION

THE EUROPEAN UNION'S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK CONCERNING THE REGISTRATION, EVALUATION AND AUTHORIZATION OF CHEMICALS (REACH) ENTERED INTO FORCE IN 2007 AND REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS TO GATHER AND REGISTER INFORMATION ON THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR SUBSTANCES THAT MEET CERTAIN VOLUME OR TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA.  THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED REACH REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS INTO ITS SAFETY, HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT PROCESSES AND TIMELY MET ALL SUCH REQUIREMENTS TO DATE.  REACH ALSO CONTAINS A MECHANISM FOR THE PROGRESSIVE SUBSTITUTION OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CHEMICALS WHEN SUITABLE ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.  DEPENDING ON WHICH CHEMICALS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE REQUIREMENT TO USE SAFER ALTERNATIVES COULD NECESSITATE CHANGES IN PRODUCTION PROCESSES.

PFOA

THE PERFORMANCE CH

EMICALS SEGMENT USES A FORM OF PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT) AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE SOME FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS.  THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT USES PFOA IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS FOR PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS (AND SOME FLUOROELASTOMERS).  IN THE FALL OF 2002, DUPONT BEGAN PRODUCING RATHER THAN PURCHASING PFOA TO SUPPORT THESE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.  PFOA IS NOT USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FLUOROTELOMERS; HOWEVER, IT IS AN UNINTENDED BY-PRODUCT PRESENT AT TRACE LEVELS IN SOME FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS.

PFOA IS BIO-PERSISTENT AND HAS BEEN DETECTED AT VERY LOW LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION.  AS A RESULT, EPA INITIATED A PROCESS TO ENHANCE ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOURCES OF PFOA IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH HUMAN EXPOSURE TO PFOA IS OCCURRING. ALTHOUGH EPA HAS STATED THAT THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY REGARDING POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA, IT ALSO STATED THAT IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY REASON FOR CONSUMERS TO STOP USING ANY PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT PFOA.

DUPONT RESPECTS EPA'S POSITION RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPOSURE ROUTES AND THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF PFOA. DUPONT AND OTHER COMPANIES CONTINUE RESEARCH, EMISSION REDUCTION AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES TO HELP ADDRESS EPA'S QUESTIONS.  IN JANUARY 2006, DUPONT PLEDGED ITS COMMITMENT TO EPA'S 2010/15 PFOA STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM.  THE EPA PROGRAM ASKS PARTICIPANTS (1) TO COMMIT TO ACHIEVE, NO LATER THAN 2010, A 95 PERCENT REDUCTION IN BOTH FACILITY EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT CONTENT LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS AND (2) TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE ELIMINATION OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY NO LATER THAN 2015.  DUPONT HAS EXCEEDED THE EPA'S 2010 OBJECTIVE.  IN FEBRUARY 2007, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS COMMITMENT TO NO LONGER MAKE, USE OR BUY PFOA BY 2015, OR SOONER IF POSSIBLE.  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, DUPONT DEVELOPED PFOA REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGY AND IS CONVERTING CUSTOMERS TO FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS MANUFACTURED USING THE REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGY.  DUPONT HAS BEEN INTRODUCING ITS NEXT GENERATION FLUOROTELOMERS PRODUCTS AND CONVERTING CUSTOMERS TO THEIR USE.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE DERIVATIVES AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACTS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011, AND 2010, AND INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S PRO RATA SHARE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES' EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES AND CORRESPONDING GAINS AND LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE USD AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, AND THE EFFECT ON FAIR VALUES OF A HYPOTHETICAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE MARKET PRICES OR RATES THAT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011. THE SENSITIVITY FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS BASED ON A ONE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE MARKET INTEREST RATE. FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS SENSITIVITIES ARE BASED ON A 10 PERCENT CHANGE IN MARKET RATES.

SINCE THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE FOR EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD BE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE REPRESENTED MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC, INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY INDUSTRY AND REGION.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) AND ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP. THEIR REPORT IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

I.

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

II.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

III.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITIONS, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES MAY CAUSE VARIATION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, HAS AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A) (2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN "MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING" APPEARING ON PAGE F-2.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE BELIEVE OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY METHOD.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS OF VIES FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING THAT ARE VIES.  THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIES DOES NOT PROVIDE IT THE POWER TO DIRECT THE VIES SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES.  FUTURE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THESE VIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE COMPANY BECOMES THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS RELATED TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES IS NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR'S DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR'S PRESENTATION.  IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2012, THE COMPANY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS (WHICH REPRESENTED A REPORTABLE SEGMENT).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS AND FROM SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS FROM CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MAY NOT EQUAL THE TOTAL COMPANY EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS DUE TO ROUNDING. THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED AND SEGREGATED AS HELD FOR SALE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WHILE CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS AT PRIOR YEAR-ENDS HAVE NOT BEEN RECLASSIFIED AND PRESENTED AS SUCH. THE CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO PERFORMANCE COATINGS HAVE NOT BEEN SEGREGATED AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. AMOUNTS RELATED TO PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED IN OR EXCLUDED FROM THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM AND PERIOD OF EACH DISCLOSURE. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE FROM THE SALE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED, COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND PRICING IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD FOB (FREE ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO NON UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.) CUSTOMERS, AN EQUIVALENT BASIS.  ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT AND RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE (CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES) OR DEBT, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE, OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CU

STOMER.

LICENSING AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS DETERMINED USING LEVEL 2 INPUTS WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. BASED ON CURRENT INTEREST RATES FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENTS WITH COMPARABLE CREDIT RISK AND TIME TO MATURITY, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES ITS STATED VALUE OF

$2,026

AND

$1,932

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN

THREE

MONTHS AND UP TO

TWELVE

MONTHS AT TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED COST.  THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE INVESTMENTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WAS ESTABLISHED THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT'S LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FOR ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 1

–

QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2

–

SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G. QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ITEMS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ITEMS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND YIELD CURVES, AND MARKET-CORROBORATED INPUTS);

LEVEL 3

–

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD; IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH VALUATIONS ARE NOT IN EXCESS OF MARKET. SEED, CERTAIN FOOD-INGREDIENT AND ENZYME INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD, OR MARKET.

ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS CARRIED AT COST AND IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED UNDER THE SUM-OF-THE-YEARS' DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR METHODS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM

15

TO

25

YEARS. CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

5

TO

7

YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE FUTURE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARISING FROM OTHER ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIED AND SEPARATELY RECOGNIZED. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.

F-10

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED AND LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

20

YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSET ARE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE WHICH IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR USE UNTIL THEIR DISPOSAL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR MARKET VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. DEPRECIATION IS DISCONTINUED FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE, THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

25

YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, VEHICLE LIABILITY AND EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.

FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF RELEVANT RISKS.  A RECEIVABLE FOR AN INSURANCE RECOVERY IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LOSS HAS OCCURRED AND COLLECTION IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE.

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET, UNDER OTHER INCOME, NET. INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE U.S. DOLLAR OR LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, WHERE APPLICABLE. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES AND THE RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN EQUITY. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE REMEASURED INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD AND THE RESULTANT EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD.

HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET IN THE INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT OR AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION MATURES, OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AND THE DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE.

CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EITHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. CASH FLOWS FROM ALL OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 20 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

2.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ON AUGUST 30, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH FLASH BERMUDA CO. LTD., A BERMUDA EXEMPTED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY FORMED BY AFFILIATES OF THE CARLYLE GROUP (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "CARLYLE") IN WHICH CARLYLE AGREED TO PURCHASE CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSETS COMPRISING THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS FOR APPROXIMATELY

ON JANUARY 2, 2013, U.S. TAX LAW WAS ENACTED WHICH EXTENDS THROUGH 2013 SEVERAL EXPIRED OR EXPIRING TEMPORARY BUSINESS TAX PROVISIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THIS EXTENSION WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED (I.E. FIRST QUARTER 2013).

EACH YEAR THE COMPANY FILES HUNDREDS OF TAX RETURNS IN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXING JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND POSSIBLE CHALLENGE BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES. POSITIONS CHALLENGED BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED OR APPEALED BY THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES OR DECREASES THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

THE COMPANY AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION, AND VARIOUS STATES AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, THE COMPANY HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY INDEFINITE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW, AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF

OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES & OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE COMPANY HAD DIRECTLY GUARANTEED

$535

OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES.  THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY.

THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK BY ASSIGNING DEFAULT RATES BASED ON THE DURATION OF THE GUARANTEES.  THESE DEFAULT RATES ARE ASSIGNED BASED ON THE EXTERNAL CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY OR THROUGH INTERNAL CREDIT ANALYSIS AND HISTORICAL DEFAULT HISTORY FOR COUNTERPARTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE PUBLISHED CREDIT RATINGS.  FOR COUNTERPARTIES WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL RATING OR AVAILABLE CREDIT HISTORY, A CUMULATIVE AVERAGE DEFAULT RATE IS USED.

IMPRELIS

®

THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED CLAIMS AND BEEN SERVED WITH MULTIPLE LAWSUITS ALLEGING THAT THE USE OF IMPRELIS

®

HERBICIDE CAUSED DAMAGE TO CERTAIN TREES.  THE LAWSUITS SEEKING CLASS ACTION STATUS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION IN FEDERAL COURT IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA.  IN ADDITION, ABOUT

80

INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF APPROXIMATELY

180

PLAINTIFFS HAVE BEEN FILED IN STATE COURT IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS.  DUPONT HAS REMOVED MOST OF THESE CASES TO FEDERAL COURT IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA.

DUPONT AND LEAD AND LIAISON COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFFS IN THE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION SOUGHT PRELIMINARY APPROVAL FROM THE COURT OF A CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT; THE COURT SCHEDULED A HEARING ON FEBRUARY 5, 2013.  THE SETTLEMENT WOULD INCORPORATE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CLAIMS PROCESS AND PROVIDE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL RELIEF.  THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT CLASS WOULD INCLUDE AFFECTED PROPERTY OWNERS AND LAWN CARE COMPANIES WHO DO NOT "OPT OUT" OF THE SETTLEMENT. DUPONT WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO CANCEL THE AGREEMENT IF THE NUMBER OF “OPT-OUTS” IS UNSATISFACTORY TO DUPONT.  IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED, DUPONT WOULD PAY ABOUT

$7

IN PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES AND BEAR THE COSTS OF NOTIFYING POTENTIAL CLASS PARTICIPANTS. IN ADDITION, DUPONT WOULD PROVIDE A WARRANTY AGAINST NEW DAMAGE, IF ANY, CAUSED BY THE USE OF IMPRELIS® ON CLASS MEMBERS' PROPERTIES THROUGH MAY 2015.

IN AUGUST 2011, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED SALES OF IMPRELIS

®

AND IN SEPTEMBER 2011 BEGAN A PROCESS TO FAIRLY RESOLVE CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF IMPRELIS

®

.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE NUMBER OF UNASSERTED CLAIMS IS LIMITED DUE TO THE FACT THAT SALES WERE SUSPENDED IN AUGUST 2011 AND THE PRODUCT WAS LAST APPLIED DURING THE 2011 SPRING APPLICATION SEASON.

THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED REVIEW PROCESSES TO VERIFY AND EVALUATE DAMAGE CLAIMS. THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIABLES THAT IMPACT THE EVALUATION PROCESS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF TREES ON A PROPERTY, THE SPECIES OF TREE WITH REPORTED DAMAGE, THE HEIGHT OF THE TREE, THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR TREES TO NATURALLY RECOVER OVER TIME.  UPON RECEIVING CLAIMS, DUPONT VERIFIES THEIR ACCURACY AND VALIDITY WHICH OFTEN REQUIRES PHYSICAL REVIEW OF THE PROPERTY.

IN 2012 AND

2011

, DUPONT HAD RECORDED CHARGES OF

$575

AND

$175

, RESPECTIVELY, TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS, BRINGING THE TOTAL CHARGES TO

$750

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ADDITIONAL CHARGES COULD RESULT RELATED TO THIS MATTER.  WHILE THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY, TOTAL CHARGES COULD RANGE UP TO

$900

.  PREDICTING THE IMPACT OF IMPRELIS

®

ON LIVING ORGANISMS AND HOW THOSE ORGANISMS MAY REACT OVER TIME ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS DRIVING THE UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE CHARGES. IMPRELIS

®

WAS APPLIED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND THE ABILITY OF ANY PARTICULAR SPECIES OF TREE TO NATURALLY RECOVER OVER TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE PROPERTY'S GEOGRAPHY AND ASSOCIATED CLIMATE.  THE COMPANY HAS AN APPLICABLE INSURANCE PROGRAM WITH A DEDUCTIBLE EQUAL TO THE FIRST

$100

OF COSTS AND EXPENSES. THE INSURANCE PROGRAM LIMITS ARE

$725

FOR COSTS AND EXPENSES IN EXCESS OF THE

$100

. DUPONT HAS SUBMITTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR PAYMENT TO ITS INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, COMM

ERCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ANTITRUST LAWSUITS.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THEIR RESOLUTION WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.  HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED.

PFOA

DUPONT USES PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT), AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE SOME FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN WEST VIRGINIA.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, DUPONT HAS ACCRUALS OF

$15

RELATED TO THE PFOA MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE ACCRUAL INCLUDES CHARGES RELATED TO DUPONT'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND VOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS TO THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.  THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE SURVEYING, SAMPLING AND TESTING DRINKING WATER IN AND AROUND CERTAIN COMPANY SITES AND OFFERING TREATMENT OR AN ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER IF TESTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF PFOA IN DRINKING WATER AT OR GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY.

DRINKING WATER ACTIONS

IN AUGUST 2001, A CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED LEACH V DUPONT, WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT ALLEGING THAT RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR THE WASHINGTON WORKS FACILITY HAD SUFFERED, OR MAY SUFFER, DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER.

DUPONT AND ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN 2004 THAT BINDS ABOUT

80,000

RESIDENTS.  IN 2005, DUPONT PAID THE PLAINTIFFS’ ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES OF

$23

AND MADE A PAYMENT OF

$70

, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY HEALTH PROJECT.  THE COMPANY FUNDED A SERIES OF HEALTH STUDIES WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2012 BY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS (THE “C8 SCIENCE PANEL”). THE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY PROBABLE LINK EXISTS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE.

THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL FOUND PROBABLE LINKS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, INCLUDING PREECLAMPSIA; KIDNEY CANCER; TESTICULAR CANCER; THYROID DISEASE; ULCERATIVE COLITIS; AND DIAGNOSED HIGHER CHOLESTEROL (HYPOCHOLESTEROLEMIA).

A PANEL OF THREE MEDICAL EXPERTS WILL DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL MONITORING PROTOCOL, IF ANY, AS A RESULT OF THESE FINDINGS.  IF A MEDICAL MONITORING PROTOCOL FOR ANY OF THESE DISEASES IS DEFINED, DUPONT IS REQUIRED TO FUND A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM TO PAY FOR SUCH MEDICAL TESTING.  PLAINTIFFS MAY PURSUE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST DUPONT ONLY FOR THOSE HUMAN DISEASES FOR WHICH THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL DETERMINED A PROBABLE LINK EXISTS.  IN JANUARY 2012, THE COMPANY PUT

$1

IN AN ESCROW ACCOUNT AS REQUIRED BY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY'S TOTAL OBLIGATION TO PAY FOR MEDICAL MONITORING CANNOT EXCEED

$235

.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WATER TREATMENT DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PFOA IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER DISTRICTS, INCLUDING THE LITTLE HOCKING WATER ASSOCIATION (LHWA), AND PRIVATE WELL USERS.

AN OHIO ACTION BROUGHT BY THE LHWA IS ONGOING. IN ADDITION TO GENERAL CLAIMS OF PFOA CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER, THE ACTION CLAIMS “IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO HEALTH AND OR THE ENVIRONMENT” UNDER THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA).  DUPONT DENIES THESE CLAIMS AND IS DEFENDING ITSELF VIGOROUSLY.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

TWENTY-FIVE

LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AND

ONE

LAWSUIT ALLEGING WRONGFUL DEATH FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER ARE PENDING IN FEDERAL COURT IN OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA. DUPONT DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS IN THESE LAWSUITS AND IS DEFENDING ITSELF VIGOROUSLY.

WHILE DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO PFOA MATTERS IN ADDITION TO THOSE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR WHICH IT HAS ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS, A RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES, IF ANY, CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO CORRECT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR RELEASES OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET FORTH IN NOTE 1.  MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SUPERFUND), RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE AND GLOBAL LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE, REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED.  THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

18.  LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY OFFERS VARIOUS LONG-TERM BENEFITS TO ITS EMPLOYEES. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE THE PLANS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS

THE COMPANY HAS BOTH FUNDED AND UNFUNDED NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING A MAJORITY OF THE U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2007.  THE BENEFITS UNDER THESE PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. THE COMPANY'S FUNDING POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH PLANS ARE FUNDED BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH TRUSTEES, COVERED BY INSURANCE CONTRACTS, OR REMAIN UNFUNDED.

OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE PARENT COMPANY AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS, AND DISABILITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PROTECTION TO EMPLOYEES. THE ASSOCIATED PLANS FOR RETIREE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM COMPANY FUNDS. ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COST AND LIABILITIES FOR THESE RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY PLANS. THE NON-MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS CONTRIBUTORY WITH PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS' CONTRIBUTIONS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY TO ACHIEVE A 50/50 TARGET SHARING OF COST INCREASES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. IN ADDITION, LIMITS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF THE RETIREE MEDICAL COST COVERAGE.  BEGINNING IN 2013, THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING THE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS WITH A COMPANY-FUNDED HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENT (HRA).  THE MAJORITY OF U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS.

EMPLOYEE LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE INSURED IN MANY COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., SUCH PLANS ARE GENERALLY SELF-INSURED OR ARE FULLY EXPERIENCE-RATED. OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSES FOR SELF-INSURED AND FULLY EXPERIENCE-RATED PLANS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIGURES BELOW.

IN THE U.S., THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IN THE U.S. WAS SELECTED FROM WITHIN THE REASONABLE RANGE OF RATES DETERMINED BY HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.  FOR NON-U.S. PLANS, ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY.

PLAN ASSETS

ALL PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. ARE INVESTED THROUGH A SINGLE MASTER TRUST FUND. THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THIS TRUST FUND IS SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT, REFLECTING THE RESULTS OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSET LIABILITY MODELING. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GUIDING U.S. PENSION ASSET INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE THOSE EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE "PRUDENT EXPERT" STANDARD AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET LIABILITY STUDIES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCESS. U.S. PLAN ASSETS AND A PORTION OF NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. THE REMAINING ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT FIRMS UNRELATED TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S PENSION INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DISCRETION TO MANAGE THE ASSETS WITHIN ESTABLISHED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, PENSION TRUST FUNDS ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS "DERIVATIVES." DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS, HEDGE CURRENCY AND ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE TARGET ALLOCATION FOR PLAN ASSETS OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLAN IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

U.S. FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE WEIGHTED HEAVIER THAN NON-U.S FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE HEDGE FUNDS, REAL ESTATE AND PRIVATE MARKET SECURITIES SUCH AS INTERESTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL PARTNERSHIPS.

FAIR VALUE CALCULATIONS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR REFLECTIVE OF FUTURE FAIR VALUES. FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AT THE REPORTING DATE.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY'S RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN (THE PLAN), WHICH REFLECTS THE 2009 MERGER OF THE RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN AND THE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN. THIS PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE RETIREMENT SAVINGS BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

100 PERCENT

OF THE FIRST

6 PERCENT

OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION ELECTION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES

3 PERCENT

OF EACH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE'S ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION.

IN APRIL 2011, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO THE DUPONT EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP). THE EIP PROVIDES FOR EQUITY-BASED AND CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AND CONSULTANTS. UNDER THE AMENDED EIP, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR THE GRANT OR SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS IS

110 MILLION

SHARES, PROVIDED THAT EACH SHARE IN EXCESS OF

30 MILLION

THAT IS ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD THAT IS NOT AN OPTION OR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE

110 MILLION

SHARE LIMIT AS FOUR AND ONE-HALF SHARES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, APPROXIMATELY

60 MILLION

SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE COMPANY'S EIP. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (PSUS) WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK.

THE COMPANY'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, RSUS AND PSUS AND MAY AUTHORIZE NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE EXERCISE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2004 EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT; OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2008 SERIALLY VESTED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND CARRY A

SIX

-YEAR OPTION TERM. STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED BETWEEN 2009 AND 2012 EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. THE PLAN ALLOWS RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO RETAIN ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING GRANT DATE.

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AWARDS, THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE ASSUMPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2012, 2011 AND 2010 WAS

RSUS AND PSUS

THE COMPANY ISSUES RSUS THAT SERIALLY VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND, UPON VESTING, CONVERT ONE-FOR-ONE TO DUPONT COMMON STOCK. A RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE RETAINS ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE. ADDITIONAL RSUS ARE ALSO GRANTED PERIODICALLY TO KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. THESE RSUS GENERALLY VEST OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM

TWO

TO

FIVE

YEARS. THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL STOCK-SETTLED RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT DATE.

THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTS PSUS TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP. IN

2012

, THERE WERE

233,422

PSUS GRANTED. VESTING FOR PSUS GRANTED IN

2010

,

2011

AND

2012

IS EQUALLY BASED UPON CORPORATE REVENUE GROWTH RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES AND TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES. PERFORMANCE AND PAYOUTS ARE DETERMINED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EACH METRIC. THE ACTUAL AWARD, DELIVERED AS DUPONT COMMON STOCK, CAN RANGE FROM

ZERO PERCENT

TO

200 PERCENT

OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT. THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE PSUS GRANTED IN

2012

, SUBJECT TO THE TSR METRIC, WAS

20.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS.  THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS TO BE UTILIZED FOR FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT.  THESE PROGRAMS REFLECT VARYING LEVELS OF EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK.

DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS HAVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS AND ARE APPROVED BY THE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED ARE FORWARDS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES ALSO ADDRESS COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, LIMITS AND ROUTINE EXPOSURE MONITORING AND REPORTING.  THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES.  THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES COLLATERAL SUPPORT ANNEX AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSSES.  THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS AND THEREFORE NO MATERIAL LOSS IS EXPECTED.  MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.  THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR.  INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS COPPER, CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.  THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

CASH FLOW HEDGES

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FORWARDS AND OPTIONS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS, TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND AGRICULTURE COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

TREASURY RATE CONTRACTS

DURIN

G

2010

, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO TREASURY RATE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO TREASURY RATES ON A PORTION OF PLANNED BOND ISSUANCES. THE CONTRACTS WERE TERMINATED AT THE TIME THE BONDS WERE ISSUED PRIOR TO YEAR END.

WHILE EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD, MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR PERIOD.  CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ARE MINIMIZED.  THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING; HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INTENDS TO ACHIEVE A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON LONG-TERM INTERCOMPANY LOANS.

IN

2012

, THE COMPANY INITIATED A PROGRAM TO UTILIZE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.
