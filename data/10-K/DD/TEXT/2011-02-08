ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

DUPONT WAS FOUNDED IN 1802 AND WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1915. DUPONT IS A WORLD LEADER IN SCIENCE AND INNOVATION ACROSS A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL

BIOTECHNOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, BIOLOGY, MATERIALS SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING. THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBALLY AND OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MARKETS INCLUDING AGRICULTURE AND

FOOD, BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION, ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS, GENERAL INDUSTRIAL, AND TRANSPORTATION. TOTAL WORLDWIDE EMPLOYMENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WAS APPROXIMATELY 60,000 PEOPLE.

THE

COMPANY CONSISTS OF 13 BUSINESSES WHICH ARE AGGREGATED INTO SEVEN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES,

END-USE MARKETS, CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION, ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS, PERFORMANCE

CHEMICALS, PERFORMANCE COATINGS, PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, SAFETY & PROTECTION, AND PHARMACEUTICALS. THE COMPANY INCLUDES CERTAIN EMBRYONIC BUSINESSES NOT INCLUDED IN THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SUCH

AS APPLIED BIOSCIENCES, AND NONALIGNED BUSINESSES IN OTHER.

THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS IN MORE THAN 90 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND ABOUT 65 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES ARE MADE TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.). SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OF DUPONT CONDUCT MANUFACTURING, SEED PRODUCTION, OR SELLING ACTIVITIES AND SOME ARE DISTRIBUTORS OF PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY.

ACQUISITION OF DANISCO

IN JANUARY 2011, DUPONT AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, DUPONT DENMARK HOLDING APS, ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF

DANISCO A/S (DANISCO) FOR $6.3 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDES $5.8 BILLION IN CASH AND THE ASSUMPTION OF $500 MILLION OF DANISCO'S NET DEBT. THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY

CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS AND THE TENDER OF MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF DANISCO'S SHARES IN THE TENDER OFFER. DUPONT HAS THE RIGHT TO WAIVE SUCH TENDER OFFER

CONDITIONS AND ACCEPT A LESSER NUMBER OF SHARES IN CERTAIN CASES. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2011.

DANISCO

IS A LEADING TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN ORGANIZATION, WITH OUTSTANDING RESEARCH AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES IN BIOTECHNOLOGY. DANISCO HAS SPECIALTY FOOD INGREDIENTS, INCLUDING ENABLERS,

CULTURES AND SWEETENERS, WHICH GENERATE ABOUT 65 PERCENT OF ITS TOTAL SALES. GENENCOR, ITS ENZYMES DIVISION, REPRESENTS ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF ITS TOTAL SALES. DUPONT AND DANISCO ARE JOINT

VENTURE PARTNERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL TECHNOLOGY. (SEE APPLIED BIOSCIENCES BUSINESS DISCUSSION ON PAGE 34 FOR MORE INFORMATION.) DANISCO HAS NEARLY 7,000 EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY

WITH OPERATIONS IN 23 COUNTRIES. UPON COMPLETION, THE TRANSACTION WOULD ESTABLISH DUPONT AS A CLEAR LEADER IN INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY WITH SCIENCE-INTENSIVE INNOVATIONS THAT ADDRESS GLOBAL CHALLENGES

IN FOOD PRODUCTION AND REDUCED FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION.

SOURCES OF SUPPLY

THE COMPANY UTILIZES NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS INTERNAL SOURCES TO SUPPLY A WIDE RANGE OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT.

TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR FUELS AND MANY RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS. LARGE VOLUME PURCHASES ARE GENERALLY PROCURED UNDER COMPETITIVELY

PRICED SUPPLY CONTRACTS.

THE

COMPANY'S WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, PIONEER HI-BRED INTERNATIONAL, INC. (PIONEER), OPERATES IN THE SEED INDUSTRY AND HAS SEED PRODUCTION FACILITIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

SEED PRODUCTION IS PERFORMED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY OR CONTRACTED WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS AND CONDITIONERS. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE SEEDS PRIMARILY DEPENDS UPON WEATHER CONDITIONS AND

AVAILABILITY OF RELIABLE CONTRACT GROWERS.

THE

MAJOR COMMODITIES, RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES FOR THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IN 2010 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION.

BENZENE

AND CARBAMIC ACID RELATED INTERMEDIATES; COPPER; INSECT CONTROL PRODUCTS; NATURAL GAS; SOYBEANS; SOY FLAKE; SOY LECITHIN; SULFONAMIDES; CORN AND SOYBEAN SEEDS

HYZAAR® ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS, WHICH ARE MANUFACTURED AND DISTRIBUTED BY MERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP., A SUBSIDIARY OF MERCK & CO., INC. (MERCK).

BACKLOG

IN GENERAL THE COMPANY DOES NOT MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS AGAINST A BACKLOG OF ORDERS AND DOES NOT CONSIDER BACKLOG TO BE A SIGNIFICANT INDICATOR OF

THE LEVEL OF FUTURE SALES ACTIVITY. PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF INCOMING ORDERS AS WELL AS PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE DEMAND. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BACKLOG

INFORMATION IS NOT MATERIAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS OVERALL BUSINESS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

DUPONT BELIEVES THAT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATE PROVIDES IT WITH AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IT HAS AN ESTABLISHED GLOBAL NETWORK OF

ATTORNEYS, AS WELL AS BRANDING, ADVERTISING AND LICENSING PROFESSIONALS, TO PROCURE, MAINTAIN, PROTECT, ENHANCE AND GAIN VALUE FROM THIS ESTATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS,

THE

COMPANY HAS A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF AND IS LICENSED UNDER VARIOUS PATENTS. THESE DEFINITE-LIVED PATENTS COVER MANY PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USES. THESE PATENTS PROTECT MANY ASPECTS OF THE

COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND THE GOODS AND SERVICES IT SELLS. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THESE PATENTS VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND DEPENDS UPON THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE OF

EACH INDIVIDUAL PATENT AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY. DUPONT OWNS ABOUT 17,600 WORLDWIDE PATENTS AND 17,300 WORLDWIDE

PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN 2010, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED ABOUT 700 U.S. PATENTS AND ABOUT 1,400 INTERNATIONAL PATENTS. DUPONT'S RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND

SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, AND TO VARYING DEGREES, IMPORTANT TO EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

THE

ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER COMPETES HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE USE AMONG COMPETITORS OF NEW PATENTS, PATENT POSITIONS AND PATENT LAWSUITS TO GAIN ADVANTAGE IN COMMERCIAL MARKETS. OWNERSHIP OF

AND ACCESS TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GERMPLASM, WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT TO PIONEER AND ITS COMPETITORS. PIONEER HAS A LARGE COLLECTION OF

PATENTS RELATED TO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GERMPLASM AND ALSO LICENSES TECHNOLOGY FROM OTHERS. PIONEER WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT COMPETES THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS THAT

INCLUDES PROTECTING AND ENFORCING ITS OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CHALLENGING CLAIMS MADE BY OTHERS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, OBTAINING LICENSES TO IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS. DURING 2007, PIONEER ENTERED INTO A BUSINESS AGREEMENT ON CORN HERBICIDE TOLERANCE AND INSECT CONTROL TRAIT TECHNOLOGIES WITH MONSANTO COMPANY (MONSANTO). AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS,

MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE EXISTING CORN LICENSE AGREEMENTS; BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN NON-ASSERT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND BOTH PARTIES OBTAINED RIGHTS

TO REFERENCE AND ACCESS CERTAIN REGULATORY DATA AND APPROVALS IN WHICH THE OTHER HAS CERTAIN INTERESTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE PIONEER BUSINESS DISCUSSION BEGINNING ON PAGE 26 AND THE

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE ON PAGE 39.

THE

COMPANY HAS ABOUT 2,000 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 19,000 REGISTRATIONS FOR THESE TRADEMARKS WORLDWIDE. OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE

TRADEMARKS ARE CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED. THE COMPANY HAS MANY TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL AND/OR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS LEVEL. SIGNIFICANT

TRADEMARKS AT THE CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL INCLUDE THE DUPONT OVAL AND DUPONT (THE "DUPONT BRAND TRADEMARKS"); PIONEER® BRAND SEEDS; TEFLON® FLUOROPOLYMERS, FILMS,

FABRIC PROTECTORS, FIBERS AND DISPERSIONS; CORIAN® SURFACES; KEVLAR® HIGH STRENGTH MATERIAL; NOMEX® THERMAL RESISTANT MATERIAL AND TYVEK® PROTECTIVE

MATERIAL. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY PURSUES LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED TRADEMARKS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL.

SEASONALITY

SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL CROPPING AND WEATHER PATTERNS. SALES AND

EARNINGS PERFORMANCE IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT IS STRONGEST IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE SEGMENT GENERALLY OPERATES AT A LOSS DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE

YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THE SEASONAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS, AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION'S INVENTORY IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR AND IS SOLD DOWN IN THE FIRST AND SECOND

QUARTERS. TRADE RECEIVABLES IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT ARE AT A LOW POINT AT YEAR-END AND INCREASE THROUGH THE SELLING SEASON TO PEAK AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER.

IN

GENERAL, BUSINESSES IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS.

MARKETING

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT, MOST PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH DUPONT'S SALES

FORCE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME REGIONS, MORE EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. PIONEER OWNS OR USES A NUMBER OF BRANDS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND PROMOTES THEM THROUGH MULTIPLE MARKETING CHANNELS

AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE CORN AND SOYBEAN MARKETS OF THE U.S. CORN BELT, PIONEER® BRAND PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH A SPECIALIZED FORCE OF INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES. PRODUCTS THAT

ARE CO-BRANDED OR MARKETED UNDER OTHER PIONEER OWNED BRANDS ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THIS REGION BY SELECT SEED COMPANIES. (SEE PAGE 27 FOR A DISCUSSION OF PIONEER'S

PROACCESS

SM

BUSINESS STRATEGY.) IN OTHER NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS, PIONEER® PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND CROP INPUT RETAILERS. PIONEER® PRODUCTS

OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA ARE MARKETED THROUGH A NETWORK OF SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND INDEPENDENT PRODUCER-DISTRIBUTORS. SIMILARLY, CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED AND SOLD TO GROWERS AND

OTHER END USERS THROUGH A NETWORK OF WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS AND CROP INPUT RETAILERS. SOLAE®

ISOLATED

AND FUNCTIONAL SOY PROTEINS ARE MARKETED USING A COMBINATION OF OUTSIDE DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIRECT SALES.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, COLLECTIVELY, PERFORMANCE COATINGS AND

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS HAVE SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. THE COMPANY HAS LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS

WITH THESE CUSTOMERS AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE SEGMENTS' OPERATING RESULTS.

COMPETITION

AS A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BASED COMPANY, DUPONT COMPETES ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS PRODUCT QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OR SPECIFICATIONS,

CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY, PRICE, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICULAR MARKET INVOLVED AND THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDED.

MAJOR

COMPETITORS INCLUDE DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES PRINCIPALLY BASED IN THE U.S., WESTERN EUROPE, JAPAN, CHINA, KOREA AND INDIA. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COMPETITORS OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF

PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL, COMMODITY AND SPECIALTY CHEMICALS TO PLASTICS, FIBERS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES IN CERTAIN MARKETS WITH SMALLER, MORE SPECIALIZED FIRMS WHO OFFER A

NARROW RANGE OF PRODUCTS OR CONVERTED PRODUCTS THAT FUNCTIONALLY COMPETE WITH THE COMPANY'S OFFERINGS.

PIONEER

SELLS ADVANCED PLANT GENETICS, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF CORN AND SOYBEANS AND THUS DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH OTHER SEED AND PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. THE NUTRITION &

HEALTH BUSINESS ALSO PROVIDES FOOD SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND SOY-BASED FOOD INGREDIENTS IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR GRAIN AND FOOD PROCESSORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH IN THE U.S. AT EITHER DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR MANUFACTURING PLANTS. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF RESEARCH IS IN

THE WILMINGTON, DELAWARE AREA AT SEVERAL LARGE RESEARCH CENTERS. AMONG THESE, THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION LABORATORIES ENGAGE IN INVESTIGATIVE AND APPLIED RESEARCH, THE CHESTNUT RUN LABORATORIES FOCUS ON

APPLIED RESEARCH AND THE STINE-HASKELL RESEARCH CENTER CONDUCTS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH AND TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH TO ASSURE THE SAFE MANUFACTURE, HANDLING AND USE OF PRODUCTS AND RAW MATERIALS.

OTHER

MAJOR RESEARCH LOCATIONS IN THE U.S. INCLUDE FACILITIES DEDICATED TO COATINGS RESEARCH IN MOUNT CLEMENS, MICHIGAN; PIONEER RESEARCH FACILITIES IN JOHNSTON, IOWA; THE SOLAE COMPANY FACILITIES IN

ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; POLYMER RESEARCH FACILITIES IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, AND PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA; AND ELECTRONIC MATERIALS RESEARCH FACILITIES IN RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA,

AND SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA.

DUPONT,

REFLECTING THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL INTERESTS, ALSO OPERATES ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., WITH MAJOR FACILITIES LOCATED IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL;

KINGSTON, CANADA; SHANGHAI, CHINA; WUPPERTAL, GERMANY; HYDERABAD, INDIA; KANAGAWA, JAPAN; UTSUNOMIYA, JAPAN; SEOUL, KOREA; AND MEYRIN, SWITZERLAND.

THE

OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE TO CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN RELEVANT FIELDS, AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES. EACH SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY FUNDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS MISSION. RECENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS BROADENED ITS SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS BEYOND

ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTION TO INCLUDE MARKET-DRIVEN TARGETS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY IS EXPANDING ITS OFFERINGS ADDRESSING SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND CLIMATE

CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE BY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING RENEWABLE, BIO-BASED MATERIALS; ADVANCED BIOFUELS; ENERGY-EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES; ENHANCED SAFETY AND PROTECTION

PRODUCTS; AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE GOALS ARE TIED DIRECTLY TO BUSINESS GROWTH, INCLUDING INCREASING FOOD PRODUCTION, INCREASING RENEWABLE SOURCES FOR ENERGY AND RAW

MATERIALS, AND PROVIDING GREATER SAFETY AND PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

THE

CORPORATE RESEARCH LABORATORIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING RESEARCH PROGRAMS ALIGNED WITH CORPORATE STRATEGY. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE ADMINISTERED BY SENIOR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FILE REPORTS

AND INFORMATION WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), INCLUDING REPORTS ON THE FOLLOWING FORMS: ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON

FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934.

THE

PUBLIC MAY READ AND COPY ANY MATERIALS THE COMPANY FILES WITH THE SEC AT THE SEC'S PUBLIC REFERENCE ROOM AT 100 F STREET, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20549. THE PUBLIC MAY OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS

IN FUTURE PERIODS.

PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND GROW EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND

DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS AFFECT

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ESTABLISHING A PRICE ON CARBON COULD CREATE INCREASES IN ENERGY

COSTS AND PRICE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

VOLATILITY.

WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES. THE COMPANY TAKES ACTIONS

TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE INCREASES, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS

WITH PRICE INCREASES IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF

HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS AND MANAGE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OPERATING RESULTS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF CURRENT, NEW AND DEVELOPING PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND ITS ABILITY TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THE COMPANY PLANS TO GROW EARNINGS BY FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING MARKETS AND SOLUTIONS TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND FOR FOOD

PRODUCTIVITY, DECREASE DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUELS AND PROTECT PEOPLE, ASSETS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS ABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE

INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OBTAIN RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS, OBTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF

NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND INTENSE COMPETITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

DEVELOPING, OR COULD BEGIN TO DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, WILL ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. SALES OF THE COMPANY'S NEW PRODUCTS COULD REPLACE SALES OF SOME OF ITS CURRENT PRODUCTS, OFFSETTING

THE BENEFIT OF EVEN A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT INTRODUCTION.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT

INFRINGEMENT, ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN PURPORTED CLASS

ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL

TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NOTED A TREND IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NUISANCE SUITS BEING FILED ON BEHALF OF STATES, COUNTIES, CITIES AND UTILITIES ALLEGING HARM

TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A

FUTURE ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD

BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO

DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED, THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PROCESS SAFETY AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP

ISSUES.

FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY MANAGE SAFETY, HUMAN HEALTH, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITIES, STAKEHOLDERS, THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD IMPACT PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE AND INFLUENCE THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO

MANAGE PROCESS SAFETY RISKS, ISSUES COULD BE CREATED BY EVENTS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS AND ACTS OF SABOTAGE.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS AND THE

MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS,

INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS. THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE

TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF

FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE MATTER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES

AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY SEEDS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE, GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND COMPETITION.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT. THE USE OF

BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CHARACTERIZE THE GENETIC AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF PIONEER SEEDS PROVIDES PIONEER WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE

PLACEMENT OF THOSE PRODUCTS ON CUSTOMER ACRES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS SEED PRODUCTS THROUGH THE ADDITION OF SPECIFIC TRANSGENES. THE COMPANY'S

ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT,

MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF COMMODITY GRAIN GROWN FROM THOSE SEEDS.

THE

COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES SUPPORTING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND

PRODUCTION MARKETS. SPEED IN DISCOVERING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING PRODUCTS BASED ON THEM TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND

EFFECTIVELY TO THIS COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OR CANDIDATE PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND LAWS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 65 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S 2010 REVENUE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL

CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS TOTAL SALES AND THAT CONTINUED GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. SALES FROM

DEVELOPING MARKETS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IN 2010 AND THE COMPANY'S GROWTH PLANS INCLUDE FOCUSING ON EXPANDING ITS PRESENCE IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND

SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN A COUNTRY'S OR REGION'S ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRADE REGULATIONS AFFECTING PRODUCTION, PRICING AND

MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, LOCAL LABOR CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS, REDUCED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY OR LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, RESTRICTIONS ON

CURRENCY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES, BURDENSOME TAXES AND TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS. INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CHANGING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TERRORISM,

POLITICAL HOSTILITIES AND WAR, COULD LEAD TO REDUCED SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

ECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING INFLATION, DEFLATION AND FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES

THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NET MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES, FOREIGN CURRENCY-

DENOMINATED

REVENUES AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE RISKS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND CASH

FLOWS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY IN THE FUTURE BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INSTABILITY IN CREDIT

MARKETS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, VOLATILE EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER CHALLENGES THAT COULD AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS MAY

EXPERIENCE DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION. FURTHER, SUPPLIERS COULD EXPERIENCE SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY.

ADVERSITY WITHIN CAPITAL MARKETS MAY IMPACT FUTURE RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THUS RESULTING IN GREATER FUTURE PENSION COSTS THAT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS. FUTURE WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED BY BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY THREATS.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, INCREASING COSTS FOR ENERGY, TEMPORARY PLANT AND/OR POWER OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEM AND NETWORK DISRUPTIONS, COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. LIKE MANY OTHER MULTINATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE COMPANY FACES

SECURITY THREATS TO ITS FACILITIES, DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR CONSEQUENCES OF BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS OR SECURITY THREATS,

THEY COULD RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS OR TO RECEIVE RAW MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS, AND

CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS OR SECURITY BREACHES IN ORDER TO MITIGATE ANY

POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF SABOTAGE, TERRORISM OR WAR, WEATHER EVENTS AND NATURAL

DISASTERS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, THE IMPACT FROM BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INABILITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL

INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY ACCESS AND USE SUCH PROPERTY. WHEN MISAPPROPRIATION IS DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH

SITUATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

BELLE PLANT, WEST VIRGINIA

THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) IS INVESTIGATING THREE CHEMICAL RELEASES AT DUPONT'S BELLE FACILITY IN WEST VIRGINIA WHICH OCCURRED IN

JANUARY 2010. ONE OF THE RELEASES INVOLVED THE DEATH OF A DUPONT EMPLOYEE AFTER EXPOSURE TO PHOSGENE.

CHAMBERS WORKS PLANT, DEEPWATER, NEW JERSEY

IN JANUARY 2010, EPA AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR NEW JERSEY, INFORMED DUPONT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS INITIATING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION ARISING

FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL NON-COMPLIANCE AT THE CHAMBERS WORKS FACILITY. THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT THE FACILITY VIOLATED RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CLEAN

AIR ACT AND THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT REGULATIONS GOVERNING LEAK DETECTION AND REPORTING AND THAT IT FAILED TO REPORT EMISSIONS OF A COMPOUND FROM CHAMBERS WORKS' WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY UNDER

THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT. THE ALLEGED NON-COMPLIANCE WAS IDENTIFIED BY EPA IN 2007 AND 2009 FOLLOWING SEPARATE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITS.

DUPONT IS IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH EPA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ).

CHAMBERS WORKS PLANT, DEEPWATER, NEW JERSEY

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2010, DUPONT RECEIVED A DRAFT ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENT ORDER FROM THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (NJDEP)

SEEKING A PENALTY FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF NEW JERSEY HAZARDOUS WASTE REGULATIONS DATING BACK TO APRIL 2009 BASED ON A FACILITY-WIDE HAZARDOUS WASTE AUDIT CONDUCTED IN MAY 2010. DUPONT IS

IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH NJDEP.

CHAMBERS WORKS PLANT, DEEPWATER, NEW JERSEY

DUPONT IS IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH EPA AND DOJ CONCERNING ALLEGATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL NON-COMPLIANCE AT THE CHAMBERS WORKS

FACILITY. THE ALLEGATIONS AROSE FROM AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO DUPONT'S MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE IN RAIL CARS.

TSCA VOLUNTARY AUDIT

DUPONT VOLUNTARILY UNDERTOOK A SELF-AUDIT CONCERNING REPORTING OF INHALATION STUDIES PURSUANT TO TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA)

SECTION 8(E). DUPONT VOLUNTARILY REPORTED THE RESULTS OF THAT AUDIT TO EPA. THE EPA HAS REVIEWED THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED UNDER THIS SELF-AUDIT AND HAS INDICATED POTENTIAL

VIOLATIONS EXIST WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE SUBMITTED STUDIES. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THIS MATTER FOR A PENALTY OF $3.3 MILLION WAS APPROVED BY EPA'S ENVIRONMENTAL APPEALS

BOARD.

THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR USE OF WORDS LIKE "PLANS," "EXPECTS," "WILL," "ANTICIPATES,"

"INTENDS," "PROJECTS," "ESTIMATES" OR OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ALL STATEMENTS THAT ADDRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE, INCLUDING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR

GROWTH, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET POSITION, EXPENDITURES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE ACCURATE OR WILL BE REALIZED.

FOR SOME OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SEE THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSION SET

FORTH UNDER PART I, ITEM 1A BEGINNING ON PAGE 6.

OVERVIEW

VISION

DUPONT'S VISION IS TO BE THE WORLD'S MOST DYNAMIC SCIENCE COMPANY, CREATING SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS ESSENTIAL FOR A BETTER, SAFER AND HEALTHIER LIFE FOR PEOPLE

EVERYWHERE. THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO GROWING SHAREHOLDER AND SOCIETAL VALUE WHILE REDUCING ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OVER THE LONG TERM.

STRATEGY

THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR GROWTH IS TO USE SCIENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS FOUR FUNDAMENTAL GLOBAL TRENDS 

INCREASING FOOD

PRODUCTION

,

DECREASING DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUELS

,

PROTECTING PEOPLE

AND THE ENVIRONMENT

, AND

GROWTH IN DEVELOPING MARKETS

. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT BEST SERVES ITS SHAREHOLDERS BY INCREASING ITS

GLOBAL PRESENCE IN MEETING CHALLENGES, INCLUDING INCREASING FOOD PRODUCTION, INCREASING RENEWABLE SOURCES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, AND PROVIDING GREATER SAFETY AND PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE AND THE

ENVIRONMENT. FOR THESE STRATEGIC AREAS, THE COMPANY HAS SET DIFFERENTIATED TARGETS FOR GROWTH AND FUTURE FUNDING FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING PROGRAMS.

ACQUISITION OF DANISCO

THE FINANCIAL GOALS DISCUSSED BELOW EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE INTENDED ACQUISITION OF DANISCO. THE ACQUISITION IS ALIGNED WITH THE COMPANY'S

GROWTH STRATEGY AND COMPLIMENTARY TO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING BUSINESSES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PIPELINES. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CASH AND EARNINGS ACCRETIVE IN 2012, THE FIRST

FULL YEAR OF THE COMBINED ENTITY. UPON COMPLETION, THE TRANSACTION WOULD ESTABLISH DUPONT AS A CLEAR LEADER IN INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY WITH SCIENCE-INTENSIVE INNOVATIONS THAT ADDRESS GLOBAL

CHALLENGES IN FOOD PRODUCTION AND REDUCED FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION.

GOALS

BY AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING TOP LINE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN KEY MARKETS AND IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY, THE COMPANY MET OR SURPASSED ITS 2010 FINANCIAL GOALS FOR

SALES GROWTH, EARNINGS PER SHARE, CASH FLOW AND WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTIONS. CONSISTENT WITH ITS STRONG 2010 PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW FIVE-YEAR PLAN WHICH INCLUDES COMPOUND

ANNUAL GROWTH TARGETS OF 7 PERCENT FOR SALES AND 12 PERCENT FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM 2010 THROUGH 2015. SALES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS, WHICH INCLUDE CHINA, INDIA, AND THE

COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA, EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND SOUTHEAST ASIA, ARE TARGETED TO MAKE UP 36 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S SALES BY 2015, A

4 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE FROM 2010. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXECUTE ITS THREE-YEAR 2010-2012 PLAN ANNOUNCED IN 2009, WHICH INCLUDES

$1 BILLION FIXED COST PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS AND $1 BILLION WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY ALSO REAFFIRMED ITS COMMITMENT TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND TO

RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THERE IS A COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH.

PRE-TAX EXCHANGE LOSSES OF $192 MILLION COMBINED WITH HIGHER INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES OF $93 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN NET GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS OF $64 MILLION,

A BENEFIT OF $59 MILLION IN 2010 RELATED TO ACCRUED INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH SETTLEMENTS OF PRIOR YEAR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES, AN INCREASE IN INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF $41 MILLION

AND A $31 MILLION COMBINED BENEFIT FROM AN ACQUISITION AND AN EARLY TERMINATION OF A SUPPLY AGREEMENT.

2009 VERSUS 2008

OTHER INCOME, NET, DECREASED $88 MILLION VERSUS 2008. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $47 MILLION REDUCTION IN INTEREST

2009 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

IN SECOND QUARTER 2009, IN RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION, THE COMPANY COMMITTED TO AN INITIATIVE TO ADDRESS THE STEEP AND EXTENDED

DOWNTURN IN MOTOR VEHICLE AND CONSTRUCTION MARKETS, AND THE EXTENSION OF THE DOWNTURN INTO INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. THE PLAN WAS DESIGNED TO RESTRUCTURE ASSET AND FIXED COST BASES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE

LONG-TERM COMPETITIVENESS, SIMPLIFY BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND MAXIMIZE PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME. THE PLAN INCLUDED THE ELIMINATION OF ABOUT 2,000 POSITIONS BY SEVERANCE

PRINCIPALLY LOCATED IN THE U.S. AS A RESULT, A CHARGE OF $340 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN EMPLOYEE SEPARATION/ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET WHICH PERTAINS TO THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE

ITEMS: COGS  60 PERCENT, SG&A  30 PERCENT, AND R&D  10 PERCENT. THIS CHARGE INCLUDED

$212 MILLION OF SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS COSTS, $24 MILLION OF OTHER NON-PERSONNEL CHARGES AND $104 MILLION OF ASSET-RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING

$77 MILLION FOR ASSET SHUT DOWNS AND WRITE-OFFS, $11 MILLION FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND $16 MILLION FOR ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $30 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2009 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A $20 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2009 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2010. THESE REDUCTIONS PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOWER

THAN ESTIMATED INDIVIDUAL SEVERANCE COSTS AND WORK FORCE REDUCTIONS THROUGH NON-SEVERANCE PROGRAMS.

THE

ACTIONS RELATED TO THE 2009 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2010 WITH PAYMENTS CONTINUING INTO 2011, PRIMARILY IN EUROPE.

2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

DURING 2008, IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY INITIATED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM TO REDUCE COSTS AND

IMPROVE PROFITABILITY ACROSS ITS BUSINESSES. THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM INCLUDED THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 2,500 POSITIONS PRINCIPALLY LOCATED IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE U.S.

PRIMARILY SUPPORTING THE MOTOR VEHICLE AND CONSTRUCTION MARKETS.

IN 2008,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $535 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $287 MILLION RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS AND $248 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO ASSET

SHUT-DOWNS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER NON-PERSONNEL CHARGES.

IN 2009,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A $100 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

$14 MILLION NET REDUCTION IN THE ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2010. THESE REDUCTIONS PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOWER THAN

ESTIMATED INDIVIDUAL SEVERANCE COSTS AND WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS THROUGH NON-SEVERANCE PROGRAMS.

THE

PROGRAM AND PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2010.

15.9%

IN 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX PROVISION OF $659 MILLION, REFLECTING AN INCREASE FROM 2009, LARGELY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN

PRE-TAX EARNINGS AND THE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY OF HEDGING THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THESE ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET TAX BENEFITS OF $49 MILLION RELATED TO THE ADJUSTMENT OF INCOME TAX ACCRUALS

ASSOCIATED WITH SETTLEMENTS OF PRIOR YEAR TAX CONTINGENCIES AND $39 MILLION FOR REVERSAL OF TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. THE DECREASE

IN THE 2010 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED TO 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS IN LOW TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS AND THE NET TAX BENEFITS NOTED ABOVE.

IN 2009,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX PROVISION OF $415 MILLION REFLECTING A MARGINAL INCREASE FROM 2008. THE INCREASE IN THE 2009 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED TO 2008

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS.

THE

COMPANY'S CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE 2011 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS ABOUT 20-21 PERCENT, EXCLUDING TAX EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES WHICH CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DUPONT ("EARNINGS") FOR 2010 INCREASED $1.3 BILLION, OR 73 PERCENT VERSUS 2009. THE INCREASE

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS HIGHER SALES VOLUME AND SELLING PRICES AND THE ABSENCE OF A PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING CHARGE, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NON-CASH PENSION COSTS AND LOWER PHARMACEUTICALS

INCOME. SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOVE RELATED TO CHANGES IN EARNINGS.

2009 VERSUS 2008

EARNINGS FOR 2009 DECREASED $252 MILLION, OR 13 PERCENT VERSUS 2008. THE DECREASE IN EARNINGS WAS PRINCIPALLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME, UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS, AND HIGHER NON-CASH PENSION COSTS. PARTLY OFFSETTING THESE FACTORS WERE LOWER COSTS FOR RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY, AND

FREIGHT, BENEFITS FROM COST REDUCTIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS, LOWER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, AND THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR YEAR HURRICANE-RELATED CHARGES. SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOVE RELATED TO

CHANGES IN EARNINGS.

CORPORATE OUTLOOK

FOR THE YEAR 2011, THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS OUTLOOK IS A RANGE OF $3.45 TO $3.75 PER SHARE WITH EXPECTED SALES BETWEEN $33 BILLION TO

$34 BILLION, REFLECTING THE EXPECTATION FOR CONTINUED STEADY GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH INCREASING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, FAVORABLE NORTH AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS AND THE COMPANY'S

FURTHER PENETRATION OF DEVELOPING MARKETS. EARNINGS FROM PHARMACEUTICALS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE ABOUT $290 MILLION PRE-TAX, REFLECTING THE EXPIRATION OF CERTAIN PATENTS FOR

COZAAR®/HYZAAR®. THE COMPANY EXPECTS HIGHER OPERATING COSTS FROM AN ESTIMATED FOUR TO FIVE PERCENT INCREASE IN RAW MATERIAL, ENERGY AND FREIGHT COSTS, AND APPROXIMATELY

$60 MILLION HIGHER PRE-TAX NON-CASH PENSION COSTS. THE COMPANY PLANS TO PARTLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES BY FIXED COST PRODUCTIVITY PROGRAMS TOTALING ABOUT

$300 MILLION.

THE

COMPANY PLANS TO CONTINUE A DIFFERENTIAL LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FUNDING FOR RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT FOR BUSINESSES EXPECTED TO HAVE ABOVE-AVERAGE GROWTH RATES AND MARGINS.

FOR 2011, TARGETS HAVE BEEN SET FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING ABOUT $1.8 BILLION, AND WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS TOTALING $300 MILLION.

THE

OUTLOOK ABOVE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE PLANNED DANISCO ACQUISITION WHICH COULD REDUCE 2011 EARNINGS BY $0.30 TO $0.45 PER SHARE.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE

PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND

VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS SOME

OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ARE TWO CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS IN MEASURING THE COST AND BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY AS OF DECEMBER 31

ST

. THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS

ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS APPROPRIATE. AS PERMITTED BY GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES EXCEED

10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PLAN OBLIGATIONS OR THE APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS, THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT

80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BENEFIT

PLANS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY UTILIZES PUBLISHED LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE AT MEASUREMENT DATE. WHERE COMMONLY AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS INDICES OF VARIOUS DURATIONS TO REFLECT THE TIMING OF FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

WITHIN

THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN

RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN

INTO CONSIDERATION. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT

POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE

LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.

IN

DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS RATHER THAN ITS FAIR VALUE. THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS IS CALCULATED BY

AVERAGING MARKET RETURNS OVER 36 MONTHS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY BE A LAG IN RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY

REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

FOR PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, PENSION EXPENSE IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED USING THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS IN ALL

PENSION PLANS WAS $18.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND THE RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS WERE $23.9 BILLION. IN ADDITION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE COMPANY'S UNFUNDED OTHER

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WERE $4.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE

MADE. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH

REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER PRPS AT MULTIPARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $407 MILLION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

CONSIDERABLE

UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT

ACCRUED. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE AND GLOBAL LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED

OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE

REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE VARIOUS LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

AND COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY FOR CLEANING UP THE DAMAGE RESULTING FROM COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE DISPOSAL. OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR

SIGNIFICANT COSTS UNDER BOTH CERCLA AND RCRA.

REMEDIATION

ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION

TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF PRPS. THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP PRECISE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION

COSTS.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT

INFRINGEMENT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ACCRUALS TO REFLECT

THE IMPACT AND STATUS OF

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

NEGOTIATIONS,

SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR MATTER. PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED

COSTS AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES. IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS, MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE

JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED, INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING THE MATTER THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND THE MATTER'S CURRENT STATUS.

CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION ACCRUAL WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A COURT PROCEEDING. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE

COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF, BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY

OVERTURNED ON APPEAL. A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION MATTERS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING

TAXES THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND

RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S TAX

ASSETS AND TAX LIABILITIES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF

COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES OR DECREASES THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

DEFERRED

INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE

ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE

NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL

IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN

RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD A DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE OF $6.4 BILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $1.7 BILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR

OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ASSETS.

VALUATION OF ASSETS

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES IS AN

INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S NORMAL ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS. TESTING FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENT'S BEST

ESTIMATES AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. THE DYNAMIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES OPERATE, AND KEY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTED

SELLING PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS. ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. CHANGES

IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIME IN WHICH SUCH IMPAIRMENTS ARE

RECOGNIZED.

BASED

ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN 2010, NO IMPAIRMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS BUSINESSES IS USING THE

INCOME APPROACH BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE INCOME APPROACH HAS BEEN GENERALLY SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL MARKET TRANSACTION ANALYSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FORECASTED CASH FLOW AND REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH RATES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF THE ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE

PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UTILIZED ARE BOTH REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION'S BUSINESSES LEVERAGE THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE TO IMPROVE THE QUANTITY, QUALITY

AND SAFETY OF THE GLOBAL FOOD SUPPLY AND THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. LAND AVAILABLE FOR WORLDWIDE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS INCREASINGLY LIMITED SO PRODUCTION GROWTH WILL NEED TO BE

ACHIEVED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH IMPROVING CROP YIELDS AND PRODUCTIVITY RATHER THAN THROUGH INCREASES IN PLANTED AREA. THE SEGMENT'S BUSINESSES DELIVER A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE

SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO ACHIEVE GAINS IN CROP YIELDS AND PRODUCTIVITY, INCLUDING PIONEER® BRAND SEED PRODUCTS AND WELL-ESTABLISHED BRANDS OF INSECTICIDES, FUNGICIDES AND

HERBICIDES. THE SEGMENT'S BUSINESSES OPERATE ACROSS THE FOOD VALUE CHAIN FROM INPUTS FOR PRODUCING AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS TO GLOBAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOY-BASED FOOD INGREDIENTS

TO FOOD QUALITY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING EQUIPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOCUSES ON LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE GROWER PRODUCTIVITY AND ENHANCE THE VALUE OF GRAINS AND SOY THROUGH IMPROVED SEED

TRAITS, SUPERIOR SEED GERMPLASM AND EFFECTIVE USE OF INSECTICIDES, HERBICIDES AND FUNGICIDES. THE FOLLOWING ARE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION'S OPERATING BUSINESSES.

PIONEER

IS THE WORLD'S LEADING SEED BRAND AND A WORLD LEADER IN IMPROVING CROP YIELDS WITH HYBRID AND VARIETAL SEEDS THAT IMPROVE GROWER YIELDS AND

PROVIDE EFFECTIVE PLANT INSECT PROTECTION AND HERBICIDE TOLERANCE. THE PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS OF PIONEER ARE HYBRID SEED CORN AND VARIETAL SOYBEAN SEED, AS WELL AS SUNFLOWER, CANOLA, SORGHUM AND RICE.

CROPS GROWN FROM PIONEER SEED ARE USED TO MEET THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ANIMAL FEED, FOOD, BIOFUELS, AND FIBER. SALES OF PIONEER SEEDS AMOUNTED TO 17 PERCENT, 18 PERCENT AND

13 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. AGRICULTURAL SEED RESEARCH REQUIRES LONG-TERM

COMMITMENT, INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION. PIONEER RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON RESULTS THAT DELIVER HIGHER CROP YIELDS AND A CONSISTENT PER ACRE INCOME ADVANTAGE FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION IS

ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH AN EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF SUPERIOR GERMPLASM AND VALUE ADDED NATIVE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS. IN 2010, PIONEER BENEFITED FROM THE NORTH AMERICA LAUNCH OF NEW SOYBEAN VARIETIES

AND NEW PIONEER® BRAND CORN HYBRIDS. IN APRIL 2010, PIONEER RECEIVED EPA CULTIVATION APPROVAL OF OPTIMUM® ACREMAX 1 PRODUCTS, THE FIRST PRODUCT WITH REDUCED AND

INTEGRATED CORN ROOTWORM REFUGE WITH 2011 COMMERCIALIZATION IN NORTH AMERICA. IN OCTOBER 2010, PIONEER RECEIVED EPA CULTIVATION APPROVAL OF OPTIMUM® INTRASECT INSECT

PROTECTION PRODUCTS OFFERING THAT WILL ALLOW U.S. CORN GROWERS TO REDUCE THEIR STRUCTURED ABOVE GROUND REFUGE TO A LEVEL OF 5 PERCENT IN THE CORN BELT. OPTIMUM®

INTRASECT INSECT PROTECTION PRODUCTS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED TO GROWERS IN 2011. PIONEER EXPECTS EPA CULTIVATION APPROVAL FOR ITS NEXT GENERATION INTEGRATED REFUGE INSECT CONTROL PRODUCTS IN

THE SECOND HALF 2011. THESE INNOVATIVE AND CONVENIENT PRODUCTS WOULD FEATURE SINGLE-BAG REDUCED REFUGE FOR BOTH CORN ROOTWORM AND CORN BORER. UPON EPA CULTIVATION APPROVAL, MULTIPLE

PRODUCT VERSIONS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR GROWER CHOICE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: OPTIMUM® ACREMAX

TM

PRODUCTS FOR ABOVE-GROUND PROTECTION AND OPTIMUM®

ACREMAX

TM

XTRA PRODUCTS FOR ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND PROTECTION.

IN

DECEMBER 2010, PIONEER AND SYNGENTA AG (SYNGENTA) ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO GRANT PIONEER A NON-EXCLUSIVE, GLOBAL LICENSE TO SYNGENTA'S CORN ROOTWORM TRAIT MIR604

(AGRISURE RW) FOR CORN SEED. THE TRAIT PROVIDES PROTECTION FROM BELOW-GROUND COLEOPTERAN INSECTS, INCLUDING CORN ROOTWORM, A MAJOR CORN PEST IN THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD. THE LICENSE

GIVES PIONEER THE RIGHT TO COMMERCIALIZE CORN SEED CONTAINING MIR604, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO STACK MIR604 WITH OTHER TRAITS THROUGH THE EXPIRATION OF THE RELEVANT PATENTS. AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT,

PIONEER IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS ASSUMING CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING REGULATORY APPROVALS, ARE MET. THE CONTINGENCIES RELATED TO THE FIRST MILESTONE PAYMENT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE MET IN 2011. MINIMUM PAYMENTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL ABOUT $400 MILLION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

IN

SEPTEMBER 2010, AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY TO DELIVER INNOVATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE NEED FOR INCREASED FOOD PRODUCTION TO FEED THE WORLD'S GROWING POPULATION, PIONEER ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD

ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

A

MAJORITY SHARE OF PANNAR SEED LIMITED, A SOUTH AFRICAN-BASED SEED COMPANY. THIS INVESTMENT WOULD ALLOW EACH BUSINESS TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CROP AREAS, REACH MORE CUSTOMERS AND DELIVER IMPROVED SEED

PRODUCTS QUICKER THAN EITHER CAN DO ON ITS OWN. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE SOUTH AFRICAN COMPETITION COMMISSION REJECTED THE ACQUISITION. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THIS DECISION AND EXPECTS TO RECEIVE A

FINAL DECISION IN 2011.

AS

ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2008, PIONEER IS EXPANDING ITS REACH IN NORTH AMERICA THROUGH ITS PROACCESS

SM

BUSINESS STRATEGY IN ORDER TO BRING ITS SEED GENETICS TO MORE CUSTOMERS. UNDER THE

PROACCESS

SM

BUSINESS STRATEGY, NINE COMPANIES DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS ON BEHALF OF PIONEER THAT ARE CO-BRANDED USING PIONEER-OWNED BRANDS TOGETHER WITH ONE OF THE NINE COMPANIES'

BRANDS. SINCE LAUNCHING PROACCESS

SM

, SIX OF THE NINE PROACCESS

SM

PARTNERS HAVE BECOME WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY.

IN

THE SPRING 2009, MONSANTO SUED THE COMPANY IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT CLAIMING THAT STACKING SEED WITH PIONEER'S OPTIMUM® GAT® TRAIT AND MONSANTO'S ROUNDUP

READY®

1

HERBICIDE TOLERANCE TRAIT VIOLATES ITS ROUNDUP READY® LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH MONSANTO. MONSANTO ALSO ALLEGES THAT SALES OF PIONEER STACKED SEEDS WOULD

INFRINGE A MONSANTO PATENT THAT EXPIRES IN 2014. MONSANTO SEEKS DECLARATORY RELIEF, UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND A PERMANENT INJUNCTION TO PREVENT SALES OF OPTIMUM® GAT®/ ROUNDUP

READY® STACKED SEEDS. DUPONT FILED AN ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS, INCLUDING PATENT MISUSE AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS. IN JANUARY 2010, THE COURT RULED THAT THE LICENSE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE

COMPANIES CONTAIN AN UNWRITTEN ("IMPLIED") TERM THAT PROHIBITS STACKING THESE TRAITS. THE COURT VACATED ITS RULING REGARDING THE "IMPLIED TERM" IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2010, AND CONCLUDED THAT THE

LICENSE NEITHER EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS NOR EXPRESSLY GRANTS THE RIGHT TO STACK A SECOND GLYPHOSATE TOLERANCE TRAIT WITH MONSANTO'S ROUNDUP READY® TRAIT. THE COMPANY'S SEPARATE ANTITRUST AND

PATENT FRAUD CLAIMS WERE NOT IMPACTED BY EITHER RULING AND ARE PROCEEDING. PIONEER CONTINUES TO DEVELOP SOYBEAN SEED IN WHICH THESE TRAITS ARE STACKED AND SALES COULD OCCUR BETWEEN

2013-2014, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS. NEITHER RULING CHANGES PIONEER'S COMMERCIALIZATION PLANS FOR PRODUCTS WITH THE OPTIMUM® GAT® TRAIT. FURTHERMORE,

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE MONSANTO LAWSUIT IS UNLIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL RESULTS FOR SOYBEAN AND CORN SEED BECAUSE PIONEER CAN CONTINUE TO SELL SEED WITH ROUNDUP

READY® TRAITS THAT ARE NOT STACKED WITH OPTIMUM® GAT® TRAITS.

INGREDIENTS.

2010 VERSUS 2009

SALES WERE $9.1 BILLION, A 10 PERCENT INCREASE VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A 7 PERCENT INCREASE IN VOLUME AND

4 PERCENT HIGHER UNITED STATES DOLLAR (USD) SELLING PRICES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PORTFOLIO CHANGES OF 1 PERCENT. HIGHER VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SEED SALES IN NORTH

AMERICA WITH MARKET SHARE GAINS FOR CORN AND SOYBEANS. HIGHER GLOBAL SALES OF CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS WERE LED BY BROAD-BASED RECOVERY ACROSS MOST REGIONS AND STRONG DEMAND FOR RYNAXYPYR®

IN ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA. THE HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES REFLECT HIGHER VALUE PRODUCT MIX AND PRICING ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE INCREASE IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS.

PTOI

FOR 2010 WAS $1.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 11 PERCENT VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE HIGHER SALES VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPENDING FOR GROWTH INVESTMENTS

AND A $50 MILLION CHARGE IN R&D EXPENSE FOR AN UPFRONT PAYMENT RELATED TO A PIONEER LICENSING AGREEMENT FOR CORN SEED TRAIT TECHNOLOGY, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

2009 VERSUS 2008

SALES WERE $8.3 BILLION, A 4 PERCENT INCREASE WHEN COMPARED TO 2008, REFLECTING 5 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A 1 PERCENT DECREASE IN VOLUME. THE HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES IS RELATED TO PIONEER SEEDS AND CROP PROTECTION PROPRIETARY INSECT, WEED AND DISEASE CONTROL PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS IN EUROPE, CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MARKET-DRIVEN PRICING FOR GLYPHOSATE RESALE. THE DECREASE IN VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO LOWER SALES OF CROP PROTECTION DISEASE AND INSECT CONTROL PRODUCTS, AND LOWER SALES OF NUTRITION & HEALTH PRODUCTS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER PIONEER CORN AND SOYBEAN SEED SALES MARKET SHARE

GAINS IN NORTH AMERICA.

PTOI

WAS $1.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 13 PERCENT VERSUS 2008, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE HIGHER SALES AND HIGHER VALUE PRODUCT MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS GLOBALLY.

OUTLOOK

THE SEGMENT ANTICIPATES SALES AND EARNINGS GROWTH IN 2011. SEGMENT EARNINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BENEFIT IN PARTICULAR FROM CONTINUED STRONG MOMENTUM IN THE

PIONEER CORN AND SOYBEAN BUSINESS. PIONEER ANTICIPATES CONTINUED GROWTH IN VOLUME IN KEY CORN AND SOYBEAN MARKETS INCLUDING THE U.S., CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA, AS WELL AS VALUE-BASED PRICING GAINS.

THE 2011 PRODUCT LINE UP WILL INCLUDE NEW CORN HYBRIDS AND SOYBEAN VARIETIES AS WELL AS OPTIMUM® ACREMAX 1 PRODUCTS, THE INDUSTRY'S FIRST PRODUCT WITH REDUCED AND INTEGRATED

CORN ROOTWORM REFUGE.

IN

THE CROP PROTECTION BUSINESS, VOLUME DRIVEN SALES GROWTH COMBINED WITH CONTINUED PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT ACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO EARNINGS IN 2011. VOLUME GROWTH IS

UNDERPINNED BY A FAVORABLE INDUSTRY OUTLOOK, CONTINUED REGIONAL EXPANSION AND NEW MARKET SEGMENT PENETRATION OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS RYNXYPYR® AS WELL AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SUCH AS

STREAMLINE® HERBICIDE FOR LAND MANAGEMENT. IN THE NUTRITION & HEALTH BUSINESS, VOLUME GROWTH REFLECTING SOY PROTEIN PENETRATION AND EXPANSION OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS COUPLED

WITH CONTINUED AND INTENSIFIED PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS ARE ANTICIPATED TO SUPPORT EARNINGS AND MARGIN EXPANSION.

THE

SEGMENT IS ON TRACK TO COMPLETE A $295 MILLION EXPANSION TO SUPPORT THE DUPONT TEDLAR® POLYVINYL FLUORIDE FILMS BUSINESS. THIS INCLUDES A $120 MILLION INVESTMENT IN

CAPACITY EXPANSION TO PRODUCE THE RAW MATERIALS THAT MAKE THE FILM, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN 2010. A MULTI-PHASE $175 MILLION INVESTMENT OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE TEDLAR® PV2001

SERIES ORIENTED FILM PRODUCTION IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION IN 2011. TEDLAR® FILMS SERVE AS THE CRITICAL COMPONENT OF PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULE BACKSHEETS, PROVIDING LONG-TERM

DURABILITY AND PERFORMANCE IN ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS.

2010 VERSUS 2009

SALES OF $2.8 BILLION WERE UP 44 PERCENT, REFLECTING 37 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME AND 7 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES.

HIGHER VOLUME WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN ALL REGIONS, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA PACIFIC AND EUROPE, AND STRONG DEMAND ACROSS MOST MARKET SEGMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN PHOTOVOLTAICS. HIGHER USD SELLING

PRICES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO PASS-THROUGH OF HIGHER PRECIOUS METALS PRICES.

PTOI

WAS $445 MILLION COMPARED TO $87 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN PTOI WAS DRIVEN BY SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER VOLUME, IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AND THE ABSENCE OF A NET

$37 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

2009 VERSUS 2008

SALES OF $1.9 BILLION WERE DOWN 13 PERCENT, REFLECTING 11 PERCENT VOLUME DECLINE AND 2 PERCENT LOWER USD SELLING

PRICES. THE LOWER VOLUME REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION WHICH AFFECTED SALES FOR PRODUCTS ACROSS ALL KEY MARKETS. SALES VOLUME IMPROVED THROUGHOUT 2009, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN

ASIA PACIFIC, WHERE SALES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT WHEN COMPARED TO 2008. THE LOWER USD SELLING PRICES WERE MAINLY DUE TO CONTRACTUAL PASS-THROUGH OF LOWER PRECIOUS METAL PRICES.

PTOI

WAS $87 MILLION COMPARED TO $251 MILLION IN 2008. THE DECLINE IN PTOI WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER SALES, LOWER INCOME FROM AFFILIATES, AND HIGHER CHARGES ASSOCIATED

WITH LOW CAPACITY UTILIZATION OF PRODUCTION LINES.

OUTLOOK

FOR 2011, SALES OF PRODUCTS INTO PHOTOVOLTAICS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, DISPLAYS, AND ADVANCED PRINTING MARKETS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE MODERATELY. THE

SEGMENT CONTINUES TO MAKE PRODUCTIVITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVEMENTS, AS WELL AS CAPACITY INVESTMENTS TO MEET GLOBAL DEMAND. SEGMENT EARNINGS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HIGHER

VOLUME AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS FOR GROWTH.

REFRIGERANT.

HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES REFLECT FAVORABLE PRICING FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE AND PASS-THROUGH OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS FOR INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS AND FLUOROPRODUCTS.

PTOI

WAS $1,081 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $547 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN PTOI WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER VOLUME, HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES THAT MORE THAN OFFSET INCREASES IN RAW

MATERIAL COSTS, IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AND THE ABSENCE OF A NET $54 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

2009 VERSUS 2008

SALES OF $5.0 BILLION WERE 18 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2008, DUE TO A 12 PERCENT DECLINE IN VOLUME AND 6 PERCENT LOWER USD

SELLING PRICES. THE LOWER VOLUME PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS DECREASED DEMAND FOR INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS AND FLUOROPRODUCTS ACROSS ALL REGIONS REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. SALES OF TITANIUM

DIOXIDE PRODUCTS RECOVERED DURING THE SECOND HALF 2009, AND WERE HIGHER THAN THE PRE-RECESSION LEVELS IN THE SECOND HALF 2007. THE LOWER USD SELLING PRICES WERE MAINLY DUE TO CONTRACTUAL

PASS-THROUGH OF LOWER RAW MATERIAL PRICES AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACT IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC.

PTOI

WAS $547 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $687 MILLION IN 2008. THE DECREASE IN EARNINGS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FIXED COSTS REDUCTIONS.

OUTLOOK

PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS' SALES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN 2011 AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY, HIGHER GLOBAL DEMAND FOR TITANIUM

DIOXIDE AND SPECIALTY CHEMICALS, AND HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES. TOTAL SEGMENT EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO INCREASE CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGHER SALES VOLUME, HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND IMPROVED

FIXED COST PRODUCTIVITY. THIS SEGMENT MANUFACTURES PRODUCTS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA MATTERS. SEE THE DISCUSSION ON PAGE 46 UNDER THE SUBHEADING PFOA FOR

ECONOMY COATING APPLICATIONS.

IN

2009 AND 2008, THE SEGMENT EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES, MAINLY IN THE OEMS MARKETS, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION,

THE NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE STRUCTURAL CHANGES, INCLUDING THE LOSS OF U.S. MARKET SHARE BY U.S. AUTOMAKERS. IN 2009, THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT

TRUCKS DECLINED BY 14 PERCENT REFLECTING DECLINES OF 33 PERCENT IN NORTH AMERICA, AND 10 PERCENT IN THE REST OF THE WORLD, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION

OF 44 PERCENT IN GREATER CHINA.

IN

2010, THE SEGMENT EXPERIENCED STRONG RECOVERY FROM THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ACROSS MOST MARKETS AND REGIONS. GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS EXPERIENCED INCREASED PRODUCTION LEVELS DUE TO IMPROVED OEM AUTO

BUILDS AS A RESULT OF HIGHER DEMAND, MOST SIGNIFICANT IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. AUTOMOTIVE BUILDS ACROSS THE GLOBE INCREASED 22 PERCENT, REFLECTING AN IMPROVEMENT OF 37 PERCENT IN

NORTH AMERICA AND 20 PERCENT IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. THE INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FORECAST FOR 2011 PROJECTS A GLOBAL INCREASE OF 5 PERCENT, REFLECTING CONTINUED RECOVERY IN NORTH AMERICA

AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN ASIA PACIFIC.

2010 VERSUS 2009

SALES OF $3.8 BILLION WERE UP 11 PERCENT WHEN COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING 9 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME AND A

2 PERCENT INCREASE IN USD SELLING PRICES. HIGHER VOLUME REFLECTS RECOVERY IN GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE OEM MARKETS AS A RESULT OF HIGHER GLOBAL MOTOR VEHICLE BUILDS AND STRONG DEMAND IN INDUSTRIAL

COATINGS, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN HEAVY DUTY TRUCK MARKETS. HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES PRIMARILY REFLECT PRICING ACTIONS TAKEN TO OFFSET THE INCREASE IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS.

PTOI

WAS $249 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $69 MILLION IN 2009. THE INCREASE IN PTOI PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF HIGHER VOLUME, IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AND HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, WHICH

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS.

2009 VERSUS 2008

SALES OF $3.4 BILLION WERE DOWN 21 PERCENT WHEN COMPARED TO 2008, REFLECTING A 20 PERCENT DECLINE IN VOLUME AND

1 PERCENT LOWER USD SELLING PRICES. THE DECLINE IN VOLUME REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FEWER MOTOR VEHICLE AND INDUSTRIAL TRUCK BUILDS OF MOTOR VEHICLE OEMS, AND LOWER SALES OF INDUSTRIAL AND

AFTER-MARKET PRODUCTS IN ALL REGIONS. SALES TO OEMS IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING THE SECOND HALF 2009, MOSTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES PROGRAMS AND HIGHER SALES IN ASIA

PACIFIC. SALES OF AFTER-MARKET AND INDUSTRIAL

COATINGS EXPERIENCED A SLOWER RECOVERY FROM THE INVENTORY DESTOCKING EXPERIENCED IN THE INDUSTRY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER 2008 AND FIRST QUARTER 2009. THE LOWER USD SELLING PRICES REFLECT UNFAVORABLE

CURRENCY IMPACTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LOCAL SELLING PRICES.

PTOI

WAS $69 MILLION AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $8 MILLION IN 2008. THE IMPROVEMENT IN PTOI WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FIXED COSTS, AND THE NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR

IMPACT OF THE 2008 AND 2009 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF LOWER VOLUME.

OUTLOOK

FOR 2011, THE SEGMENT EXPECTS SALES TO INCREASE MODESTLY WITH CONTINUED RECOVERY IN THE GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCK MARKETS AND MARKET GROWTH IN

THE DEVELOPING REGIONS. PTOI IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE DUE TO CONTINUED PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS AND HIGHER SALES IN ALL REGIONS.

2010 VERSUS 2009

SALES OF $6.3 BILLION WERE 32 PERCENT HIGHER THAN PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING 27 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME AND A 7 PERCENT

INCREASE IN USD SELLING PRICES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PORTFOLIO CHANGES OF 2 PERCENT. THE HIGHER VOLUME WAS LED BY BROAD-BASED DEMAND ACROSS ALL MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN AUTOMOTIVE AND

ELECTRONIC MARKETS, WITH STRONG VOLUME RECOVERY IN ALL REGIONS, LED BY ASIA PACIFIC. HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES WERE A COMBINATION OF STRONGER PRODUCT SALES MIX AND HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES IN

RESPONSE TO HIGHER FEEDSTOCK COSTS.

2010

PTOI WAS $994 MILLION COMPARED TO $287 MILLION IN 2009. THE INCREASE IN PTOI WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES VOLUME, HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY.

2009 VERSUS 2008

SALES OF $4.8 BILLION WERE 26 PERCENT LOWER REFLECTING 18 PERCENT LOWER VOLUME, 6 PERCENT DECREASE IN USD SELLING

PRICES, AND A 2 PERCENT REDUCTION RELATED TO PORTFOLIO CHANGES. THE DECREASE IN VOLUME MAINLY REFLECTS THE EFFECT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION AND THE INVENTORY DESTOCKING EXPERIENCED

DURING THE FIRST HALF 2009. HOWEVER, SALES CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED DURING THE SECOND HALF 2009, BOTH SEQUENTIALLY AND WHEN COMPARED TO 2008, MAINLY DUE TO OVERALL ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND HIGHER SALES TO

THE MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY. THE LOWER USD SELLING PRICES WERE A COMBINATION OF SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER PRODUCT SALES MIX, UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS, AND FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, LOWER USD SELLING PRICES

IN RESPONSE TO LOWER FEEDSTOCK COSTS.

2009

PTOI WAS $287 MILLION COMPARED TO $128 MILLION IN 2008. THE IMPROVEMENT IN PTOI REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF LOWER RAW MATERIAL, ENERGY AND FREIGHT COSTS, LOWER FIXED COSTS, THE ABSENCE

OF A $216 MILLION HURRICANE-RELATED CHARGE IN 2008, AN $82 MILLION BENEFIT IN 2009 FROM HURRICANE-RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND A REDUCTION IN THE HURRICANE-RELATED ACCRUAL, AND THE

NET YEAR OVER YEAR IMPACT OF THE 2008 AND 2009 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING ADDITIONAL INSURANCE RECOVERIES IN THE RANGE OF $50  $100 MILLION.

OUTLOOK

2011 SALES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW DUE TO ANTICIPATED INCREASES IN GLOBAL MOTOR VEHICLE OEMS BUILDS AND CONTINUED STRENGTH, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA

PACIFIC, FOR MOST OF THE MARKETS SERVED BY THE SEGMENT. PTOI IS ALSO EXPECTED TO IMPROVE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER SALES, IMPROVED FIXED COST PRODUCTIVITY AND MARKET-DRIVEN INNOVATIONS FOR PRODUCTS

AND PROCESSES.

2010 VERSUS 2009

AND INCREASED DEMAND ACROSS ALL REGIONS, LED BY EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC, AND MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN ARAMID AND NONWOVEN PRODUCTS. FURTHER PENETRATION IN THE U.S. COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKETS LED

TO HIGHER SALES AS RECOVERY IN GLOBAL CONSTRUCTION MARKETS REMAINED WEAK. SALES FOR CONSULTING AND TRAINING SERVICES IMPROVED MODESTLY ACROSS MOST REGIONS, LED BY ASIA PACIFIC.

PTOI

WAS $454 MILLION COMPARED TO $260 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME AND THE ABSENCE OF A NET $45 MILLION RESTRUCTURING

CHARGE IN PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPENDING FOR GROWTH INITIATIVES AND HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS.

2009 VERSUS 2008

SALES OF $2.8 BILLION WERE 25 PERCENT LOWER THAN 2008, DUE TO A 23 PERCENT DECLINE IN VOLUME AND 3 PERCENT LOWER USD

SELLING PRICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1 PERCENT INCREASE FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES. THE LOWER VOLUME REFLECTS DECREASED DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS ACROSS ALL MARKETS AND REGIONS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE

ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THE LOWER USD SELLING PRICES WERE MAINLY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACT IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC.

PTOI

WAS $260 MILLION COMPARED TO $661 MILLION IN 2008. THE DECREASE IN EARNINGS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER VOLUME AND CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH LOW CAPACITY UTILIZATION OF

PRODUCTION UNITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FIXED COSTS REDUCTIONS.

OUTLOOK

FOR 2011, SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM IMPROVED GLOBAL MARKET CONDITIONS. DEMAND FOR KEVLAR®, NOMEX® AND TYVEK®

PRODUCTS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE ACROSS ALL REGIONS WITH CONTINUED STRENGTH IN INDUSTRIAL, CONSUMER AND AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS. SALES RELATED TO THE BUILDING INNOVATIONS BUSINESS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE

DUE TO FORECASTED IMPROVEMENTS IN CONSTRUCTION MARKETS ACROSS MOST REGIONS. SALES RELATED TO THE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE MODESTLY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF THE

PHARMACEUTICALS'

COZAAR®/HYZAAR® INCOME IS THE SUM OF TWO PARTS: INCOME RELATED TO A SHARE OF THE PROFITS FROM NORTH AMERICAN SALES AND CERTAIN MARKETS IN EMEA, AND ROYALTY

INCOME DERIVED FROM WORLDWIDE CONTRACT NET SALES LINKED TO THE EXCLUSIVITY TERM IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY. PATENTS AND EXCLUSIVITY STARTED TO EXPIRE IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE U.S. EXCLUSIVITY FOR

COZAAR® ENDED IN APRIL 2010. THE WORLDWIDE AGREEMENT TERMINATES WHEN THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET: (I) THE CANADIAN EXCLUSIVITY ENDS, AND (II) NORTH AMERICAN SALES FALL

BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED ITS FIRST SIGNIFICANT STEP-DOWN IN INCOME FROM COZAAR®/HYZAAR® IN 2010 AND EXPECTS A CONTINUED STEP-DOWN

EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR TO ZERO WHEN THE CONTRACT ENDS. IN GENERAL, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS A TRADITIONAL SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH DECLINE FOR A DRUG GOING OFF PATENT IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $63 MILLION CHARGE TO OTHER INCOME, NET AND A REDUCTION TO ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, NET IN THE PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT TO REFLECT

INCREASED REBATES AND OTHER SALES DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE COZAAR®/HYZAAR® LICENSING AGREEMENT.

OUTLOOK

COZAAR®/HYZAAR® INCOME IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF A MAJORITY OF THE WORLDWIDE

PATENTS WHICH OCCURRED IN 2010. EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY FROM THE COLLABORATION WITH MERCK ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE IN 2011 ABOUT $290 MILLION PRE-TAX FROM EARNINGS

GENERATED IN 2010.

OTHER

THE COMPANY INCLUDES CERTAIN EMBRYONIC BUSINESSES NOT INCLUDED IN THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SUCH AS APPLIED BIOSCIENCES AND NONALIGNED BUSINESSES IN OTHER. THE POTENTIAL

VIABILITY OF EACH EMBRYONIC BUSINESS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE AND PRODUCTION RAMP UP CAPABILITIES. USING THESE FACTORS AND OTHERS,

MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL AND FIT OF THESE BUSINESSES AND MAY MAKE INVESTMENT ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON SUCH ASSESSMENTS. APPLIED BIOSCIENCES IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING COST ADVANTAGED

PRODUCTS WITH SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AND A SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT THAT ARE BASED ON A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL AND MATERIAL SCIENCE CAPABILITIES. SPECIFIC GLOBAL GROWTH

PROJECTS ACROSS THE COMPANY ARE CONSOLIDATED WITHIN APPLIED BIOSCIENCES TO CAPITALIZE ON THE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND TECHNOLOGY NEEDS IN THIS HIGH-GROWTH INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BIOMATERIALS

AND ADVANCED BIOFUELS PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.

APPLIED

BIOSCIENCES IS DEVELOPING TWO BIOFUELS BUSINESSES: ONE TO COMMERCIALIZE NON-FOOD, CELLULOSIC ETHANOL AND THE SECOND TO COMMERCIALIZE BIOBUTANOL. DUPONT IS PURSUING

COMMERCIALIZATION THROUGH TWO JOINT VENTURES: DUPONT DANISCO CELLULOSIC ETHANOL LLC (DDCE) AND BUTAMAX ADVANCED BIOFUELS LLC, RESPECTIVELY. DDCE NOW OPERATES A DEMONSTRATION

SCALE FACILITY IN VONORE, TENNESSEE AND BUTAMAX NOW OPERATES A DEMONSTRATION SCALE FACILITY IN HULL, UNITED KINGDOM. BOTH JOINT VENTURES ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING COMMERCIALIZATION

CAPABILITIES.

DUPONT

PROPRIETARY FERMENTATION AND PURIFICATION PROCESS. BIO-PDO IS THE KEY BUILDING BLOCK FOR DUPONT SORONA® RENEWABLY SOURCED POLYMER. THE JOINT VENTURE

ALSO MARKETS DIRECT SALE OF BIO-PDO UNDER THE ZEMEA® PROPANEDIOL AND SUSTERRA® PROPANEDIOL BRANDS AS A KEY RENEWABLE INGREDIENT IN PRODUCTS RANGING

FROM INDUSTRIAL TO PERSONAL CARE USES. DUPONT TATE & LYLE BIO PRODUCTS LLC IS CURRENTLY EXPANDING CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION OF BIO-PDO, WHICH IS

SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION IN 2011.

IN

2010, THE APPLIED BIOSCIENCES BUSINESS ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION, PENDING EUROPEAN UNION APPROVALS, OF ACTAMAX SURGICAL MATERIALS LLC, A JOINT VENTURE WITH ROYAL DSM N.V.

2009

PRE-TAX LOSS OF $171 MILLION COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $181 MILLION IN 2008. THE LOWER PRE-TAX LOSS FOR THE YEAR WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE NET YEAR OVER YEAR IMPACT

OF THE 2008 AND 2009 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, AND LOWER PRE-TAX LOSS FOR APPLIED BIOSCIENCES.

LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH

REQUIREMENTS TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL SPENDING, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DEBT MATURITIES AND OTHER CASH NEEDS. THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES, BILATERAL CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS AND

ASSET SALES. THE COMPANY'S CURRENT STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RATINGS PROVIDE EXCELLENT ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, CASH GENERATING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED

INCLUDING SPENDING AND WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTIONS AND RESTRUCTURING TO BETTER ALIGN EXPENDITURES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGING

CONDITIONS.

PURSUANT

TO ITS CASH DISCIPLINE POLICY, THE COMPANY SEEKS FIRST TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND, TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH IS

COMPELLING. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES OF $6.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, PROVIDE PRIMARY LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ALL SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION IN UNUSED CREDIT LINES WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO MEET SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DEBT PORTFOLIO AND OCCASIONALLY MAY REBALANCE IT TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND AN OPTIMUM DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE. IN 2010, THE COMPANY ISSUED $0.5 BILLION

OF 1.95% SENIOR NOTES DUE JANUARY 15, 2016, $1.0 BILLION OF 3.625% SENIOR NOTES DUE JANUARY 15, 2021 AND $0.5 BILLION OF 4.90% SENIOR NOTES DUE JANUARY 15, 2041. THE

COMPANY ELECTED TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS TO REDEEM $0.5 BILLION OF ITS 5.00% SENIOR NOTES DUE JANUARY 15, 2013 AND $0.8 BILLION OF ITS 5.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE JANUARY 15,

2014 AND PAY DOWN COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED TO FUND THE $0.5 BILLION VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF DANISCO WITH ABOUT $3.0 BILLION IN EXISTING CASH AND THE REMAINDER IN NEW DEBT. THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED IN THE SECOND

QUARTER 2011 AND IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS AND THE TENDER OF MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF DANISCO SHARES IN THE TENDER OFFER. IN CONNECTION

WITH THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $4 BILLION BRIDGE

LOAN FACILITY AND A $2 BILLION BRIDGE LOAN FACILITY. THE LATTER REQUIRES THE COMPANY HAVE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT LEAST EQUAL TO $2 BILLION ON HAND AT ALL

TIMES AND READILY AVAILABLE FOR USE TO PURCHASE DANISCO'S SHARES. THE BRIDGE LOAN FACILITIES TERMINATE WHEN THE COMPANY COMPLETES THE FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION.

DURING

2010, STANDARD & POOR'S AND MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE REVISED THE COMPANY'S CREDIT OUTLOOK TO "STABLE" FROM "NEGATIVE". AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE POTENTIAL ACQUISITION OF DANISCO,

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE PLACED ALL OF THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS UNDER REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE. STANDARD & POOR'S HAS RESPONDED TO THE ACQUISITION ANNOUNCEMENT BY PLACING THE COMPANY

ON CREDIT WATCH WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS. FITCH RATINGS ANNOUNCED IT WILL TAKE NO IMMEDIATE ACTION WITH REGARD TO THE COMPANY'S RATINGS.

THE COMPANY'S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $4.6 BILLION IN 2010, A $0.2 BILLION DECREASE COMPARED TO 2009. HIGHER EARNINGS WERE OFFSET

BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER SALES AND INVENTORY; THE STRONGER DOLLAR, WHICH WAS HEDGED WITH FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS REFLECTED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES; AND

THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE

COMPANY'S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $4.7 BILLION IN 2009, A $1.6 BILLION INCREASE FROM THE $3.1 BILLION GENERATED IN 2008. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE BENEFIT OF THE WEAKER DOLLAR, WHICH WAS HEDGED BY FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $1.5 BILLION, $1.3 BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. SPENDING IN 2010 REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S

CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN CAPACITY EXPANSION TO SUPPORT AREAS OF GROWTH. THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2011 PURCHASES OF PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT TO BE $1.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $0.3 BILLION

FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT NOT RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO

GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANIES DO NOT CALCULATE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THE SAME MANNER AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S FREE CASH FLOW DEFINITION MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT

WITH THE METHODOLOGIES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND THEREFORE INDICATES

OPERATING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES, AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CASH

FLOW AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND IS AN INTEGRAL FINANCIAL MEASURE USED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS.

2010

FREE CASH FLOW OF $3.1 BILLION EXCEEDED THE COMPANY'S TARGET OF GREATER THAN $1.7 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS AND WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY.

TOTAL

DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS $10.3 BILLION, A $0.7 BILLION DECREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE DECREASE IN DEBT REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S POSITIVE CASH FLOW GENERATED

FROM GENERAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

TOTAL

DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS $11.0 BILLION, A $1.4 BILLION INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE INCREASED BORROWINGS WERE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN

CONSECUTIVE DIVIDEND SINCE THE COMPANY'S FIRST DIVIDEND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 1904.

THE

COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $2 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN IN JUNE 2001. DURING 2010, THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 5.4 MILLION SHARES AT A TOTAL COST OF

$250 MILLION UNDER THIS PLAN. DURING 2009 AND 2008, THERE WERE NO PURCHASES OF STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED 25.9 MILLION SHARES AT A

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

CERTAIN GUARANTEE CONTRACTS

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN

CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, THE COMPANY HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS

AND DIVESTITURES AND RELATED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES,

COMPANY,

SUCH AS ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE

TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS RECORDED

FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE $100 MILLION. ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO THE NATURE OF

INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE 2004 SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE NET ASSETS OF TEXTILES AND INTERIORS, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED THE PURCHASERS, SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH INDUSTRIES, INC. (INVISTA), AGAINST

CERTAIN LIABILITIES PRIMARILY

RELATED TO TAXES, LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WAS $70 MILLION AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE INDEMNIFICATIONS BALANCE OF $100 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE

COMPANY'S TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CANNOT EXCEED $1.4 BILLION. THE OTHER INDEMNITIES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT. IN MARCH 2008,

INVISTA FILED SUIT IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WERE BREACHED AND, THEREFORE, THAT DUPONT IS OBLIGATED

TO INDEMNIFY IT. DUPONT DISAGREES WITH THE EXTENT AND VALUE OF INVISTA'S CLAIMS. DUPONT HAS NOT CHANGED ITS ESTIMATE OF ITS TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AS A

RESULT OF THE LAWSUIT.

OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHERS

THE

COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER AFFILIATED

COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD DIRECTLY GUARANTEED $544 MILLION OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND $16 MILLION RELATING TO GUARANTEES OF OBLIGATIONS FOR DIVESTED

SUBSIDIARIES. THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM

ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, A LIABILITY OF $109 MILLION AND $146 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WAS RECORDED FOR

THESE OBLIGATIONS, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK WHICH THE COMPANY DEEMS PROBABLE. THIS LIABILITY IS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S POLYESTER FILMS JOINT

VENTURE WHICH ARE GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY.

EXISTING

GUARANTEES FOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS AROSE AS PART OF CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS. EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES AROSE FOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN NORMAL

OPERATIONS. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY HAS RECOURSE TO ASSETS HELD AS COLLATERAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL GUARANTEES FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.

THE

COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO A DIVESTED SUBSIDIARY, CONOCO, WHICH HAS INDEMNIFIED THE COMPANY FOR ANY LIABILITIES THE COMPANY MAY INCUR PURSUANT TO THESE

GUARANTEES. NO MATERIAL LOSS IS ANTICIPATED BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD NO LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS.

ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S GUARANTEES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HAD TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT

PAYMENTS TO SATISFY GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SATISFY THESE GUARANTEES.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A

LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS

AND SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES (OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS). APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S

WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS. PENSION

COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES ALTERNATIVE

SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE. WHERE PERMITTED BY

APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE PENSION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.

IN

2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED MAJOR CHANGES TO THE PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS THAT COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES. SUCH EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE U.S. AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2006 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS BUT RECEIVE BENEFITS IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

BENEFITS

UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH

APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE

REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS' ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. THE COMPANY MADE A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION OF

$500 MILLION IN 2010 TO ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN. NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED OR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED TO BE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2011. CONTRIBUTIONS BEYOND 2011

ARE NOT DETERMINABLE SINCE THE AMOUNT OF ANY CONTRIBUTION IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS. U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED

FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.

FUNDING

FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND PENSION EXPENSE.

IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $782 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS IN 2010 AND ANTICIPATES THAT IT

WILL MAKE APPROXIMATELY $305 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2011 TO PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE

COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRE-TAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL

NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $321 MILLION, $323 MILLION AND $326 MILLION FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT

$320 MILLION IN 2011. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS REFLECT THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS, DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS

AND DEDUCTIBLES.

THE ABOVE (BENEFITS) CHARGES FOR PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR. THE INCREASES IN

PENSION EXPENSE IN 2010 AND 2009 PRIMARILY RELATED TO DECREASES IN THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF THE ASSETS IN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN. SEE "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" UNDER THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE 22 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE

COMPANY'S KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND THE

DISCOUNT RATE (SEE NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2011, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT $60 MILLION, PRIMARILY

DUE TO LOWER DISCOUNT RATES.

OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED BENEFITS

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED REVISIONS TO ITS VACATION BENEFITS POLICY COVERING ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2010,

ENTITLED VACATION FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR WILL NO LONGER VEST AT THE END OF EACH PRECEDING YEAR. IN ADDITION, VACATION WILL BE EARNED MONTHLY AND ACCRUED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH CALENDAR MONTH DURING

THE YEAR BEGINNING IN 2011. THESE REVISIONS TO THE COMPANY'S VACATION BENEFITS POLICY PROVIDED A ONE-TIME BENEFIT OF $148 MILLION IN 2010.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, PRODUCT HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. SUCH RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY THE IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY, AND THE COMPANY MONITORS THESE CHANGES CLOSELY. COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED

LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTS VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, MINIMIZE THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WATER USE AND

DISCHARGES, INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS. MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A GLOBAL UPWARD TREND IN THE AMOUNT AND COMPLEXITY

OF PROPOSED CHEMICALS REGULATION. THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

OPERATING COSTS

AS

A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY INCURS COSTS FOR POLLUTION ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF AIR

POLLUTION CONTROLS AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT, EMISSIONS TESTING AND MONITORING, AND OBTAINING PERMITS. THE COMPANY ALSO INCURS COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD AND TREATMENT STUDIES AS WELL AS TOXICITY AND DEGRADATION TESTING TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PRODUCTS AND RAW MATERIALS. RELATED TO THESE ACTIVITIES, THE

COMPANY INCURRED ENVIRONMENTAL OPERATING COSTS OF $501 MILLION, $483 MILLION AND $525 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

REMEDIATION

EXPENDITURES

RCRA,

WHICH EXTENSIVELY REGULATES THE TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE, REQUIRES THAT PERMITTED FACILITIES UNDERTAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

CONTAMINATION. IF CONDITIONS

WARRANT, COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY PRIOR OPERATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO CERCLA, THE COSTS OF THE RCRA CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY BORNE SOLELY BY THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT SIGNIFICANT ONGOING EXPENDITURES FOR RCRA REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES MAY BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEAR TERM, HOWEVER, ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RANGE OF SUCH EXPENDITURES EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE

SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANY'S EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE $52 MILLION, $49 MILLION AND $51 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008,

RESPECTIVELY.

FROM

TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION OR NOTICES OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM EPA AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IS A PRP UNDER CERCLA OR SIMILAR

STATE STATUTES. CERCLA IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERFUND AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE IT CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS

OR WHERE COMPANY GENERATED WASTE HAS BEEN DISPOSED. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO, ON OCCASION, BEEN ENGAGED IN COST RECOVERY LITIGATION INITIATED BY THOSE AGENCIES OR BY PRIVATE PARTIES. THESE REQUESTS,

NOTICES AND LAWSUITS ASSERT POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT VARIOUS SITES THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT COMPANY OWNED, BUT ALLEGEDLY CONTAIN WASTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S PAST OPERATIONS.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA OR STATE LAWS AT ABOUT 405 SITES AROUND THE U.S., WITH ACTIVE REMEDIATION UNDER WAY AT APPROXIMATELY

160 OF THESE SITES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED ITS LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 170 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN "DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS"

WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANY'S, REPRESENTED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT 10 NEW SITES DURING 2010

COMPARED WITH THREE AND FIVE SIMILAR NOTICES IN 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH CERCLA AND SIMILAR STATE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY

$21 MILLION, $18 MILLION AND $17 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR

NEARLY ALL SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TOTAL SITE REMEDIATION COSTS BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF WASTE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY VERSUS

THAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALL OTHER PRPS AT ANY GIVEN SITE IS TYPICALLY RELATIVELY LOW. OTHER PRPS AT SITES, WHERE THE COMPANY IS A PARTY, TYPICALLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS

AND, WHERE THEY DO NOT, OR WHERE PRPS CANNOT BE LOCATED OR HAVE DECLARED BANKRUPTCY, THE COMPANY'S OWN SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS NOT MATERIALLY INCREASED. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW SITES WHERE THE COMPANY

IS A MAJOR PARTICIPANT AND THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF REMEDIATION AT THOSE SITES AND AT ALL CERCLA SITES IN THE AGGREGATE, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

TOTAL

PAYMENTS FOR PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES UNDER RCRA, CERCLA AND SIMILAR STATE AND GLOBAL LAWS WERE $82 MILLION, $72 MILLION AND $81 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY.

REMEDIATION

ACCRUALS

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS INCLUDED AN ACCRUED LIABILITY OF $407 MILLION RELATED TO ACTIVITIES UNDER RCRA, CERCLA AND SIMILAR STATE

AND GLOBAL LAWS COMPARED TO $396 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO RCRA, AND,

UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. OF THE $407 MILLION ACCRUED LIABILITY,

APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT WAS RESERVED FOR NON-U.S. FACILITIES. APPROXIMATELY 68 PERCENT OF THE

RESERVE BALANCE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION LIABILITIES, WHILE ABOUT 23 PERCENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERCLA LIABILITIES. INCREASES TO REMEDIATION ACCRUALS WERE

$93 MILLION, $89 MILLION AND $103 MILLION FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT A MATERIAL LOSS, IN

EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ACCRUED, RELATED TO REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT ANY INDIVIDUAL SITE OR LOCATION IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE.

AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES, IF ANY, IN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

IN

2010, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL

ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION IN 2011. IN THE U.S., SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA). UNTIL ALL

CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING FUTURE ESTIMATES FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL CAA CAPITAL COSTS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE

CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO RANGE FROM $40 MILLION TO $70 MILLION.

CLIMATE

CHANGE

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE THAT WILL PRESENT RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BUSINESS AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. SINCE THE EARLY 1990S WHEN

THE COMPANY BEGAN TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, THE COMPANY HAS ACHIEVED MAJOR GLOBAL REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS. VOLUNTARY EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMPANY AND OTHER

COMPANIES ARE VALUABLE BUT ALONE WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS A PROBLEM OF THIS SCALE. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC POLICIES TO REDUCE

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ENCOURAGE LOWER CARBON FORMS OF ENERGY.

THE

KYOTO PROTOCOL TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE ENTERED INTO FORCE IN FEBRUARY 2005 AND, WHILE NOT RATIFIED BY THE U.S., HAS SPURRED POLICY ACTION BY MANY OTHER

COUNTRIES AND REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION. CONSIDERABLE INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION IS NOW FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT OF A POST-2012 INTERNATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK TO

GUIDE INTERNATIONAL ACTION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN THE KYOTO

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

PROTOCOL

EXPIRES IN 2012. PROPOSED AND EXISTING LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CONTROL OR LIMIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ENERGY SOURCE AND SUPPLY CHOICES AS WELL AS INCREASE THE

COST OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM FOSSIL FUELS. SUCH EFFORTS ARE ALSO ANTICIPATED TO PROVIDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THE REGULATORY FUTURE, HELP GUIDE INVESTMENT

DECISIONS, AND DRIVE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR LOW-CARBON AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES.

AT

THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL, THERE ARE EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE REGULATED UNDER THE EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME.

IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., POLICY DEBATE CONTINUES. THE CURRENT UNSETTLED POLICY ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.S. ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY TO BUSINESS DECISIONS PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING

TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IF IN THE ABSENCE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION, STATES WERE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS MANDATING GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS, THE COMPANY, ITS

SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS COULD BE COMPETITIVELY DISADVANTAGED BY THE ADDED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND BURDEN OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF STATE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

A

2007 U.S. SUPREME COURT RULING DIRECTED EPA TO DETERMINE WHETHER CARBON DIOXIDE ENDANGERS HUMAN HEALTH AND, IF SO, TO TAKE STEPS TO REGULATE IT UNDER THE CAA. IN DECEMBER 2009, EPA MADE A

DETERMINATION THAT CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS ENDANGER HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT REQUIRING EPA TO PURSUE REGULATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS UNDER THE CAA. IN 2010, EPA LAUNCHED A PHASED IN

SCHEME TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS UNDER CAA REGULATIONS KNOWN AS THE PREVENTION OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION (PSD) RULES. THE PSD RULES REQUIRE THAT BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (BACT) BE

INSTALLED ON MAJOR NEW OR MODIFIED SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS. BACT CONTROLS FOR GHG EMISSIONS CAN REQUIRE VERY LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. EPA HAS NOT PROVIDED FINAL GUIDANCE REGARDING BACT

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, EPA IN 2010 PUT IN PLACE OPERATING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR MAJOR NEW OR MODIFIED SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS. EPA WILL NOT REQUIRE PERMITS FOR SMALLER SOURCES UNTIL 2016 OR

LATER. BOTH CONGRESSIONAL AND LITIGATION EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO DELAY OR REMOVE EPA'S AUTHORITY TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS AND TO ENFORCE GHG REPORTING AND PERMITTING REGULATIONS.

THIS

TYPE OF GHG EMISSIONS REGULATION BY EPA, IN THE ABSENCE OF OR IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL LEGISLATION, COULD RESULT IN MORE COSTLY, LESS EFFICIENT FACILITY-BY-FACILITY CONTROLS

VERSUS A FEDERAL, MARKET-BASED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. DIFFERENCES IN REGIONAL OR NATIONAL LEGISLATION COULD PRESENT CHALLENGES IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR COORDINATED GLOBAL

POLICY ACTION.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009, EPA ISSUED THE FINAL MANDATORY REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GASES RULE WHICH REQUIRES REPORTING OF GHG EMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES BEGINNING IN 2010. THE RULE REQUIRES

SUPPLIERS OF FOSSIL FUELS OR INDUSTRIAL GREENHOUSE GASES, MANUFACTURERS OF VEHICLES AND ENGINES, AND FACILITIES THAT EMIT 25,000 METRIC TONS OR MORE PER YEAR OF GHG EMISSIONS TO SUBMIT ANNUAL REPORTS

TO EPA. THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 25 SITES THAT HAVE A STAKE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COVERED GASES, INCLUDING SEVERAL AT WHICH EMISSIONS MONITORING EQUIPMENT MUST BE INSTALLED. COSTS INCURRED IN

2010 TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE OF RULEMAKING RELATED TO THIS RULE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT FUTURE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE WILL BE

MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE

COMPANY ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL RISKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE COULD PRESENT, AND LOOKS FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE ITS OVERALL PORTFOLIO LESS ENERGY AND EMISSIONS INTENSIVE. THE COMPANY WEIGHS ENERGY USE

WHEN INVESTMENTS OR DIVESTITURES ARE CONSIDERED. THE COMPANY CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED DEMANDS OF A

LOW-CARBON ECONOMY.

REGISTRATION

THE

GOAL OF THE U.S. TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) IS TO PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISKS OF INJURY TO HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURE, PROCESSING,

DISTRIBUTION IN COMMERCE, USE, OR DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES. UNDER TSCA, THE EPA HAS ESTABLISHED REPORTING, RECORD-KEEPING, TESTING AND CONTROL-RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW AND EXISTING

CHEMICALS. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, EPA ANNOUNCED ITS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ENHANCE THE AGENCY'S CURRENT CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM UNDER TSCA, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF ACTION PLANS. THE AGENCY'S

ACTIONS ON CHEMICALS MAY INCLUDE INITIATING REGULATORY ACTION TO LABEL, RESTRICT, OR BAN A CHEMICAL, OR TO REQUIRE THE

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

SUBMISSION

OF ADDITIONAL DATA NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE RISK A CHEMICAL MAY POSE. ALSO IN 2009, EPA ANNOUNCED ITS "ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE FOR REFORM OF CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT LEGISLATION." THE COMPANY IS

MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS UNDER TSCA.

IN

DECEMBER 2006, THE EUROPEAN UNION ADOPTED A NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK CONCERNING THE REGISTRATION, EVALUATION AND AUTHORIZATION OF CHEMICALS. THIS REGULATORY FRAMEWORK KNOWN AS REACH ENTERED INTO

FORCE ON JUNE 1, 2007. ONE OF ITS MAIN OBJECTIVES IS THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. REACH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE PROPERTIES OF

THEIR SUBSTANCES THAT MEET CERTAIN VOLUME OR TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA AND REGISTER THE INFORMATION IN A CENTRAL DATABASE TO BE MAINTAINED BY THE EUROPEAN CHEMICALS AGENCY. THE REGULATION ALSO CONTAINS A

MECHANISM FOR THE PROGRESSIVE SUBSTITUTION OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CHEMICALS WHEN SUITABLE ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. COMPLETE REGISTRATIONS CONTAINING EXTENSIVE DATA ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF

THE CHEMICAL WILL BE REQUIRED IN THREE PHASES, DEPENDING ON PRODUCTION USAGE OR TONNAGE IMPORTED PER YEAR, AND THE TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA OF THE CHEMICAL. THE FIRST REGISTRATIONS FOR SUBSTANCES THAT

WERE PREREGISTERED IN 2008 WERE REQUIRED IN 2010; SUBSEQUENT REGISTRATIONS ARE DUE IN 2013 AND 2018. NEW SUBSTANCES THAT WILL BE MANUFACTURED OR IMPORTED NEED TO BE REGISTERED PRIOR TO BEING PLACED ON

THE MARKET (ALSO KNOWN AS NON-PHASE-IN SUBSTANCES). THE COMPANY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE 2010 REGISTRATIONS AND IS WORKING ON THE NON-PHASE-IN

REGISTRATIONS. BY JUNE 1, 2011, COMPANIES MUST NOTIFY THE EUROPEAN CHEMICALS AGENCY OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING ABOVE 0.1 PERCENT OF SUBSTANCES OF VERY HIGH CONCERN ON THE CANDIDATE LIST FOR

AUTHORIZATION. THERE ARE NOW 46 SUCH SUBSTANCES AND THE NOTICE PROCESS MAY CREATE PRESSURE FOR SUBSTITUTION AWAY FROM THESE SUBSTANCES. BY JUNE 1, 2013, THE COMMISSION WILL REVIEW WHETHER

SUBSTANCES WITH ENDOCRINE DISRUPTIVE PROPERTIES SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED IF SAFER ALTERNATIVES EXIST. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH REACH WILL BE MATERIAL TO ITS OPERATIONS AND

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

FACILITY SECURITY

DUPONT RECOGNIZES THAT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF ITS OPERATIONS ARE CRITICAL TO ITS EMPLOYEES, NEIGHBORS AND, INDEED, TO THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY.

AS SUCH, THE COMPANY HAS MERGED CHEMICAL SITE SECURITY INTO ITS SAFETY CORE VALUE WHERE IT SERVES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ITS LONG STANDING SAFETY CULTURE. PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN COMBINED

WITH PROCESS SAFETY MEASURES (INCLUDING THE USE OF INHERENTLY SAFER TECHNOLOGY), ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PREPAREDNESS INTO AN INTEGRATED SECURITY PLAN. THE COMPANY HAS

CONDUCTED VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AT OPERATING FACILITIES IN THE U.S. AND HIGH PRIORITY SITES WORLDWIDE AND IDENTIFIED AND IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES FROM PHYSICAL

AND CYBER ATTACKS. DUPONT IS PARTNERING WITH CARRIERS, INCLUDING RAILROAD, SHIPPING AND TRUCKING COMPANIES, TO SECURE CHEMICALS IN TRANSIT.

IN

APRIL 2007, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) ISSUED AN INTERIM FINAL RULE (RULE) THAT ESTABLISHES RISK-BASED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THE SECURITY OF U.S. CHEMICAL FACILITIES.

COVERED CHEMICAL FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE SECURITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS THAT IDENTIFY FACILITY SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SITE SECURITY PLANS THAT INCLUDE

MEASURES SATISFYING THE IDENTIFIED RISK-BASED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THE RULE CONTAINS ASSOCIATED PROVISIONS ADDRESSING INSPECTIONS AND AUDITS, RECORDKEEPING, AND THE PROTECTION OF

INFORMATION THAT CONSTITUTES CHEMICAL-TERRORISM VULNERABILITY INFORMATION. DHS CAN SEEK COMPLIANCE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ORDERS, INCLUDING ORDERS ASSESSING CIVIL PENALTY AND ORDERS FOR THE CESSATION

OF OPERATIONS.

IN

JUNE 2008, DHS NOTIFIED THOSE FACILITIES THAT WERE PRELIMINARILY DETERMINED TO BE COVERED BY THE RULE'S SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. DUPONT FACILITIES THAT WERE PRELIMINARILY DETERMINED TO BE COVERED

CONDUCTED AND SUBMITTED SECURITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS TO DHS. BASED ON ITS REVIEW OF THESE ASSESSMENTS, DHS MADE FINAL DETERMINATIONS AS TO WHICH FACILITIES WERE COVERED AND THE

RISK-BASE TIER INTO WHICH EACH FALLS. THESE FACILITIES ARE SUBMITTING SITE SECURITY PLANS TO DHS. ONCE DHS HAS REVIEWED AND PROVIDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE PLANS, IT WILL MEET WITH

FACILITIES BEFORE PROVIDING FINAL APPROVAL. DUPONT HAS ALREADY DEVOTED SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT AND RESOURCES IN ASSESSING SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND TAKING STEPS TO REINFORCE SECURITY AT ITS CHEMICAL

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. UNTIL EACH FACILITY DEVELOPS AND RECEIVES DHS APPROVAL FOR ITS SITE SECURITY PLAN, SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED AND CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS REGARDING

ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. HOWEVER, BASED ON GUIDANCE ISSUED BY DHS REGARDING ITS RISK-BASED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT NEW SECURITY MEASURES WILL NEED TO

BE IMPLEMENTED

45

PFOA

DUPONT MANUFACTURES FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AS WELL AS FLUOROTELOMERS, MARKETING MANY OF THEM UNDER THE TEFLON® AND

ZONYL® BRANDS. ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE PART OF THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT.

FLUOROPOLYMER

RESINS AND DISPERSIONS ARE HIGH-PERFORMANCE MATERIALS WITH MANY END USES INCLUDING ARCHITECTURAL FABRICS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONIC WIRING INSULATION, AUTOMOTIVE FUEL

SYSTEMS, COMPUTER CHIP PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, WEATHER-RESISTANT/BREATHABLE APPAREL AND NON-STICK COOKWARE. FLUOROTELOMERS ARE USED TO MAKE SOIL, STAIN AND GREASE REPELLANTS FOR PAPER,

APPAREL, UPHOLSTERY AND CARPETS AS WELL AS FIREFIGHTING FOAMS AND COATINGS.

A

FORM OF PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT) IS USED AS A PROCESSING AGENT TO MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS. FOR OVER

50 YEARS, DUPONT PURCHASED ITS PFOA NEEDS FROM A THIRD PARTY, BUT BEGINNING IN THE FALL OF 2002, IT BEGAN PRODUCING PFOA TO SUPPORT THE MANUFACTURE OF FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS. PFOA

IS NOT USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FLUOROTELOMERS; HOWEVER, IT IS AN UNINTENDED BY-PRODUCT PRESENT AT TRACE LEVELS IN SOME FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS.

DUPONT

PERFORMANCE ELASTOMERS, LLC (DPE) USES PFOA IN THE MANUFACTURE OF RAW MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURE KALREZ® PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS. PFOA IS ALSO USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SOME

FLUOROELASTOMERS MARKETED BY DPE UNDER THE VITON® TRADEMARK. THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY IS A PART OF THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT.

PFOA

IS BIO-PERSISTENT AND HAS BEEN DETECTED AT VERY LOW LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. AS A RESULT, EPA INITIATED A PROCESS TO ENHANCE ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOURCES OF

PFOA IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH HUMAN EXPOSURE TO PFOA IS OCCURRING. IN 2005, EPA ISSUED A DRAFT RISK ASSESSMENT ON PFOA STATING THAT THE CANCER DATA FOR PFOA MAY BE BEST

DESCRIBED AS "SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE OF CARCINOGENICITY, BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO ASSESS HUMAN CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL" UNDER EPA'S GUIDELINES FOR CARCINOGEN RISK ASSESSMENT. AT EPA'S REQUEST, THE SCIENCE

ADVISORY BOARD (SAB) REVIEWED AND COMMENTED ON THE SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS OF THIS ASSESSMENT. IN ITS MAY 2006 REPORT, THE SAB SET FORTH THE VIEW, BASED ON LABORATORY STUDIES IN RATS, THAT THE HUMAN

CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL OF PFOA IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDELINES' DESCRIPTOR OF "LIKELY TO BE CARCINOGENIC." HOWEVER, THE REPORT STATED THAT ADDITIONAL DATA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE EPA

FINALIZES ITS RISK ASSESSMENT OF PFOA. EPA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER ADDITIONAL DATA, INCLUDING NEW RESEARCH AND TESTING, AND HAS INDICATED THAT ANOTHER SAB REVIEW WILL BE SOUGHT AFTER

EPA MAKES ITS RISK ASSESSMENT. DUPONT DISPUTES THE CANCER CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDED IN THE SAB REPORT. ALTHOUGH EPA HAS STATED THAT THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY REGARDING

POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA, IT ALSO STATED THAT IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY REASON FOR CONSUMERS TO STOP USING ANY PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT PFOA.

DUPONT

RESPECTS EPA'S POSITION RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPOSURE ROUTES AND THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF PFOA AND DUPONT AND OTHER COMPANIES HAVE OUTLINED PLANS TO CONTINUE RESEARCH, EMISSION REDUCTION

AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES TO HELP ADDRESS EPA'S QUESTIONS. IN JANUARY 2006, DUPONT PLEDGED ITS COMMITMENT TO EPA'S 2010/15 PFOA STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. THE EPA PROGRAM ASKS PARTICIPANTS

(1) TO COMMIT TO ACHIEVE, NO LATER THAN 2010, A 95 PERCENT REDUCTION IN BOTH FACILITY EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT CONTENT LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS

AND (2) TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE ELIMINATION OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY NO LATER THAN 2015. IN OCTOBER 2010, (FOR THE

YEAR 2009), DUPONT REPORTED TO EPA THAT IT HAD ACHIEVED ABOUT A 99 PERCENT REDUCTION OF PFOA EMISSIONS IN U.S. MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE COMPANY ACHIEVED ABOUT A 98 PERCENT REDUCTION

IN GLOBAL MANUFACTURING EMISSIONS, EXCEEDING EPA'S 2010 OBJECTIVE. IN FEBRUARY 2007, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS COMMITMENT TO NO LONGER MAKE, USE OR BUY PFOA BY 2015, OR SOONER IF POSSIBLE. TO ACHIEVE THIS

GOAL, DUPONT DEVELOPED PFOA REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGY AND IS CONVERTING CUSTOMERS TO FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS MANUFACTURED USING THE REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION SINCE 2008, DUPONT HAS

BEEN INTRODUCING ITS NEXT GENERATION FLUOROTELOMERS PRODUCTS AND CONVERTING CUSTOMERS TO THEIR USE.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009, EPA ANNOUNCED THE START OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ENHANCING EPA'S CURRENT CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM UNDER TSCA. AS PART OF THIS ENHANCEMENT, EPA RELEASED FOUR

EXISTING CHEMICAL

ACTION

PLANS (THE PLANS) IN DECEMBER 2009 OF WHICH ONE COVERS LONG-CHAIN PERFLUORINATED CHEMICALS (PFCS) INCLUDING PFOA. THE PLANS OUTLINE THE RISKS THAT THE USE OF THE SPECIFIED CHEMICALS

MAY PRESENT AND THE SPECIFIC STEPS THAT EPA WILL TAKE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. EPA INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO PROPOSE REGULATORY ACTIONS IN 2012 TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL RISKS FROM PFCS, BUT THE

SPECIFIC STEPS NOTED IN THE PFCS PLAN ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 2010/2015 PFOA STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM.

IN

JANUARY 2009, EPA ISSUED A NATIONAL PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY FOR PFOA OF 0.4 PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) IN DRINKING WATER. IN FEBRUARY 2007, NJDEP IDENTIFIED A PRELIMINARY DRINKING-WATER GUIDANCE

LEVEL FOR PFOA OF 0.04 PPB AS PART OF THE FIRST PHASE OF AN ONGOING PROCESS TO ESTABLISH A STATE DRINKING-WATER STANDARD. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER 2009, NJDEP BEGAN THE PROCESS TO ESTABLISH A

PERMANENT MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVEL (MCL) FOR PFOA IN DRINKING WATER. THE PROCESS IS ESTIMATED TO TAKE 1 TO 2 YEARS. WHILE NJDEP WILL CONTINUE SAMPLING AND EVALUATION OF DATA FROM ALL SOURCES,

IT HAS NOT RECOMMENDED A CHANGE IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS.

BASED

ON EXTENSIVE HEALTH AND TOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES, DUPONT BELIEVES THAT PFOA EXPOSURE DOES NOT POSE A HEALTH RISK TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. HUMAN STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED MANY HEALTH ENDPOINTS ACROSS A

WIDE RANGE OF EXPOSED POPULATIONS. WHILE SOME ASSOCIATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, NO HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS ARE KNOWN TO BE CAUSED BY PFOA. A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF HUMAN HEALTH STUDIES ARE ONGOING AND

RESULTS WILL BE AVAILABLE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

THERE

HAVE NOT BEEN ANY REGULATORY OR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS THAT PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION OR USE OF PFOA. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE IN THE FUTURE. PRODUCTS CURRENTLY

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF 2010 REVENUES COULD BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH REGULATION OR PROHIBITION. DUPONT HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES IN CONNECTION WITH

CERTAIN PFOA ENVIRONMENTAL AND LITIGATION MATTERS (SEE NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST

RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UTILIZED INCLUDE FORWARDS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES.

THE

COMPANY HEDGES CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND CERTAIN ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL FEEDSTOCK

PURCHASES.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF CASH, INVESTMENTS,

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DERIVATIVES.

AS

PART OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS ACTUAL

EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE

COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE REPRESENTED MORE THAN

5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC, INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE

COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY INDUSTRY AND REGION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN

CURRENCY RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS.

THE

COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE

PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET

OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW

VOLATILITY RELATED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACTS OF THIS PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, AND INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S PRO RATA SHARE

OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES' EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES AND CORRESPONDING GAINS AND LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE USD AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS

DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND

DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH

REQUIREMENTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST

RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED OR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE

COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES.

A

PORTION OF CERTAIN ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES ARE HEDGED TO REDUCE PRICE VOLATILITY USING FIXED PRICE SWAPS AND OPTIONS.

THE

COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS TO PRODUCE FINISHED SEED INVENTORY. UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, GROWERS ARE COMPENSATED WITH BUSHEL EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE MARKETED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE

MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN DURING THE

CONTRACT

PERIOD. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HAVING A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY ARE USED TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK INVOLVED IN COMPENSATING GROWERS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF SOYBEAN MEAL. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY EXPOSURE AND ARE DEEMED EFFECTIVE IN

OFFSETTING SOYBEAN MEAL FEEDSTOCK PRICE RISK.

ADDITIONAL

DETAILS ON THESE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SET FORTH IN NOTE 23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, AND THE EFFECT ON FAIR

VALUES OF A HYPOTHETICAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE MARKET PRICES OR RATES THAT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009. THE SENSITIVITY FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS BASED ON A ONE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE

MARKET INTEREST RATE. FOREIGN CURRENCY AND ENERGY DERIVATIVE SENSITIVITIES ARE BASED ON A 10 PERCENT CHANGE IN MARKET RATES.

SEPARATE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD ARE OMITTED BECAUSE NO SUCH AFFILIATE INDIVIDUALLY CONSTITUTES A 20 PERCENT SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARY.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) AND ARE CONSIDERED BY

MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP. THEIR REPORT IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN

RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

I.

PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY;

II.

PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

III.

PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITIONS, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES MAY CAUSE VARIATION

IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.

MANAGEMENT

ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

. BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT AND THOSE CRITERIA, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED

THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP,

AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, HAS AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A) (2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN "MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING" APPEARING ON

PAGE F-2. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING

THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS OF VIES FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY WERE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE VIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FUTURE

EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THESE VIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE COMPANY BECOMES THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE OTHER VIES WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF THE NET INCOME (LOSS) OF THESE VIES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET, IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS AND IS NOT

MATERIAL.

FOR

THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN

AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS. THIS INCLUDES MAJORITY-OWNED ENTITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE A MINORITY INVESTOR HOLDS SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST

METHOD OR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE FROM THE SALE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A

DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED, COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND

PRICING IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD FOB (FREE ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS, AN EQUIVALENT BASIS. ACCRUALS ARE MADE

FOR SALES RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF

GOODS SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE

DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.

THE

COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT AND RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS

SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE, OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.

LICENSING

AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY

ASSURED.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST,

WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND UP TO

TWELVE MONTHS AT TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE

CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED COST. THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE INVESTMENTS.

OTHER

ASSETS INCLUDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, WHICH COMPRISE INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE (COST INVESTMENTS) AND

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES THAT ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE (SEE NOTE 13).

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WAS ESTABLISHED THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION

TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE

LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT'S LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE

COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FOR ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 1



QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2



SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G. QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ITEMS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ITEMS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED

PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND YIELD CURVES, AND MARKET-CORROBORATED INPUTS);

LEVEL 3



UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD; IN THE

AGGREGATE, SUCH VALUATIONS ARE NOT IN EXCESS OF MARKET. SEED INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD, OR MARKET.

ELEMENTS

OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY

THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS CARRIED AT COST AND IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PLACED

IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED UNDER THE SUM-OF-THE-YEARS' DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR METHODS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS

ARE DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 15 TO 25 YEARS. CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 5

TO 7 YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDED IN

DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE

AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES

INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.

DEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED AND LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 5 TO

20 YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE

CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSET ARE SEPARATELY

IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE

COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE WHICH IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR USE UNTIL THEIR DISPOSAL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD

FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR MARKET VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. DEPRECIATION IS DISCONTINUED FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE

LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR PREVENT

CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE, THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING

EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO 20 YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS

BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, VEHICLE LIABILITY AND

EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF RELEVANT RISKS.

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED

TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR

PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT

BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED.

INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN MISCELLANEOUS INCOME

AND EXPENSES, NET, UNDER OTHER INCOME, NET. INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR (USD) IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF MOST OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES, PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR,

EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR

SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE

RATES AND THE RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY. ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE REMEASURED INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD AND THE RESULTANT EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD.

HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET ON THE INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE

HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE

RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN

THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT OR AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED AT

TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION MATURES, OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE

DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AND THE

DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER

PROBABLE.

THE INCREASE IN U.S. PRE-TAX EARNINGS FROM 2009 TO 2010 IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TWO FACTORS, THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S HEDGING PROGRAM COMBINED

WITH THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE U.S. ECONOMY. IN 2009, THE U.S. RECORDED $485 OF EXCHANGE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEDGING PROGRAM. HOWEVER, IN 2010, THE PROGRAM RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RECORDING $117

OF EXCHANGE GAINS. THIS SWING IN THE EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES YEAR OVER YEAR COMBINED WITH THE UNDERLYING RECOVERY IN THE U.S. ECONOMY ACCOUNTS FOR THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. EARNINGS PER THE CHART

ABOVE. WHILE THE TAXATION OF THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED ON THE CHART ABOVE DOES NOT CORRESPOND PRECISELY TO THE JURISDICTION OF TAXATION (DUE TO TAXATION IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES, EXCHANGE GAINS (LOSSES),

ETC.), IT REPRESENTS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES SPLIT BETWEEN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. SEE NOTE 23 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE

COMPANY'S HEDGING PROGRAM.

UNDER

THE TAX LAWS OF VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, DEDUCTIONS OR CREDITS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY UTILIZED FOR TAX PURPOSES DURING THE CURRENT YEAR MAY BE CARRIED FORWARD OR BACK,

SUBJECT TO STATUTORY LIMITATIONS, TO REDUCE TAXABLE INCOME OR TAXES PAYABLE IN FUTURE OR PRIOR YEARS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH CARRYFORWARDS/BACKS, NET OF VALUATION

ALLOWANCE APPROXIMATED $1,379. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1,205 HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE, $38 EXPIRES AFTER 2010 BUT BEFORE THE END OF 2015 AND $136 EXPIRES AFTER 2015.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. TOTALING $12,631 WERE DEEMED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED. NO DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH REGARD

TO THE REMITTANCE OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO ESTIMATE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE REMITTED TO THE U.S.

EACH

YEAR THE COMPANY FILES HUNDREDS OF TAX RETURNS IN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXING JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND POSSIBLE

CHALLENGE BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES. POSITIONS CHALLENGED BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED OR APPEALED BY THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES OR

DECREASES THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

THE

COMPANY AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION, AND VARIOUS STATES AND NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER

SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, OR

THE COMPANY WARRANTS THAT ITS PRODUCTS MEET STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

WAS $20 AND $17, RESPECTIVELY. ESTIMATES FOR WARRANTY COSTS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, THE COMPANY HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND PRODUCT

LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY INDEFINITE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW, AGAINST LIABILITIES

INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS A

RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS IS

GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE $100. ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED

AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE 2004 SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE NET ASSETS OF TEXTILES AND INTERIORS, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED THE PURCHASERS, SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH INDUSTRIES, INC. (INVISTA), AGAINST

CERTAIN LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES, LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE

INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WAS $70 AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE INDEMNIFICATIONS BALANCE OF $100 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE

COMPANY'S TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CANNOT EXCEED $1,400. THE OTHER INDEMNITIES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT. IN MARCH 2008, INVISTA

FILED SUIT IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WERE BREACHED AND, THEREFORE, THAT DUPONT IS OBLIGATED TO

INDEMNIFY IT. DUPONT DISAGREES WITH THE EXTENT AND VALUE OF INVISTA'S CLAIMS. DUPONT HAS NOT CHANGED ITS ESTIMATE OF ITS TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AS A

RESULT OF THE LAWSUIT.

OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES & OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS

AND OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD DIRECTLY GUARANTEED $544 OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND $16 RELATING TO GUARANTEES OF HISTORICAL OBLIGATIONS FOR DIVESTED

SUBSIDIARIES. THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM

ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY.

THE

COMPANY ASSESSES THE PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK BY ASSIGNING DEFAULT RATES BASED ON THE DURATION OF THE GUARANTEES. THESE DEFAULT RATES ARE ASSIGNED BASED ON THE EXTERNAL CREDIT RATING OF THE

COUNTERPARTY OR THROUGH INTERNAL CREDIT ANALYSIS AND HISTORICAL DEFAULT HISTORY FOR COUNTERPARTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE PUBLISHED CREDIT RATINGS. FOR COUNTERPARTIES WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL RATING OR AVAILABLE

CREDIT HISTORY, A CUMULATIVE AVERAGE DEFAULT RATE IS USED.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, A LIABILITY OF $109 AND $146, RESPECTIVELY, WAS RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DEEMS

PROBABLE. THIS LIABILITY IS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S POLYESTER FILMS JOINT VENTURE, WHICH ARE GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY.

PFOA

DUPONT USES PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT), AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER

RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN WEST VIRGINIA. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, DUPONT HAS ACCRUALS OF $18 RELATED TO THE PFOA MATTERS

DISCUSSED BELOW.

LEACH V DUPONT

IN AUGUST 2001, A CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED LEACH V DUPONT, WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AGAINST DUPONT AND THE LUBECK PUBLIC SERVICE

DISTRICT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR THE WASHINGTON WORKS FACILITY HAD SUFFERED, OR MAY SUFFER, DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER. THE RELIEF

SOUGHT INCLUDED DAMAGES FOR MEDICAL MONITORING, DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUES AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES PLUS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP RELEASES OF PFOA. DUPONT AND ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN 2004 AND AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS OF $108 IN 2004. THE SETTLEMENT BINDS A CLASS OF APPROXIMATELY 80,000 RESIDENTS. AS DEFINED BY THE COURT, THE CLASS

INCLUDES THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

HAVE CONSUMED, FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR, WATER CONTAINING 0.05 PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) OR GREATER OF PFOA FROM ANY OF SIX DESIGNATED PUBLIC WATER SOURCES OR FROM SOLE SOURCE PRIVATE WELLS.

IN

JULY 2005, THE COMPANY PAID THE PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES OF $23 AND MADE A PAYMENT OF $70, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL HAS DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY HEALTH PROJECT. THE COMPANY IS ALSO

FUNDING A SERIES OF HEALTH STUDIES BY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS IN THE COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY PROBABLE LINK EXISTS BETWEEN

EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL TO COMPLETE THESE HEALTH STUDIES BETWEEN 2009 AND YEAR-END 2011 AT A TOTAL ESTIMATED COST OF $32. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING STATE-OF-THE ART WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PFOA IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER DISTRICTS, INCLUDING THE LITTLE

HOCKING WATER ASSOCIATION (LHWA), UNTIL THE SCIENCE PANEL DETERMINES THAT PFOA DOES NOT CAUSE DISEASE OR UNTIL APPLICABLE WATER STANDARDS CAN BE MET WITHOUT SUCH TREATMENT. ALL OF THE WATER TREATMENT

SYSTEMS ARE OPERATING.

THE

SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN THE DISMISSAL OF ALL CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE LAWSUIT EXCEPT FOR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF THE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL CONCLUDES THAT NO PROBABLE LINK EXISTS BETWEEN

EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY DISEASES, THEN THE SETTLEMENT WOULD ALSO RESOLVE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF IT CONCLUDES THAT A PROBABLE LINK DOES EXIST BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY DISEASES, THEN DUPONT

WOULD ALSO FUND UP TO $235 FOR A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM TO PAY FOR SUCH MEDICAL TESTING. IN THIS EVENT, PLAINTIFFS WOULD RETAIN THEIR RIGHT TO PURSUE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. ALL OTHER CLAIMS IN

THE LAWSUIT WOULD REMAIN DISMISSED BY THE SETTLEMENT. DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REMOTE THAT THE PANEL WILL FIND A PROBABLE LINK. THEREFORE, AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY ACCRUALS RELATED TO MEDICAL MONITORING OR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHAT THE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL WILL CONCLUDE.

CIVIL ACTIONS: DRINKING WATER

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE WERE FOUR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS PENDING BROUGHT BY OR ON BEHALF OF WATER DISTRICT CUSTOMERS IN NEW JERSEY, OHIO AND

WEST VIRGINIA. THE CASES GENERALLY CLAIM PFOA CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER AND SEEK A VARIETY OF RELIEF INCLUDING COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, TESTING, TREATMENT, REMEDIATION AND MONITORING.

IN ADDITION, THE TWO NEW JERSEY CLASS ACTIONS AND THE OHIO ACTION, BROUGHT BY THE LHWA, CLAIM "IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO HEALTH AND OR THE ENVIRONMENT" UNDER THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION

AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA). IN DECEMBER 2010, THE COMPANY REACHED AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO SETTLE THE TWO NEW JERSEY CLASS ACTIONS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL. APPROVAL WAS DENIED AND THE PARTIES ARE

CONSIDERING REVISED SETTLEMENT TERMS FOR POTENTIAL RESUBMISSION TO THE COURT. IF A REVISED SETTLEMENT IS NOT REACHED AND APPROVED, LITIGATION WILL RESUME. DISCOVERY HAS JUST

IN THE OHIO CLASS ACTION. IN THE WEST VIRGINIA CLASS ACTION, THE COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR DUPONT IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2010. PLAINTIFFS' APPEAL OF THE MATTER WAS HEARD BY THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS IN LATE JANUARY 2011.

DUPONT

DENIES THE CLAIMS ALLEGED IN THESE CIVIL DRINKING WATER ACTIONS AND IS DEFENDING ITSELF VIGOROUSLY.

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS

OF THE TOTAL ACCRUAL, $4 IS TO FUND DUPONT'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THE U. S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) AND THE NEW JERSEY

DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. IN 2005, THE COMPANY AND EPA ENTERED AN AGREEMENT SETTLING ALLEGATIONS THAT DUPONT FAILED TO COMPLY WITH TECHNICAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE TOXIC

SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT AND RCRA. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT, DUPONT PAID A FINE OF $10.25 AND IS UNDERTAKING TWO SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS. IN 2009, EPA AND DUPONT ENTERED A CONSENT ORDER UNDER

THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT WHICH OBLIGATES DUPONT TO SURVEY, SAMPLE AND TEST DRINKING WATER IN AND AROUND THE COMPANY'S WASHINGTON WORKS SITE. IF TESTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF PFOA IN DRINKING WATER

AT THE NATIONAL PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY FOR PFOA OF 0.40 PPB OR GREATER, THE COMPANY WILL OFFER TREATMENT OR AN ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER.

WHILE

DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO PFOA MATTERS IN ADDITION TO THOSE MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR WHICH IT HAS ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS, A RANGE OF

SUCH LOSSES, IF ANY, CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

BENLATE®

IN 1991, DUPONT BEGAN RECEIVING CLAIMS BY GROWERS THAT USE OF BENLATE® 50 DF FUNGICIDE HAD CAUSED CROP DAMAGE. DUPONT HAS SINCE BEEN

SERVED WITH THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS, MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF THROUGH TRIAL, DISMISSAL OR SETTLEMENT.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE WERE NINE CASES IN FLORIDA COURTS ALLEGING THAT BENLATE® CAUSED CROP DAMAGE. AT THE 2006 TRIAL OF TWO CASES INVOLVING TWENTY-SEVEN COSTA RICAN FERN

GROWERS, THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT DAMAGES IN THE RANGE OF $270 TO $400. A $56 JUDGMENT WAS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY, BUT WAS REDUCED TO $24 ON DUPONT'S MOTION. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2009, ON DUPONT'S

MOTION, THE JUDGMENT WAS REVERSED, VACATED AND THE CASES WERE REMANDED TO BE TRIED SEPARATELY OR IN SMALL RELATED GROUPS. PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE DECISION. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE

APPELLATE COURT UPHELD THE DECISION TO TRY THE CASES SEPARATELY. THE APPELLATE COURT ALSO AFFIRMED DISMISSAL OF THE VERDICTS FOR SEVEN OF THE TWENTY-SEVEN FERN GROWERS ON GROUNDS THAT THEIR CLAIMS

WERE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. PLAINTIFFS ARE SEEKING REVIEW BY THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT. ONE OTHER CROP CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN JUNE 2011. ON JANUARY 19, 2011, THE COURT

ENTERED AN ORDER IN FIVE OF THE REMAINING CROP CASES STRIKING DUPONT'S PLEADINGS. THE ORDER ESSENTIALLY ENTERS JUDGMENT AGAINST DUPONT AS TO LIABILITY. DUPONT WILL APPEAL, BUT CANNOT DO SO UNTIL A

DAMAGES TRIAL RESULTS IN A MONETARY JUDGMENT AGAINST IT.

TWO

CASES ALLEGING DAMAGE TO SHRIMPING OPERATIONS WERE RESOLVED IN A SINGLE BINDING ARBITRATION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER 2010. THE ARBITER AWARDED PLAINTIFFS A TOTAL OF $19 IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

PLUS ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES. DUPONT PAID THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN DECEMBER 2010 AND WILL PAY $8.5 IN ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES.

IN

JANUARY 2009, A CASE WAS FILED IN FLORIDA STATE COURT CLAIMING THAT PLAINTIFF'S EXPOSURE TO BENLATE® ALLEGEDLY CONTAMINATED WITH OTHER FUNGICIDES AND HERBICIDES, CAUSED PLAINTIFF'S

KIDNEY CANCER AND PANCREATIC AND BRAIN TUMORS. THE CASE WAS TRIED TO A VERDICT IN SEPTEMBER 2010 IN FEDERAL COURT, TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN REMOVED ON DUPONT'S MOTION, AND THE JURY UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED

ALLEGATIONS THAT EXPOSURE TO BENLATE® CAUSED PLAINTIFF'S DISEASES. IN DECEMBER 2010, THE COURT DENIED PLAINTIFF'S POST TRIAL MOTIONS. PLAINTIFF HAS APPEALED.

THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT BENLATE® CAUSED THE DAMAGES ALLEGED IN EACH OF THESE CASES AND DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEFEND ITSELF IN

ONGOING MATTERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2,000 ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MATTERS, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINING TWELVE CASES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUALS OF ABOUT $9 RELATED TO BENLATE®. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT LOSSES IN EXCESS OF

THE ACCRUALS, IF ANY, TO BE MATERIAL.

SPELTER, WEST VIRGINIA

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, A WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS ACTION CAPTIONED PERRINE V DUPONT, AGAINST DUPONT THAT SEEKS RELIEF INCLUDING THE

PROVISION OF REMEDIATION SERVICES AND PROPERTY VALUE DIMINUTION DAMAGES FOR 7,000 RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN THE VICINITY OF A CLOSED ZINC SMELTER IN SPELTER, WEST VIRGINIA. THE ACTION ALSO SEEKS

MEDICAL MONITORING FOR AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN THE CLASS AREA. THE SMELTER WAS OWNED AND OPERATED BY AT LEAST THREE COMPANIES BETWEEN 1910 AND 2001, INCLUDING DUPONT BETWEEN 1928 AND

1950. DUPONT PERFORMED REMEDIAL MEASURES AT THE REQUEST OF EPA IN THE LATE 1990S AND IN 2001 REPURCHASED THE SITE TO FACILITATE AND COMPLETE THE REMEDIATION. THE FALL 2007 TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN FOUR

PHASES: LIABILITY, MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE JURY FOUND AGAINST DUPONT IN ALL FOUR PHASES AWARDING $55.5 FOR PROPERTY REMEDIATION AND $196.2 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN POST

TRIAL MOTIONS, THE COURT ADOPTED THE PLAINTIFFS' FORTY-YEAR MEDICAL MONITORING PLAN ESTIMATED BY PLAINTIFFS TO COST $130 AND GRANTED PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEYS LEGAL FEES OF $127 PLUS $8 IN

EXPENSES BASED ON AND INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL JURY AWARD. DUPONT APPEALED TO THE WEST VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT (THE COURT) SEEKING REVIEW OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES. THE COURT ISSUED ITS DECISION ON

MARCH 26, 2010, AFFIRMING IN PART AND REVERSING IN PART THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION.

THE

COURT CONDITIONALLY AFFIRMED THE VERDICT, BUT REDUCED PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO $97.7. THE COURT REVERSED THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO THE ADULT PLAINTIFFS ON THE ISSUE OF

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND ORDERED A NEW JURY TRIAL ON THE SOLE ISSUE OF WHEN THE PLAINTIFFS POSSESSED REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE TO TRIGGER THE RUNNING OF THE STATUTE.

IN

NOVEMBER 2010, PLAINTIFFS AND DUPONT REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THIS MATTER FOR $70. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES DUPONT TO FUND A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM. THE INITIAL

SET-UP COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM ARE INCLUDED IN THE $70. THE COMPANY WILL REASSESS ITS LIABILITY RELATED TO FUNDING THE MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM AS ELIGIBLE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS

ELECT TO PARTICIPATE AND ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM.

ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2011. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ACCRUALS OF $70 RELATED THIS MATTER.

GENERAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS INCLUDE ACTIONS

BASED ON ALLEGED EXPOSURES TO PRODUCTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND CONTRACT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS. MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST

CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT

CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES. SUCH CASES MAY ALLEGE CONTAMINATION FROM UNREGULATED SUBSTANCES OR REMEDIATED SITES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NOTED A TREND IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NUISANCE SUITS BEING

FILED ON BEHALF OF STATES, COUNTIES, CITIES AND UTILITIES ALLEGING HARM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER

ACTION TO CORRECT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR RELEASES OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET FORTH IN NOTE 1. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA,

OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SUPERFUND), RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE AND GLOBAL LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS

OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS

PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS,

EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS INCLUDED A LIABILITY OF $407, RELATING TO THESE MATTERS AND, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE AVERAGE TIME

FRAME, OVER WHICH THE ACCRUED OR PRESENTLY UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS MAY BE PAID, BASED ON PAST HISTORY, IS ESTIMATED TO BE 15-20 YEARS. CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO

THESE COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

21.  LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY OFFERS VARIOUS LONG-TERM BENEFITS TO ITS EMPLOYEES. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES

THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE THE PLANS.

IN

2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED MAJOR CHANGES TO THE PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS THAT COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES. SUCH EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE U.S. AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2006 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS BUT RECEIVE BENEFITS IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS

THE COMPANY HAS BOTH FUNDED AND UNFUNDED NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING A MAJORITY OF THE U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE BENEFITS UNDER

THESE PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. THE COMPANY'S FUNDING POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

PENSION

COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH PLANS ARE

FUNDED BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH TRUSTEES, COVERED BY INSURANCE CONTRACTS, OR REMAIN UNFUNDED.

OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE PARENT COMPANY AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS, AND DISABILITY AND LIFE

INSURANCE PROTECTION TO EMPLOYEES. THE ASSOCIATED PLANS FOR RETIREE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM COMPANY FUNDS. ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COST AND LIABILITIES

FOR THESE RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY PLANS. THE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS CONTRIBUTORY WITH PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS' CONTRIBUTIONS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY TO ACHIEVE A

50/50 TARGET SHARING OF COST INCREASES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. IN ADDITION, LIMITS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF THE RETIREE MEDICAL COST COVERAGE.

EMPLOYEE

LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE INSURED IN MANY COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., SUCH PLANS ARE GENERALLY SELF-INSURED OR ARE FULLY EXPERIENCE-RATED.

OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSES FOR SELF-INSURED AND FULLY EXPERIENCE-RATED PLANS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIGURES BELOW.

PLAN ASSETS

ALL PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. ARE INVESTED THROUGH A SINGLE MASTER TRUST FUND. THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THIS TRUST FUND IS SELECTED BY

MANAGEMENT, REFLECTING THE RESULTS OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSET LIABILITY MODELING. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GUIDING U.S. PENSION ASSET INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE THOSE EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME

SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE "PRUDENT EXPERT" STANDARD AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT

ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE

COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET LIABILITY STUDIES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCESS. U.S. PLAN ASSETS AND A PORTION OF NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED

BY THE COMPANY. THE REMAINING ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT FIRMS UNRELATED TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S PENSION INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DISCRETION TO MANAGE THE ASSETS WITHIN

ESTABLISHED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, PENSION TRUST FUNDS ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS

"DERIVATIVES." DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS, HEDGE CURRENCY AND ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S. PARENT

COMPANY'S RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN (THE PLAN), WHICH REFLECTS THE 2009 MERGER OF THE RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN AND THE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN. THIS PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE

STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE RETIREMENT SAVINGS

BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT

AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES 100 PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION ELECTION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES

3 PERCENT OF EACH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE'S ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION.

THE

COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY'S DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WERE $195, $191 AND $189 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S

MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS VEST IMMEDIATELY UPON CONTRIBUTION. THE 3 PERCENT NONMATCHING COMPANY CONTRIBUTION VESTS FOR EMPLOYEES WITH AT LEAST THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE

CONTRIBUTIONS TO OTHER DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS OF $59, $54 AND $45 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT $265 TO ITS

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN 2011.

22.  COMPENSATION PLANS

THE TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS WAS $108, $115 AND $112 FOR 2010, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS WERE $36, $38 AND $37 FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

APRIL 2007, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE DUPONT EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP). THE EIP CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING COMPENSATION PLANS (THE STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN, VARIABLE

COMPENSATION PLAN, AND EQUITY AWARDS OF THE STOCK ACCUMULATION AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS) INTO ONE PLAN PROVIDING FOR EQUITY-BASED AND CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES,

DIRECTORS AND CONSULTANTS. CURRENTLY, EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS CONSIST OF STOCK OPTIONS, TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS), PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (PSUS)

AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

THE

COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS AND PSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE EIP, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR THE GRANT OR

SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS IS 60 MILLION SHARES, PROVIDED THAT EACH SHARE IN EXCESS OF 20 MILLION THAT IS ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD THAT IS NOT AN OPTION OR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT

WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE 60 MILLION SHARE LIMIT AS FOUR SHARES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 23 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE COMPANY'S EIP.

AWARDS OR GRANTS MADE IN 2007, PRIOR TO SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE EIP, WERE ISSUED UNDER THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUSLY EXISTING COMPENSATION PLANS. AWARDS OUTSTANDING UNDER EACH OF THESE PLANS HAVE NOT

BEEN TERMINATED. THESE AWARDS REMAIN OUTSTANDING AND ARE ADMINISTERED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE EXISTING PLAN. NO FURTHER AWARDS WILL BE MADE UNDER THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUSLY EXISTING

COMPENSATION PLANS.

THE

COMPANY'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, RSUS AND PSUS AND MAY AUTHORIZE NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2004

EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT; OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2008 SERIALLY VESTED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND CARRY A SIX-YEAR OPTION TERM. STOCK OPTION AWARDS

GRANTED IN 2009 AND 2010 EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. THE PLAN ALLOWS RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO RETAIN ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST

SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING GRANT DATE.

FOR

PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AWARDS, THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE ASSUMPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $6.44, $2.68 AND $5.30, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUES IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENT THE TOTAL PRE-TAX INTRINSIC VALUE (THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY'S CLOSING STOCK

PRICE ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF 2010 AND THE EXERCISE PRICE, MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF IN-THE-MONEY OPTIONS) THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE OPTION HOLDERS HAD ALL

OPTION HOLDERS EXERCISED THEIR IN-THE-MONEY OPTIONS AT YEAR END. THE AMOUNT CHANGES BASED ON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK. TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS

EXERCISED FOR 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WERE $109, $0 AND $18, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2010, THE COMPANY REALIZED A TAX BENEFIT OF $35 FROM OPTIONS EXERCISED.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, $14 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.71 YEARS.

RSUS AND PSUS

THE COMPANY ISSUES RSUS THAT SERIALLY VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND, UPON VESTING, CONVERT ONE-FOR-ONE TO

DUPONT COMMON STOCK. A RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE RETAINS ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE. ADDITIONAL

RSUS ARE ALSO GRANTED PERIODICALLY TO KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. THESE RSUS GENERALLY VEST OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM TWO TO FIVE YEARS. THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL STOCK-SETTLED RSUS IS BASED UPON THE

MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT DATE.

THE

COMPANY ALSO GRANTS PSUS TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP. IN 2010, THERE WERE 310,917 PSUS GRANTED. VESTING FOR PSUS GRANTED IN 2008, 2009 AND 2010 IS EQUALLY BASED UPON CORPORATE REVENUE GROWTH RELATIVE TO

PEER COMPANIES AND TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES. PERFORMANCE AND PAYOUTS ARE DETERMINED INDEPENDENTLY FOR EACH METRIC. THE ACTUAL AWARD, DELIVERED AS DUPONT COMMON STOCK,

CAN RANGE FROM ZERO PERCENT TO 200 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT. THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE PSUS GRANTED IN 2010, SUBJECT TO THE TSR METRIC, WAS $44.86, ESTIMATED USING A

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION. THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE PSUS, SUBJECT TO THE REVENUE METRIC, WAS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT DATE.

FOR

PSUS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2008, VESTING OCCURS UPON ATTAINMENT OF (I) CORPORATE REVENUE GROWTH RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES AND (II) RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL OBJECTIVES (RELATIVE TO PEER

COMPANIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO 2008 AND RELATIVE TO INTERNAL TARGETS FOR PERIODS BEGINNING IN 2008). THE ACTUAL AWARD, DELIVERED AS DUPONT COMMON STOCK,

CAN RANGE FROM ZERO PERCENT TO 200 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT. THE FAIR VALUE OF PSUS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2008 IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT

DATE.

23.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY,

INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF APPROVED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE UTILIZED IN EACH FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS VARYING LEVELS OF EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS RELATED TO EACH HEDGING PROGRAM. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UTILIZED DURING THE

PERIOD INCLUDE FORWARDS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

THE

COMPANY ESTABLISHED A FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT INCORPORATED THE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES THAT

AUTHORIZE THE USE OF SPECIFIC DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FURTHER ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL AND ROUTINE MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES

TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES. THE

COMPANY MANAGES THIS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS THROUGH THE AFOREMENTIONED CREDIT APPROVALS, LIMITS AND MONITORING PROCEDURES AND, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, BY RESTRICTING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH UNPAID

BALANCES ARE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS AND THEREFORE NO MATERIAL LOSS IS EXPECTED. MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

THE

COMPANY HEDGES FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUE AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN BUSINESS SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND CERTAIN ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE EXPOSURES RELEVANT TO AGRICULTURAL FEEDSTOCKS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN

CURRENCY RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE

COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE

PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET

OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST

RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE

COMPANY TO ACHIEVE A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS NATURAL GAS, COPPER, CORN,

SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.

THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND

AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WERE ISSUED, THAT

INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THESE SWAPS ALLOW THE

F-43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

COMPANY

TO ACHIEVE A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT. ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THESE HEDGES. THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT FAIR VALUE HEDGES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1,000 AND

$1,900, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF CASH FLOW HEDGING PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. WHILE EACH RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD, MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR PERIOD.

THE

COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET

CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WITH GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $1,220 AND $293, RESPECTIVELY.

A

PORTION OF NATURAL GAS PURCHASES ARE HEDGED TO REDUCE PRICE VOLATILITY USING FIXED PRICE SWAPS AND OPTIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND OTHER CONTRACTS

WITH GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY $151 AND $277, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS TO PRODUCE SEED INVENTORY. UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, GROWERS ARE COMPENSATED WITH BUSHEL EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE SOLD TO THE COMPANY FOR THE MARKET PRICE OF

GRAIN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTIONS THAT HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY, ARE USED TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK INVOLVED

IN COMPENSATING GROWERS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY FUTURES TO MANAGE THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF SOYBEAN MEAL. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY EXPOSURE AND ARE

DEEMED EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING SOYBEAN MEAL FEEDSTOCK PRICE RISK.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY CONTRACTS WITH GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY $297 AND $332, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING

2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO TREASURY RATE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO TREASURY RATES ON A PORTION OF PLANNED BOND ISSUANCES. THE CONTRACTS WERE TERMINATED AT THE

TIME THE BONDS WERE ISSUED PRIOR TO YEAR END.

CASH

FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED

TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE EFFECT OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ON ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY DID NOT MAINTAIN ANY HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING. HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTS IN A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WITH GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$7,449 AND $7,634, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD

AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES CONTRACTS WITH GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY $310 AND $206, RESPECTIVELY.
