PART I

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS REPORT, INCLUDING "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" IN ITEM 7,

CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR USE OF

WORDS LIKE "PLANS," "EXPECTS," "WILL," "ANTICIPATES," "INTENDS," "PROJECTS,"

"PENDING," "ESTIMATES" OR OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ALL STATEMENTS THAT

ADDRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE, INCLUDING STATEMENTS ABOUT

THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR GROWTH, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET POSITION,

EXPENDITURES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

FUTURE EVENTS. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND

EXPECTATIONS ARE ACCURATE OR WILL BE REALIZED. IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING ARE

SOME OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

O THE COMPANY OPERATES IN APPROXIMATELY 75 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVES 55

PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE,

GOVERNMENTAL AND QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE

LAWS OR POLICIES OF ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, COULD AFFECT

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN THAT COUNTRY. ALSO, THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY COULD BE

AFFECTED BY POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS ON A DOMESTIC, COUNTRY

SPECIFIC OR GLOBAL LEVEL FROM ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR (WHETHER OR NOT

DECLARED) AND THE RESPONSE TO SUCH ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC

FACTORS (INCLUDING SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S.,

EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC, INFLATION OR FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES) AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS (SUCH AS GREATER PRICE

COMPETITION OR EXPIRATION OF PATENT PROTECTION) COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

O THE COMPANY'S GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO

RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO.

IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS; SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT; OBTAIN RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS; OBTAIN ADEQUATE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

O THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GROW EARNINGS WILL BE AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN THE

COST OF RAW MATERIALS. THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS AND TEXTILES & INTERIORS

SEGMENTS ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OIL,

NATURAL GAS AND PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE COMPANY MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS

THROUGH PRICE INCREASES OR PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

O AS PART OF ITS STRATEGY FOR GROWTH, THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE

TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES AND FORM STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. THE

SUCCESSFUL SEPARATION OF TEXTILES & INTERIORS IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY'S

STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ONGOING OPERATIONS; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THIS OR ANY OTHER PLANNED DIVESTITURE OR ACQUISITION WILL BE

COMPLETED OR BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY.

O TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE, RESULTS IN THE COMPANY'S AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

SEGMENT REFLECT CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WEATHER AND

GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THESE RESULTS ALSO REFLECT THE SEASONALITY OF SALES OF

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS; HIGHEST SALES IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE OCCUR IN

THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN

THESE SEGMENTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY ENHANCED

PRODUCTS.

O THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE PRODUCTIVITY

INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURINGS AND SIX SIGMA

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS, TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND GENERATE COST

SAVINGS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE WILL BE COMPLETED OR

BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY

ESTIMATED FINANCIAL BENEFIT FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES WILL BE REALIZED.

O THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND

WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS

FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE SINCE THE ESTIMATES ON

WHICH THE ACCRUALS

3

PART I

ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE

ALLEGATION, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, THE NATURE OF THE REMEDY, THE

OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTIPARTY SITES, AND THE NUMBER AND

FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

O THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT

LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS,

PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS.

THE FOREGOING LIST OF IMPORTANT FACTORS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE, OR NECESSARILY IN

ORDER OF IMPORTANCE.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q,

CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS ARE ACCESSIBLE ON

THE COMPANY'S WEB SITE AT WWW.DUPONT.COM BY CLICKING ON THE TAB LABELED

"INVESTOR CENTER" AND THEN ON "SEC FILINGS." THESE REPORTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE,

WITHOUT CHARGE, AS SOON AS IS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPANY FILES OR

FURNISHES THEM ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

DUPONT WAS FOUNDED IN 1802 AND WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1915. DUPONT IS A

WORLD LEADER IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING

HIGH-PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, SYNTHETIC FIBERS, ELECTRONICS, SPECIALTY CHEMICALS,

AGRICULTURE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBALLY, MANUFACTURING A

WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS FOR DISTRIBUTION AND SALE TO MANY DIFFERENT MARKETS,

INCLUDING THE AUTOMOTIVE, TEXTILE, CONSTRUCTION, AGRICULTURAL, MEDICAL,

PACKAGING, ELECTRONICS, AND THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH MARKETS. TOTAL WORLDWIDE

EMPLOYMENT AT YEAR-END 2003 WAS APPROXIMATELY 81,000 PEOPLE.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY STRATEGICALLY REALIGNED ITS BUSINESSES INTO FIVE MARKET-

AND TECHNOLOGY-FOCUSED GROWTH PLATFORMS. THE GROWTH PLATFORMS ARE: AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION; COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES; ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION

TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCE MATERIALS; AND SAFETY & PROTECTION. THESE GROWTH

PLATFORMS ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS LARGE, ATTRACTIVE MARKET SPACES THAT ALLOW THE

COMPANY TO LEVERAGE ITS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS AND BRANDS, MARKET

ACCESS, AND GLOBAL REACH TO BRING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET SPECIFIC CUSTOMER

NEEDS. A SIXTH PLATFORM, TEXTILES & INTERIORS, WAS ALSO FORMED TO PREPARE IT FOR

SEPARATION FROM THE COMPANY. ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003, THE COMPANY AND KOCH

INDUSTRIES, INC. (KOCH) ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD REACHED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

TO SELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE NET ASSETS RELATED TO THE TEXTILES & INTERIORS

SEGMENT TO SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH. THESE NET ASSETS AND RELATED BUSINESSES ARE

REFERRED TO AS INVISTA. THE SALE IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF

2004. THE GROWTH PLATFORMS, TOGETHER WITH TEXTILES & INTERIORS AND

PHARMACEUTICALS, COMPRISE THE COMPANY'S SEVEN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY'S

NONALIGNED AND EMBRYONIC BUSINESSES ARE GROUPED UNDER OTHER.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBING THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY CAN BE FOUND ON

THE INDICATED PAGES OF THIS REPORT.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE OPERATIONS IN ABOUT 75 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE

AND ABOUT 55 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES ARE MADE TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OF DUPONT CONDUCT MANUFACTURING, SEED

PRODUCTION, OR SELLING ACTIVITIES, AND SOME ARE DISTRIBUTORS OF PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY.

SOURCES OF SUPPLY

THE COMPANY UTILIZES NUMEROUS FIRMS AS WELL AS INTERNAL SOURCES TO SUPPLY A WIDE

RANGE OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT. TO ENSURE

AVAILABILITY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR FUELS AND MOST RAW

MATERIALS, INCLUDING HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS. LARGE VOLUME PURCHASES ARE

GENERALLY PROCURED UNDER COMPETITIVELY PRICED SUPPLY CONTRACTS.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PRODUCTION AND SALES IN THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS

AND TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF

HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS.

4

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS-CONTINUED

CURRENT HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK REQUIREMENTS ARE MET BY PURCHASES FROM MAJOR

PETROCHEMICAL COMPANIES. DUPONT PARTICIPATES IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH EQUISTAR

CHEMICALS, LP, WHICH MANUFACTURES AND SUPPLIES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR ETHYLENE GLYCOL, A HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK.

WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT, THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY, PIONEER,

WHICH IS IN THE HYBRID SEED INDUSTRY, HAS SEED PRODUCTION FACILITIES LOCATED

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, IN BOTH THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES. IN THE

PRODUCTION OF ITS PARENT AND COMMERCIAL SEED, PIONEER GENERALLY PROVIDES THE

SEED STOCK, DETASSELING AND ROGUING LABOR, AND CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTION INPUTS.

THE BALANCE OF THE LABOR, EQUIPMENT, AND INPUTS ARE SUPPLIED BY INDEPENDENT

GROWERS. PIONEER BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF GROWERS, PARENT SEED STOCK, AND

OTHER INPUTS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE ITS COMMERCIAL SEED IS ADEQUATE FOR PLANNED

PRODUCTION LEVELS. THE PRINCIPAL RISK IN THE PRODUCTION OF SEED IS THE

ENVIRONMENT, WITH WEATHER BEING THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIANT. PIONEER LESSENS THIS

RISK BY DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTION ACROSS MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. DUE TO

ITS GLOBAL PRESENCE, THE COMPANY CAN ENGAGE IN SEED PRODUCTION YEAR ROUND.

PRODUCTION IN THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH BUSINESSES IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT UPON

THE AVAILABILITY OF SOY FLAKE, WHICH IS READILY AVAILABLE FROM MANY SOURCES.

THE MAJOR COMMODITIES, RAW MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES FOR THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE

SEGMENTS IN 2003 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION.

ACETALDOXIME; CARBAMIC ACID RELATED INTERMEDIATES; POLYETHYLENE; SOYBEANS;

SOY FLAKE; 5-CHOROINDANONE; SOY LECITHIN

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES.

BUTYL ACETATE; CHLORINE; HDI BASED POLY ALAPHATIC ISOCYANATES; INDUSTRIAL

GASES (O2/N2); ORE; PETROLEUM COKE; PIGMENTS

ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES.

CHLOROFORM; FLUORSPAR; HYDROFLUORIC ACID; KRATON; OXYDIANILINE;

PERCHLOROETHYLENE; POLYESTER; POLYETHYLENE; PRECIOUS METALS; PYROMELLITIC

DIANHYDRIDE

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS.

ADIPIC ACID; BUTANEDIOL; ETHANE; ETHYLENE GLYCOL; FIBERGLASS;

HEXAMETHYLENEDIAMINE; METHACRYLIC ACID; METHANOL; NATURAL GAS; PARAXYLENE

SAFETY & PROTECTION.

AMMONIA; BENZENE; HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; ISOPHTHALOYL CHLORIDE;

METAPHENYLENEDIAMINE; METHYL METHACRYLATE; NATURAL GAS;

PARAPHENYLENEDIAMINE; POLYESTER FIBER; POLYPROPYLENE; PROPYLENE;

TEREPHTHALOYL CHLORIDE; WOOD PULP

TEXTILES & INTERIORS.

ACETYLENE; ADIPIC ACID; AMMONIA; BUTADIENE; CYCLOHEXANE; NATURAL GAS;

PARAXYLENE; TEREPHTHALIC ACID

IN ADDITION, DURING 2003, THE COMPANY CONSUMED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR ENERGY.

AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE PENDING SALE OF INVISTA, A SUBSIDIARY OF KOCH WILL

BE THE SOLE PROVIDER OF ADIPIC ACID AND HEXAMETHYLENEDIAMINE FOR THE QUANTITIES

ANTICIPATED TO BE REQUIRED BY THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT.

DUPONT HAS CONTRACTED WITH COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION (CSC) AND ACCENTURE LLP

TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY. CSC OPERATES A MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANY'S GLOBAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURES AND PROVIDES

SELECTED APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE SERVICES. ACCENTURE LLP PROVIDES ENTERPRISE

RESOURCE PLANNING SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING,

MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PATENT AND TRADEMARK ESTATE PROVIDES IT WITH AN

IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IT HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL NETWORK OF

ATTORNEYS, AS WELL AS BRANDING, ADVERTISING, AND LICENSING PROFESSIONALS, TO

PROCURE, MAINTAIN, PROTECT, ENHANCE, AND GAIN VALUE FROM THIS ESTATE.

THE COMPANY OWNS AND IS LICENSED UNDER VARIOUS PATENTS, WHICH EXPIRE FROM TIME

TO TIME, COVERING MANY PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USES. THESE PATENTS

PROTECT MANY ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH PROGRAM AND THE GOODS

AND SERVICES IT SELLS. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THESE PATENTS VARIES

FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND DEPENDS UPON THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE OF EACH

INDIVIDUAL PATENT AS WELL AS THE

5

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS-CONTINUED

AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY. THE COMPANY OWNS APPROXIMATELY

22,000 WORLDWIDE PATENTS AND APPROXIMATELY 15,000 WORLDWIDE PATENT APPLICATIONS.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED ALMOST 440 U.S. PATENTS AND ABOUT 1,950

INTERNATIONAL PATENTS. THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS

WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY AS A

WHOLE, AND TO VARYING DEGREES, IMPORTANT TO EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS TO PHARMACEUTICALS, SEE THE

SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGE 29 OF THIS REPORT.

THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER AND THE REST OF THE COMPANIES WITHIN THE SEED

INDUSTRY COMPETE IS INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY NEW PATENTS, PATENT POSITIONS,

PATENT LAWSUITS AND THE STATUS OF VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

OWNERSHIP OF AND ACCESS TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE

RELATING TO BIOTECHNOLOGY, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PIONEER BUSINESS AND ITS

COMPETITORS. NO SINGLE PATENT OWNED BY PIONEER OR ITS COMPETITORS IS ESSENTIAL

TO PIONEER'S ABILITY TO COMPETE. HOWEVER, PIONEER WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS

FREEDOM TO OPERATE ISSUES BY ENFORCING ITS OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

CHALLENGING CLAIMS MADE BY OTHERS, AND WHERE APPROPRIATE, OBTAINING LICENSES TO

IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 2,100 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 22,000 WORLDWIDE REGISTRATIONS AND APPLICATIONS FOR

THESE TRADEMARKS. OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS

ARE CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED. THE COMPANY HAS MANY TRADEMARKS

THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL AND/OR BUSINESS

TO BUSINESS LEVEL. SIGNIFICANT TRADEMARKS AT THE CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL INCLUDE

THE DUPONT OVAL AND DUPONTTM (THE "DUPONT BRAND TRADEMARKS"); PIONEER(R) BRAND

SEEDS, TEFLON(R) FLUOROPOLYMERS, FILMS, FABRIC PROTECTORS, FIBERS, AND

DISPERSIONS; CORIAN(R) SOLID SURFACES; KEVLAR(R) HIGH STRENGTH MATERIAL, AND

TYVEK(R) PROTECTIVE MATERIAL. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY PURSUING LICENSING

OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED TRADEMARKS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

DUPONT BRAND TRADEMARKS HAVE BEEN LICENSED FOR HARD SURFACE FLOORING, AUTOMOTIVE

APPEARANCE PRODUCTS, AIR AND WATER FILTRATION, AND LUBRICANTS. IN ADDITION, THE

TEFLON(R) TRADEMARK HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH BRAND LICENSING TO PERSONAL CARE

PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE CAR CARE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE WIPER BLADES, EYE GLASS

LENSES, AND HOME CARE PRODUCTS.

CERTAIN PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN TRADEMARKS,

(INCLUDING LYCRA(R) BRAND PREMIUM STRETCH FIBERS, STAINMASTER(R) CARPETS,

CORDURA(R) NYLON, COOLMAX(R) FIBERS AND TACTEL(R) NYLON), AND THE RELATED

REGISTRATIONS AND APPLICATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PENDING SALE OF INVISTA.

CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS PATENT ESTATE TO DECREASE BY ABOUT 4,200

PATENTS AND 2,600 PATENT APPLICATIONS; AND ITS TRADEMARK ESTATE TO DECREASE BY

ABOUT 3,700 REGISTRATIONS AND 470 APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY AND

KOCH HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

INCLUDING PATENT AND TRADEMARK LICENSES.

SEASONALITY

SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION, AND TO A CERTAIN

EXTENT, COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES AND TEXTILES & INTERIORS, ARE AFFECTED BY

SEASONAL PATTERNS. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION'S PERFORMANCE IS STRONGEST IN THE

FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. PIONEER GENERALLY OPERATES AT A LOSS DURING THE THIRD

AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, AND DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE SEED

BUSINESS, PIONEER'S INVENTORY IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR

YEAR AND IS SOLD DOWN IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. TRADE RECEIVABLES IN

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ARE AT A LOW POINT AT YEAR-END AND INCREASE THROUGH THE

SELLING SEASON TO PEAK AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER. COATINGS & COLOR

TECHNOLOGIES' SALES REFLECT SEASONAL PATTERNS RELATED TO MOTOR VEHICLE BUILDS

AND AFTER-MARKET REFINISHING. TEXTILES & INTERIORS' FLOORING BUSINESSES ARE

SOMEWHAT AFFECTED BY THE SEASONALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, WHICH

EXPERIENCES ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF ACTIVITY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.

IN GENERAL, BUSINESSES IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED

BY SEASONAL FACTORS.

MARKETING

IN 2003, THE COMPANY FORMED A MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE, THE SOLAE COMPANY, WITH

BUNGE LIMITED, COMPRISED OF THE COMPANY'S PROTEIN TECHNOLOGIES BUSINESS AND

BUNGE'S NORTH AMERICAN, EUROPEAN AND BRAZILIAN INGREDIENTS OPERATIONS. WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF PIONEER AND THE SOLAE COMPANY, MOST PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED PRIMARILY

THROUGH DUPONT'S SALES FORCE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME REGIONS, MORE EMPHASIS IS PLACED

ON SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. IN NORTH AMERICA, THE MAJORITY OF PIONEER(R)

BRAND SEED IS MARKETED THROUGH INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES. IN AREAS

OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL CORN BELT, SEED PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN MARKETED THROUGH

DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO HANDLE

6

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS-CONTINUED

OTHER AGRICULTURAL SUPPLIES. PIONEER PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA

THROUGH A NETWORK OF SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES, AND INDEPENDENT

PRODUCER-DISTRIBUTORS. SOLAE(R) ISOLATED AND FUNCTIONAL SOY PROTEINS ARE

MARKETED USING A COMBINATION OF INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES, OUTSIDE

DISTRIBUTORS AND JOINT VENTURES.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL

GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. TEXTILES & INTERIORS AND COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES,

HOWEVER, HAVE SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

IMPORTANT TO THESE SEGMENTS' OPERATING RESULTS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES COMPETE ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE, PRODUCT

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OR SPECIFICATIONS, CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY, CUSTOMER

SERVICE AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

PARTICULAR MARKET INVOLVED AND THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDED.

MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE CHEMICAL COMPANIES PRINCIPALLY BASED IN THE UNITED

STATES, WESTERN EUROPE, JAPAN, CHINA AND KOREA. IN THE AGGREGATE, COMPETITORS

OFFER A COMPARABLE RANGE OF PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL, COMMODITY AND SPECIALTY

CHEMICALS TO PLASTICS AND FIBERS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES IN CERTAIN

PRODUCT MARKETS WITH SMALLER, MORE SPECIALIZED FIRMS, AS WELL AS THOSE WITH

PARTIALLY OR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SELLS HYBRID SEEDS THROUGH PIONEER, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE

GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF CORN AND SOYBEANS, AND THUS DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH OTHER

HYBRID SEED SUPPLIERS. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ALSO PROVIDES FOOD SAFETY

EQUIPMENT AND SOY-BASED FOOD INGREDIENTS IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR GRAIN

AND FOOD PROCESSORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES AT OVER 40 SITES IN 19 STATES

AT EITHER DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR MANUFACTURING PLANTS. THE HIGHEST

CONCENTRATION OF RESEARCH IS IN THE WILMINGTON, DELAWARE AREA AT SEVERAL LARGE

RESEARCH CENTERS. AMONG THESE, THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION LABORATORIES ENGAGE IN

INVESTIGATIVE AND APPLIED RESEARCH, THE CHESTNUT RUN LABORATORIES FOCUS ON

APPLICATIONS RESEARCH, AND THE STINE-HASKELL RESEARCH CENTER CONDUCTS

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH AND TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH TO ASSURE THE SAFE

MANUFACTURE, HANDLING AND USE OF PRODUCTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

GRAND CAL/INDIANA HARBOR SYSTEM

THE INDIANA DEPARTMENTS OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND

THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A

NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT OF THE GRAND CALUMET RIVER AND THE INDIANA

HARBOR CANAL SYSTEM UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA), AND THE OIL POLLUTION ACT. THE

COMPANY'S PLANT IN EAST CHICAGO, INDIANA, WHICH DISCHARGES INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER

INTO THESE WATERWAYS, WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF 17 POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES (PRPS) FOR THE COST OF THE ASSESSMENT AND ANY DETERMINED NATURAL

PART I

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-CONTINUED

RESOURCE DAMAGES. THE TRUSTEES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEIR PREFERRED REMEDY IS TO

DREDGE THE ENTIRE GRAND CAL/INDIANA HARBOR SYSTEM. DUPONT HAS JOINED WITH EIGHT

OTHER PRPS TO CONTEST THE REMEDY. A SETTLEMENT OFFER HAS BEEN TENDERED TO THE

TRUSTEES AND NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING.

PFOA: WEST VIRGINIA AND OHIO DEPARTMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

DUPONT USES PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS SALTS (PFOA) AS A PROCESSING AID TO

MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AT ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT

IN WOOD COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. CURRENTLY, DUPONT RECOVERS OR DESTROYS OVER 85

PERCENT OF THE PFOA THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE EMITTED OR DISCHARGED DURING THE

MANUFACTURING PROCESS AT THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT. BY THE END OF 2004, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THAT MORE THAN 90 PERCENT WILL BE RECOVERED OR DESTROYED.

IN NOVEMBER 2001, THE WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

(WVDEP) AND DUPONT SIGNED A MULTIMEDIA CONSENT ORDER (THE WV ORDER) THAT

REQUIRES ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING AND ANALYSES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCREENING

LEVELS FOR PFOA THAT IS USED OR MANAGED BY THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT. AS A

RESULT OF THIS PROCESS, WVDEP ISSUED ITS FINAL AMMONIUM PERFLUOROOCTANOATE

ASSESSMENT OF TOXICITY TEAM REPORT IN AUGUST 2002. IN THE REPORT, THE WVDEP

ESTABLISHED A SCREENING LEVEL OF 150 MICROGRAMS OF PFOA PER LITER SCREENING

LEVEL FOR DRINKING WATER AND A SOIL SCREENING LEVEL OF 240 PARTS PER MILLION.

NONE OF THE LOCAL SOURCES FOR DRINKING WATER HAS TESTED AT OR ABOVE THE

SCREENING LEVEL. THE REPORT ESTABLISHED A SCREENING LEVEL OF 1 MICROGRAM PER

CUBIC METER FOR AIR. DUPONT RECENTLY SUBMITTED TO THE WVDEP ITS INITIAL AIR

DISPERSION MODELING RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD SEPTEMBER 2002 THROUGH AUGUST 2003

WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT THE AIR SCREENING LEVEL WAS NOT EXCEEDED DURING THE TIME

PERIOD.

UNLESS DUPONT VIOLATES ITS TERMS, THE WV ORDER DOES NOT CALL FOR SANCTIONS.

DUPONT HAS COMPLETED ALL MAJOR ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY REQUIRED BY THE WV ORDER AND

HAS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $3.5 MILLION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003, IN CONNECTION

WITH THESE ACTIVITIES. DUPONT EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR PUBLIC DRINKING

WATER SUPPLIES IN AND AROUND THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT ON A QUARTERLY AND/OR

ANNUAL BASIS. THE SCOPE AND EXTENT OF THIS MONITORING HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY PERFORM OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AS SUGGESTED

BY RESULTS RECEIVED FROM STUDIES PERFORMED UNDER THE WV ORDER.

ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING OF THE PFOA LEVELS IN THE GROUNDWATER AND DRINKING WATER

HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER PURSUANT TO A MEMORANDUM OF

UNDERSTANDING AMONG DUPONT, THE OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, THE WVDEP,

AND THE DIVISION OF HEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES (THE MOU). UNDER THE MOU, THESE

RESULTS WERE SHARED WITH THE OHIO EPA. ALSO, DUPONT IS FUNDING INVESTIGATIONS OF

GROUND AND DRINKING WATER IN THAT STATE COMPARABLE TO THE STUDIES IN WEST

VIRGINIA, PURSUANT TO THE MOU. IN ADDITION, DUPONT SIGNED A SAFE DRINKING WATER

CONSENT (SDWC) ORDER WITH EPA REGION III (WHICH INCLUDES WEST VIRGINIA) AND

REGION V (WHICH INCLUDES OHIO) IN MARCH 2002 TO ASSURE PROVISION OF ALTERNATIVE

DRINKING WATER IF SUPPLIES ARE FOUND TO EXCEED SCREENING LEVELS ESTABLISHED

UNDER THE WV ORDER. SINCE THE PFOA CONCENTRATIONS IN DRINKING WATER TESTED TO

DATE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE SCREENING LEVEL, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT DUPONT

WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER UNDER THE SDWC ORDER.

NEW JOHNSONVILLE, TENNESSEE

THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) CONDUCTED A MULTI-MEDIA AUDIT OF

DUPONT'S TITANIUM DIOXIDE PLANT IN NEW JOHNSONVILLE, TENNESSEE IN THE SUMMER OF

2001. IN DECEMBER 2002, THE EPA ALLEGED CERTAIN POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS BY DUPONT

AND ITS CONTRACTOR UNDER SECTION 608 OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA) REGARDING

REFRIGERANT EMISSIONS.

THE EPA REQUESTED SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS REGARDING THE REPAIR,

CHARGING AND MAINTENANCE OF THE REFRIGERANT MACHINES AT THE NEW JOHNSONVILLE

PLANT FROM DUPONT'S CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF

CERTAIN REFRIGERATION MACHINES AT THE PLANT. A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS

WERE PROVIDED TO THE EPA. IN ADDITION, DUPONT AND ITS CONTRACTOR HAVE HAD

NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EPA SINCE JANUARY 2003 TO OBTAIN MORE SPECIFICITY

REGARDING THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS AND TO RESPOND TO THE EPA'S VARIOUS INQUIRIES.

DUPONT AND ITS CONTRACTOR CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THE EPA IN AN

EFFORT TO REACH A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EPA'S

ALLEGED CAA REGULATORY VIOLATIONS. THE EPA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE

PRESENTED DUPONT AND ITS CONTRACTOR WITH A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT APPROACH. DUPONT

IS CONSIDERING ITS OPTIONS AND ANTICIPATES RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IN 2004.

PART I

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS-CONTINUED

FORT HILL NEW SOURCE REVIEW ENFORCEMENT ACTION

IN 2003, THE EPA ISSUED A "NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND FINDING OF VIOLATION" FOR THE

DUPONT FORT HILL SULFURIC ACID PLANT IN NORTH BEND, OHIO. THE EPA CONDUCTED A

REVIEW OF CAPITAL PROJECTS AT THE PLANT OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. BASED ON ITS

REVIEW, THE EPA BELIEVES THAT TWO OF THE PROJECTS TRIGGERED A REQUIREMENT TO

MEET THE NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR SULFURIC ACID PLANTS AND THAT

DUPONT SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A PERMIT UNDER THE NEW SOURCE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS OF

THE CLEAN AIR ACT. DUPONT VIGOROUSLY DISAGREES WITH THE EPA'S FINDINGS BECAUSE

THE EPA CONTINUES TO CHANGE ITS INTERPRETATION OF THESE RULES AND REQUIREMENTS

WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE REQUIRED PROCESS TO AMEND THEM. THE COURTS ARE SPLIT

ON THESE INTERPRETATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS THREE OTHER SULFURIC ACID PLANTS THAT

USE SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY.

THE EPA HAS INVITED THE COMPANY TO BEGIN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS, BUT INSISTS

THAT ALL FOUR SULFURIC ACID PLANTS BE INCLUDED. SINCE THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL PREVAIL IF IT LITIGATES THIS MATTER, DUPONT HAS ACCEPTED

THE EPA'S INVITATION. IF THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL, IT IS REASONABLY

LIKELY THAT THE RESULTING SETTLEMENT WOULD INCLUDE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WELL

AS PENALTIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF SUCH

COSTS AT THIS TIME.

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

IN EARLY 2002, THE COMPANY WAS REORGANIZED INTO FIVE GROWTH PLATFORMS TO EXTEND

THE GLOBAL REACH AND COMPETITIVENESS OF ITS BUSINESSES AND TO BRING GREATER

FOCUS TO ATTAIN FINANCIAL TARGETS OF 6 PERCENT REVENUE GROWTH, 10 PERCENT

EARNINGS GROWTH, AND 1 PERCENTAGE POINT IMPROVEMENT IN RETURN ON INVESTOR'S

CAPITAL (ROIC) PER YEAR. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED 12 PERCENT REVENUE GROWTH IN

2003 DRIVEN BY VOLUME INCREASES IN THE FIVE GROWTH PLATFORMS WHICH AVERAGED 5

PERCENT IN 2003. STRATEGIES ARE IN PLACE, INCLUDING DEVELOPING A MORE DIRECT AND

POWERFUL CONNECTION TO CUSTOMERS AND STRENGTHENING THE COMPANY'S PRESENCE IN

EMERGING HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS, TO DELIVER STRONG REVENUE GROWTH AGAIN IN 2004. A

SIXTH PLATFORM, THE COMPANY'S MATURE TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT, WAS FORMED TO

PREPARE FOR ITS SEPARATION FROM THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S SEVENTH PLATFORM IS

ITS PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT.

ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003, THE COMPANY AND KOCH INDUSTRIES, INC. (KOCH) ANNOUNCED

THAT THEY HAD REACHED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

NET ASSETS OF THE TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT TO SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH. THESE

NET ASSETS AND RELATED BUSINESSES ARE NOW REFERRED TO AS INVISTA. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS THE SALE TO CLOSE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2004. THE SUCCESSFUL

SEPARATION OF INVISTA IS AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOR ACHIEVING A PROFITABLE

GROWTH STRATEGY, AND FOR REDUCING THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO THE VOLATILITY OF

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, WHICH HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANY'S EARNINGS IN 2003.

IN 2003, STRONG DEMAND CONTINUED IN HOUSING, CONSTRUCTION AND MOTOR VEHICLE

RELATED MARKETS WHICH, ALONG WITH PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT

DEMAND DRIVERS FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. HIGHER SALES VOLUMES RESULTED FROM

THE ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT IN THESE KEY MARKETS AND INCREASED MARKET SHARE;

HOWEVER, BROAD IMPROVEMENT IN U.S. MANUFACTURING DID NOT MATERIALIZE UNTIL LATE

IN THE YEAR. AT THE SAME TIME, 2003 PRICES FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS ROSE

SUBSTANTIALLY AFTER HITTING POST-RECESSION LOWS IN EARLY 2002, AND REMAINED AT

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. HIGHER HYDROCARBON PRICES ARE

THE SINGLE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY'S RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES, AND

CONCURRENTLY REDUCED GROSS MARGINS SINCE ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF RAW MATERIAL

COST INCREASES WERE RECOVERED THROUGH HIGHER SELLING PRICES. REFLECTING

HISTORICALLY HIGH OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS REDUCED

2003 AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY ABOUT $650 MILLION VERSUS 2002. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF THIS IMPACT OCCURRED IN TWO SEGMENTS, TEXTILES & INTERIORS AND PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS WHICH, TOGETHER, CONSUME APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S OIL

AND NATURAL GAS RELATED RAW MATERIALS. EARNINGS WERE ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

A $696 MILLION AFTER-TAX CHARGE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SEPARATION OF INVISTA.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN NON-CASH PENSION, OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, AND STOCK OPTION COSTS WHICH REDUCED AFTER-TAX EARNINGS

BY ABOUT $400 MILLION VERSUS 2002.

THEREFORE, DESPITE A 12 PERCENT INCREASE IN 2003 SALES, INCOME BEFORE THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DECLINED 46 PERCENT TO $1

BILLION. TO RESTORE PROFITABILITY, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO IMPROVE 2005

PRETAX EARNINGS BY $900 MILLION THROUGH VARIABLE MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS, FIXED COST

REDUCTIONS, AND ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIONS. APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION OF THE

IMPROVEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED IN 2004. COST IMPROVEMENTS TARGETED IN

2004 WILL ESSENTIALLY OFFSET RESIDUAL COSTS FROM THE SEPARATION OF INVISTA AND

OTHER EXPECTED FIXED COST INCREASES, THUS ALLOWING THE FULL MEASURE OF THE

COMPANY'S EXPECTED 2004 VOLUME AND PRICE IMPROVEMENT TO BENEFIT OPERATING

EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A VERY STRONG LIQUIDITY

PROFILE. CASH BALANCES OF OVER $3 BILLION AND BANK CREDIT LINES OF $4.1 BILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, PROVIDE PRIMARY LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ALL SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS. SECONDARY LIQUIDITY, SUFFICIENT TO MEET UPCOMING DEBT MATURITIES,

COMES FROM EXCELLENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, STRONG CASH FLOW GENERATION AND

THE ABILITY TO SELL ASSETS.

SOLAE COMPANY AND THE PURCHASE OF THE REMAINING INTEREST IN GRIFFIN LLC IN 2003,

AS WELL AS THE PURCHASE OF CHEMFIRST, INC. AND LIQUI-BOX CORPORATION WHICH

HIGHER WORLDWIDE U.S. DOLLAR SELLING PRICES PRIMARILY REFLECT THE BENEFICIAL

CURRENCY IMPACT OF THE WEAKER DOLLAR, WHICH INCREASED WORLDWIDE SALES BY 5

ASIA PACIFIC REGION, REFLECTING INCREASED SALES OF ELECTRONICS-RELATED MATERIALS

AND POLYMERS, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, AND ENGINEERING POLYMERS.

2002 VS 2001 CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2002 WERE DOWN $0.7 BILLION OR 3 PERCENT

VOLUME GROWTH OF 4 PERCENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SALES VOLUMES ACROSS ALL

REGIONS, LED BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN ASIA PACIFIC WHERE THERE WAS STRONG

DEMAND FOR MATERIALS AND POLYMERS FOR ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS, ENGINEERING

POLYMERS, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, AND COATINGS. WORLDWIDE SALES VOLUME GROWTH REFLECTS

DEMAND ACROSS MOST PRODUCT LINES, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE TEXTILES &

INTERIORS, PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, AND COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES SEGMENTS.

FOUR PERCENT LOWER LOCAL CURRENCY PRICES REFLECTS COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES,

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS INSTITUTED IN 2002 AND 2001 FURTHER ALIGNED RESOURCES

CONSISTENT WITH THE SPECIFIC MISSIONS OF THE SEGMENTS, THEREBY IMPROVING

COMPETITIVENESS, ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARD SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND ADDRESSING

WEAKENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY RECORDED NET CHARGES OF $290 MILLION

AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THESE

PROGRAMS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW; ADDITIONAL DETAILS ARE CONTAINED IN NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

2002 COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES

A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WAS INSTITUTED WITHIN COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER 2002 TO TERMINATE APPROXIMATELY 775 EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN

TECHNICAL, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. ESSENTIALLY

ALL EMPLOYEES HAD BEEN TERMINATED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THEREBY COMPLETING

THIS PORTION OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SHUT DOWN OPERATING

FACILITIES DURING 2003 DUE TO TRANSFERRING PRODUCTION TO MORE COST EFFECTIVE

FACILITIES.

IN THE AGGREGATE, PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AND

TO THIRD PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY FOR DISMANTLEMENT AND REMOVAL ACTIVITIES, ARE

EXPECTED TO TOTAL ABOUT $75 MILLION. OVER 50 PERCENT OF THESE CASH OUTLAYS WERE

MADE IN 2003, AND MOST OF THE REMAINING PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE IN 2004. AS A

RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS ANNUAL PRETAX COST SAVINGS OF

ABOUT $55 MILLION PER YEAR WHEN COMPLETED WITH ABOUT 60 PERCENT REALIZED IN

2003, AND ESSENTIALLY ALL THE REMAINING SAVINGS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED IN 2004.

ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THESE SAVINGS WILL RESULT IN REDUCED COST OF GOODS SOLD AND

OTHER OPERATING CHARGES, WITH THE REMAINING 30 PERCENT EXPECTED TO BE DIVIDED

ABOUT EVENLY BETWEEN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

2002 TEXTILES & INTERIORS

A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WAS INSTITUTED WITHIN TEXTILES & INTERIORS IN THE SECOND

QUARTER 2002 TO TERMINATE APPROXIMATELY 2,000 EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN TECHNICAL,

MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES, AND TO SHUT DOWN

OPERATING FACILITIES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO TRANSFERRING PRODUCTION TO MORE COST

EFFECTIVE FACILITIES. ESSENTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES HAD BEEN TERMINATED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THEREBY COMPLETING THIS PORTION OF THE PROGRAM.

IN THE AGGREGATE, PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AND

THIRD PARTIES FOR DISMANTLEMENT AND REMOVAL ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL

ABOUT $160 MILLION. ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF THE CASH OUTLAYS WERE MADE IN 2002, 40

PERCENT IN 2003, 20 PERCENT ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN 2004, AND THE REMAINDER

IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN 2005. THE COMPANY REALIZED ANNUAL PRETAX COST SAVINGS

OF ABOUT $120 MILLION PER YEAR FROM THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. ABOUT 20 PERCENT

OF THESE SAVINGS WERE REALIZED IN 2002, AND ESSENTIALLY ALL THE REMAINING

SAVINGS WERE REALIZED IN 2003. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THESE SAVINGS RESULTED IN

REDUCED COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES, WITH THE REMAINING 20

PERCENT DIVIDED EVENLY BETWEEN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

2001 RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS INSTITUTED IN 2001 IMPACTED ESSENTIALLY ALL SEGMENTS.

UNDER THE PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY TERMINATED APPROXIMATELY 5,500 EMPLOYEES

INVOLVED IN TECHNICAL, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES,

REDUCED THE CONTRACTOR WORK FORCE BY ABOUT 1,300, AND SHUT DOWN OPERATING

FACILITIES PRINCIPALLY DUE TO TRANSFERRING PRODUCTION TO MORE COST COMPETITIVE

FACILITIES.

IN THE AGGREGATE, PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AND

TO THIRD PARTIES FOR DISMANTLEMENT AND REMOVAL ACTIVITIES AND TO TERMINATE

CONTRACTS ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL ABOUT $375 MILLION. ABOUT $150 MILLION OF THESE

CASH OUTLAYS WERE MADE IN 2001, $182 MILLION IN 2002, $21 MILLION IN 2003, AND

MOST OF THE REMAINING PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE IN 2004. THE 2003 BENEFIT TO

EARNINGS WAS APPROXIMATELY $440 MILLION BEFORE TAXES WITH ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF

THESE SAVINGS RESULTING IN REDUCED COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING

CHARGES, ABOUT 30 PERCENT RESULTING IN REDUCED SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE BALANCE RESULTING IN REDUCED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. FACILITY SHUTDOWN AND CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS RESULTING IN

LOWER DEPRECIATION AND LEASE EXPENSE CONTRIBUTED ABOUT $35 MILLION OF THE TOTAL

COST SAVINGS.

FUTURE COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2003 THAT IT WOULD TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS TO

ENSURE ITS GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AS A MORE FOCUSED, SCIENCE-BASED COMPANY

FOLLOWING THE SEPARATION OF INVISTA. INCLUDED ARE VARIABLE MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS,

FIXED COST REDUCTIONS, AND ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE A

$900 MILLION PRETAX COST IMPROVEMENT IN 2005. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS ACTIONS TO

YIELD A $450 MILLION COST IMPROVEMENT IN 2004, AND THE FULL $900 MILLION IN

2005. COST IMPROVEMENTS TARGETED IN 2004 WILL ESSENTIALLY OFFSET RESIDUAL COSTS

FROM THE SEPARATION OF INVISTA AND OTHER EXPECTED FIXED COST INCREASES, THUS

ALLOWING THE FULL MEASURE OF THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED 2004 VOLUME AND PRICE

IMPROVEMENT TO BENEFIT OPERATING EARNINGS. A PORTION OF THE FIXED COST SAVINGS

WILL COME FROM WORK FORCE REDUCTIONS.

THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING PLANS TO MEET THE

OBJECTIVES ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER AND EXPECTS TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE INFORMATION ON

THE NUMBER OF POSITION ELIMINATIONS AND ANY RESTRUCTURING CHARGES DURING THE

FIRST HALF OF 2004.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $1.6 BILLION FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER

CHARGES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE EXPECTED SALE OF INVISTA. IN ADDITION, UPON

RECLASSIFICATION TO ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, THE COMPANY CEASED DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION OF THESE ASSETS. THIS IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE COMPANY'S

QUARTERLY 2004 EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $.07 PER SHARE UNTIL SEPARATION.

ADDITIONAL CHARGES AND CREDITS RELATED TO THE EXPECTED SALE OF INVISTA MAY BE

RECORDED, SOME OF WHICH MIGHT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT DUE TO ONGOING

PURCHASES AND SALES BETWEEN INVISTA AND THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS OTHER ONGOING

OBLIGATIONS. THIS CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT PRECLUDES THE COMPANY FROM REPORTING

INVISTA RESULTS AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

UPON CLOSING OF THE PENDING SALE OF INVISTA, THE COMPANY WILL INDEMNIFY KOCH

AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES, LEGAL MATTERS,

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INDEMNITIES AND

WILL RECORD THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INDEMNITIES UPON CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION.

UNDER THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY'S TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION

FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CANNOT EXCEED

APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION. THE REMAINING INDEMNITIES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THIS

MAXIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE INDEMNITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FUTURE LIQUIDITY OF THE

COMPANY. SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL

2003 VS. 2002 THE 2003 EITR IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE 2002 EITR OF 8.7

PERCENT. THE CHANGE IN EITR FOR 2003 IS PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY THE RECORDING OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN TWO EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES FOR THEIR TAX BASIS INVESTMENT

LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON LOCAL TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF

JURISDICTIONAL MIX AND OTHER TAX BENEFITS WAS MAGNIFIED BY THE LOW LEVEL OF

PRETAX EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR.

THE COMPANY'S CURRENTESTIMATE OF THE 2004 EITR IS ABOUT 25 PERCENT, EXCLUDING

ANY TAX EFFECTS ON EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES OR SPECIAL ITEMS, NEITHER OF WHICH CAN

BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

2002 VS. 2001 THE 2002 EITR OF 8.7 PERCENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE 2001

EITR OF 36 PERCENT. THERE WERE FOUR KEY FACTORS DRIVING THE REDUCTION IN THE

RATE: (1) A GREATER PORTION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS BEING GENERATED IN JURISDICTIONS

WITH LOWER TAX RATES, (2) AN INCREASED UTILIZATION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, (3)

TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH LOSSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, AND (4) THE

TAX IMPACT OF THE 2002 SPECIAL ITEMS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 20. ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF

THE DECREASE IN THE EITR RELATES TO THE FIRST TWO ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ANOTHER

30 PERCENT RELATES TO THE TAX BENEFIT ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND THE

BALANCE RELATES TO THE TAX IMPACT OF SPECIAL ITEMS. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS WHICH

CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER EITR ARE THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS,

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND AGREEMENT ON CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR

AUDIT ISSUES.

ON JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 143, "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS," WHICH

REQUIRES COMPANIES TO RECORD AN ASSET AND RELATED LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LONG-LIVED TANGIBLE ASSET IF A LEGAL

LIABILITY TO RETIRE THE ASSET EXISTS. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD RESULTED IN

A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO

INCOME OF $29 MILLION.

THE COMPANY'S ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,"

RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO INCOME OF $2,944 MILLION,

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002. THIS CHARGE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS

OF $2,866 MILLION IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT AND $78 MILLION IN THE

TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT.

ON JANUARY 1, 2001, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS AMENDED. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133

RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE AFTER-TAX

BENEFIT OF $11 MILLION.

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

NET LOSS FOR THE YEAR 2002 WAS $1,103 MILLION COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $4,339

MILLION IN 2001. INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES WAS $1,841 MILLION IN 2002 VERSUS $4,328 MILLION IN 2001. 2002 INCOME

BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE INCLUDES SPECIAL

ITEMS TOTALING $168 MILLION IN NET AFTER-TAX CHARGES. 2001 INCLUDES A NET

AFTER-TAX BENEFIT OF $3,077 MILLION FOR SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDING A $3,866 MILLION

AFTER-TAX GAIN RECORDED ON THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS. SPECIAL ITEMS FOR

EACH YEAR ARE LISTED ABOVE.

IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SPECIAL

ITEMS IN BOTH YEARS, THE YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGE IN INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN INCOME OF

APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION RESULTING FROM HIGHER SALES VOLUME, REDUCTIONS IN RAW

MATERIAL COSTS, LOWER FIXED COSTS, ABSENCE OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION, REDUCED

INTEREST EXPENSE AND LOWER INCOME TAXES. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY

THE IMPACT OF LOWER SELLING PRICES.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ON A DILUTED BASIS WERE A LOSS OF $1.11 IN 2002 VERSUS

EARNINGS OF $4.16 IN 2001.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED

INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES"

(VIES), WHICH IS AN INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 51,

"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS." FIN 46 ADDRESSES THE APPLICATION OF ARB NO.

51 TO VIES, AND GENERALLY WOULD REQUIRE THAT ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND RESULTS OF

THE ACTIVITY OF A VIE BE CONSOLIDATED INTO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

ENTERPRISE THAT IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THIS INTERPRETATION

APPLIES IMMEDIATELY TO VIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, AND TO VIES IN WHICH

A COMPANY OBTAINS AN INTEREST AFTER THAT DATE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT CREATED OR

OBTAINED AN INTEREST IN ANY VIES IN 2003. IN ADDITION, THE INTERPRETATION

BECOMES APPLICABLE ON DECEMBER 31, 2003, FOR SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES)

CREATED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD NO

SPES FOR WHICH IT WAS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR NON-SPES IN WHICH

A COMPANY HOLDS A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT IT ACQUIRED BEFORE FEBRUARY 1, 2003,

THE FASB HAS POSTPONED THE DATE ON WHICH THE INTERPRETATION WILL BECOME

APPLICABLE TO MARCH 31, 2004.

THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED TWO NON-CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AS VIES WHERE DUPONT IS

CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. ONE ENTITY PROVIDES MANUFACTURING SERVICES

FOR THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER ENTITY IS A REAL ESTATE RENTAL OPERATION. THE

COMPANY GUARANTEES ALL DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF THESE ENTITIES, WHICH TOTALED $136

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN OBLIGATIONS FOR

EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHERS IN NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46, THE COMPANY WILL

CONSOLIDATE THESE VIES AS OF MARCH 31, 2004. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THESE VIES TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE ACT) INTO LAW. AS PERMITTED UNDER

FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 106-1, "ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF

2003", THE COMPANY DID NOT REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF THIS ACT IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. IN JANUARY 2004, THE COMPANY

AMENDED ITS U.S. MEDICAL PLAN TO BE SECONDARY TO MEDICARE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG

COVERAGE BEGINNING IN 2006 FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND SURVIVORS. AS A RESULT OF

THIS PLAN AMENDMENT, FAS 106-1 WILL NOT APPLY TO THE COMPANY. SEE FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF PLAN AMENDMENT UNDER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS BEGINNING ON PAGE

37 AND NOTE 28 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104, "REVENUE RECOGNITION", WHICH

SUPERSEDES SAB NO. 101. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF SAB NO. 104 IS TO RESCIND

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN SAB NO. 101 AND THE SEC'S "REVENUE RECOGNITION

IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS" (THE FAQ)

RELATED TO MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT

THE ISSUANCE OF SAB NO. 104 TO IMPACT ITS CURRENT REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO

PROVIDE THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE

INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND

INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING

RESERVES AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, AND VARIOUS OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE

COMPANY REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS APPROPRIATE.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENT SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL

JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS

IN ALL PENSION PLANS WAS $18 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND THE RELATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS WERE $21 BILLION. IN ADDITION, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

COMPANY'S UNFUNDED OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS WERE $5 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003. EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS

ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

AND NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S PRETAX EARNINGS

DUE TO CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, BASED ON ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER

31, 2003.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY

HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE. THE

COMPANY'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY

OF THE SITE, THE NATURE OF THE REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH

REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT

MULTIPARTY SITES, AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS. THE

COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $380 MILLION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST

THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS

AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE

UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT

(CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE

COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE

COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF

SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA,

RCRA OR STATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK

FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE VARIOUS LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL

REGULATIONS, AND COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY FOR

CLEANING UP THE DAMAGE RESULTING FROM COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE DISPOSAL. OVER THE

NEXT TWO DECADES THE COMPANY MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS UNDER BOTH CERCLA AND

RCRA.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO

SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE

SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF PRPS.

THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE

REMEDIATION COSTS. A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IS CONTAINED

IN MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, BEGINNING ON PAGE 39.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION

ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT

CLAIMS AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS. THE COMPANY RECORDS RESERVES FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN

THE INFORMA-

22

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

TION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. PREDICTING THE OUTCOME

OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION, AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES

SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM

ESTIMATES. IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS,

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED

TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANY'S

EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS

FILED, INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL AND THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE MATTER.

CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A

LITIGATION RESERVE WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A

COURT PROCEEDING. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF,

BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY

OVERTURNED ON APPEAL. A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION MATTERS IS

CONTAINED IN NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMPLEXITY OF TAX

REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING THE

ULTIMATE TAXES THE COMPANY WILL PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON

MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS

JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING

FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE

UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S TAX ASSETS AND TAX

LIABILITIES.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF

APPROPRIATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE REALIZATION OF

THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS

SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE,

CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY

WILL REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD RESULT IN RECORDING A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET. IN SOME SITUATIONS THESE

CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

IN 2003, DUPONT RECORDED $669 MILLION IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO

EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES FOR THEIR TAX BASIS INVESTMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON LOCAL

TAX RETURNS. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED

PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO

FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO

THESE ASSETS.

CORPORATE OUTLOOK

THE COMPANY'S OVERALL OUTLOOK FOR 2004 IS POSITIVE. DUPONT EXPECTS CYCLICAL

RECOVERY IN MAJOR INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES, IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING GROWTH IN

EMERGING ECONOMIES. THIS IS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT GLOBAL REAL GDP GROWTH OF 3.6

PERCENT IN 2004, WHICH WOULD BE THE LARGEST FULL-YEAR INCREASE SINCE 2000. THE

COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS THAT IN CONTRAST TO RECENT YEARS THE MANUFACTURING SECTORS

OF THE DEVELOPED INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES WILL GROW AT RATES STRONGER THAN THEIR

REGIONAL GDP.

THE MAJOR RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OUTLOOK ARE SUSTAINED

INCREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES OR A FALTERING U.S. ECONOMIC EXPANSION.

HOWEVER, WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE RECOVERY AND ITS CURRENT MOMENTUM, DUPONT

BELIEVES THAT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN 2004 WILL BE POSITIVE FOR ITS

BUSINESSES.

SPECIFIC KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND ACTIONS THAT SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK FOR 2004

INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

O IN DECEMBER 2003, DUPONT ANNOUNCED A PROGRAM TO REDUCE FIXED COSTS AND

IMPROVE VARIABLE MARGINS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS ACTIONS TO YIELD A $450

MILLION PRETAX COST IMPROVEMENT IN 2004, AND THE FULL $900 MILLION IN 2005.

COST IMPROVEMENTS TARGETED IN 2004 WILL ESSENTIALLY OFFSET RESIDUAL COSTS

FROM THE SEPARATION OF INVISTA AND OTHER EXPECTED FIXED COST INCREASES.

O WITH OIL AND U.S. NATURAL GAS PRICES REMAINING HIGH, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT ANY RELIEF FROM HYDROCARBON COSTS IN 2004 AND ANTICIPATES THAT

PRICES FOR RAW MATERIALS WILL REMAIN AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE 2003 LEVELS.

O THE COMPANY'S CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE 2004 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS

ABOUT 25 PERCENT, EXCLUDING ANY TAX EFFECTS ON EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES OR

SPECIAL ITEMS, NEITHER OF WHICH CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK FOR 2004 IS BETWEEN $2.00 AND $2.20 EARNINGS

PER SHARE. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ESTIMATES FOR ANY 2004 SPECIAL ITEMS, INCLUDING

THOSE ANTICIPATED FOR RESTRUCTURING AND THE INVISTA SEPARATION, AS SUCH ITEMS

CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION LEVERAGES DUPONT TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND

INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE TO IMPROVE THE QUANTITY, QUALITY AND SAFETY OF THE GLOBAL

FOOD SUPPLY. GLOBAL LAND AREA THAT CAN BE USED IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS

BECOMING INCREASINGLY LIMITED. THEREFORE, INCREASES IN PRODUCTION WILL NEED TO

BE ACHIEVED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH IMPROVING CROP YIELDS AND PRODUCTIVITY RATHER

THAN THROUGH INCREASES IN PLANTED ACREAGE. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION DELIVERS A

BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO

ACHIEVE GAINS IN CROP YIELDS AND PRODUCTIVITY, INCLUDING PIONEER(R) BRAND SEED

PRODUCTS AND WELL-ESTABLISHED BRANDS OF INSECTICIDES, FUNGICIDES AND HERBICIDES.

THE SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDES GLOBAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOY-BASED FOOD

INGREDIENTS, FOOD QUALITY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, AND LIQUID

FOOD PACKAGING SYSTEMS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THIS SEGMENT FOCUSES ON

LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE GROWER PRODUCTIVITY AND ENHANCE THE VALUE OF

GRAINS AND SOY USED IN FEED AND FOOD THROUGH IMPROVED SEED TRAITS AND THE

EFFECTIVE USE OF INSECTICIDES, HERBICIDES AND FUNGICIDES.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, PIONEER

HI-BRED INTERNATIONAL, INC., WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST SEED PRODUCER AND THE

WORLD LEADER IN IMPROVING CROP YIELDS WITH HYBRID AND VARIETAL SEEDS THAT

IMPROVE GROWER YIELDS AND PROVIDE INSECT PROTECTION AND HERBICIDE TOLERANCE. THE

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AT PIONEER ARE HYBRID SEED CORN AND SOYBEAN SEED. DURING

2003, PIONEER(R) BRAND CORN HYBRIDS OUTPERFORMED COMPETITIVE HYBRIDS IN NORTH

AMERICA BY AN AVERAGE YIELD OF 6.1 BUSHELS PER ACRE BASED ON SIDE-BY-SIDE

COMPARISONS. WHILE THE COMMERCIAL SEED INDUSTRY FOR MAJOR CROPS REMAINED STABLE

IN 2003, PIONEER INCREASED MARKET SHARE IN THE EUROPEAN AND SOUTH AMERICAN SEED

CORN MARKETS, WITH OVER 10 PERCENT GROWTH IN SALES IN 2003.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ALSO SERVES THE GLOBAL AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WITH CROP

PROTECTION PRODUCTS FOR THE GRAIN AND SPECIALTY CROP SECTORS AS WELL AS FORESTRY

AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. DEMAND FOR DUPONT CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN 2003

INCREASED AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF DECLINE, REFLECTING HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES AND

FARM INCOME. SALES OF CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS INCREASED ABOUT 12 PERCENT,

REFLECTING MARKET SHARE GROWTH IN INSECTICIDE SALES FOR USE ON COTTON CROPS IN

ASIA PACIFIC; AN EXPANDED PRESENCE IN THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SPECIALTY MARKET

SECTORS; AND PRODUCT REGISTRATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE USE OF EXISTING PRODUCTS IN

NEW MARKETS. IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED GRIFFIN CORPORATION'S 50

PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN GRIFFIN LLC FOR $13 MILLION, NET OF $18 MILLION

CASH ACQUIRED, THEREBY BECOMING THE SOLE OWNER. THIS ACQUISITION STRENGTHENED

THE SEGMENT'S PRODUCT, SALES, MARKETING AND MANUFACTURING RESOURCES AND

EXPERTISE TO BETTER SERVE CROP PROTECTION CUSTOMERS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION'S SALES OF SOY PROTEIN EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH IN

2003, LARGELY DUE TO THE FORMATION IN EARLY 2003 OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN DUPONT

AND BUNGE LIMITED. THIS ALLIANCE RESULTED IN (1) A MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE, THE

SOLAE COMPANY, THAT FOCUSES ON THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF

SPECIALTY FOOD INGREDIENTS, INCLUDING SOY PROTEINS AND LECITHINS; (2) A

BIOTECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT TO JOINTLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE SOYBEANS WITH

IMPROVED QUALITY TRAITS; AND (3) AN ALLIANCE TO DEVELOP A BROADER OFFERING OF

SERVICES AND PRODUCTS FOR FARMERS. DUPONT CONTRIBUTED ITS SOY FOOD INGREDIENTS

BUSINESS TO THE VENTURE FOR A 72 PERCENT MAJORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE

SOLAE COMPANY, AND BUNGE CONTRIBUTED BUSINESSES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $520

MILLION FOR A 28 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE VENTURE.

THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, QUALICON INC., AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ALSO

PROVIDES DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTOMATED INSTRUMENT

FOR FINGERPRINTING THE DNA OF BACTERIA TO HELP FOOD AND HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY

CUSTOMERS MONITOR THE MICROBIAL ENVIRONMENT IN THEIR MANUFACTURING

24

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

PROCESSES AND FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE SEGMENT OFFERS SYSTEMS FOR THE

ASEPTIC AND REFRIGERATED LIQUID PACKAGING OF BEVERAGES, DAIRY PRODUCTS AND

PUMPABLE FOODS IN RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL APPLICATIONS. SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS

AND SYSTEMS EXPERIENCED GROWTH OF ALMOST 50 PERCENT IN 2003.

2003 VERSUS 2002 SALES OF $5.5 BILLION WERE 21 PERCENT HIGHER AS BOTH U.S.

DOLLAR (USD) SELLING PRICES AND VOLUMES INCREASED 6 PERCENT. THE 21 PERCENT

INCREASE ALSO INCLUDES 9 PERCENT DUE TO ADDITIONAL SALES RESULTING FROM THE

FORMATION OF THE SOLAE COMPANY AND THE ACQUISITION OF THE REMAINING INTEREST OF

GRIFFIN LLC. HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES RESULTED PRINCIPALLY DUE TO CURRENCY

TRANSLATION, REFLECTING THE WEAKER DOLLAR. VOLUME GROWTH PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS

INCREASED CORN SEED SALES IN MARKETS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, HIGHER SALES OF

HERBICIDES IN NORTH AMERICA, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INSECTICIDE SALES IN ASIA

PACIFIC, AND HIGHER WORLDWIDE SALES OF SOY-BASED PRODUCTS.

2003 ATOI WAS $540 MILLION, INCLUDING AN AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $41 MILLION

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FORMATION OF THE SOLAE COMPANY. THIS COMPARES TO ATOI OF

$443 MILLION IN 2002, WHICH INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF $67 MILLION RELATED TO

REVISIONS IN POST-EMPLOYMENT COSTS FOR PIONEER, A $25 MILLION CHARGE TO REFLECT

AN EXPECTED LOSS ON THE SALE OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN EUROPE, AND A $29

MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE OFF INVENTORIES OF DISCONTINUED HERBICIDE PRODUCTS. THE

IMPROVEMENT IN 2003 ATOI ALSO REFLECTS THE BENEFITS OF HIGHER VOLUMES AND

FAVORABLE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NON-CASH

PENSION EXPENSE AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $4.5 BILLION WERE 5 PERCENT HIGHER, REFLECTING 3

PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME AND A 2 PERCENT INCREASE DUE TO THE MAY 2002 ACQUISITION

OF LIQUI-BOX, A PROVIDER OF SYSTEMS FOR ASEPTIC AND REFRIGERATED LIQUID

PACKAGING. ATOI WAS $443 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES A BENEFIT OF $67 MILLION

RELATED TO REVISIONS IN POST-EMPLOYMENT COSTS FOR PIONEER, A $25 MILLION CHARGE

TO REFLECT AN EXPECTED LOSS ON THE SALE OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN EUROPE,

AND A $29 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE OFF INVENTORIES OF DISCONTINUED HERBICIDE

PRODUCTS. 2002 ATOI ALSO REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER PIONEER(R), SOY, AND

DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCT SALES AND LOWER OVERALL SEGMENT COSTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO A

$108 MILLION BENEFIT (VERSUS PRIOR YEAR) FROM DISCONTINUING AMORTIZATION OF

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS REQUIRED BY NEW ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS. 2001 ATOI OF $21 MILLION INCLUDED NET CHARGES OF $225 MILLION FOR

EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS, A WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS, LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, AND

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE SALE OF PIONEER INVENTORY.

OUTLOOK THE PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK IS POSITIVE FOR

2004 WITH HIGHER COMMODITY GRAIN PRICES REFLECTING INCREASED CONSUMPTION AND

MINIMAL RESERVE SUPPLIES. NORTH AMERICAN PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE IS EXPECTED TO

REMAIN STABLE IN TERMS OF FARM INCOME AND CASH FLOW, AS PRODUCTION IN THE U.S.

AND CANADA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS.

AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF NEW PRODUCTS WERE LAUNCHED IN 2003 WHICH ARE EXPECTED

TO BENEFIT THE 2004 PLANTING SEASON. THE LAUNCH INCLUDES 18 NEW SOYBEAN

VARIETIES AND 74 NEW PIONEER(R) BRAND CORN HYBRIDS, 46 OF WHICH CONTAIN THE

ROUNDUP READY(R) GENE*. SALES OF CORN HYBRIDS CONTAINING THE ROUNDUP READY(R)

GENE* WERE AT INTRODUCTORY LEVELS IN 2003, WITH FULL LAUNCH PLANNED FOR 2004. AS

PART OF A COMPLETE PRODUCT LINE OFFERING, PIONEER ALSO ANTICIPATES GROWTH IN

TREATED CORN SEED SALES, WHICH DOUBLED IN 2003 FROM 2002 LEVELS AND ARE EXPECTED

TO NEARLY DOUBLE AGAIN IN 2004.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION EXPECTS TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY OF CROP PROTECTION

PRODUCTS THROUGH GROWTH IN SPECIALTY MARKETS AND IMPROVED ASSET UTILIZATION IN

2004. SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES ARE ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE AS A RESULT

OF INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND THE INFLUENCE OF INSECT AND HERBICIDE TOLERANT

CROPS.

THE SEGMENT ALSO ANTICIPATES STRONG GROWTH IN SOY PROTEIN SALES, AS MAJOR FOOD

COMPANIES CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW MAINSTREAM PRODUCTS UTILIZING SOLAE(R) SOY

PROTEINS, AS 8TH CONTINENT(TM) LIGHT SOYMILK IS FULLY LAUNCHED, AND AS THE

VENTURE WITH BUNGE BEGINS TO GENERATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES. A NUMBER OF MAJOR

GLOBAL FOOD COMPANIES HAVE INTRODUCED, OR ARE PLANNING TO INTRODUCE, FOOD AND

BEVERAGE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOLAE(R) SOY PROTEINS. IN ADDITION, THE SEGMENT

EXPECTS TO AGGRESSIVELY GROW ITS FOOD SAFETY BUSINESS IN 2004 THROUGH EXPANDED

TESTING CAPABILITY AND GLOBAL UTILIZATION OF THE BAX(R) BACTERIAL DETECTION

SYSTEM TO DETECT PATHOGENS SUCH AS SALMONELLA, E. COLI AND LISTERIA IN FOOD.

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES IS THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTOMOTIVE COATINGS

SUPPLIER AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE WHITE

PIGMENTS. PRODUCTS OFFERED INCLUDE HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID AND POWDER COATINGS

FOR AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEM), THE AUTOMOTIVE

AFTERMARKET (KNOWN AS REFINISH), AND GENERAL INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, WHICH

INCLUDE COATINGS FOR PLASTICS, BRIDGES, WINDMILLS, PIPES AND APPLIANCES. THE

COMPANY MARKETS ITS REFINISH PRODUCTS USING THE DUPONT(TM), STANDOX(R), SPIES

HECKER(R), AND NASON(R) BRAND NAMES. STANDOX(R) AND SPIES HECKER(R) ARE FOCUSED

ON THE HIGH-END REFINISH MARKETS, WHILE NASON(R) IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY

COATING APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, A BROAD LINE OF DUPONT(TM) TI-PURE(R)

TITANIUM DIOXIDE PRODUCTS IN BOTH SLURRY AND POWDER FORM SERVE THE COATINGS,

PLASTIC AND PAPER INDUSTRIES. THE SEGMENT ALSO OFFERS SPECIALTY PRODUCTS FOR INK

JET DIGITAL PRINTING INCLUDING THE DUPONT(TM) ARTISTRI(TM) PRINTING SYSTEMS FOR

TEXTILES, AND PRODUCTS FOR ADHESIVE BONDING AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION.

THE KEY MARKETS IN WHICH COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES OPERATES WERE GENERALLY

FLAT TO DOWN IN 2003, ALTHOUGH ASIA PACIFIC MARKETS CONTINUED TO RAPIDLY EXPAND.

NORTH AMERICAN LIGHT VEHICLE BUILDS, WHICH INCLUDE AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT TRUCKS,

WERE DOWN 3 PERCENT, WHILE EUROPEAN BUILDS WERE DOWN ABOUT 2 PERCENT. ALTHOUGH

WORLDWIDE REFINISH MARKETS WERE FLAT, THE COMPANY GAINED SHARE IN EUROPE.

INDUSTRIAL AND POWDER COATINGS DEMAND REMAINED DEPRESSED, WITH PARTICULAR

SOFTNESS IN EUROPE. THE COATINGS MARKET IN ASIA PACIFIC GREW 25 PERCENT. AS PART

OF THE SEGMENT'S STRATEGIC INTENT TO SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE EXPANDED

GEOGRAPHICALLY INTO ASIA PACIFIC, COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES FORMED ANOTHER

VENTURE IN 2003 IN CHINA FOR THE MANUFACTURE, SUPPLY, AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF

COATINGS PRODUCTS.

SINCE ITS ACQUISITION OF THE GLOBAL HERBERTS COATINGS BUSINESS IN 1999, THE

SEGMENT HAS UNDERTAKEN A SERIES OF RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS TO CONSOLIDATE

BUSINESS ASSETS AND ELIMINATE REDUNDANCIES. THE MOST RECENT PROGRAM, WHICH WAS

ANNOUNCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, INVOLVED PERSONNEL REDUCTIONS OF ABOUT

775, PRINCIPALLY IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. THIS PROGRAM WAS SUCCESSFULLY

COMPLETED IN 2003.

INDUSTRY DEMAND FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE WHITE PIGMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN 2003.

DEMAND GROWTH OF 10 PERCENT IN ASIA PACIFIC WAS OFFSET BY CONTRACTIONS IN THE

NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN MARKETS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN

ITS OVERALL GLOBAL SHARE. AVERAGE PRICES FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE WHITE PIGMENT

INCREASED SLIGHTLY OVER THE COURSE OF 2003, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, BUT ARE STILL

BELOW THE LONG-TERM AVERAGE TREND.

2003 VERSUS 2002 SALES OF $5.5 BILLION INCREASED 9 PERCENT, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO 8

PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, WHICH BENEFITED FROM CURRENCY TRANSLATION

REFLECTING THE STRONGER EURO AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICES ON A LOCAL CURRENCY

BASIS. INCREASED OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN RENPAR SA, A SOUTH AMERICAN VENTURE,

INCREASED SALES 1 PERCENT. SALES VOLUMES WERE ESENTIALLY FLAT, AS HIGHER

WORLDWIDE SALES OF OEM AND REFINISH COATINGS WERE OFFSET BY LOWER TITANIUM

DIOXIDE VOLUMES, THE LATTER REFLECTING WEAK DEMAND IN NORTH AMERICA DURING MUCH

OF THE YEAR.

ATOI WAS $477 MILLION IN 2003 VERSUS $483 MILLION IN 2002. RESULTS IN 2003 WERE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER PRICES FOR RAW MATERIALS AND INCREASED FIXED COSTS,

PRINCIPALLY NON-CASH PENSION EXPENSE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE BENEFITS OF

HIGHER REVENUE AND MORE FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $5.0 BILLION WERE 2 PERCENT HIGHER DRIVEN BY INCREASED

SALES OF AUTOMOTIVE FINISHES. VOLUMES IMPROVED 5 PERCENT WHILE LOCAL SELLING

PRICES DECLINED 3 PERCENT. ATOI WAS $483 MILLION IN 2002 COMPARED WITH $452

MILLION IN 2001. THE IMPROVEMENT IN SEGMENT ATOI REFLECTS HIGHER EARNINGS IN

COATINGS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS IN TITANIUM DIOXIDE PRODUCTS, THE

LATTER RESULTING PRINCIPALLY FROM LOWER PRICES. 2002 ATOI INCLUDES A $42 MILLION

NET CHARGE FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS. 2001 INCLUDES A SIMILAR NET CHARGE

TOTALING $46 MILLION.

OUTLOOK THE GLOBAL COATINGS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A CHALLENGING

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN 2004 AS COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN

INTENSE. NORTH AMERICAN 2004 LIGHT VEHICLE BUILDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 2 PERCENT

ABOVE 2003 LEVELS, WHILE WESTERN EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO

BE 1 PERCENT HIGHER. CONTINUED GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN ASIA PACIFIC. INDUSTRY

DEMAND FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

REBOUND GLOBALLY DURING 2004.

IN IMPROVED PRICING MOMENTUM.

GIVEN THESE INDUSTRY OUTLOOKS, COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES EXPECTS IMPROVED

COATINGS RESULTS IN 2004 BASED ON GROWTH IN OEM AND REFINISH COATINGS AND

CONTINUED GROWTH IN ASIA PACIFIC. THE SEGMENT ALSO EXPECTS IMPROVED RESULTS FROM

ITS TITANIUM DIOXIDE OFFERINGS BASED ON GROWTH IN DEMAND AND IMPROVED PRICING.

ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF ADVANCED

MATERIALS FOR THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY; FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINTING AND COLOR PROOFING

SYSTEMS; AND A WIDE RANGE OF FLUOROPOLYMER AND FLUOROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS. THE

SEGMENT ALSO CONTINUES TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO DISPLAYS AND

FUEL CELLS.

IN THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, MARKETS SERVED INCLUDE DISPLAY MATERIALS,

INTEGRATED CIRCUIT FABRICATION MATERIALS AND PACKAGING SOLUTIONS, AND PRINTED

WIRE BOARD FABRICATION MATERIALS. THE SEGMENT MEETS THE RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKET

NEEDS FOR SMALLER, MORE PORTABLE AND POWERFUL ELECTRONIC DEVICES BY BUILDING ON

ITS STRENGTH AS A LEADING SUPPLIER OF ORGANIC, FLEXIBLE, AND CERAMIC CIRCUIT

MATERIALS. MAJOR PRODUCT LINES INCLUDE DUPONT(TM) KAPTON(R) POLYIMIDE FILM,

PYRALUX(R) FLEXIBLE LAMINATES, RISTON(R) DRY FILM PHOTORESISTS, GREEN TAPE(TM)

LOW TEMPERATURE CO-FIRED CERAMICS, FODEL(R) PHOTOIMAGEABLE COMPOSITES, AND

POSISTRIP(R) PHOTORESIST REMOVERS. IN 2003, THE SEGMENT ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION

TO EXPAND KAPTON(R) POLYIMIDE FILM PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO SERVE THE RAPIDLY

GROWING FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT INDUSTRY IN ASIA. THE NEW LINE WILL BE LOCATED IN JAPAN

AT THE TORAY-DUPONT COMPANY, A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE WITH TORAY INDUSTRIES.

COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN BY EARLY 2005.

ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IS THE MARKET LEADER IN FLEXOGRAPHY

PRINTING AND COLOR PROOFING SERVING THE PACKAGING AND COMMERCIAL PRINTING

INDUSTRIES. ITS OFFERINGS INCLUDE DUPONT(TM) CYREL(R) AND CYREL(R)FAST(TM)

FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATES, AS WELL AS COLOR PROOFING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING

DUPONT(TM) WATERPROOF(R), CROMALIN(R), AND DYLUX(R). CYREL(R) FAST(TM)

INSTALLATIONS DOUBLED TO OVER 200 IN 2003. CYREL(R) FAST(TM) IS THE ONLY

SOLVENT-FREE THERMAL FLEXOGRAPHIC PLATEMAKING TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE.

ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES' COLOR PROOFING BUSINESS HAS ALSO

DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF SITES TO ABOUT 200 THAT USE ITS THERMAL 4 COLOR HALFTONE

TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN 2001. DUPONT IS ONE OF FOUR COMPANIES

OFFERING THERMAL PROOFING TECHNOLOGY, ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING TECHNOLOGIES IN

THE MARKET.

IN ADDITION, THE SEGMENT IS THE LARGEST GLOBAL MANUFACTURER OF INDUSTRIAL AND

SPECIALTY FLUOROCHEMICALS AND FLUOROPOLYMERS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO THE

REFRIGERATION, INSULATION, AEROSOL PACKAGING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AEROSPACE,

AUTOMOTIVE, ELECTRONICS, CHEMICAL PROCESSING, AND HOUSEWARES INDUSTRIES. THE

COMPANY'S OFFERINGS INCLUDES DUPONT(TM) SUVA(R) REFRIGERANTS, TEFLON(R) AND

TEFZEL(R) FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS, AUTOGRAPH(R) AND TEFLON(R) NON-STICK FINISHES,

AND TEFLON(R) AND TEDLAR(R) FLUOROPOLYMER FILMS.

AFTER A RELATIVELY SLOW START IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2003, THE PRIMARY MARKETS

SERVED BY ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH,

INCLUDING DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IN BOTH SEMICONDUCTORS AND FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS.

SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE DISPLAYS

MARKET, AS WELL AS TARGETING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE

(PEM) FUEL CELLS. IN DISPLAYS, PROGRAMS RELATED TO PLASMA AND LIQUID CRYSTAL

DISPLAYS ARE PROGRESSING, WHILE THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ORGANIC LIGHT-EMITTING

DIODE (OLED) DISPLAYS HAS BEEN DELAYED DUE TO TECHNICAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH

DEVELOPMENT AND SCALE-UP TO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION. IN FUEL CELLS, MEMBRANE

ELECTRODE ASSEMBLIES AND OTHER SYSTEM COMPONENTS ARE BEING SOLD IN SMALL, BUT

INCREASING QUANTITIES TO DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS. APPLICATIONS TARGETED FOR PEM

FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE AUTOMOTIVE, PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION AND PORTABLE

POWER DEVICES. THE INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEM FUEL CELLS IS NOT

EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO EARNINGS NEAR TERM BUT PRESENTS A

LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITY.

2003 VERSUS 2002 SALES OF $2.9 BILLION WERE 14 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2002,

REFLECTING 10 PERCENT VOLUME GROWTH AS WELL AS AN INCREASE OF 4 PERCENT

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUISITION OF CHEMFIRST, INC.'S INTEGRATED CIRCUIT

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

NOVEMBER 2002. INCREASED VOLUMES REFLECT HIGHER SALES OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS

AND FLUOROPRODUCTS, INCLUDING REFRIGERANTS AND SPECIALTY GASES, PARTICULARLY IN

ASIA PACIFIC. INCREASED SALES VOLUMES ALSO REFLECT HIGHER WORLDWIDE SALES OF

FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINTING PRODUCTS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY

CONTINUING DECLINES IN THE SALES OF OLDER ANALOG PROOFING PRODUCTS.

ATOI WAS $147 MILLION IN 2003 VERSUS $217 MILLION IN 2002. THE DECLINE IN ATOI

PRINCIPALLY RESULTED FROM SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EXPENDITURES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT

OF OLEDS AND INCREASED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, REFLECTING,

IN PART, HIGHER NON-CASH PENSION COSTS. THE BENEFIT TO ATOI FROM HIGHER REVENUE

WAS REDUCED SOMEWHAT BY SLIGHTLY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND A SHIFT IN

FLUOROPRODUCTS SALES MIX TO LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $2.5 BILLION WERE 6 PERCENT LOWER, REFLECTING 8

PERCENT LOWER PRICES AND 2 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME. DEMAND FOR MANY OF THE KEY

PRODUCTS IN THIS SEGMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS

MARKETS, REMAINED VERY WEAK. ATOI WAS $217 MILLION IN 2002 COMPARED WITH $291

MILLION IN 2001. EARNINGS DECLINED IN ALL BUSINESS UNITS REFLECTING LOWER SALES.

OUTLOOK ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES EXPECTS CONTINUED STRENGTHENING

IN 2004 IN THE MAJORITY OF THE MARKETS SERVED, LED BY STRONG GROWTH IN DEMAND

FOR MATERIALS IN THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY. STRONG GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN

DEMAND FOR MATERIALS FOR SEMICONDUCTOR AND FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS, WHILE MODEST

GROWTH IS EXPECTED IN FLEXOGRAPHIC PRINTING AND THE MARKETS SERVED BY

FLUOROPRODUCTS. THE SEGMENT EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE IMPROVED EARNINGS DUE TO

INCREASED VOLUMES AND A FOCUS ON CONTROLLING FIXED COSTS.

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH MORE PRODUCTIVE, HIGHER

PERFORMANCE POLYMER MATERIALS, SYSTEMS AND SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE UNIQUENESS,

FUNCTIONALITY AND PROFITABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS. PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS DELIVERS A BROAD MATERIALS PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING ENGINEERING

POLYMERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY USED BY CUSTOMERS TO FABRICATE COMPONENTS FOR

MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS SPECIALIZED RESINS AND FILMS USED

IN VARIOUS PACKAGING AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THESE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE

FOOD PACKAGING, SEALANTS AND ADHESIVES, CARPET BACKING, AND INTERLAYERS FOR

LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS. KEY BRANDS INCLUDE DUPONT(TM) ZYTEL(R) NYLON RESINS,

SURLYN(R) PACKAGING RESINS, HYTREL(R) BLOW MOLDING RESINS, BUTACITE(R) LAMINATE

GLASS INTERLAYERS AND DELRIN(R) ACETAL RESINS.

THE KEY MARKETS SERVED BY THE SEGMENT INCLUDE, MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE AUTOMOTIVE

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (OEM) AND ASSOCIATED AFTER-MARKET INDUSTRIES,

AS WELL AS ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONICS, PACKAGING, CONSTRUCTION, AND CONSUMER DURABLE

GOODS.

THE SEGMENT'S CORE COMPETENCY IS APPLIED MATERIALS SCIENCE, FOCUSING ON

SUBSTITUTING TRADITIONAL MATERIALS WITH NEW MATERIALS THAT OFFER ADVANTAGES SUCH

AS PERFORMANCE AND WEIGHT. NEW APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSING MATERIALS INTO

INNOVATIVE PARTS AND SYSTEMS ARE ALSO AREAS OF FOCUS. RECENT EXAMPLES OF THIS

CORE INNOVATION CAPABILITY INCLUDE SENTRYGLAS(R) EXPRESSIONS(TM), WHICH LINKS

DUPONT(TM) POLYMER MATERIALS AND INK JET TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP SPECIALTY

DECORATIVE INTERLAYERS FOR ARCHITECTURAL APPLICATIONS, AND DUPONT(TM) HPF

POLYMER, WHICH ALLOWS GOLF BALL MANUFACTURERS TO DESIGN GOLF BALLS WITH IMPROVED

DISTANCE, CONTROL, AND FEEL.

IN 2003, THE SEGMENT ANNOUNCED THE RATIONALIZATION OF ITS ENGINEERING POLYMERS

COMPOUNDING FACILITIES, WHICH INCLUDES REALIGNMENT OF ITS OPERATIONS IN MEXICO,

EXPANSION OF ITS OPERATIONS IN CHINA, AND THE SHUTDOWN OF ITS PRODUCTION

FACILITY IN THE NETHERLANDS. THIS SHUTDOWN IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE

SPRING OF 2004.

2003 VERSUS 2002 SALES OF $5.4 BILLION WERE 9 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2002,

REFLECTING 7 PERCENT VOLUME GROWTH, LARGELY DERIVED FROM INCREASED SALES OF

ENGINEERING AND PACKAGING POLYMERS IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC. IN ADDITION,

SALES IMPROVED FROM 3 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, REFLECTING THE CURRENCY

BENEFIT OF THE WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER LOCAL CURRENCY SELLING

PRICES. THE GROWTH IN VOLUME AND INCREASE IN USD SELLING PRICES WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A 1 PERCENT DECREASE IN SALES FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CLYSAR(R)

SHRINK FILM BUSINESS IN 2002.

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

ATOI WAS $262 MILLION IN 2003 COMPARED WITH $479 MILLION IN 2002. THE DECREASE

IN ATOI IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OIL AND NATURAL GAS-RELATED RAW MATERIAL

COSTS AND RECORDING TRANSFERS OF NYLON INTERMEDIATES FROM TEXTILES & INTERIORS

AT MARKET PRICES RATHER THAN COST IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SEPARATION OF INVISTA.

ATOI IN 2002 BENEFITED FROM A $51 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE CLYSAR(R)

BUSINESS.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $4.9 BILLION WERE 4 PERCENT HIGHER, REFLECTING 8

PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME AND 4 PERCENT LOWER PRICES. ATOI WAS $479 MILLION COMPARED

WITH $234 MILLION. 2002 EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER SALES VOLUMES, A LOWER

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, AND LOWER ENERGY-BASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS. 2002 ALSO

INCLUDES A $51 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE CLYSAR(R) SHRINK FILM BUSINESS.

2001 INCLUDES A NET CHARGE OF $45 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS AND

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

OUTLOOK PERFORMANCE MATERIALS EXPECTS TO OPERATE IN AN IMPROVING BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT IN 2004. NORTH AMERICAN 2004 AUTOMOTIVE BUILDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

ABOUT 2 PERCENT ABOVE 2003 LEVELS, WHILE WESTERN EUROPEAN AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION

IS EXPECTED TO BE 1 PERCENT HIGHER, WITH CONTINUED GROWTH ALSO EXPECTED IN ASIA

PACIFIC. GLOBALLY, PACKAGING MARKET DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT CURRENT

LEVELS. THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG, AND IT

IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONICS MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS EXPECTS REVENUE GROWTH DUE TO THESE IMPROVING INDUSTRY

OUTLOOKS. HOWEVER, EARNINGS IMPROVEMENT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON OFFSETTING CONTINUED

HIGH PETROLEUM-RELATED RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCTIVITY

IMPROVEMENTS AND CUSTOMER-DRIVEN INNOVATIONS FOR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2001, DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS WAS SOLD TO THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB

COMPANY. DUPONT RETAINED ITS INTEREST IN COZAAR(R) (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM) AND

HYZAAR(R) (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE). THESE ANGIOTENSIN II

ANTAGONIST (AIIA) DRUGS WERE DISCOVERED BY DUPONT AND DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION

WITH MERCK & CO. AND ARE USED IN THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION. DUPONT HAS

EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED WORLDWIDE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) TO

MERCK. THE U.S. PATENTS COVERING THE COMPOUNDS, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION AND

USE FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION, INCLUDING APPROVAL FOR PEDIATRIC USE,

WILL EXPIRE IN 2010. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS,

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCTS FOR DUPONT UNTIL SEPTEMBER 30,

2003, AT THE FORMER DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS MANUFACTURING SITE AT GARDEN CITY,

NEW YORK. MANUFACTURING RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED TO

MERCK AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2003.

IN SEPTEMBER 2002, THE U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVED COZAAR(R) TO

REDUCE THE RATE OF PROGRESSION OF NEPHROPATHY (KIDNEY DISEASE) IN TYPE 2

DIABETIC PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND NEPHROPATHY (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS

THE RENAAL STUDY). THROUGH 2003, APPROVALS HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN 43 COUNTRIES,

WITH FURTHER APPROVALS PENDING.

THE LOSARTAN INTERVENTION FOR ENDPOINT REDUCTION IN HYPERTENSION STUDY (LIFE)

RESULTS WERE REPORTED AND PUBLISHED IN MARCH 2002 AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE

AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY. THE STUDY FOUND THAT USE OF COZAAR(R)

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE COMBINED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH, HEART ATTACK

AND STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY (LVH)

COMPARED TO THE BETA-BLOCKER ATENOLOL. IN MARCH 2003, THE U.S. FOOD & DRUG

ADMINISTRATION APPROVED COZAAR(R) AS THE FIRST AND ONLY HYPERTENSIVE MEDICINE TO

HELP PREVENT STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND LVH. IN TOTAL, 30

COUNTRIES HAVE GRANTED NEW REGULATORY LICENSES TO COZAAR(R) BASED ON THE LIFE

STUDY.

DURING 2003, TWO SEPARATE SETS OF HYPERTENSIVE GUIDELINES (THE EUROPEAN SOCIETY

OF HYPERTENSION - EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF CARDIOLOGY GUIDELINES, AND THE SEVENTH

REPORT OF THE JOINT NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON PREVENTION, DETECTION & TREATMENT OF

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE) WERE ISSUED IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. BOTH SUPPORT

THE USE OF AIIAS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF PATIENTS, BASED IN PART

ON THE LANDMARK LIFE AND RENAAL STUDIES WITH COZAAR(R).

2003 VERSUS 2002 WORLDWIDE MARKETING AND SALES OF COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) ARE

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MERCK. THE PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT RECEIVES ROYALTIES AND

NET PROCEEDS AS OUTLINED BY THE LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE 2003 ATOI WAS $355

BENEFITS RESULTING FROM ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE SALE OF DUPONT

PHARMACEUTICALS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

2002 VERSUS 2001 THE 2002 ATOI WAS $329 MILLION, INCLUDING $39 MILLION OF

BENEFITS RESULTING FROM ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE 2001 SALE OF DUPONT

PHARMACEUTICALS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SALE AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR FINALIZATION OF NET WORKING CAPITAL, TRANSFER OF

PENSION ASSETS, AND THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES, THE RESOLUTION OF WHICH

RESULTED IN THE ADDITIONAL AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $39 MILLION. THE 2001 ATOI WAS

$3,924 MILLION, INCLUDING A $3,866 MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE OF

DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS ON OCTOBER 1, 2001.

OUTLOOK MERCK HAS IDENTIFIED COZAAR(R)/HYZAAR(R) AS ONE OF THEIR FIVE KEY GROWTH

DRIVERS. THESE AIIA DRUGS ARE THE FIRST OF A NEW CLASS OF EFFECTIVE AND

WELL-TOLERATED BLOOD PRESSURE LOWERING MEDICATIONS, AND ARE TWO OF THE LEADING

TREATMENTS WORLDWIDE FOR HYPERTENSION.

DUPONT AND MERCK CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) WITH

ADDITIONAL CLINICAL STUDIES DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS

FOR PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND CO-MORBID CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE

ONGOING COZAAR(R)/HYZAAR(R) COLLABORATION TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS FOR

THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

SAFETY & PROTECTION BUILDS ON DUPONT'S 200-YEAR RECORD OF BEING ONE OF THE

SAFEST INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AND EXTENDS THE COMPANY'S KNOWLEDGE AND

TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER WORLDWIDE SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT PEOPLE, PROPERTY,

OPERATIONS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SAFETY & PROTECTION APPLIES A WIDE RANGE OF

TECHNOLOGIES, BRANDS AND KNOW-HOW TO EXPAND ITS PRESENCE ACROSS A SPECTRUM OF

INDUSTRIAL, SERVICE AND RESIDENTIAL MARKETS. HIGHLY RECOGNIZED BRANDS ARE

INCLUDED IN ITS PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING DUPONT(TM)

KEVLAR(R) ARAMID PRODUCTS; TYVEK(R) NONWOVEN SHEET STRUCTURES; OXONE(R)

DISINFECTANT; CORIAN(R) SOLID SURFACE MATERIALS; AND SAFETY CONSULTING SERVICES,

SUCH AS SAFERETURNS(TM).

THE SEGMENT SERVES A LARGE NUMBER OF MARKETS THAT RANGE FROM CONSTRUCTION,

INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL, AND AUTOMOTIVE TO U.S. DEFENSE, HOMELAND SECURITY AND

SAFETY CONSULTING. DEMAND INCREASED FROM NORTH AMERICAN HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION

MARKETS, WHILE AUTOMOTIVE AND AIRCRAFT DEMAND WAS FLAT, REFLECTING LOWER

PRODUCTION LEVELS. COMBINED EFFECTS OF WAR, TERRORISM AND DISEASE CONTROL

CONCERNS LED TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ORDERS FOR MILITARY, LAW ENFORCEMENT,

FIRE FIGHTING AND HEALTH CARE PROTECTIVE APPAREL. INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL MARKETS

VARIED BY REGION, BUT WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT WORLDWIDE.

THE SEGMENT DELIVERS INNOVATIVE BUILDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE GLOBAL

CONSTRUCTION MARKET THROUGH OFFERINGS THAT CAPITALIZE ON THE COMPANY'S

COMPETENCY IN ROOFING AND WALL WEATHERIZATION SYSTEMS, SECURITY WINDOWS, AND

STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. IN 2003, SALES OF GLOBAL TYVEK(R) WEATHERIZATION PRODUCTS

EXPERIENCED DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH. THE NORTH AMERICAN BUSINESS GREW TWO TIMES THE

OVERALL MARKET GROWTH RATE DUE TO THE SEGMENT'S INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION AND

THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCTS. SALES IN EUROPE GREW AT A DOUBLE DIGIT RATE IN A

DOWN MARKET, DRIVEN BY EXPANSION IN THE SCOPE OF THE SEGMENT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY

ATTRACTIVE SEALED ROOFING SYSTEMS.

THE SEGMENT OFFERS A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS RELATED TO PERSONAL PROTECTION,

PRIMARILY GARMENTS AND OTHER APPAREL FOR PROTECTION AGAINST CHEMICAL,

PARTICULATE, BIOLOGICAL, THERMAL AND CUT HAZARDS. GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION,

INCREASED MARKET PENETRATION, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVERSIFICATION OF THESE PRODUCTS

RESULTED IN SALES GROWTH OF ABOUT 11 PERCENT IN 2003.

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR PREVENTION OF DISEASE AND IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY IN THE FOOD,

HEALTH CARE, HOUSEHOLD, INSTITUTIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS CONTINUES TO CREATE

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH RELATED TO THE SEGMENT'S CLEAN AND DISINFECT OFFERINGS.

ACQUISITION OF UK-BASED ANTEC INTERNATIONAL, A GLOBAL LEADER IN BIOSECURITY,

PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF SAFE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE MARKET-LEADING DISINFECT AND

CLEANSING AGENTS.

OF A NEW U.S. BASED KEVLAR(R) BRAND FIBER PLANT FOCUSED ON MILITARY BALLISTIC

AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.

2003 VERSUS 2002 SALES OF $4.1 BILLION WERE 17 PERCENT HIGHER, WITH 6 PERCENT

DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES, 6 PERCENT DUE TO HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND 5 PERCENT

DUE TO ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY THE NOVEMBER 2002 PURCHASE OF CHEMFIRST, INC.,

WHOSE CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATE UNITS WERE INTEGRATED INTO THIS SEGMENT. VOLUME

GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GREATER WORLDWIDE SALES OF KEVLAR(R) AND NOMEX(R)

ARAMIDS, REFLECTING INCREASED DEMAND FOR MILITARY, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

PROTECTIVE APPAREL PRODUCTS. HIGHER VOLUME IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED

SALES OF TYVEK(R) NONWOVENS AND CORIAN(R) SOLID SURFACES, REFLECTING STRENGTH IN

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT MARKETS. HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES

REFLECT BOTH HIGHER LOCAL CURRENCY PRICES AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT OF THE WEAKER

DOLLAR.

ATOI IN 2003 WAS $536 MILLION COMPARED TO $490 MILLION IN 2002, REFLECTING THE

BENEFIT OF HIGHER VOLUMES AND SELLING PRICES, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW

MATERIAL AND FIXED COSTS, PRIMARILY NON-CASH PENSION EXPENSE.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $3.5 BILLION WERE 3 PERCENT LOWER, REFLECTING 3

PERCENT LOWER VOLUME. ATOI WAS $490 MILLION COMPARED WITH $451 MILLION. 2001

INCLUDED $34 MILLION IN CHARGES FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS AND FACILITY

SHUTDOWNS. 2002 EARNINGS REFLECT IMPROVED RESULTS IN NONWOVEN PRODUCTS, SOLID

SURFACE MATERIALS, AND SAFETY CONSULTING, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET DECLINES IN

INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS AND ARAMID PRODUCTS.

OUTLOOK OVERALL, SAFETY & PROTECTION EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH IN REVENUE AND

EARNINGS IN 2004. THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG, AND

THE SEGMENT ANTICIPATES SOLID GROWTH RELATED TO BUILDING PRODUCTS DUE TO

CONTINUED FOCUS ON INCREASING MARKET PENETRATION. SALES OF PROTECTIVE SURFACES

PRODUCTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF

PRODUCTS, CHANNELS AND MARKETS.

CONTINUED STRONG SPENDING IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE MARKETS THROUGH U.S. FEDERAL

HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING, AS WELL AS RECOVERY IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN

THE U.S. AND EUROPE, IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN PERSONAL

PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS. U.S. AND GLOBAL MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DEMAND FOR

BALLISTIC PROTECTION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG AT LEAST THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF

2004 AND POTENTIALLY FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN INDUSTRIAL

PRODUCTION IS ALSO EXPECTED TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN ELECTRICAL INSULATION

(TRANSFORMERS AND MOTORS), FILTRATION, OIL AND GAS PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE

INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS PRODUCT LINES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THIS

GENERAL IMPROVEMENT, MARGINS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE PRESSURED BY ENERGY

RELATED COSTS, POCKETS OF OVERCAPACITY AND INCREASED COMPETITION FROM ASIA

PACIFIC.

ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003, THE COMPANY AND KOCH INDUSTRIES, INC. (KOCH) ANNOUNCED

THAT THEY HAD REACHED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF INVISTA, WHICH

REPRESENTS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE NET ASSETS RELATED TO THE TEXTILES &

INTERIORS SEGMENT, TO SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH FOR APPROXIMATELY $4.4 BILLION,

INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION OF DEBT. THE TRANSACTION

IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2004.

TEXTILES & INTERIORS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING GLOBAL BRANDS AND TRADEMARKS.

LYCRA(R), STAINMASTER(R), ANTRON(R), COOLMAX(R), THERMOLITE(R), CORDURA(R),

SUPPLEX(R), AND TACTEL(R), AND IN THE SPECIALTY CHEMICALS BUSINESS, CORFREE(R),

DYTEK(R), ADI-PURE(R), TERATHANE(R) AND DBE(R).

2003 VERSUS 2002 SALES OF $6.9 BILLION WERE 12 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2002. THIS

INCLUDES AN 8 PERCENT INCREASE DUE TO INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF NYLON INTERMEDIATES

TO THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT AT MARKET PRICES VERSUS COST BEGINNING IN

2003 IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SEPARATION. SALES INCREASED 4 PERCENT DUE TO A

BENEFIT FROM THE WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER VOLUMES, PARTLY OFFSET

BY LOWER LOCAL SELLING PRICES.

ATOI WAS A LOSS OF $1,336 MILLION IN 2003 VERSUS EARNINGS OF $69 MILLION IN

2002. RESULTS IN 2003 INCLUDE A NET CHARGE OF $1,365 MILLION, PRIMARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLANNED SEPARATION OF INVISTA. THIS CHARGE REFLECTS THE

WRITE-DOWN OF VARIOUS MANUFACTURING ASSETS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, AND INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES, TOGETHER WITH A PENSION

PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF INVISTA ASSETS; THIS

DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT IS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT ATOI. (ADDITIONAL DETAILS ARE

CONTAINED IN NOTES 5, 6, 9 AND 31 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

RESULTS IN 2003 ALSO REFLECT HIGHER COSTS FOR RAW MATERIALS, PRINCIPALLY THOSE

DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM, WHICH REDUCED AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY OVER $400 MILLION.

THESE RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES, COMBINED WITH HIGHER NON-CASH PENSION

EXPENSE, MORE THAN OFFSET THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF HIGHER SALES, LOWER

DEPRECIATION, AND OTHER COST REDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES.

ATOI IN 2002 INCLUDED A NET CHARGE OF $144 MILLION RELATED TO EMPLOYEE

TERMINATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $6.2 BILLION WERE 3 PERCENT LOWER REFLECTING 5 PERCENT

HIGHER VOLUME, MORE THAN OFFSET BY 6 PERCENT LOWER PRICES AND A 2 PERCENT

DECLINE DUE TO DIVESTITURES. INTERMEDIATE AND APPAREL PRODUCTS BOTH EXPERIENCED

LOWER SALES. SALES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT FOR SEGMENT PRODUCTS SOLD INTO THE

CARPET, INTERIORS AND INDUSTRIAL FIBER MARKETS AS HIGHER VOLUMES OFFSET LOWER

PRICES. ATOI IN 2002 WAS $69 MILLION AND INCLUDED A NET CHARGE OF $144 MILLION

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. IN 2001, ATOI WAS A

LOSS OF $342 MILLION AND INCLUDED A NET CHARGE OF $410 MILLION RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. WHILE SEGMENT SALES DECLINED

IN 2002, EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM REDUCED FIXED COSTS REFLECTING RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAMS IN BOTH YEARS, LOWER ENERGY-BASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS, AND A LOWER

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

INITIATIVES. RESULTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED BENLATE(R) FUNGICIDE

BUSINESS ARE ALSO INCLUDED (SEE BENLATE(R) DISCUSSION IN NOTE 24 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). IN THE AGGREGATE, SALES FROM THESE

BUSINESSES REPRESENT LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF TOTAL SEGMENT SALES.

2003 VERSUS 2002 SALES OF $19 MILLION WERE DOWN 14 PERCENT. ATOI WAS A LOSS OF

$150 MILLION IN 2003 AND INCLUDED $50 MILLION IN CHARGES RELATED TO BENLATE(R)

LITIGATION. ATOI WAS A LOSS OF $164 MILLION IN 2002 AND INCLUDED CHARGES OF $50

MILLION TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S RESERVE FOR BENLATE(R) LITIGATION AND $31

MILLION TO ESTABLISH A RESERVE RELATED TO VITAMINS LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH A

PREVIOUSLY DIVESTED JOINT VENTURE.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $22 MILLION WERE DOWN 85 PERCENT, PRINCIPALLY

REFLECTING THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BENLATE(R) FUNGICIDE BUSINESS IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER 2001. ATOI WAS A LOSS OF $164 MILLION AND INCLUDES CHARGES OF $50

MILLION TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S RESERVE FOR BENLATE(R) LITIGATION AND $31

MILLION TO ESTABLISH A RESERVE RELATED TO VITAMINS LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH A

PREVIOUSLY DIVESTED JOINT VENTURE. A 2001 ATOI LOSS OF $95 MILLION INCLUDED A

NET CHARGE OF $37 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS.

LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO

BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS OF AA- AND AA3 FROM

STANDARD & POOR'S (S&P;) AND MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, AND ITS

COMMERCIAL PAPER RATING OF A-I+ BY S&P; AND PRIME 1 BY MOODY'S ARE EVIDENCE OF

THAT STRENGTH. THIS ADVANTAGE IS BASED ON STRONG BUSINESS OPERATING CASH FLOWS

OVER AN ECONOMIC CYCLE, AND A COMMITMENT TO CASH DISCIPLINE REGARDING WORKING

CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY

THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT

SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH FROM OPERATIONS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES,

BILATERAL CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS, AND ASSET SALES.

THE COMPANY'S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $2.6 BILLION IN 2003, A $150

MILLION INCREASE FROM THE $2.4 BILLION GENERATED IN 2002. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

INCREASE IS A RESULT OF LOWER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL

COSTS, TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM AND FUNDING

OF THE DUPONT CANADA INC. PENSION FUND IN PREPARATION FOR THE SEPARATION OF

INVISTA. IN 2002, THE COMPANY'S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $15 MILLION LESS

THAN THE $2.5 BILLION GENERATED IN 2001, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED TAX

PAYMENTS, RELATED TO THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS, AND REDUCED

REVENUE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING COSTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES TOTALED $3.4 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003 (INCLUDING $75 MILLION OF CASH CLASSIFIED AS ASSETS HELD FOR

SALE AT DECEMBER 31, 2003), REFLECTING A $770 MILLION DECREASE FROM DECEMBER 31,

2002. THE REDUCTION IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE $1.1 BILLION OF CASH USED

TO PURCHASE THE SHARES IN DUPONT CANADA INC. FROM THE MINORITY OWNERS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S PLANS TO SEPARATE INVISTA.

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET IS A SOURCE OF "SAME DAY" CASH FOR THE COMPANY. THE

COMPANY CAN ACCESS THIS MARKET AT PREFERRED RATES GIVEN ITS STRONG CREDIT

RATING. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BEFORE TAXES ON COMMERCIAL PAPER

BORROWINGS FOR 2003, 2002 AND 2001, WERE 1.1, 1.7 AND 4.1 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, DUPONT'S COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE WAS $4.4 BILLION, A $3.7

BILLION INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE PRIMARILY

RELATES TO THE REDEMPTION OF THE CORPORATE MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURES FOR $2.0

BILLION, THE TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND SYNTHETIC

LEASE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FINANCED BY THE COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT FOR $589

MILLION, AND THE BUYOUT OF CERTAIN SYNTHETIC LEASES (NOT COVERED UNDER THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT) FOR $210 MILLION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE

TERMINATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IS DISCUSSED BEGINNING ON PAGE 35.

IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY NEEDS, THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY $4.1 BILLION IN "SAME

DAY" CREDIT LINES WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE CREDIT LINES

ARE SPLIT ABOUT EQUALLY BETWEEN 364-DAY AND MULTI-YEAR FACILITIES.

DUPONT ALSO HAS ACCESS TO EQUITY MARKETS AND TO LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RELATIVELY LOW LONG-TERM BORROWING LEVEL, STRONG FINANCIAL

POSITION AND CREDIT RATINGS PROVIDE ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS.

THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ASSET SALES IN 2003. IN 2002, PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF

ASSETS WERE $196 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING $143 MILLION RECEIVED FROM THE

SALE OF THE CLYSAR(R) SHRINK FILM BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE $122 MILLION

OF SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS TO BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB RELATING TO THE 2001 SALE OF

DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS. PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS IN 2001 TOTALED $8.1

BILLION, OF WHICH $7.8 BILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S SALES OF ASSETS ARE PROVIDED IN NOTE

27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM THE PENDING SALE OF INVISTA TO

STRENGTHEN ITS BALANCE SHEET BY REDUCING DEBT. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO CONSIDER

PENSION FUND CONTRIBUTIONS AND AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SHARE REPURCHASES.

USES OF CASH

PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES WERE

$1.8 BILLION IN 2003, COMPARED WITH $1.4 BILLION IN 2002, AND $1.6 BILLION IN

2001. EXPENDITURES FOR 2003 INCLUDE $334 MILLION OF ASSETS PURCHASED UNDER THE

COMPANY'S SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT, RAIL CARS, AND

MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING FACILITIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PURCHASES OF

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN 2004 TO BE ABOUT $1.4 BILLION, WHICH REFLECTS

THE EXPECTED ABSENCE OF INVISTA IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2003 TOTALED $1.5 BILLION, PRIMARILY

CONSISTING OF TWO ACQUISITIONS. IN JUNE AND JULY 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

66,704,465 SHARES IN DUPONT CANADA INC. FROM THE MINORITY OWNERS FOR $1.1

BILLION. IN MAY 2003, THE SOLAE COMPANY, A MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE

COMPANY, ACQUIRED 82 PERCENT OF BUNGE LIMITED'S BRAZILIAN INGREDIENTS OPERATION

FOR $256 MILLION WITH THE ADDITIONAL 18 PERCENT ACQUIRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2003 FOR $44 MILLION. PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2002 AMOUNTED TO

$697 MILLION WHICH INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES

OF LIQUI-BOX CORPORATION FOR $272 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, AND THE

ACQUISITION OF CHEMFIRST, INC. FOR $357 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THERE

WERE NO SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2001. ADDITIONAL DETAILS

RELATED TO THE ACQUISITIONS ARE PROVIDED IN NOTE 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE SETTLEMENTS OF FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ISSUED TO HEDGE THE COMPANY'S NET

EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN

CASH PAYMENTS OF $631 MILLION IN 2003, AND $264 MILLION IN 2002, COMPARED TO

CASH RECEIPTS OF $93 MILLION IN 2001. THE PAYMENTS IN 2003 AND 2002 WERE

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WEAKER DOLLAR VERSUS THE EURO AND LARGER NET

MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY REVALUATIONS

OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED, WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN THE APPROPRIATE CATEGORIES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

THE COMPANY HAS PAID A QUARTERLY COMMON DIVIDEND SINCE ITS FIRST DIVIDEND IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1904. DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK WERE $1.40 IN 2003,

2002 AND 2001.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A PROGRAM TO PURCHASE AND

RETIRE UP TO 20 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK TO OFFSET DILUTION FROM

SHARES ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN JULY 2000, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF

DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON

STOCK REMAINING TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE 1998 PROGRAM FROM ABOUT 16 MILLION

SHARES TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES THAT COULD BE PURCHASED FOR $2.5 BILLION.

THESE PURCHASES WERE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE NEEDED TO OFFSET DILUTION FROM SHARES

ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE 1998

PROGRAM BY PURCHASING 10.8 MILLION SHARES FOR $470 MILLION. IN ADDITION, 43

MILLION SHARES WERE PURCHASED FOR $1.8 BILLION IN 2001.

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $2 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN IN

JUNE 2001. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, NO SHARES WERE PURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM

AND MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A TIMELINE FOR THE BUYBACK OF STOCK UNDER

THIS PLAN.

NET DEBT INCREASED $4.4 BILLION IN 2003 AS A RESULT OF THE REDEMPTION OF THE

CORPORATE MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURES, ACQUISITION OF THE MINORITY SHARES HELD

IN DUPONT CANADA INC., TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND

SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FINANCED BY THE COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT AND

BUYOUT OF CERTAIN SYNTHETIC LEASES (NOT COVERED UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

CONDUIT). IN ADDITION, NET DEBT INCREASED $147 MILLION, REFLECTING DEBT BALANCES

ASSUMED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF ACQUIRING THE REMAINING INTEREST IN

GRIFFIN LLC. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE TERMINATION OF THE CORPORATE

MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURE AND THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SYNTHETIC LEASE

PROGRAMS IS DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS BELOW.

THE INCREASE IN NET DEBT WAS FINANCED WITH COMMERCIAL PAPER, WHICH BECAME A MORE

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL DEBT POSITION. THE IMPACT OF THE

CHANGE IN THE DEBT PORTFOLIO MIX REDUCED THE YEAR-END AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FROM

5.0 PERCENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, TO 3.0 PERCENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. INTEREST

34

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

EXPENSE WAS FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST

RATES OFFSET BY HIGHER DEBT LEVELS. SEE NOTES 19 AND 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR YEAR-END DEBT BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES NET DEBT PROVIDES THE INVESTOR WITH A MORE REALISTIC VIEW

OF THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY AND ACTUAL DEBT POSITION BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY DOWN

DEBT. NET DEBT ALSO ALLOWS THE INVESTOR TO COMPARE DEBT IN DIFFERENT PERIODS

WITHOUT ADJUSTING FOR CASH AND THE CHANGES IN CASH POSITION.

MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURES

IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $2 BILLION FROM ENTERING INTO TWO

MINORITY INTEREST TRANSACTIONS. COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

TRANSACTIONS TOTALED $42 MILLION AND WERE BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD TO MINORITY INTEREST IN EARNINGS OF CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT. THE PROCEEDS WERE USED TO

REDUCE DEBT AND WERE REPORTED AS MINORITY INTERESTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY REDEEMED THESE STRUCTURES FOR $2 BILLION, AND RECORDED A

CHARGE OF $28 MILLION PRIMARILY TO WRITE OFF THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSACTIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITY

IN 2002, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT PROGRAM TO REDUCE

THE FINANCING COSTS OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND

SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS BY GAINING DIRECT ACCESS TO THE ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL

PAPER MARKET. THE CONDUIT ISSUED NOTES TO THIRD PARTIES SECURED BY THE

RECEIVABLE INTERESTS AND THE EQUIPMENT AND REAL ESTATE UNDER SYNTHETIC LEASES.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND

SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FINANCED BY THE COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT.

THIS REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PURCHASE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE TRADE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BEING HELD UNDER THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION

PROGRAM FOR $445 MILLION AND ASSETS UNDER SYNTHETIC LEASES FOR $144 MILLION.

THE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WERE COLLECTED IN 2003.

OTHER SYNTHETIC LEASES

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE ASSETS UNDER ITS SYNTHETIC LEASES RELATED

TO MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING FACILITIES UNDER CONSTRUCTION (WHICH WERE NOT

COVERED UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT) FOR $210 MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAS ONE REMAINING SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAM

RELATING TO MISCELLANEOUS SHORT-LIVED EQUIPMENT VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $115

MILLION. LEASE PAYMENTS FOR THESE ASSETS TOTALED $43 MILLION IN 2003, $28

MILLION IN 2002, AND $12 MILLION IN 2001, AND WERE REPORTED AS OPERATING

EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT. THE LEASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM ARE

CONSIDERED OPERATING LEASES AND ACCORDINGLY THE RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. FURTHERMORE, THE

LEASE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM VARY BASED ON THIRTY-DAY LIBOR. THE

COMPANY MAY TERMINATE THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME BY PURCHASING THE ASSETS. SHOULD

THE COMPANY DECIDE NEITHER TO RENEW THE LEASES NOR TO EXERCISE ITS PURCHASE

OPTION, IT MUST PAY THE OWNER A RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE AMOUNT, WHICH MAY BE

RECOVERED FROM A SALE OF THE PROPERTY TO A THIRD PARTY. RESIDUAL VALUE

GUARANTEES TOTALED $100 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

CERTAIN GUARANTEE CONTRACTS

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND THE FORMATION OF JOINT

VENTURES, THE COMPANY HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN

LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST

EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF

THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY SUCH AS ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RELATING TO

LITIGATION MATTERS. THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN

TO ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX, AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY INDEFINITE. IF THE

INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS A

RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT

OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNT

RECORDED FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, IS $31 MILLION.

ALTHOUGH IT IS

35

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO THE

NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF

THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL

AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST.

AS PART OF THE PENDING SALE OF INVISTA, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE CERTAIN

INDEMNIFICATIONS. SEE FURTHER DISCUSSION ON PAGE 18 UNDER SEPARATION

CHARGES--TEXTILE & INTERIORS.

OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS

WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHER

UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD DIRECTLY

GUARANTEED $885 MILLION OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS, EXCLUDING GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN

OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF CONOCO, INC. AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THIS REPRESENTS

THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE COMPANY

COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. NO MATERIAL LOSS IS ANTICIPATED

BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE

LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR CUSTOMERS AROSE AS PART OF CONTRACTUAL SALES AGREEMENTS.

EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES AROSE FOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN NORMAL

OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE

EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY HAS

RECOURSE TO ASSETS HELD AS COLLATERAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL GUARANTEES FROM

CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF

CONOCO, INC., ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, WHICH TOTALED $235 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003. CONOCO HAS INDEMNIFIED THE COMPANY FOR ANY LIABILITIES THE

COMPANY MAY INCUR PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES. THE RESTRUCTURING, TRANSFER AND

SEPARATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN DUPONT AND CONOCO REQUIRES CONOCO TO USE ITS BEST

EFFORTS TO HAVE CONOCO, OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SUBSTITUTE FOR DUPONT. NO

MATERIAL LOSS IS ANTICIPATED BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAS NO LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE

OBLIGATIONS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY'S GUARANTEES IS INCLUDED IN

NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HAD TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS TO SATISFY

GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS THE FINANCIAL

RESOURCES TO SATISFY THESE GUARANTEES SHOULD UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGH ITS NORMAL

SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND BELIEVES IT HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SATISFY

THESE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SHOULD UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A

LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE

TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AND MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. ABOUT 78 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S

WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS, AND ABOUT 99 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S

WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFITS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BENEFIT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO

CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE PENSION AND MEDICAL, DENTAL

AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS. BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE

BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. IN THE

U.S., PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY

WITH U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS

THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

AND PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS' ACTUARIES TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT

OF BENEFITS. NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN TRUST FUND IN 2004. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS PERMITTED TO MAKE

A TAX DEDUCTIBLE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN

TRUST FUND IN 2004, NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE TO MAKE SUCH A

37

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

CONTRIBUTION. CONTRIBUTIONS BEYOND 2004 ARE NOT DETERMINABLE SINCE THE AMOUNT OF

ANY CONTRIBUTION IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND

INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS. PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED FEDERAL

LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID

TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PENSION COVERAGE FOR

EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO

THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE SOVEREIGN COUNTRY

IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION

BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, REDUCED ASSET

VALUATIONS TEND TO RESULT IN HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION PLANS. IN 2003, THE

COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $460 MILLION TO PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S.

PENSION PLAN DISCUSSED ABOVE. THIS INCLUDES FUNDING OF THE DUPONT CANADA INC.

PENSION FUND IN PREPARATION FOR THE PENDING SEPARATION OF INVISTA. THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2004 TO THESE PLANS.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE AN ADJUSTMENT TO STOCKHOLDERS'

EQUITY WHENEVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF YEAR-END PENSION ASSETS IS LESS THAN

THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, EACH OF THE COMPANY'S

PENSION PLANS MUST BE TESTED INDIVIDUALLY. AT YEAR-END 2002, A NON-CASH

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $2.5 BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY WAS RECORDED IN

RESPONSE TO LOWER ASSET VALUATIONS AND SOMEWHAT HIGHER BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF

THAT DATE. MOST OF THIS ADJUSTMENT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION

PLAN. IN 2003, $858 MILLION OF THIS CHARGE WAS REVERSED, REFLECTING RECOVERING

ASSET VALUES.

MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE

APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRETAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO

COVER ACTUAL NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $410

MILLION, $400 MILLION, AND $423 MILLION, FOR 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $420 MILLION IN 2004. CHANGES IN CASH

REQUIREMENTS DURING THIS PERIOD REFLECT HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS,

DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES, AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS AND

DEDUCTIBLES.

THE COMPANY'S INCOME IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PENSION BENEFITS AS WELL AS

RETIREE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

SUMMARIZES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMPANY'S INCOME OVER EACH OF THE LAST THREE

YEARS WAS AFFECTED BY PRETAX CREDITS AND CHARGES RELATED TO LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS.

NET (BENEFIT) CHARGE               $844    $ 178    $ (27)

================================================================================

THESE EXPENSES ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR. THE INCREASE IN

PENSION COST IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VALUES FOR PENSION PLAN ASSETS RESULTING

FROM THE DECLINE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS MEASURED IN PRECEDING YEARS. THE DECREASE

IN OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BENEFICIAL

EFFECTS OF THE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BENEFIT LIMITS ON THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF THE

COST COVERAGE PLAN AMENDMENTS ADOPTED IN 2002, PARTLY OFFSET BY RAPIDLY

INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS.

IN JANUARY 2004, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS U.S. MEDICAL PLAN TO BE SECONDARY TO

MEDICARE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGINNING IN 2006 FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES

AND SURVIVORS. THE IMPACT OF THIS AMENDMENT IS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT 2004 PRETAX

EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION AND REDUCE THE COMPANY'S OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATION BY ABOUT $525 MILLION.

THE COMPANY'S KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION

INCREASES, AND THE DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN THE U.S.

CALCULATIONS WAS DETERMINED TO BE 6.25 PERCENT IN 2003, BASED ON HIGH QUALITY

CORPORATE BOND RATES. IN 2003, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

CLAIMS LOWER THAN THE ANTICIPATED CLAIMS. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, AND THE

AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN IN JANUARY 2004, IT IS

EXPECTED THAT THE COMPANY'S 2004 PRETAX EARNINGS WILL BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY

APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION TO $150 MILLION.

IN ANTICIPATION OF A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES RELATED TO

THE PENDING INVISTA SALE, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX CURTAILMENT LOSS OF $78

MILLION IN 2003. UPON COMPLETING THE SALE OF INVISTA, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES

THAT THERE MAY BE A REMEASUREMENT OF PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL CHARGES OR CREDITS. SUCH AMOUNTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY

DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. THE

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

COMPANY DOES NOT PLAN TO TRANSFER PENSION BENEFITS ASSETS/LIABILITIES AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS LIABILITIES IN THE U.S., BUT HAS ARRANGED TO TRANSFER

THE ASSETS/LIABILITIES IN THE NON-U.S. PLANS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND ASSETS WILL NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF THE

PENDING SALE.

THE COMPANY HAS ANNOUNCED POSSIBLE REDUCTIONS IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN 2004

RELATED TO COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. THIS MAY RESULT IN A REMEASUREMENT OF

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL CHARGES OR

CREDITS. SUCH AMOUNTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, PRODUCT HANDLING AND

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR

EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, DUPONT IMPLEMENTS

VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, ELIMINATE THE GENERATION OF

HAZARDOUS WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WASTE WATER DISCHARGES, INCREASE THE

EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF PERSISTENT,

BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC (PBT) MATERIALS. THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND

GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. EVEN THOUGH

THESE COSTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE OR FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

IN 2003, DUPONT SPENT ABOUT $64 MILLION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER

REQUIRED BY LAW OR NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL

PROJECTS WILL TOTAL $80 MILLION IN 2004 (EXCLUDING INVISTA). IN THE U.S.,

SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT

DECADE FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND HAZARDOUS

WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA). UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN

REGARDING FUTURE ESTIMATES FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL CAA CAPITAL COSTS

OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO RANGE FROM $10 MILLION TO $20

MILLION.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) CHALLENGED THE U.S. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY

TO VOLUNTARILY CONDUCT SCREENING LEVEL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING

ON NEARLY 3,000 HIGH PRODUCTION VOLUME (HPV) CHEMICALS OR TO MAKE EQUIVALENT

INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AN HPV CHEMICAL IS A CHEMICAL LISTED ON THE 1990

INVENTORY UPDATE RULE WITH ANNUAL U.S. CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS OF ONE

MILLION POUNDS OR MORE. THE COST TO DUPONT OF TESTING FOR HPV CHEMICALS IT MAKES

IS ESTIMATED TO BE A TOTAL OF $8 MILLION TO $10 MILLION FROM 2001-2005; FOR THE

ENTIRE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY, THE COST OF TESTING IS ESTIMATED TO BE $500 MILLION.

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE

CHANGE ADOPTED IN 1992. THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, ADOPTED IN DECEMBER 1997, IS AN

EFFORT TO ESTABLISH SHORT-TERM ACTIONS UNDER THE CONVENTION. THE

ENTRY-INTO-FORCE OF THE PROTOCOL IS IN QUESTION, WITH RATIFICATION BY THE

RUSSIAN FEDERATION NECESSARY. THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS EXPECTED TO DECIDE

WHETHER TO RATIFY THE PROTOCOL DURING 2004. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS

INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO PROCEED WITH ITS EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS EVEN

IF THE PROTOCOL DOES NOT ENTER INTO FORCE. THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO PURSUE

IN THE EU AND ELSEWHERE A LESS-RESTRICTIVE CLIMATE POLICY FRAMEWORK, EMPHASIZING

VOLUNTARY ACTION. THE KYOTO PROTOCOL WOULD ESTABLISH SIGNIFICANT EMISSION

REDUCTION TARGETS FOR SIX GASES CONSIDERED TO HAVE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND

WOULD DRIVE MANDATORY REDUCTIONS IN DEVELOPED NATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

DUPONT HAS A STAKE IN A NUMBER OF THESE GASES - CO2, N2O, HFCS AND PFCS - AND

HAS BEEN REDUCING ITS EMISSIONS OF THESE GASES SINCE 1991. THE COMPANY REMAINS

WELL AHEAD OF THE TARGET/TIMETABLE CONTEMPLATED BY THE PROTOCOL. HOWEVER, ON A

GLOBAL BASIS, THE COMPANY FACES THE POSSIBILITY OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS

WHERE MAJOR REDUCTIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACHIEVED. DUPONT IS WORKING TO ENABLE

SUCCESS OF EMISSIONS TRADING MECHANISMS IN THE EU AND ELSEWHERE THAT COULD AID

IN SATISFYING SUCH COUNTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ALTHOUGH

CONGRESSIONAL PROPOSALS FOR SUCH MANDATES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED.

DUPONT HAS DISCOVERED THAT VERY LOW LEVELS OF DIOXINS (PARTS PER TRILLION TO LOW

PARTS PER BILLION) AND RELATED COMPOUNDS ARE INADVERTENTLY GENERATED DURING ITS

TITANIUM DIOXIDE PIGMENT PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS LAUNCHED AN

EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND PROCESS ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY THE

CAUSE

39

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

OF THE DIOXIN GENERATION AND TO IDENTIFY PROCESS MODIFICATIONS THAT WILL

ELIMINATE DIOXIN FORMATION. THE PROGRAMS IMPLEMENTED TO DATE HAVE RESULTED IN

REDUCTIONS OF ALMOST 50 PERCENT, SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AGAINST DUPONT'S

AGGRESSIVE GOALS TO REDUCE SUCH DIOXIN GENERATION BY 90 PERCENT BY 2007. OVER 99

PERCENT OF THE DIOXIN GENERATED AT DUPONT'S PRODUCTION PLANTS BECOMES ASSOCIATED

WITH PROCESS SOLID WASTES THAT ARE DISPOSED IN CONTROLLED LANDFILLS WHERE PUBLIC

EXPOSURE IS NEGLIGIBLE.

PRETAX ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS TOTALED $482 MILLION

IN 2003 COMPARED WITH $480 MILLION IN 2002, AND $550 MILLION IN 2001. THESE

EXPENSES INCLUDE THE REMEDIATION ACCRUALS DISCUSSED BELOW: OPERATING,

MAINTENANCE AND DEPRECIATION COSTS FOR SOLID WASTE, AIR AND WATER POLLUTION

CONTROL FACILITIES; AND THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. WHILE

EXPENSES RELATED TO THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT A

SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THESE COSTS TO BECOME PROPORTIONALLY GREATER AS THE COMPANY

INCREASES ITS PARTICIPATION IN BUSINESSES FOR WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS

ARE REQUIRED DURING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE LARGEST OF THESE EXPENSES IN 2003

RESULTED FROM THE OPERATION OF WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES AND SOLID

WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES FOR ABOUT $134 MILLION AND $127 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. ABOUT 79 PERCENT OF TOTAL ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES RESULTED

FROM THE OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.

REMEDIATION ACCRUALS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED AN

ACCRUED LIABILITY OF $380 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $371 MILLION AT YEAR-END

2002. CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE

UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. OF THE $380

MILLION ACCRUED LIABILITY, APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT IS FOR NON-U.S. FACILITIES.

APPROXIMATELY 75 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION LIABILITIES, WHILE 25

PERCENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERCLA LIABILITIES. DURING 2003, REMEDIATION

ACCRUALS OF $47 MILLION WERE ADDED TO THE RESERVE COMPARED WITH $48 MILLION IN

2002.

REMEDIATION EXPENDITURES

RCRA EXTENSIVELY REGULATES AND REQUIRES PERMITS FOR THE TREATMENT, STORAGE AND

DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. RCRA REQUIRES THAT PERMITTED FACILITIES UNDERTAKE

AN ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT THE FACILITY. IF CONDITIONS

WARRANT, COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY PRIOR

OPERATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO CERCLA, THE COSTS OF THE RCRA CORRECTIVE ACTION

PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY BORNE SOLELY BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

SIGNIFICANT ONGOING EXPENDITURES FOR RCRA REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES MAY BE REQUIRED

OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEAR TERM, HOWEVER, ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RANGE OF SUCH EXPENDITURES

EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANY'S

EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE

APPROXIMATELY $38 MILLION IN 2003, $42 MILLION IN 2002, AND $49 MILLION IN 2001.

THE COMPANY, FROM TIME TO TIME, RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION OR NOTICES OF

POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM THE EPA AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES ALLEGING THAT

THE COMPANY IS A PRP UNDER CERCLA OR SIMILAR STATE STATUTE. THE COMPANY HAS

ALSO, ON OCCASION, BEEN ENGAGED IN COST RECOVERY LITIGATION INITIATED BY THOSE

AGENCIES OR BY PRIVATE PARTIES. THESE REQUESTS, NOTICES AND LAWSUITS ASSERT

POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT VARIOUS SITES THAT TYPICALLY ARE

NOT COMPANY OWNED, BUT ALLEGEDLY CONTAIN WASTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S

PAST OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF

POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA OR STATE LAWS AT 372 SITES AROUND THE UNITED

STATES, WITH ACTIVE REMEDIATION UNDER WAY AT 138 OF THESE SITES. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED ITS LIABILITY AT 138 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING

REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN "DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS"

WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANY'S, REPRESENTED ONLY A SMALL

FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF

POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT FIVE NEW SITES DURING 2003 COMPARED WITH EIGHT SIMILAR

NOTICES IN 2002, AND ELEVEN IN 2001. IN 2003, TWO SITES WERE SETTLED BY THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH CERCLA AND SIMILAR STATE

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION IN 2003, $20 MILLION IN

2002, AND $17 MILLION IN 2001.

FOR NEARLY ALL SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY WILL BE

SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TOTAL SITE REMEDIATION COSTS BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE

OF WASTE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY

40

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

VERSUS THAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALL OTHER PRPS IS RELATIVELY LOW. OTHER PRPS AT

SITES WHERE THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TYPICALLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO MEET

THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND, WHERE THEY DO NOT, OR WHERE PRPS CANNOT BE LOCATED, THE

COMPANY'S OWN SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS NOT MATERIALLY INCREASED. THERE ARE

RELATIVELY FEW SITES WHERE THE COMPANY IS A MAJOR PARTICIPANT, AND THE COST TO

THE COMPANY OF REMEDIATION AT THOSE SITES, AND AT ALL CERCLA SITES IN THE

AGGREGATE, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE OR

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES UNDER CERCLA,

RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS WERE $60 MILLION IN 2003, $62 MILLION IN 2002, AND

$66 MILLION IN 2001.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

UNDER PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

(DERIVATIVES) IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO

THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR

PETROCHEMICAL AND PETROLEUM COMPANIES.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2004, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO DISCONTINUE ITS BROAD-BASED

FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, AS WELL AS ITS PROGRAM TO HEDGE

NATURAL GAS PURCHASES. THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING DISCONTINUED, AS THE COSTS OF THE

PROGRAMS ARE NO LONGER BELIEVED TO BE WARRANTED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE, AS WILL

HEDGING OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO EXCHANGE TRADED AGRICULTURAL

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE EXPOSURES RELEVANT TO AGRICULTURAL FEEDSTOCK

PURCHASES.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF CASH, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE, DERIVATIVES, AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES

THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE

DUPONT, AND MONITORS ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS ON A DAILY

BASIS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT- AND LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS, DERIVATIVES, AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED,

GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED, AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR

AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL

GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE REPRESENTS MORE THAN 5

PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE

OF THE GEOGRAPHIC, INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S

GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING AND GRANTING

CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR GRANTED

CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY INDUSTRY AND REGION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS

TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE

IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE ITS NET

EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS

HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE

CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED. IN ADDITION, OPTION AND

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF ANTICIPATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES AND MAJOR RAW

41

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

MATERIAL PURCHASES FROM VENDORS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES

AND COSTS RESPECTIVELY.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO

ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS

DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A

GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE

AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS.

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED FROM TIME TO TIME TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE

TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST

PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON

THREE- OR SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO

MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW

MATERIAL PURCHASES.

A PORTION OF ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES IS HEDGED TO REDUCE PRICE VOLATILITY

USING VARIOUS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. HEDGED COMMODITY PURCHASES INCLUDE

NATURAL GAS, ETHANE AND CYCLOHEXANE. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SALES OF ETHYLENE ARE

ALSO HEDGED.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS TO PRODUCE FINISHED SEED

INVENTORY. UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, GROWERS ARE COMPENSATED WITH BUSHEL

EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE MARKETED TO THE COMPANY FOR THE MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING HARVEST. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMODITY

FUTURES THAT HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY, ARE USED TO

HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK INVOLVED IN COMPENSATING GROWERS.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY FUTURES TO MANAGE THE PRICE

VOLATILITY OF SOYBEAN MEAL. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION

TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY EXPOSURE AND ARE DEEMED EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING

SOYBEAN MEAL FEEDSTOCK PRICE RISK.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THESE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SET FORTH IN

NOTE 29 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VALUE AT RISK

A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) ANALYSIS PROVIDES A FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE OF THE

MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE FOR A DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME ASSUMING

NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE COMPANY'S RISK

MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS WHICH PROVIDE

PROTECTION FROM VOLATILITY IN THE AREAS OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY,

AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES, AND ENERGY FEEDSTOCK COMMODITIES. THE VALUATIONS AND

RISK CALCULATIONS FOR THE VAR ANALYSIS WERE CONDUCTED USING THE COMPANY'S RISK

MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIOS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND 2002. THE AVERAGE, HIGH AND

LOW VALUES REFLECTED IN THE TABLE WERE DEVELOPED FROM EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS

ENDED IN 2003. THE VAR ANALYSIS USED A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TYPE MODEL WITH AN

EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED COVARIANCE MATRIX, AND EMPLOYED 3,000 PSEUDO-RANDOM

MARKET PATHS INCLUDING ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

IN THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIOS. THE CALCULATIONS WERE CONDUCTED

OVER A 20 BUSINESS DAY PERIOD AT A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING

(ERP) SYSTEM GLOBALLY. THE IMPLEMENTATION IS PHASED AND IS CURRENTLY PLANNED TO

BE COMPLETE IN 2006. IMPLEMENTING AN ERP SYSTEM ON A GLOBAL BASIS INVOLVES

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BUSINESS PROCESSES AND EXTENSIVE ORGANIZATIONAL TRAINING.

THE PHASED-IN APPROACH THE COMPANY IS TAKING REDUCES THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

MAKING THESE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO

MONITOR AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROLS DURING THIS PERIOD OF CHANGE.

THESE STEPS INCLUDE DEPLOYING RESOURCES TO MITIGATE INTERNAL CONTROL RISKS AND

PERFORMING ADDITIONAL VERIFICATIONS AND TESTING TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY.

PURSUANT TO RULES ADOPTED BY THE SEC AS DIRECTED BY SECTION 302 OF THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, THE COMPANY HAS PERFORMED AN EVALUATION OF ITS

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED BY EXCHANGE ACT RULES 13A-15(E)

AND 15D-15(E)) AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THIS

EVALUATION, THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THESE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING THAT

RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ARE CONSIDERED BY

MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS THAT

ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE AS TO THE PROTECTION OF ASSETS AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR

DISPOSITION, AND THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL RECORDS FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS

ETHICS POLICY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM. THIS POLICY

SETS FORTH MANAGEMENT'S COMMITMENT TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WORLDWIDE WITH THE

HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS AND IN CONFORMITY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. THE BUSINESS

ETHICS POLICY ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE DOCUMENTS SUPPORTING ALL TRANSACTIONS

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THEIR TRUE NATURE AND THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS BE PROPERLY

REPORTED AND CLASSIFIED IN THE FINANCIAL RECORDS. THE SYSTEM IS MONITORED BY AN

EXTENSIVE PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDIT, AND MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, MEETS THE OBJECTIVES NOTED ABOVE.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT

AUDITORS, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO

INDEPENDENTLY AFFIRM THE FAIRNESS OF MANAGEMENT'S REPORTING OF FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. TO EXPRESS THE OPINION SET FORTH

IN THEIR REPORT, THEY STUDY AND EVALUATE THE INTERNAL CONTROLS TO THE EXTENT

THEY DEEM NECESSARY. THEIR REPORT IS SHOWN ON THIS PAGE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ASSISTS THE BOARD IN FULFILLING ITS OVERSIGHT

RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE EXTERNAL REPORTING PROCESS AND THE ADEQUACY

OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROLS. THIS COMMITTEE ALSO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR

APPOINTING THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, SUBJECT TO STOCKHOLDER RATIFICATION. NO

MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE MAY BE AN OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY OR ANY

SUBSIDIARY OR AFFILIATED COMPANY. THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND THE INTERNAL

AUDITORS HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, AND THEY MEET WITH THE

COMMITTEE ON A PERIODIC BASIS, WITH AND WITHOUT MANAGEMENT PRESENT, TO DISCUSS

ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS.

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DUPONT FOLLOWS ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA. THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE

OTHER NOTES THAT FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND

ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED. FOR THOSE

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100

PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT

NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS. THIS INCLUDES

MAJORITY-OWNED ENTITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE A

MINORITY INVESTOR HOLDS SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. INVESTMENTS IN

AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THIS

GENERALLY OCCURS WHEN PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER IN ACCORDANCE WITH

TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED,

COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, AND PRICING IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE.

ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S

EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN

SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS SOLD AT THE TIME

REVENUE IS RECORDED. ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON

TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR

DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

AFFILIATE AND SUBSIDIARY STOCK TRANSACTIONS

GAINS OR LOSSES ARISING FROM ISSUANCES BY AN AFFILIATE OR A SUBSIDIARY OF ITS

OWN STOCK ARE RECORDED AS NONOPERATING ITEMS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS

FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH

APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES

MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES REPRESENTS INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND FLOATING RATE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF

PURCHASE. THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED

COST.

OTHER ASSETS INCLUDES LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, WHICH COMPRISES

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH

MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED

ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY UNTIL

SOLD. AT THE TIME OF SALE, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES CALCULATED BY THE SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION METHOD ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME. LOSSES ARE ALSO RECOGNIZED

IN INCOME WHEN A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY.

OTHER SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY

AVAILABLE ARE CARRIED AT COST. SEE NOTE 17.

INVENTORIES

EXCEPT FOR PIONEER INVENTORIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT

COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD; IN THE AGGREGATE,

SUCH VALUATIONS ARE NOT IN EXCESS OF MARKET. FOR PIONEER, INVENTORIES ARE VALUED

AT THE LOWER OF COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD, OR

MARKET.

ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT LABOR, AND

MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR MARKET,

WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E;) IS CARRIED AT COST AND IS DEPRECIATED USING

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PP&E; PLACED IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED

UNDER THE SUM-OF-THE-YEARS' DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

METHODS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL

LIVES RANGING FROM 15 TO 25 YEARS. CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER

SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 5 TO 7

YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF,

THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE

F-6

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH

DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS

ARE CAPITALIZED. IN SITUATIONS WHERE SIGNIFICANT MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES ARE

PLANNED AT MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES IN ADVANCE THE COSTS

EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS FOR MAINTENANCE

ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL AND

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE

PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE

CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR

ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES.

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS, AND

CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR

PERIODS RANGING FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE

REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND

USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT

BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED

WHEN THE TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH ASSET ARE SEPARATELY

IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR

ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES.

LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF ARE DETERMINED IN A SIMILAR

MANNER, EXCEPT THAT FAIR MARKET VALUES ARE REDUCED FOR DISPOSAL COSTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN

BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD

PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE

OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN

WHICH CASE, THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ON JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 143, "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS," WHICH

REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN ASSET AND RELATED LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS WHEN A LEGAL

LIABILITY TO RETIRE THE ASSET EXISTS. THIS INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS INCURRED AS A

RESULT OF ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, OR NORMAL OPERATION OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE

LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE

USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY

WAS RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE CAPITALIZED AS

PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE

ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1 TO 20 YEARS.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR REGULATION,

INCLUDING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, VEHICLE LIABILITY, AND EMPLOYEE RELATED

BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY

CONSIDERING HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, AND OTHER

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF

INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF RELEVANT

RISKS.

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY

APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS

F-7

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED TO OCCUR

WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE

CURRENT YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED TAXES

RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF THE COMPANY'S

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS

WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE

REALIZED.

PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE

PERMANENTLY INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD).

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF MOST OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE

OPERATIONS. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY,

ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO U.S.

DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID

EXPENSES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE

REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE

REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR

EXPENSES RELATED TO BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE

RATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN

THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT

END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, AND THE RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS WHICH ARE DESCRIBED MORE

FULLY IN NOTE 26. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THESE

PLANS UNDER THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES," AND

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY

BE OFFSET ON THE INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE

PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS) UNTIL IT IS CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE

HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD

EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT OR AN

ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED

TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED

IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION MATURES,

OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE

DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DERIVATIVE THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, AND THE DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED AS FOR

TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER LIKELY TO OCCUR.

CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED AS INVESTING

ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, CASH FLOWS FROM

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EITHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR CASH FLOW

HEDGES ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS BEING

HEDGED.

SEE NOTE 29 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES AND

STRATEGIES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEARS' DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO 2003

CLASSIFICATIONS.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED

INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES"

(VIES), WHICH IS AN INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 51,

"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS." FIN 46 ADDRESSES THE APPLICATION OF ARB NO.

51 TO VIES, AND GENERALLY WOULD REQUIRE THAT ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND RESULTS OF

THE ACTIVITY OF A VIE BE CONSOLIDATED INTO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

ENTERPRISE THAT IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THIS INTERPRETATION

APPLIES IMMEDIATELY TO VIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, AND TO VIES IN WHICH

A COMPANY OBTAINS AN INTEREST AFTER THAT DATE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT CREATED OR

OBTAINED AN INTEREST IN ANY VIES IN 2003. IN ADDITION, THE INTERPRETATION

BECOMES APPLICABLE ON DECEMBER 31, 2003 FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES)

CREATED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD NO

SPES FOR WHICH IT WAS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR NON-SPES IN WHICH

A COMPANY HOLDS A VARIABLE INTEREST THAT IT ACQUIRED BEFORE FEBRUARY 1, 2003,

THE FASB HAS POSTPONED THE DATE ON WHICH THE INTERPRETATION WILL BECOME

APPLICABLE TO MARCH 31, 2004.

THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED TWO NON-CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AS VIES WHERE DUPONT IS

CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. ONE ENTITY PROVIDES MANUFACTURING SERVICES

FOR THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER ENTITY IS A REAL ESTATE RENTAL OPERATION. THE

COMPANY GUARANTEES ALL DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF THESE ENTITIES, WHICH TOTALED $136 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003. THESE AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUITY

AFFILIATES AND OTHERS IN NOTE 24. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46,

THE COMPANY WILL CONSOLIDATE THESE VIES AS OF MARCH 31, 2004. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT EXPECT THE CONSOLIDATION OF THESE VIES TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE ACT) INTO LAW. AS PERMITTED UNDER

FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 106-1, "ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF

2003", THE COMPANY DID NOT REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF THIS ACT IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. IN JANUARY 2004, THE COMPANY

AMENDED ITS U.S. MEDICAL PLAN TO BE SECONDARY TO MEDICARE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG

COVERAGE BEGINNING IN 2006 FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND SURVIVORS. AS A RESULT OF

THIS PLAN AMENDMENT, FAS 106-1 WILL NOT APPLY TO THE COMPANY. SEE FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF PLAN AMENDMENT AT NOTE 28.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104, "REVENUE RECOGNITION," WHICH

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN SAB NO. 101 AND THE SEC'S "REVENUE RECOGNITION

IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS" (THE FAQ)

RELATED TO MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT

THE ISSUANCE OF SAB NO. 104 TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ITS CURRENT REVENUE

OTHER ACTIVITIES

DURING 2000 AND 1999, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED ACTIVITIES INVOLVING EMPLOYEE

TERMINATIONS AND WRITE-DOWNS OF ASSETS. FOR THE 2000 ACTIVITIES, A BENEFIT OF $2

WAS RECORDED IN 2002 TO REFLECT HIGHER THAN EXPECTED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

BUSINESS ASSETS, AND AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF $2 WAS RECORDED IN 2001 TO REFLECT

LOWER THAN EXPECTED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS, BOTH OF WHICH

WERE RELATED TO COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES. FOR THE 1999 ACTIVITIES, A NET

BENEFIT OF $7 WAS RECORDED IN 2001 TO REFLECT LOWER THAN EXPECTED COSTS,

PRINCIPALLY IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION. BOTH YEAR'S PROGRAMS ARE NOW COMPLETE.

THE REMAINING EMPLOYEE SEPARATION SETTLEMENTS TOTALING $5 LARGELY REPRESENT

STIPULATED INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES. ALSO, IN 2002 THE

COMPANY RECORDED A BENEFIT OF $30 IN TEXTILES & INTERIORS, AND AN ADDITIONAL

BENEFIT OF $1 IN 2003 RESULTING PRINCIPALLY FROM A FAVORABLE LITIGATION

SETTLEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S EXIT FROM A JOINT VENTURE IN CHINA IN

1999.

5. SEPARATION ACTIVITIES - TEXTILES & INTERIORS

THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF $1,620 RELATED TO THE SEPARATION OF

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE NET ASSETS OF THE TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT AS

DESCRIBED BELOW.

ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003, THE COMPANY AND KOCH INDUSTRIES, INC. (KOCH), ANNOUNCED

THAT THEY HAD REACHED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

NET ASSETS RELATED TO THE TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT TO SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH

FOR APPROXIMATELY $4,400. THESE NET ASSETS AND RELATED BUSINESSES ARE REFERRED

TO AS INVISTA. THIS $4,400 INCLUDES THE ASSUMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY $270 OF DEBT

BY THE BUYER. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS TO

SELL CERTAIN OTHER TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT ASSETS. THE COMPANY WROTE DOWN

THESE ASSETS TO BE SOLD TO ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE AND RECORDED OTHER

SEPARATION CHARGES AS FOLLOWS: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $1,168;

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCLUDING GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 6) OF $57; EQUITY AFFILIATES OF

$293; A PENSION CURTAILMENT LOSS OF $78 AND OTHER SEPARATION COSTS OF $24. THE

WRITE-DOWNS WERE BASED ON ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AS DETERMINED THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF NEGOTIATIONS TO SELL THE ASSETS AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS.

ADDITIONAL CHARGES AND CREDITS RELATED TO THE SALE OF THESE ASSETS COULD OCCUR.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE TRANSACTION WITH KOCH TO CLOSE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF

2004.

THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR

TIONS AND WARRANTIES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE INDEMNITIES AND WILL RECORD THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

INDEMNITIES UPON CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. UNDER THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT, THE

COMPANY'S TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CANNOT EXCEED APPROXIMATELY $1,400. THE REMAINING

INDEMNITIES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THIS MAXIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INDEMNITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE FUTURE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

6. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT - TEXTILES & INTERIORS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PENDING SALE OF INVISTA, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO TEST

THE RELATED GOODWILL FOR RECOVERABILITY. THIS TEST INDICATED THAT THE CARRYING

VALUE OF GOODWILL EXCEEDED ITS FAIR VALUE, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED

AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $295 TO WRITE OFF ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED GOODWILL. THIS

WRITE-OFF WAS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY THE NEGOTIATED

SALES PRICE OF THE INVISTA NET ASSETS.

7. GAIN ON SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS

ON OCTOBER 1, 2001, THE COMPANY SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE NET ASSETS OF

DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS TO BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY AND RECORDED NET PROCEEDS

OF $7,798. THE COMPANY HAS RETAINED ITS INTEREST IN THE COLLABORATION RELATING

TO COZAAR(R)/HYZAAR(R) ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS.

THE UNAUDITED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS SOLD TO BRISTOL-MYERS

SQUIBB FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

MINORITY INTERESTS.

AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN IN 2001 OF

$6,136 ($3,866 AFTER-TAX), WHICH INCLUDED CHARGES THAT WERE A DIRECT RESULT OF

THE DECISION TO DIVEST DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SALE

AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR FINALIZATION OF NET

WORKING CAPITAL, TRANSFER OF PENSION ASSETS, AND SETTLEMENT OF TAX LIABILITIES.

THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS IN 2002 RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL PRETAX GAIN OF

$25 ($39 AFTER-TAX) ON THE SALE.

8. GAIN ON SALE OF INTEREST BY SUBSIDIARY - NONOPERATING

IN APRIL 2003, THE COMPANY FORMED A MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE, THE SOLAE COMPANY,

WITH BUNGE LIMITED, COMPRISED OF THE COMPANY'S PROTEIN TECHNOLOGIES BUSINESS AND

BUNGE'S NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN INGREDIENTS OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THIS

TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROTEIN TECHNOLOGIES

BUSINESS WAS REDUCED FROM 100 PERCENT TO 72 PERCENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED A

NONOPERATING PRETAX GAIN OF $62, AS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE BUSINESSES

CONTRIBUTED BY BUNGE EXCEEDED THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE 28 PERCENT OWNERSHIP

INTEREST ACQUIRED BY BUNGE. SEE NOTE 27 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THE CHANGE IN THE NET DEFERRED TAX POSITION FROM 2002 TO 2003 IS PRINCIPALLY DUE

TO THE RECORDING OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IN TWO EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES FOR THEIR

TAX BASIS INVESTMENT LOSSES AND THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN INVISTA DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE.

CURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $863 AND $594 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY, ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPTION INCOME TAXES WITHIN CURRENT ASSETS OF

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. IN ADDITION, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $1,054 AND

$441 ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

SEE NOTE 17. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $60 AND $42 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND

(650.3)%     8.7%    36.0%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE CHANGE IN EITR FOR 2003 IS PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE RECORDING OF DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS IN TWO EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES FOR THEIR TAX BASIS INVESTMENT LOSSES

RECOGNIZED ON LOCAL TAX RETURNS. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF JURISDICTIONAL MIX

AND OTHER TAX BENEFITS WAS MAGNIFIED BY THE LOW LEVEL OF PRETAX EARNINGS FOR THE

YEAR.

INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND MINORITY INTERESTS SHOWN BELOW IS BASED ON THE

LOCATION OF THE CORPORATE UNIT TO WHICH SUCH EARNINGS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE. HOWEVER,

SINCE SUCH EARNINGS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY, THE

INCOME TAX PROVISION SHOWN ABOVE AS UNITED STATES OR INTERNATIONAL DOES NOT

CORRESPOND TO THE EARNINGS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

TAX LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH REGARD TO THE REMITTANCE OF SUCH

EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT

BE INCURRED IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE REMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES.

UNDER THE TAX LAWS OF VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES,

DEDUCTIONS OR CREDITS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY UTILIZED FOR TAX PURPOSES DURING THE

CURRENT YEAR MAY BE CARRIED FORWARD, SUBJECT TO STATUTORY LIMITATIONS, TO REDUCE

TAXABLE INCOME OR TAXES PAYABLE IN A FUTURE YEAR. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE TAX

EFFECT OF SUCH CARRYFORWARDS APPROXIMATED $1,749. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1,310 HAS NO

EXPIRATION DATE, $44 EXPIRES AFTER 2003 BUT BEFORE THE END OF 2008, AND $395

10. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

ON JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 143, WHICH REQUIRES THE COMPANY

TO RECORD AN ASSET AND RELATED LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS WHEN A LEGAL LIABILITY TO RETIRE THE

ASSET EXISTS.

THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH

CLOSURE, RECLAMATION, AND REMOVAL COSTS FOR MINING OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE

PRODUCTION OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE IN THE COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES SEGMENT. THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 RESULTED IN A CHARGE OF $46 ($29 AFTER-TAX) WHICH HAS

BEEN REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. SUCH

AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED PRIOR

TO THE APPLICATION OF THIS STATEMENT AND THE NET AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED PURSUANT TO

THIS STATEMENT.

THE ESTIMATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION WOULD HAVE BEEN $56 ON JANUARY 1,

2002, AND $60 ON DECEMBER 31, 2002, HAD THIS STATEMENT BEEN APPLIED AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2002. SET FORTH BELOW IS A RECONCILIATION OF THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED

HAD THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 143 BEEN APPLIED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2001, THE PRO

FORMA EFFECTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND 2001, ON INCOME BEFORE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND NET INCOME FOR THE

PERIODS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL.

ON JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS," WHICH RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT CHARGE TO INCOME OF

$2,944. THIS CHARGE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS OF $2,866 IN THE

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT AND $78 IN THE TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT. AS

THERE WAS NO TAX BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHARGE (GOODWILL AROSE IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF STOCK VERSUS A PURCHASE OF ASSETS), BOTH THE

PRETAX AND AFTER-TAX AMOUNTS ARE THE SAME. A VARIETY OF FAIR VALUATION METHODS

WERE USED IN MEASURING FOR IMPAIRMENT, INCLUDING DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW AND

COMPARABLE COMPANY MULTIPLES OF REVENUES AND EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST,

TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION). THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT RESULTED IN THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION WERE THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR, SLOWER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT OF AND

ACCESS TO TRAITS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY, AND A SLOWER THAN EXPECTED RATE OF

ACCEPTANCE BY THE PUBLIC OF NEW AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.

ON JANUARY 1, 2001, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS AMENDED. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133

RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE BENEFIT OF

$19 ($11 AFTER-TAX). THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF THIS GAIN IS RELATED TO THE

COMPANY'S POSITION IN CERTAIN STOCK WARRANTS, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED

FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE HAD BEEN

REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE COMPANY ALSO

RECORDED A PRETAX INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) OF

$10 ($6 AFTER-TAX). THE INCREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS) IS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNREALIZED GAINS IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY HEDGING

PROGRAMS.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND THE FORMATION OF JOINT

VENTURES, THE COMPANY HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN

LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST

EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW, AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF

THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RELATING TO

LITIGATION MATTERS. THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN

TO ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX, AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY INDEFINITE. IF THE

INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS A

RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT

OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNT

RECORDED FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 IS $31.

ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS

ACCRUED, DUE TO THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS. NO ASSETS

ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST.

OBLIGATIONS FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES & OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS

WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHER

UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD DIRECTLY

GUARANTEED $885 OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS, EXCLUDING GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS

AND LIABILITIES OF CONOCO, INC. AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM

POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE COMPANY COULD BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES.

OF THE $885 DIRECTLY GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS, $61 IS FOR SHORT-TERM (LESS THAN

ONE YEAR) BANK LOANS RELATED TO CUSTOMERS, $41 IS FOR LONG-TERM (1-5 YEARS) BANK

LOANS RELATED TO CUSTOMERS, $386 IS FOR SHORT-TERM (LESS THAN ONE YEAR) BANK

BORROWINGS RELATED TO EQUITY AFFILIATES, $253 IS FOR LONG-TERM (1-6 YEARS) BANK

BORROWINGS RELATED TO EQUITY AFFILIATES, $103 IS FOR HISTORICAL OBLIGATIONS OF A

PREVIOUSLY DIVESTED SUBSIDIARY (TERM 7 YEARS), $28 IS FOR REVENUE BONDS (1-12

YEARS), AND $13 IS FOR LEASES ON EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES FOR EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS

AND EQUITY AFFILIATES. EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR CUSTOMERS AROSE AS PART OF

CONTRACTUAL SALES AGREEMENTS. EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES AROSE

FOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN NORMAL OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY. IN

CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY HAS

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

RECOURSE TO ASSETS HELD AS COLLATERAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL GUARANTEES FROM

CUSTOMERS. ASSUMING LIQUIDATION, THESE ASSETS ARE ESTIMATED TO COVER

APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF THE $107 OF GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS OF CUSTOMERS. NO

MATERIAL LOSS IS ANTICIPATED BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WERE NOT

MATERIAL.

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF

CONOCO, INC., ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, WHICH TOTALED $235 AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2003. CONOCO HAS INDEMNIFIED THE COMPANY FOR ANY LIABILITIES THE COMPANY MAY

INCUR PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES. THE RESTRUCTURING, TRANSFER AND SEPARATION

AGREEMENT BETWEEN DUPONT AND CONOCO REQUIRES CONOCO TO USE ITS BEST EFFORTS TO

HAVE CONOCO, OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SUBSTITUTE FOR DUPONT. NO MATERIAL LOSS

IS ANTICIPATED BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2003, THE COMPANY HAD NO LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS.

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES OF $100

RELATED TO SHORT-LIVED EQUIPMENT UNDER ITS SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS. SEE FURTHER

DISCUSSION UNDER OPERATING LEASES BELOW.

OPERATING LEASES

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS LEASED FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT IN ITS OPERATIONS. THE

TERMS FOR THESE LEASED ASSETS VARY DEPENDING ON THE LEASE AGREEMENT.

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY EXERCISED ITS PURCHASE OPTIONS IN THE SYNTHETIC LEASE

PROGRAMS RELATED TO CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, RAIL CARS, AND MANUFACTURING AND

WAREHOUSING FACILITIES, THEREBY TERMINATING THESE PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT OF THESE

TRANSACTIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED ASSETS OF $334 NET OF A $20 DEFERRED GAIN

ASSOCIATED WITH THE INITIAL SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003 THE COMPANY HAD ONE REMAINING SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAM

RELATING TO SHORT-LIVED EQUIPMENT. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SYNTHETIC LEASE

PROGRAM, THE COMPANY HAD RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $100 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003. THE GUARANTEE AMOUNTS ARE TIED TO THE UNAMORTIZED LEASE

VALUES OF THE ASSETS UNDER SYNTHETIC LEASE AND ARE DUE SHOULD THE COMPANY DECIDE

NEITHER TO RENEW THESE LEASES NOR TO EXERCISE ITS PURCHASE OPTION. AT DECEMBER

31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD NO LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS. ANY

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE AMOUNTS PAID TO THE LESSOR MAY BE RECOVERED BY THE

COMPANY FROM THE SALE OF THE ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY.

FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS (INCLUDING RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE AMOUNTS) UNDER

NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES ARE $326, $198, $131, $100, AND $77 FOR THE YEARS

2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND $231 FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS,

AND ARE NOT REDUCED BY NONCANCELABLE MINIMUM SUBLEASE RENTALS DUE IN THE FUTURE

IN THE AMOUNT OF $23. NET RENTAL EXPENSE UNDER OPERATING LEASES WAS $269 IN

2003, $247 IN 2002, AND $223 IN 2001.

LITIGATION

BENLATE(R)

IN 1991, DUPONT BEGAN RECEIVING CLAIMS BY GROWERS THAT USE OF BENLATE(R) 50 DF

FUNGICIDE HAD CAUSED CROP DAMAGE. DUPONT HAS SINCE BEEN SERVED WITH SEVERAL

HUNDRED LAWSUITS, MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF THROUGH TRIAL, DISMISSAL

OR SETTLEMENT. THE STATUS OF BENLATE(R) CASES IS INDICATED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

TWENTY-ONE OF THE 96 CASES PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

WERE FILED BY GROWERS WHO ALLEGE PLANT DAMAGE FROM USING BENLATE(R) 50 DF AND,

IN SOME CASES, BENLATE(R) WP. FORTY-THREE OF THE PENDING CASES SEEK TO REOPEN

SETTLEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY BY ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY COMMITTED FRAUD AND

MISCONDUCT, AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE RACKETEERING LAWS. FOUR

OF THE PENDING CASES INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES ARISING FROM

EXPOSURE TO BENLATE(R) 50 DF AND/OR BENLATE(R) WP. TWENTY-EIGHT OF THE PENDING

CASES INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED DAMAGE TO SHRIMPING OPERATIONS FROM BENLATE(R)

OD.

IN ONE OF THE 21 CASES ALLEGING PLANT DAMAGE, A FLORIDA JURY FOUND DUPONT LIABLE

IN AUGUST 2001 UNDER FLORIDA'S RACKETEERING STATUTE AND FOR PRODUCT DEFECT

INVOLVING ALLEGED CROP DAMAGE. IN MARCH 2002, PURSUANT TO DUPONT'S MOTION, THE

JUDGE WITHDREW THE JURY'S FINDING OF LIABILITY UNDER THE RACKETEERING STATUTE

AND ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE AMOUNT OF $29. THE JUDGMENT WAS

LATER REDUCED TO $26. DUPONT HAS APPEALED. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUPONT'S APPEAL WAS

HEARD ON JANUARY 8, 2004, AND THE COM-

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

PANY IS AWAITING THE COURT'S DECISION. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NOT

PROBABLE THAT THE ADVERSE JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE WILL ULTIMATELY BE UPHELD;

THEREFORE, DUPONT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR THIS MATTER. A CASE TRIED IN

STATE COURT IN FLORIDA IN 2001 INVOLVING ALLEGED DAMAGE TO ORCHIDS, RESULTED IN

A JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF DUPONT. IN NOVEMBER, 2003, THE INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE

COURT REVERSED THE CASE AND ORDERED A NEW TRIAL. DUPONT HAS MOVED FOR REHEARING

OF THAT DECISION. THE REMAINING CROP CASES ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT,

PRINCIPALLY IN TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS IN FLORIDA.

IN 43 CASES, PLAINTIFFS WHO PREVIOUSLY SETTLED WITH THE COMPANY SEEK TO REOPEN

THEIR SETTLEMENTS THROUGH CASES ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER MISCONDUCT RELATING TO

THE LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT OF THEIR BENLATE(R) 50 DF CLAIMS. THE FLORIDA

FEDERAL COURT HAS DISMISSED THE LEAD CASE OF THE 28 REOPENER CASES PENDING

BEFORE IT. THE DISMISSAL HAS BEEN AFFIRMED BY THE 11TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS.

THE 15 REMAINING REOPENER CASES ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT IN TRIAL

AND APPELLATE COURTS IN FLORIDA AND HAWAII.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY 4 CASES PENDING INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT BENLATE(R) CAUSED

BIRTH DEFECTS TO CHILDREN EXPOSED IN UTERO. OF THESE 4 CASES, THE FEDERAL COURT

IN WEST VIRGINIA DISMISSED ONE CASE ON THE GROUNDS OF INSUFFICIENT SCIENTIFIC

SUPPORT FOR CAUSATION. ON JANUARY 27, 2004, THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL. THE REMAINING 3 CASES ARE PENDING IN DELAWARE. TWO OF

THESE CASES WERE DISMISSED FOR NOT BEING TIMELY FILED AND WERE APPEALED TO THE

DELAWARE SUPREME COURT. IN APRIL OF 2003, THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT REVERSED

THE DISMISSALS AND REMANDED THESE 2 CASES, INVOLVING SIX PLAINTIFFS, TO THE

TRIAL COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. IN THE THIRD CASE PENDING IN DELAWARE,

DUPONT ARGUED ITS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT SCIENTIFIC

SUPPORT FOR CAUSATION. THE COURT HAS NOT YET RULED ON THE MOTION. THE CASE IS

EXPECTED TO BE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN THE SECOND OR THIRD QUARTER OF 2004. A

FIFTH CASE WAS TRIED IN FLORIDA RESULTING IN A $4 VERDICT AGAINST DUPONT. THE

VERDICT WAS REVERSED AT THE INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE LEVEL BECAUSE THE PLAINTIFFS'

SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR CAUSATION WAS INSUFFICIENT. THE CASE WAS APPEALED TO THE

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT AND THE VERDICT FOR THE PLAINTIFFS WAS REINSTATED WITH

INTEREST. FURTHER APPELLATE REVIEW WAS DENIED AND THE JUDGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY

$6.8 HAS BEEN PAID AND THE CASE CLOSED. DUPONT DOES NOT EXPECT THE FLORIDA

SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO HAVE PRECEDENTIAL VALUE IN THE 3 CASES PENDING IN

DELAWARE SINCE FLORIDA USES A DIFFERENT STANDARD TO DETERMINE ADMISSIBILITY.

THE 28 CASES INVOLVING DAMAGE TO SHRIMP ARE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE

COURT IN BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA. THESE CASES WERE BROUGHT BY ECUADORIAN SHRIMP

FARMERS WHO ALLEGE THAT BENLATE(R) OD APPLIED TO BANANA PLANTATIONS IN ECUADOR

RAN-OFF AND WAS DEPOSITED IN PLAINTIFFS' SHRIMP FARMS, CAUSING MASSIVE NUMBERS

OF SHRIMP TO DIE. DUPONT CONTENDS THAT THE INJURIES ALLEGED ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

A VIRUS, TAURA SYNDROME VIRUS, AND IN NO WAY INVOLVE BENLATE(R) OD. ONE CASE WAS

TRIED IN THE FALL OF 2000 AND ANOTHER IN EARLY 2001. BOTH TRIALS RESULTED IN

ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $14 EACH. THE COMPANY APPEALED THE JUDGMENTS

IN BOTH CASES. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2003, THE INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT REVERSED

THE ADVERSE VERDICT AGAINST DUPONT IN THE FIRST CASE AND THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT

REVIEW OF THIS RULING BY THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT. ON FEBRUARY 11, 2004 THE

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO REVIEW THE MATTER. THE COMPANY WILL SEEK ENTRY

OF JUDGMENT IN ITS FAVOR BY THE TRIAL COURT. THE INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT

HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THE COMPANY'S APPEAL OF THE SECOND CASE ON JULY 2, 2003,

BUT IT HAS NOT YET RENDERED A DECISION. AN ACCRUAL HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR

EITHER CASE BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE

ADVERSE JUDGMENTS AT THE TRIAL LEVEL ULTIMATELY WILL BE UPHELD. THE 26 UNTRIED

CASES ARE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL OF THE CASE TRIED IN THE

FALL OF 2000.

A SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION WAS FILED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY A SHAREHOLDER IN

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN FLORIDA AGAINST THE COMPANY AND THE THEN-CHAIRMAN. THE

PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE ALLEGED THAT DUPONT MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

AND OMISSIONS ABOUT BENLATE(R) 50 DF, WITH THE ALLEGED EFFECT OF INFLATING THE

PRICE OF DUPONT'S STOCK BETWEEN JUNE 19, 1993, AND JANUARY 27,1995. THE DISTRICT

COURT CERTIFIED THE CASE AS A CLASS ACTION. IN MARCH 2003, DUPONT ENTERED INTO

AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THIS CASE FOR $77.5. THE COURT GRANTED FINAL APPROVAL OF

THE SETTLEMENT ON MAY 30, 2003. THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT HAS BEEN PAID AND THE CASE

HAS BEEN CLOSED.

DUPONT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT BENLATE(R) CAUSED THE DAMAGES ALLEGED IN EACH OF

THESE CASES AND DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT. DUPONT CONTINUES

TO DEFEND ITSELF IN ONGOING MATTERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, DUPONT HAS

INCURRED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1,900 ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

MATTERS. THE COMPANY HAS RECOVERED APPROXIMATELY $250 OF ITS COSTS AND EXPENSES

THROUGH INSURANCE. WHILE MANAGE-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

MENT RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES MAY BE

INCURRED, A RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

PFOA

DUPONT USES PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS SALTS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS

PFOA), AS PROCESSING AIDS TO MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AT

VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN WEST

VIRGINIA. DUPONT PURCHASED PFOA FROM A THIRD PARTY UNTIL IT BEGAN MANUFACTURING

PFOA IN NORTH CAROLINA IN THE FALL OF 2002. SOME OF THE WASTESTREAM FROM THE

MANUFACTURE OF PFOA IS TREATED AT DUPONT'S CHAMBERS WORKS SITE IN NEW JERSEY.

DUPONT ALSO MANUFACTURES FLUORINATED TELOMERS THAT ARE USED IN SOIL, STAIN AND

GREASE REPELLANTS FOR THE PAPER, APPAREL, UPHOLSTERY AND CARPET INDUSTRIES.

DUPONT DOES NOT USE PFOA AS A PROCESSING AID IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE

TELOMERS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT TELOMER CHEMISTRY CAN FORM

SMALL TRACE AMOUNTS OF PFOA.

ON APRIL 14, 2003, THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

ISSUED A PRELIMINARY RISK ASSESSMENT ON PFOA. IT INDICATES POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OF

THE U.S. GENERAL POPULATION TO PFOA AT VERY LOW LEVELS AND STATES THAT THERE

COULD BE A POTENTIAL RISK OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND OTHER EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH

PFOA EXPOSURE. THE EPA STATES THAT THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA. HOWEVER, THE EPA HAS

SAID THAT IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY REASON FOR CONSUMERS TO STOP USING

ANY CONSUMER OR INDUSTRIAL-RELATED PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PFOA. THE

EPA ALSO STARTED A PUBLIC PROCESS TO IDENTIFY AND GENERATE ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION TO DEVELOP A MORE ACCURATE RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO IDENTIFY WHAT

VOLUNTARY OR REGULATORY MITIGATION OR OTHER ACTIONS, IF ANY, MIGHT BE

APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, THE EPA INVITED INTERESTED PARTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN

PUBLICLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS, KNOWN AS ENFORCEABLE CONSENT AGREEMENTS OR ECAS,

WITH THE EPA TO DEVELOP INFORMATION THAT ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE

SOURCES OF PFOA IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PATHWAYS BY WHICH HUMAN EXPOSURE TO

PFOA IS OCCURRING. THE RESULT OF THE PROCESS THAT THE EPA HAS PUT IN PLACE WILL

BE A REFINED RISK ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE

AGENCY'S SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD, AND A DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT, IF ANY,

REGULATIONS ARE APPROPRIATE REGARDING PFOA. DUPONT EXPECTS THAT THIS PROCESS

WILL CONTINUE WELL INTO 2004.

BASED ON OVER FIFTY YEARS OF INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND EXTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC STUDY,

DUPONT BELIEVES THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT PFOA CAUSES ANY ADVERSE HUMAN HEALTH

EFFECTS OR HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, DUPONT RESPECTS THE EPA'S POSITION

RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPOSURE ROUTES AND THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF PFOA AND

IS UNDERTAKING VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS CONCERNING PFOA AND FLUORINATED TELOMERS.

DUPONT, AS WELL AS OTHER COMPANIES, HAVE OUTLINED PLANS FOR CONTINUED RESEARCH,

EMISSION REDUCTIONS ACTIVITIES, AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES TO HELP

ADDRESS THE EPA'S QUESTIONS.

A CLASS ACTION WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AGAINST DUPONT AND THE

LUBECK PUBLIC SERVICE DISTRICT. THE ACTION ALLEGES THAT THE CLASS HAS OR MAY

SUFFER DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER AND

SEEKS MEDICAL MONITORING. IN ADDITION, THE CLASS SEEKS DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY

VALUES, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES PLUS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP RELEASES OF PFOA.

THE CLASS HAS BEEN DEFINED AS ANYONE WHO HAS CONSUMED DRINKING WATER

CONTAMINATED BY PFOA FROM OPERATIONS OF THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT, WHICH COULD

BE AS LARGE AS FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. THE LUBECK PUBLIC SERVICE DISTRICT

AND PLAINTIFFS RECENTLY REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY

THE COURT. DUPONT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT CONSUMPTION OF DRINKING WATER WITH LOW

LEVELS OF PFOA HAS CAUSED OR WILL CAUSE DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS. ON MAY 1,

2003, THE COURT ENTERED AN ORDER REQUIRING THAT DUPONT SAMPLE AND ANALYZE THE

BLOOD FOR PFOA OF THE INDIVIDUAL CLASS MEMBERS ELECTING TO PARTICIPATE. IN

ADDITION, THE COURT MADE CERTAIN FINDINGS OF FACT INCLUDING A FINDING THAT PFOA

IS TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS TO HUMANS. IN RESPONSE TO DUPONT'S APPEAL, THE WEST

VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT SET ASIDE THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDER, INCLUDING THE FINDINGS

OF FACT. DUPONT INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THIS MATTER. SINCE DUPONT

DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS USE OF PFOA HAS CAUSED OR WILL CAUSE ANY DELETERIOUS

HEALTH EFFECTS, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A RESERVE RELATED TO THE FINAL

OUTCOME OF THE LAWSUIT. SEPTEMBER 20, 2004 HAS BEEN SET AS THE TRIAL DATE FOR

THIS ACTION.

WHILE MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT LOSSES RELATED

TO PFOA MAY BE INCURRED, A RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED

AT THIS TIME.

DUPONT DOW ELASTOMERS LLC

AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CANADA ARE

INVESTIGATING THE SYNTHETIC RUBBER MARKETS FOR POSSIBLE ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS.

DUPONT DOW ELASTOMERS LLC (DDE), A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE IN THE PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS SEGMENT, HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

RELATED CIVIL LITIGATION HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST DDE AND OTHERS, INCLUDING

DUPONT. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT DDE WILL INCUR A LOSS AS

A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND CIVIL LITIGATION; HOWEVER, A RANGE OF SUCH

LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT DUPONT

MAY INCUR A LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE MATTERS; HOWEVER, A RANGE OF SUCH

LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

GENERAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL

COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS INCLUDE ACTIONS BASED ON ALLEGED

EXPOSURES TO PRODUCTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS; AND

CONTRACT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR CONTINGENCIES WHEN A LOSS

IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WHILE THE ULTIMATE

LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO

CORRECT THE EFFECTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR RELEASES

OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY

ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET

FORTH IN NOTE 1. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED

TO AS SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA), AND SIMILAR

STATE LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE

AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED

OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL

ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE

COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE

REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO

SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE

SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDES A LIABILITY OF $380 RELATING TO THESE

MATTERS AND, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES. THE AVERAGE TIME FRAME OVER WHICH THE ACCRUED OR PRESENTLY

UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS MAY BE PAID, BASED ON PAST HISTORY, IS ESTIMATED TO BE

15-20 YEARS. CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE COSTS AND,

UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO

TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003.

THE COMPANY HAS CONTINUED ITS LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPUTER SCIENCES

CORPORATION (CSC) AND ACCENTURE LLP. CSC OPERATES A MAJORITY OF DUPONT'S GLOBAL

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDES SELECTED

APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE SERVICES. ACCENTURE PROVIDES ENTERPRISE RESOURCE

PLANNING SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE DUPONT'S MANUFACTURING, MARKETING,

DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. IN APRIL 2003, THE CONTRACT WITH CSC WAS

REVISED, RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE FUTURE MINIMUM PAYMENTS DUE UNDER

THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS INCIDENT TO THE ORDINARY CONDUCT OF

BUSINESS. IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH COMMITMENTS ARE NOT AT PRICES IN EXCESS OF

CURRENT MARKET.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A PROGRAM TO PURCHASE AND

RETIRE UP TO 20 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK TO OFFSET DILUTION FROM

SHARES ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN JULY 2000, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES REMAINING TO BE PURCHASED

UNDER THE 1998 PROGRAM FROM ABOUT 16 MILLION SHARES TO

SHARES ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE

1998 PROGRAM, PURCHASING 10.8 MILLION SHARES FOR $470. IN ADDITION, 43 MILLION

SHARES WERE PURCHASED FOR $1,818 IN 2001.

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $2,000 SHARE BUYBACK PLAN IN JUNE

2001. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, NO SHARES WERE PURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

SHARES HELD BY THE FLEXITRUST WERE PREVIOUSLY USED TO SATISFY EXISTING EMPLOYEE

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE ADOPTION OF WORLDWIDE

CORPORATE SHARING PROGRAMS. UNDER THESE PROGRAMS, ESSENTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES HAVE

RECEIVED A ONE-TIME GRANT TO ACQUIRE SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK AT THE MARKET

PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTION TERMS ARE "FIXED" AND OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY

EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT.

IN JANUARY 2002, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A 2002 BICENTENNIAL CORPORATE

SHARING PROGRAM AND AWARDED, TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, A ONE-TIME "FIXED AND

DETERMINABLE" GRANT TO ACQUIRE 200 SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK AT THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT ($44.50 PER SHARE). DURING ALL BUT THE LAST

SIX MONTHS OF THE TEN-YEAR OPTION TERM, THESE OPTIONS CANNOT BE EXERCISED UNTIL

A MARKET PRICE OF $53.40 PER SHARE OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK IS ACHIEVED FOR A

PERIOD OF FIVE CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT MAY

BE SUBJECT TO OPTION UNDER EXISTING PROGRAMS.

STOCK OPTION AWARDS UNDER THE DUPONT STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN MAY BE GRANTED TO

KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND MAY BE "FIXED" OR "VARIABLE." THE PURCHASE

PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE MARKET PRICE

OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONEES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RELOAD

OPTIONS UPON THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS WITH THE CONDITION THAT SHARES

RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE ARE HELD FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. A RELOAD OPTION IS

GRANTED AT THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAS A TERM EQUAL TO THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE ORIGINAL OPTION. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RELOAD OPTIONS

GRANTED IS LIMITED TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IN THE ORIGINAL

OPTION TIMES THE ORIGINAL OPTION PRICE DIVIDED BY THE OPTION PRICE OF THE RELOAD

OPTION. GENERALLY, FIXED OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS

AFTER DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING IN 1998,

SHARES OTHERWISE RECEIVABLE FROM THE EXERCISE OF NONQUALIFIED OPTIONS CAN BE

DEFERRED AS STOCK UNITS FOR A DESIGNATED FUTURE DELIVERY.

VARIABLE STOCK OPTION GRANTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CERTAIN MEMBERS OF SENIOR

MANAGEMENT. THESE OPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IF, WITHIN FIVE YEARS FROM

THE DATE OF GRANT, THE MARKET PRICE OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK DOES NOT ACHIEVE A

PRICE OF $75 PER SHARE FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE OPTIONS AND $90 PER SHARE FOR THE

REMAINING 50 PERCENT. THIS CONDITION WAS MET IN 1998 FOR OPTIONS WITH A $75 PER

SHARE HURDLE PRICE AND, AS A RESULT, THESE OPTIONS BECAME "FIXED" AND

EXERCISABLE. THIS CONDITION WAS NEVER MET FOR THE OPTIONS WITH A $90 PER SHARE

HURDLE PRICE AND, AS A RESULT, THESE OPTIONS WERE FORFEITED IN JANUARY 2002.

THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO OPTION FOR ANY CONSECUTIVE

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS 72 MILLION SHARES. SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT, ADDITIONAL SHARES

THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE SUBJECT TO OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE

29,606,134 FOR 2003, 31,243,286 FOR 2002 AND 40,458,505 FOR 2001.

THE DUPONT STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO KEY EMPLOYEES. STOCK OPTION GRANTS IN 2004 CONSISTED

OF 7,276,932 FIXED NONQUALIFIED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE DUPONT COMMON STOCK AT THE

MARKET PRICE ($43.62 PER SHARE) ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE OPTIONS SERIALLY VEST

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND CARRY A SIX-YEAR OPTION TERM. GRANTS OF 694,882

TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE ISSUED TO PARTICIPANTS AT THE MARKET

PRICE ($43.62 PER UNIT). THE UNITS SERIALLY VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, AND

AT VESTING BOTH THE ORIGINAL UNIT GRANT PLUS DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT UNITS CREDITED

DURING THE RESTRICTION PERIOD WILL BE DELIVERED AS DUPONT COMMON STOCK. THE

COMPANY ALSO GRANTED 244,400 PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT THE

MARKET PRICE ($43.62 PER UNIT) TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP. VESTING IS BASED UPON

ATTAINMENT OF ESTABLISHED CORPORATE OBJECTIVES AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE

THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THE ACTUAL AWARD, DELIVERED AS DUPONT COMMON

STOCK, CAN RANGE FROM 0 PERCENT TO 200 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT. DIVIDEND

EQUIVALENTS WILL ALSO BE GRANTED AS SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK UPON VESTING.

THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GUIDING INVESTMENT OF U.S. PENSION ASSETS ARE THOSE

EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE

PRINCIPLES INCLUDE DISCHARGING

F-35

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN

PARTICIPANTS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE "PRUDENT EXPERT" STANDARD AND OTHER

ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION

PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH

THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. THE INTERACTION

BETWEEN PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IS PERIODICALLY STUDIED TO ASSIST IN

ESTABLISHING SUCH STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION TARGETS. THE COMPANY'S PENSION

INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DISCRETION TO MANAGE THE ASSETS WITHIN ESTABLISHED

ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. THE

COMPANY'S U.S. PENSION ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. MARKETS.

INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS "DERIVATIVES". DERIVATIVES MAY NOT BE USED

IN A MANNER THAT LEVERAGES ASSETS OF THE FUND.

THE TOTAL VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS IS $14,595 AND $12,739 AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. U.S. PENSION ASSETS INCLUDE

COMPANY COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNTS OF $454 (3 PERCENT OF TOTAL PLAN ASSETS),

AND $420 (3 PERCENT OF TOTAL PLAN ASSETS) AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY. "OTHER" CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF PRIVATE EQUITY AND PRIVATE DEBT.

CASH FLOW

NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION

PLAN TRUST FUND BY FUNDING REGULATIONS OR LAWS IN 2004. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS

PERMITTED TO MAKE A TAX DEDUCTIBLE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN TRUST FUND IN 2004, NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE TO MAKE SUCH A

CONTRIBUTION. WORLDWIDE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $300 TO

ITS PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND $420 TO ITS

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IN 2004.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG,

IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE ACT) INTO LAW. THE ACT INTRODUCES

A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE (MEDICARE PART D) AS WELL AS A

FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO COMPANIES WHICH SPONSOR RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS

THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART

D. AS PERMITTED UNDER FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) FAS 106-1, "ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT

AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003", THE COMPANY DID NOT REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF THIS

ACT IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. IN JANUARY

2004, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS U.S. MEDICAL PLAN TO BE SECONDARY TO MEDICARE FOR

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGINNING IN 2006 FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND

SURVIVORS. AS A RESULT OF THIS PLAN AMENDMENT FAS 106-1 WILL NOT APPLY TO THE

COMPANY. THE IMPACT OF THIS AMENDMENT IS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT 2004 PRETAX

EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $60 AND REDUCE THE COMPANY'S OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

OBLIGATION BY ABOUT $525.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH COVER

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE SAVINGS AND

INVESTMENT PLAN (THE PLAN). THIS PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP,

AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO

PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN

IS A TAX QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF

THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 50

PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. THE

COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN WERE $60, $58, AND $61 FOR YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTIONS

VEST 100 PERCENT UPON CONTRIBUTION.

29. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

UNDER PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

(DERIVATIVES) IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. THE FRAMEWORK HAS

ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF APPROVED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE UTILIZED IN EACH

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS VARYING LEVELS OF EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME

HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS RELATED TO EACH HEDGING PROGRAM.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UTILIZED DURING THE PERIOD INCLUDE FORWARDS, OPTIONS,

FUTURES AND SWAPS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS.

F-36

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

THE FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH SENIOR MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES THROUGH A CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY.

IN ADDITION, IT ESTABLISHES OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES AND RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

THAT AUTHORIZE THE USE OF SPECIFIC DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FURTHER

ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL,

AND ROUTINE MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR PETROCHEMICAL AND

PETROLEUM COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF

NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY MANAGES THIS EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT LOSS THROUGH THE AFOREMENTIONED CREDIT APPROVALS, LIMITS, AND MONITORING

PROCEDURES AND, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, BY RESTRICTING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH

UNPAID BALANCES ARE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS, AND NO MATERIAL LOSS WOULD

BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH NONPERFORMANCE. MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2004, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO DISCONTINUE ITS

BROAD-BASED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE HEDGING PROGRAM, AS WELL AS ITS PROGRAMS TO

HEDGE NATURAL GAS PURCHASES. THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING DISCONTINUED AS THE COSTS OF

THE PROGRAMS ARE NO LONGER BELIEVED TO BE WARRANTED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE, AS WILL

HEDGING OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO EXCHANGE TRADED AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY

DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE EXPOSURES RELEVANT TO AGRICULTURAL FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF

INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE

INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ALLOW THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING

RATE DEBT. ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF HEDGE

ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THESE HEDGES. CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK ARE RECORDED IN

INTEREST EXPENSE EACH PERIOD. THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE

RELATED DEBT ARE ALSO RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NO

OTHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF CASH FLOW HEDGING PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RISKS

RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAMS

INVOLVE HEDGING A PORTION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES AND MAJOR RAW

MATERIAL PURCHASES FROM VENDORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. COMMODITY PRICE

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON

PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS NATURAL GAS, ETHANE, ETHYLENE, CORN, CYCLOHEXANE,

SOYBEANS, AND SOYBEAN MEAL. WHILE EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT

TIME HORIZON, MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR

PERIOD. ONE EXCEPTION IS AN INVENTORY PURCHASE PROGRAM WITH CURRENCY RISK, WHICH

HAS BEEN PARTIALLY HEDGED THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006.

HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES ARE REPORTED ON THE NET SALES

LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT, AND THE EFFECTS OF HEDGES OF

INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER

OPERATING CHARGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN

WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER

IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE. CASH FLOW

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR 2003 IS A PRETAX GAIN OF $3.

DURING 2003, THERE WERE NO PRETAX GAINS (LOSSES) EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS. THE AMOUNT RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS FOR FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS THAT DID NOT OCCUR WAS NOT MATERIAL. ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ACTIVITY DURING 2003 CONSISTS OF A BEGINNING BALANCE

OF $(33) AFTER-TAX. REVALUATION OF CASH FLOW HEDGES OF $(38) AFTER-TAX, AND

CLEARANCE OF CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS TO EARNINGS OF $(63) AFTER-TAX DURING THE

PERIOD YIELDED AN AFTER-TAX ENDING BALANCE OF $(8). THE PORTION OF THE ENDING

BALANCE OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IS $(8).

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAS NOT MAINTAINED ANY

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY

CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPO-

F-37

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

SURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING. HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION

OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED

MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTS IN A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER

TAXES. SEVERAL SMALL EQUITY AFFILIATES HAVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, MAINLY IN

THE AREA OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, FOR WHICH THEY HAVE ELECTED NOT TO PURSUE

HEDGE ACCOUNTING. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A FEW SMALL RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAMS FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT. ALSO, THE COMPANY OWNS STOCK WARRANTS IN A FEW COMPANIES FOR

STRATEGIC PURPOSES.

IN ADDITION, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE 23.88 PERCENT MINORITY

INTEREST IN DUPONT CANADA INC. (SEE NOTE 27), THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO OPTION

CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE 1.0 BILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS FOR ABOUT $700. THE BUSINESS

PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACTS WAS TO PROTECT AGAINST ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN THE U.S.

DOLLAR/CANADIAN DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE. THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE

CONTRACTS WERE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD THE CHANGE OCCURRED. THE

CONTRACTS EXPIRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTING IN A PRETAX EXCHANGE

GAIN OF $30.

CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE ITS NET

EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS

OPERATIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE DESIGNATED

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS

TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED

TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.

OPTION AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ROUTINELY USED TO OFFSET A PORTION OF

THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE OBJECTIVE

OF THIS HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO

CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH

WITH CERTAINTY THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS

DENOMINATED IN ANOTHER CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A

GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE

AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY, AND ECONOMIC TRENDS.

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED FROM TIME TO TIME TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX

OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST

PAYMENTS THAT ARE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH UNDERLYING FIXED-RATE BONDS OR NOTES TO

EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON THREE- OR

SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

WITH TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $2,310, WHEREBY THE COMPANY, OVER THE REMAINING

TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING NOTES, WILL RECEIVE A FIXED RATE PAYMENT EQUIVALENT TO

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE OF THE UNDERLYING NOTE AND PAY A FLOATING RATE OF

INTEREST THAT IS BASED ON THREE- OR SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OVERALL COST

OF BORROWING AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002.

SEE NOTE 21 FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTIONS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW

MATERIAL PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXPOSURES.
