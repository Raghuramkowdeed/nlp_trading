THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BACKLOG INFORMATION IS NOT MATERIAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS OVERALL BUSINESS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

AS A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BASED COMPANY, DUPONT BELIEVES THAT SECURING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF PROTECTING ITS RESEARCH. SOME DUPONT BUSINESSES OPERATE IN ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE AVAILABILITY AND PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AFFECT COMPETITION.  (INFORMATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO PIONEER IS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 AGRICULTURE BUSINESS DISCUSSION BEGINNING ON PAGE 2 OF THIS REPORT.)

TRADE SECRETS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  MANY OF THE PROCESSES USED TO MAKE DUPONT PRODUCTS ARE KEPT AS TRADE SECRETS WHICH, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAY BE LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES.  DUPONT VIGILANTLY PROTECTS ALL OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INCLUDING ITS TRADE SECRETS.  WHEN THE COMPANY DISCOVERS THAT ITS TRADE SECRETS HAVE BEEN UNLAWFULLY TAKEN, IT REPORTS THE MATTER TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTION, AS APPROPRIATE.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT

,

WHICH MAY INCLUDE CIVIL ACTIONS SEEKING REDRESS, RESTITUTION AND/OR DAMAGES BASED ON LOSS TO THE COMPANY AND/OR UNJUST ENRICHMENT.

PATENTS & TRADEMARKS.

DUPONT

CONTINUALLY APPLIES FOR AND OBTAINS U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS AND HAS ACCESS TO A LARGE PATENT PORTFOLIO, BOTH OWNED AND LICENSED.  DUPONT’S RIGHTS UNDER THESE PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY IN THE AGGREGATE. THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THESE PATENTS VARIES BASED ON COUNTRY, SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL PATENT COVERAGE, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY.  THIS SIGNIFICANT PATENT ESTATE MAY BE

LEVERAGED TO ALIGN WITH THE COMPANY’S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES WITHIN AND ACROSS SEGMENTS.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE COMPANY OWNED OVER 24,000 PATENTS WITH VARIOUS EXPIRATION DATES OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. IN ADDITION TO ITS OWNED PATENTS, THE COMPANY OWNS OVER 20,000 PATENT APPLICATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT 2,140 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 21,130 REGISTRATIONS FOR THESE TRADEMARKS WORLDWIDE.  OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS ARE CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED.  THE COMPANY HAS MANY TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL AND/OR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS LEVEL.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) AT EITHER DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR MANUFACTURING PLANTS. THERE ARE ELEVEN MAJOR RESEARCH LOCATIONS IN THE U.S. & CANADA, WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF FACILITIES AT OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN THE WILMINGTON, DELAWARE AREA. IN ADDITION, DUPONT HAS FIVE MAJOR RESEARCH CENTERS IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, FOUR MAJOR LOCATIONS IN THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA) REGION AND ONE MAJOR LOCATION IS LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA.

THE COMPANY’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO LEVERAGE ITS UNIQUE INTEGRATED SCIENCE CAPABILITIES TO DRIVE REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH.  DUPONT'S R&D ORGANIZATION IS FULLY FOCUSED ON THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES: EXTENDING ITS LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE HIGH-VALUE, SCIENCE-DRIVEN SEGMENTS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD VALUE CHAINS, STRENGTHENING ITS LEAD AS PROVIDER OF DIFFERENTIATED, HIGH-VALUE ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS, AND BUILDING TRANSFORMATIONAL NEW BIO-BASED INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS UNIQUE BREADTH OF SCIENCE, PROVEN R&D ENGINE, BROAD GLOBAL REACH AND DEEP MARKET PENETRATION ARE DISTINCTIVE, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT POSITION IT TO ADDRESS DEMANDS FOR MORE AND HEALTHIER FOOD, DECREASING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUEL, AND PROTECTING PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.  EACH BUSINESS IN THE COMPANY FUNDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS MISSION, AND A CENTRAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS CROSS-BUSINESS AND CROSS-FUNCTIONAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.  THE R&D PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED BY SENIOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE BUSINESS AND CORPORATE STRATEGY AND TO CAPITALIZE ON THE APPLICATION OF EMERGING SCIENCE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PROTECT ITS R&D INVESTMENT THROUGH ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGY. SEE DISCUSSION UNDER "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY".

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY IN THE FUTURE BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INSTABILITY IN CREDIT MARKETS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES AND INTEREST RATES, VOLATILE EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER CHALLENGES SUCH AS THE CHANGING FINANCIAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION. FURTHER, SUPPLIERS COULD EXPERIENCE SIMILAR CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY. ADVERSITY WITHIN CAPITAL MARKETS MAY IMPACT FUTURE RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, THUS RESULTING IN GREATER FUTURE PENSION COSTS THAT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS.  BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NET MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES, FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  FUTURE WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND FAILURE TO MANAGE THESE RISKS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND LAWS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

SALES TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONSTITUTE ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S 2013 REVENUE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS TOTAL SALES AND THAT CONTINUED GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. SALES FROM DEVELOPING MARKETS REPRESENT 33 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IN 2013 AND THE COMPANY'S GROWTH PLANS INCLUDE FOCUSING ON EXPANDING ITS PRESENCE IN DEVELOPING MARKETS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS, AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN A COUNTRY'S OR REGION'S ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRADE REGULATIONS AFFECTING PRODUCTION, PRICING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, LOCAL LABOR CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS, REDUCED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY OR LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES, BURDENSOME TAXES AND TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS. INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CHANGING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TERRORISM, POLITICAL HOSTILITIES AND WAR, COULD LEAD TO REDUCED SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND GROW EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS, AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN 2013, PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS WERE ABOUT $500 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2012. PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO EARNINGS IN 2012 AS COMPARED TO 2011. LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ESTABLISHING A PRICE ON CARBON COULD CREATE INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS AND PRICE VOLATILITY.  WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES. THE COMPANY TAKES ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE INCREASES, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH PRICE INCREASES IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED BY BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS.

BUSINESS AND/OR SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, PLANT AND/OR POWER OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND/OR NETWORK DISRUPTIONS, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF SABOTAGE, EMPLOYEE ERROR OR OTHER ACTIONS, GEO-POLITICAL ACTIVITY, WEATHER EVENTS AND NATURAL DISASTERS COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT, DETECT AND RECOVER FROM SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE

8

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

BY HACKERS; VIRUSES; BREACHES DUE TO EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS; OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS COULD RESULT IN MISUSE OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS, BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, LOSS OF PROPERTY INCLUDING TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION, LEGAL CLAIMS OR PROCEEDINGS, REPORTING ERRORS, PROCESSING INEFFICIENCIES, NEGATIVE MEDIA ATTENTION, LOSS OF SALES AND INTERFERENCE WITH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.  LIKE MOST MAJOR CORPORATIONS, DUPONT IS THE TARGET OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE, INCLUDING CYBER-ATTACKS, FROM TIME TO TIME. DUPONT HAS DETERMINED THAT THESE ATTACKS HAVE RESULTED, AND COULD RESULT IN THE FUTURE, IN UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES GAINING ACCESS TO AT LEAST CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. HOWEVER, TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT, CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT OR BUSINESS OPERATIONS THAT IT ATTRIBUTES TO THESE ATTACKS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL LOSSES TO DATE RELATED TO SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL NOT SUFFER SUCH LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES. AS THESE THREATS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, PARTICULARLY AROUND CYBERSECURITY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENHANCE ITS CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, PROCESSES, PRACTICES AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, SUCH EVENTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INABILITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING PATENTS, PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION, TRADE SECRETS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, TRADEMARKS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER FORMS OF TRADE DRESS, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTED.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS, THEFT AND CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, AND OTHER SECURITY BREACHES. WHEN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE OR COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS ARE DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH SITUATIONS TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION, AS APPROPRIATE, AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE

ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT.

FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, ALLIANCES AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ACQUISITION CANDIDATES THAT MAY STRATEGICALLY FIT ITS BUSINESS AND/OR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IF DUPONT IS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AND DEVELOP ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS, INCLUDING ANY EXPECTED INCREASES IN REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL RESULTS. DUPONT CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S OBJECTIVES AND ALIGNMENT WITH ITS GROWTH STRATEGY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN SEPARATING UNDERPERFORMING OR NON-STRATEGIC ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DIVESTITURE OF, OR LOST OPERATING INCOME FROM, SUCH ASSETS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS.  MOREOVER, DUPONT MIGHT INCUR ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES THAT REDUCE ITS EARNINGS.

IN OCTOBER 2013, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO SEPARATE ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT THROUGH A U.S. TAX-FREE SPIN-OFF TO SHAREHOLDERS. THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, COMPLEX IN NATURE AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY UNANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS. COMPLETION OF THE SPIN-OFF WILL BE CONTINGENT UPON CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING RECEIPT OF REGULATORY APPROVALS.

MARKET ACCEPTANCE, GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND COMPETITION COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES SEGMENTS. THESE PRODUCTS ENABLE COST AND PROCESS BENEFITS, BETTER PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES TO A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES SUCH AS SEEDS, ANIMAL NUTRITION, DETERGENTS, FOOD MANUFACTURING, ETHANOL PRODUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS COULD BE IMPACTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF COMMODITY GRAIN GROWN FROM THOSE SEEDS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS LENGTHY AND COMPLEX WITH REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN VARY BY INDUSTRY AND BY COUNTRY. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDER REACTION TO ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED IMPACTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ON SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRES SUBMITTING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND DATA, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. THE ABILITY TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATORY AGENCIES IS ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SELL EXISTING PRODUCTS OR COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS.

9

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES SUPPORTING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY AGRICULTURAL AND BIO-BASED PRODUCTS. SPEED IN DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING RELATED PRODUCTS TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OR CANDIDATE PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES. COMPETITORS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITIONS AND THE OUTCOMES CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. IF CHALLENGES ARE RESOLVED ADVERSELY, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS AND GENERATE SALES FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PROCESS SAFETY AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ISSUES.

FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY MANAGE SAFETY, HUMAN HEALTH, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITIES, STAKEHOLDERS, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD IMPACT PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE AND INFLUENCE THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO MANAGE PROCESS SAFETY RISKS, ISSUES COULD BE CREATED BY EVENTS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, ACTS OF SABOTAGE AND SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANY'S EXTERNAL PARTNERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION COSTS. THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE MATTER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NOTED A TREND IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NUISANCE SUITS BEING FILED ON BEHALF OF STATES, COUNTIES, CITIES AND UTILITIES ALLEGING HARM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED, THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

PURPOSE

DUPONT’S BUSINESSES SERVE MARKETS WHERE THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR MORE AND HEALTHIER FOOD, RENEWABLY SOURCED MATERIALS AND FUELS, AND ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS IS CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE COMBINATION OF SCIENCES, PROVEN R&D ENGINE, BROAD GLOBAL REACH, AND DEEP MARKET PENETRATION ARE DISTINCTIVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT POSITION THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE CAPITALIZING ON THIS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL.

STRATEGY

POSITION DUPONT AS A HIGHER GROWTH, HIGHER VALUE COMPANY, WELL EQUIPPED TO DRIVE REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH THROUGH SCIENCE-BASED INNOVATION AND THE COMPANY’S SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES WITH THREE PRIORITIES.

•

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION - EXTEND DUPONT’S LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE HIGH-VALUE, SCIENCE-DRIVEN SEGMENTS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD VALUE CHAIN;

•

ADVANCED MATERIALS - STRENGTHEN THE COMPANY’S LEAD AS A PROVIDER OF DIFFERENTIATED, HIGH-VALUE ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS;

•

INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES - BUILD TRANSFORMATIONAL NEW BIO-BASED BUSINESSES BY COMBINING DUPONT’S WORLD LEADING SCIENCE WITH EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES FROM THE ADVANCED MATERIALS AND AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THERE IS A COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH.

RESULTS

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER TAXES INCREASED 16 PERCENT TO $2.9 BILLION. NET SALES OF $35.7 BILLION INCREASED 3 PERCENT DRIVEN BY 5 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME. SALES GREW 6 PERCENT IN DEVELOPING MARKETS, WHICH INCLUDE CHINA, INDIA, AND THE COUNTRIES LOCATED IN LATIN AMERICA, EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND SOUTHEAST ASIA. SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO SALES GROWTH.

ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

SEPARATION OF PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS

ON OCTOBER 24, 2013, DUPONT ANNOUNCED THAT IT INTENDS TO SEPARATE ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT THROUGH A U.S. TAX-FREE SPIN-OFF TO SHAREHOLDERS, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE SEPARATION ABOUT MID-2015.

DIVESTITURE OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS

ON AUGUST 30, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH FLASH BERMUDA CO. LTD., A BERMUDA EXEMPTED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY FORMED BY AFFILIATES OF THE CARLYLE GROUP (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "CARLYLE") IN WHICH CARLYLE AGREED TO PURCHASE CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSETS COMPRISING THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS. IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE SALE WAS COMPLETED RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION ($2.0 BILLION NET OF TAX). THE GAIN WAS RECORDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

ACQUISITION OF DANISCO

IN 2011, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED DANISCO IN A TRANSACTION VALUED AT $6.4 BILLION, PLUS NET DEBT ASSUMED OF $0.6 BILLION.  AS PART OF THIS ACQUISITION, DUPONT INCURRED $85 MILLION IN TRANSACTION RELATED COSTS DURING 2011, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.  IN 2011, THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED FROM DANISCO CONTRIBUTED NET SALES OF $1.7 BILLION AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DUPONT OF $(7) MILLION, WHICH EXCLUDES $30 MILLION AFTER-TAX ($39 MILLION PRE-TAX) OF ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEBT ISSUED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION. DANISCO'S CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED A $125 MILLION AFTER-TAX ($175 MILLION PRE-TAX) CHARGE RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE STEP-UP OF INVENTORIES ACQUIRED AND SOLD DURING 2011.  SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

SALES INCREASED 3 PERCENT, REFLECTING A 5 PERCENT INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE SALES VOLUME WITH GROWTH IN ALL SEGMENTS. LOCAL PRICES WERE 1 PERCENT LOWER PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A 12 PERCENT DECLINE IN PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS PRICES AND A PASS THROUGH OF LOWER PRECIOUS METALS PRICES FOR ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS. NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT REFLECTS A WEAKER BRAZILIAN REAL AND INDIAN RUPEE, PARTLY OFFSET BY A STRONGER EURO. SALES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS OF $11.9 BILLION IMPROVED 7 PERCENT ON 10 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES IN THESE MARKETS INCREASED TO 33 PERCENT FROM 32 PERCENT IN 2012.

THE 2 PERCENT DECLINE IN WORLDWIDE SALES VOLUME PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS HIGHER AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION & HEALTH, AND INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES VOLUME, MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME FOR THE OTHER SEGMENTS COMBINED, PARTICULARLY PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS.  HIGHER LOCAL PRICES WERE DRIVEN PRINCIPALLY BY INCREASES FOR SEEDS, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, AND SPECIALTY POLYMERS.  CURRENCY EFFECT PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE WEAKER EURO AND BRAZILIAN REAL.

SALES GROWTH WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY HIGHER GLOBAL SEED PRICES AND VOLUMES, INCREASED GLOBAL INSECTICIDE AND FUNGICIDE VOLUMES, AND THE BENEFIT OF INCREASED OWNERSHIP IN PANNAR SEED (PTY) LTD, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY NEGATIVE CURRENCY.  GROWTH IN SEEDS REFLECTS STRONG CORN SALES IN NORTH AMERICA AND BRAZIL. INCREASED INSECTICIDE VOLUMES WERE DRIVEN BY DEMAND FOR RYNAXYPYR

®

, PARTICULARLY IN LATIN AMERICA TO COMBAT HEAVY INSECT PRESSURE, WHILE FUNGICIDE VOLUME INCREASES WERE LED BY DEMAND FOR PICOXYTSTROBIN IN NORTH AMERICA AND LATIN AMERICA.

2013 PTOI AND PTOI MARGIN INCREASED ON SALES GROWTH, LOWER CHARGES INCURRED RELATED TO IMPRELIS

HERBICIDE CLAIMS, AND EARLIER SEED SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SEED INPUT COSTS OF ABOUT $350 MILLION, $108 MILLION OF NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT, AND THE ABSENCE OF A $117 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUSINESS RECORDED IN 2012. AS A RESULT OF THE EARLIER TIMING OF SEED SHIPMENTS, REPRESENTING EARLIER SEED SHIPMENTS FOR THE BRAZIL SAFRINHA CORN SEASON ENABLED BY RECENT INVESTMENTS AND EARLIER DIRECT SEED SHIPMENTS TO NORTH AMERICAN FARMERS, APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF PTOI WAS REALIZED IN 2013 VERSUS 2014.

FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT NOT RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANIES DO NOT CALCULATE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THE SAME MANNER AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S FREE CASH FLOW DEFINITION MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGIES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND THEREFORE INDICATES OPERATING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND IS AN INTEGRAL FINANCIAL MEASURE USED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ARE TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MEASURING THE COST AND BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY AS OF DECEMBER 31

ST

. THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS APPROPRIATE. AS PERMITTED BY GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PLAN'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS, THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT 77 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BENEFIT PLANS IN THE U.S.  IN THE U.S. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE, APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY, AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

WITHIN THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERAT

ION. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD

DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED R

ETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.

IN DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS RATHER THAN ITS FAIR VALUE. THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS IS CALCULATED BY AVERAGING MARKET RETURNS OVER 36 MONTHS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY BE A LAG IN RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A

RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE.  THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $458 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.  AS REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP PRECISE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS)

AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.  THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS.  THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ACCRUALS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT AND STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS, SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR MATTER.  PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES.  IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS.  THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED, INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING THE MATTER THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND THE MATTER'S CURRENT STATUS.  CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION ACCRUAL WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A COURT PROCEEDING.  IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF, BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNED ON APPEAL.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION MATTERS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

INCOME TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING TAXES THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S TAX ASSETS AND TAX LIABILITIES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES OR DECREASES THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE COMPANY HAD A DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE OF $6.4 BILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $1.8 BILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ASSETS.  SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE.

VALUATION OF ASSETS

THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE MEASURED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED, INCLUDING IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES, IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. THE DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF FAIR VALUE TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS BASED ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND VALUATION METHODOLOGIES REQUIRING CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATES BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION, CURRENT MARKET DATA AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED IN THE COMPANY'S VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES, OPERATING MARGIN ESTIMATES, ROYALTY RATES, AND DISCOUNT RATES. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATES WERE DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION, THOSE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S NORMAL ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS.  TESTING FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME.  THE DYNAMIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES OPERATE, AND KEY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTED SELLING PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS.  ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  CHANGES IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIME IN WHICH SUCH IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS TO ENSURE THEY ARE ACHIEVING THEIR GREATEST POTENTIAL AND ARE ALIGNED WITH THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY. STRATEGIC DECISIONS INVOLVING A PARTICULAR GROUP OF ASSETS MAY TRIGGER AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE RELATED ASSETS. SUCH AN ASSESSMENT COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. DURING 2013, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $129 MILLION TO WRITE-DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET GROUP TO FAIR VALUE.  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THIS CHARGE.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN 2013, NO IMPAIRMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS USING THE INCOME APPROACH BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  THE INCOME APPROACH HAS BEEN GENERALLY SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL MARKET TRANSACTION ANALYSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FORECASTED CASH FLOW AND REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH RATES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF THE ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UTILIZED ARE BOTH REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES (OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS). APPROXIMATELY 77 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS. PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE PENSION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.

THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE U.S. ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS, BUT RECEIVE BENEFITS IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS' ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. IN JANUARY 2012, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $500 MILLION TO ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS

WERE MADE IN 2011 OR 2013. NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2014. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN BEYOND 2014; HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF ANY CONTRIBUTIONS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS.  U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $313 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS IN 2013 AND ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL MAKE APPROXIMATELY $344 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2014 TO PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRE-TAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $207 MILLION, $261 MILLION AND $312 MILLION FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $224 MILLION IN 2014. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS REFLECT THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS, DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER 2012, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS U.S. PARENT COMPANY RETIREE MEDICAL AND DENTAL PLANS FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. BEGINNING IN 2013, THE COMPANY REPLACED THE COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMPANY SPONSORED PLANS WITH A NEW COMPANY-FUNDED HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENT (HRA). MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE PLAN PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED IN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH PLANS IN THE OPEN MARKET AND THE COMPANY WILL REIMBURSE THEIR HEALTH CARE EXPENSES WITH AN HRA BASED ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMENDED PLANS. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE WAS REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION AND $46 MILLION IN 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. FOR 2014, THE PLAN AMENDMENT IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE CHANGES IN THE PLANS NOTED ABOVE IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CHARGES RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $5, $74 AND $72 FOR 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ABOVE CHARGES FOR PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2013 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RETIREE MEDICAL AND DENTAL PLAN AMENDMENT IN 2012 AND THE PERFORMANCE COATINGS SALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DISCOUNT RATES. SEE "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" UNDER THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE 30 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE COMPANY'S KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND THE DISCOUNT RATE (SEE NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2014, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE BY ABOUT $440 MILLION DUE TO HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED PENSION ASSET RETURNS DURING 2013.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, PRODUCT HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  SUCH RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY THE IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY, AND THE COMPANY MONITORS THESE CHANGES CLOSELY.  COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTS VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, MINIMIZE THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WATER USE AND DISCHARGES, INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS.  MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A GLOBAL UPWARD TREND IN THE AMOUNT AND COMPLEXITY OF PROPOSED CHEMICALS REGULATION.  THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ENVIRONMENTAL OPERATING COSTS

AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY INCURS COSTS FOR POLLUTION ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROLS AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT, EMISSIONS TESTING AND MONITORING, AND OBTAINING PERMITS. THE COMPANY ALSO INCURS COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD AND TREATMENT STUDIES AS WELL AS TOXICITY AND DEGRADATION TESTING TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PRODUCTS AND RAW MATERIALS.

LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA OR SUPERFUND) OR SIMILAR STATE LAWS AT ABOUT 420 SITES AROUND THE U.S., WITH ACTIVE REMEDIATION UNDER WAY AT APPROXIMATELY 165 OF THESE SITES.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED ITS LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 175 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN "DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS" WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANY'S, REPRESENTED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT FIVE NEW SITES DURING

2013

COMPARED WITH FIVE AND SIX SIMILAR NOTICES IN

2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS, AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

.  HOWEVER, BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY LOSS, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ACCRUED, RELATED TO REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT ANY INDIVIDUAL SITE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

IN

2013

, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $115 MILLION IN

2014.

IN THE U.S., ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA).  UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

CLIMATE CHANGE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE THAT PRESENTS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES. EXPANDING UPON SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTIONS MADE IN THE PERIOD 1990-2004, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT ACHIEVING IN 2012 REDUCTIONS OF 25 PERCENT IN GHG EMISSIONS AND 12 PERCENT IN WATER CONSUMPTION VERSUS OUR 2004 BASELINES. IN ADDITION, IN 2012 THE COMPANY ACHIEVED A ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN ENERGY INTENSITY FROM NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES VERSUS A 2010 BASELINE. THE COMPANY CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED DEMANDS OF A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY.  ABOUT $2 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S 2012 REVENUE WAS GENERATED FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT HELP DIRECT AND DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS.

THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC POLICIES TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AND ENCOURAGE LOWER CARBON FORMS OF ENERGY. SUCH POLICIES MAY BRING HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AS WELL AS GREATER REVENUE AND MARGIN OPPORTUNITIES.

LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CONTROL OR LIMIT GHG EMISSIONS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ENERGY SOURCE AND SUPPLY CHOICES AS WELL AS INCREASE THE COST OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM FOSSIL FUELS. SUCH EFFORTS ARE ALSO ANTICIPATED TO PROVIDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THE REGULATORY FUTURE, HELP GUIDE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND DRIVE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR LOW-CARBON AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO GROW FOR PRODUCTS THAT FACILITATE ADAPTATION TO A CHANGING CLIMATE.

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

AT THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL, THERE ARE EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS GHG EMISSIONS.  SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ARE REGULATED UNDER THE EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME.

CHINA HAS BEGUN PILOT PROGRAMS FOR TRADING OF GHG EMISSIONS IN SELECTED AREAS AND SOUTH KOREA WILL BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT ITS EMISSION TRADING SCHEME IN 2015.  IN THE EU, U.S. AND JAPAN, POLICY EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH GASES USED IN REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING CREATE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER GHG SOLUTIONS.

THE CURRENT UNSETTLED POLICY ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.S. ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY TO BUSINESS DECISIONS PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. IF IN THE ABSENCE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION, STATES WERE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS MANDATING GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS, THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS COULD BE COMPETITIVELY DISADVANTAGED BY THE ADDED COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH A VARIETY OF STATE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

IN 2010, EPA LAUNCHED A PHASED-IN SCHEME TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS FIRST FROM LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES UNDER THE EXISTING CLEAN AIR ACT PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. AS A RESULT, LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO INSTALL BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY ON MAJOR NEW OR MODIFIED SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS.  THIS TYPE OF GHG EMISSIONS REGULATION BY EPA, IN THE ABSENCE OF OR IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL LEGISLATION, COULD RESULT IN MORE COSTLY, LESS EFFICIENT FACILITY-BY-FACILITY CONTROLS VERSUS A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT INCORPORATES POLICIES THAT PROVIDE AN ECONOMIC BALANCE THAT DOES NOT SEVERELY DISTORT MARKETS.  DIFFERENCES IN REGIONAL OR NATIONAL LEGISLATION COULD PRESENT CHALLENGES IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR COORDINATED GLOBAL POLICY ACTION.

IN 2013 EPA PROPOSED MORE STRINGENT REGULATIONS FOR NEW ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGU'S) THAT MAY AFFECT THE LONG TERM PRICE AND SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY. THE PRECISE IMPACT IS UNCERTAIN.

PFOA

THE PERFORMANCE CH

EMICALS SEGMENT USED A FORM OF PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT) AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE SOME FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS.  THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT USED PFOA IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS FOR PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS (AND SOME FLUOROELASTOMERS).  IN THE FALL OF 2002, DUPONT BEGAN PRODUCING RATHER THAN PURCHASING PFOA TO SUPPORT THESE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.  PFOA IS NOT USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FLUOROTELOMERS; HOWEVER, IT IS AN UNINTENDED BY-PRODUCT PRESENT AT TRACE LEVELS IN SOME FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS.

PFOA IS BIO-PERSISTENT AND HAS BEEN DETECTED AT VERY LOW LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPOSURE ROUTES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF PFOA.  REGULATORY AGENCIES CONTINUE TO REVIEW THESE STUDIES TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL REGULATION.

IN JANUARY 2006, DUPONT PLEDGED ITS COMMITMENT TO EPA'S 2010/15 PFOA STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM.  THE EPA PROGRAM ASKS PARTICIPANTS (1) TO COMMIT TO ACHIEVE, NO LATER THAN 2010, A 95 PERCENT REDUCTION IN BOTH FACILITY EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT CONTENT LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS AND (2) TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE ELIMINATION OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY NO LATER THAN 2015.  DUPONT HAS EXCEEDED THE EPA'S 2010 OBJECTIVE. IN FEBRUARY 2007, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS COMMITMENT TO NO LONGER MAKE, USE OR BUY PFOA BY 2015, OR SOONER IF POSSIBLE.

AS OF THE FOURTH QUARTER 2013, DUPONT HAD ALREADY CEASED THE MANUFACTURE OF PFOA AND DISCONTINUED THE USE OF PFOA FOR PRODUCTION OF FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AS WELL AS FOR RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS AND FLUOROELASTOMERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS IN REPLACING FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS WITH ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING PFOA MATTERS, SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE DERIVATIVES AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACTS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2013

,

2012

, AND

2011

, AND INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S PRO RATA SHARE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES' EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES AND CORRESPONDING GAINS AND LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE USD AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, AND THE EFFECT ON FAIR VALUES OF A HYPOTHETICAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE MARKET PRICES OR RATES THAT EXISTED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

. THE SENSITIVITY FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS BASED ON A ONE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE MARKET INTEREST RATE. FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS SENSITIVITIES ARE BASED ON A 10 PERCENT CHANGE IN MARKET RATES.

SINCE THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE FOR EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD BE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER.  AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE REPRESENTED MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC, INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY INDUSTRY AND REGION.

THESE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ALSO GIVE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN SUCH REPORTS IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO MANAGEMENT TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES.

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) AND ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP. THEIR REPORT IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

I.

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

II.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

III.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITIONS, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES MAY CAUSE VARIATION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

. BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT AND THOSE CRITERIA, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, HAS AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A) (2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(1992) ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN "MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING" APPEARING ON PAGE F-2.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2013,  THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF VALUING INVENTORY HELD AT A MAJORITY OF ITS FOREIGN AND CERTAIN U.S. LOCATIONS FROM THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD TO THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY METHOD.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS OF VIES FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING THAT ARE VIES.  THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIES DOES NOT PROVIDE IT THE POWER TO DIRECT THE VIES SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES.  FUTURE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THESE VIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE COMPANY BECOMES THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS RELATED TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES IS NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR'S DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR'S PRESENTATION, INCLUDING SEPARATELY STATING COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES ON THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2012, THE COMPANY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS (WHICH REPRESENTED A REPORTABLE SEGMENT).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS FROM CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MAY NOT EQUAL THE TOTAL COMPANY EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS DUE TO ROUNDING. THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 ARE PRESENTED AS HELD FOR SALE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO PERFORMANCE COATINGS HAVE NOT BEEN SEGREGATED AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. AMOUNTS RELATED TO PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED IN OR EXCLUDED FROM THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM AND PERIOD OF EACH DISCLOSURE.

IN NOVEMBER 2013, DUPONT ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL GLASS LAMINATING SOLUTIONS/VINYLS (GLS/VINYLS). THE ASSETS RELATED TO GLS/VINYLS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 ARE PRESENTED AS HELD FOR SALE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE SALE OF GLS/VINYLS DOES NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, EARNINGS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THE ABOVE MATTERS.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE FROM THE SALE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED, COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND PRICING IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD FOB (FREE ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO NON UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.) CUSTOMERS, AN EQUIVALENT BASIS.  ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT AND RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE (CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES) OR DEBT, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE, OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CU

STOMER.

LICENSING AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS DETERMINED USING LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 INPUTS WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE COMPANY HELD

$5,116

AND

$0

OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HELD

$2,256

AND

$2,026

OF OTHER CASH EQUIVALENTS (LEVEL 2 MEASUREMENTS) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

BASED ON OBSERVED NET ASSET VALUES AND CURRENT INTEREST RATES FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENTS WITH COMPARABLE CREDIT RISK AND TIME TO MATURITY, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES ITS STATED VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

AND

2012.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN

THREE

MONTHS AND UP TO

TWELVE

MONTHS AT TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED COST.  THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE INVESTMENTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WAS ESTABLISHED THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT'S LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FOR ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 1

–

QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2

–

SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G. QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ITEMS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ITEMS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND YIELD CURVES, AND MARKET-CORROBORATED INPUTS);

LEVEL 3

–

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

INVENTORIES

THE COMPANY'S INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.  ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

INVENTORIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FIFO METHOD ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS WITH SHORTER SHELF LIVES SUCH AS SEEDS, CERTAIN FOOD-INGREDIENTS AND ENZYMES.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2013, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF VALUING INVENTORY HELD AT A MAJORITY OF ITS FOREIGN AND CERTAIN U.S. LOCATIONS FROM THE LIFO METHOD TO THE AVERAGE COST METHOD. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE AVERAGE COST METHOD IS PREFERABLE TO THE LIFO METHOD AS IT MORE CLEARLY ALIGNS WITH HOW THE COMPANY ACTUALLY MANAGES ITS INVENTORY AND WILL IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING BY BETTER MATCHING REVENUES AND EXPENSES, FOR THESE INVENTORIES. IN ADDITION, THE CHANGE FROM LIFO TO AVERAGE COST WILL ENHANCE THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WITH OUR PEER COMPANIES. AS DESCRIBED IN THE GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES, THE COMPARATIVE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF PRIOR PERIODS ARE ADJUSTED TO APPLY THE NEW ACCOUNTING METHOD RETROSPECTIVELY.

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE FUTURE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARISING FROM OTHER ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIED AND SEPARATELY RECOGNIZED. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES.

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED AND LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

20

YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSET ARE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE WHICH IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR USE UNTIL THEIR DISPOSAL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR MARKET VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. DEPRECIATION IS DISCONTINUED FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS (PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF EMPLOYEE COSTS, MATERIALS, CONTRACT SERVICES, RESEARCH AGREEMENTS, AND OTHER EXTERNAL SPEND) RELATING TO THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, ENHANCEMENT OF EXISTING PRODUCTS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE, THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

25

YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, VEHICLE LIABILITY AND EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.

FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF RELEVANT RISKS.  A RECEIVABLE FOR AN INSURANCE RECOVERY IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LOSS HAS OCCURRED AND COLLECTION IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET, UNDER OTHER INCOME, NET. INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE U.S. DOLLAR OR LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, WHERE APPLICABLE. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE U.S. DOLLAR (USD) IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES AND THE RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN EQUITY. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE REMEASURED INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD AND THE RESULTANT EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD.

HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET IN THE INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT OR AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION MATURES, OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AND THE DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE.

CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EITHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. CASH FLOWS FROM ALL OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 20 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

EACH YEAR THE COMPANY FILES HUNDREDS OF TAX RETURNS IN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXING JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND POSSIBLE CHALLENGE BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES. POSITIONS CHALLENGED BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED OR APPEALED BY THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES OR DECREASES THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT CLASS INCLUDES AFFECTED PROPERTY OWNERS AND LAWN CARE COMPANIES WHO DO NOT "OPT OUT" OF THE SETTLEMENT. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, DUPONT HAS PAID

$7

IN PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, DUPONT IS PROVIDING A WARRANTY AGAINST NEW DAMAGE, IF ANY, CAUSED BY THE USE OF IMPRELIS

HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED.

PFOA

DUPONT USED PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT), AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE SOME FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN WEST VIRGINIA. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

RELATED TO THE PFOA MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE ACCRUAL INCLUDES CHARGES RELATED TO DUPONT'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND VOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS TO THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.  THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE SURVEYING, SAMPLING AND TESTING DRINKING WATER IN AND AROUND CERTAIN COMPANY SITES AND OFFERING TREATMENT OR AN ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER IF TESTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF PFOA IN DRINKING WATER AT OR GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY.

DRINKING WATER ACTIONS

IN AUGUST 2001, A CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED LEACH V DUPONT, WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT ALLEGING THAT RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR THE WASHINGTON WORKS FACILITY HAD SUFFERED, OR MAY SUFFER, DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER.

DUPONT AND ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN 2004 THAT BINDS ABOUT

80,000

RESIDENTS. IN 2005, DUPONT PAID THE PLAINTIFFS’ ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES OF

$23

AND MADE A PAYMENT OF

, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY HEALTH PROJECT.  THE COMPANY FUNDED A SERIES OF HEALTH STUDIES WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2012 BY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS (THE “C8 SCIENCE PANEL”). THE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY PROBABLE LINK EXISTS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE.

THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL FOUND PROBABLE LINKS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, INCLUDING PREECLAMPSIA; KIDNEY CANCER; TESTICULAR CANCER; THYROID DISEASE; ULCERATIVE COLITIS; AND DIAGNOSED HIGH CHOLESTEROL.

IN MAY 2013, A PANEL OF THREE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL DOCTORS RELEASED ITS INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OF ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS. THE MEDICAL PANEL IS EXPECTED TO ADDRESS MONITORING AND MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN A SUBSEQUENT REPORT. THE MEDICAL PANEL HAS NOT COMMUNICATED ITS ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETION. THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO FUND UP TO

$235

FOR A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS.  IN JANUARY 2012, THE COMPANY PUT

$1

IN AN ESCROW ACCOUNT TO FUND MEDICAL MONITORING AS REQUIRED BY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE COURT HAS APPOINTED A MEDICAL MONITORING DIRECTOR TO IMPLEMENT THE MEDICAL PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS WHO IS IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP A PROGRAM.  TESTING HAS NOT YET BEGUN AND NO MONEY HAS BEEN DISBURSED FROM THE FUND.  WHILE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO FUNDING THE MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM, SUCH LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING IMPLEMENTATION.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WATER TREATMENT DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PFOA IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER DISTRICTS, INCLUDING THE LITTLE HOCKING WATER ASSOCIATION (LHWA), AND PRIVATE WELL USERS.

18.  LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY OFFERS VARIOUS LONG-TERM BENEFITS TO ITS EMPLOYEES. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE THE PLANS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS

THE COMPANY HAS BOTH FUNDED AND UNFUNDED NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING A MAJORITY OF THE U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2007.  THE BENEFITS UNDER THESE PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. THE COMPANY'S FUNDING POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH PLANS ARE FUNDED BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH TRUSTEES, COVERED BY INSURANCE CONTRACTS, OR REMAIN UNFUNDED.

OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE PARENT COMPANY AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. THE ASSOCIATED PLANS FOR RETIREE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM COMPANY FUNDS. ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COST AND LIABILITIES FOR THESE RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY PLANS. THE NON-MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS CONTRIBUTORY WITH PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS' CONTRIBUTIONS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY TO ACHIEVE A 50/50 TARGET SHARING OF COST INCREASES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. IN ADDITION, LIMITS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF THE RETIREE MEDICAL COST COVERAGE.  FOR MEDICARE ELIGIBLE PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS THE COMPANY PROVIDES A COMPANY-FUNDED HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENT (HRA). BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015, ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE ON AND AFTER THAT DATE WILL RECEIVE THE SAME ONE-TIME LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PAYMENT, REGARDLESS OF AGE. THE MAJORITY OF U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES DISABILITY BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE DISABILITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE INSURED IN MANY COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., SUCH PLANS ARE GENERALLY SELF-INSURED. OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSES FOR SELF-INSURED PLANS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIGURES BELOW.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLANNED SALE OF THE PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS (SEE NOTE 2), THE COMPANY UPDATED THE DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS DURING 2012.

IN THE U.S., THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IN THE U.S. WAS SELECTED FROM WITHIN THE REASONABLE RANGE OF RATES DETERMINED BY HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.  FOR NON-U.S. PLANS, ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY.

PLAN ASSETS

ALL PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. ARE INVESTED THROUGH A SINGLE MASTER TRUST FUND. THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THIS TRUST FUND IS SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT, REFLECTING THE RESULTS OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSET LIABILITY MODELING. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GUIDING U.S. PENSION ASSET INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE THOSE EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE "PRUDENT EXPERT" STANDARD AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET LIABILITY STUDIES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCESS. U.S. PLAN ASSETS AND A PORTION OF NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. THE REMAINING ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT FIRMS UNRELATED TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S PENSION INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DISCRETION TO MANAGE THE ASSETS WITHIN ESTABLISHED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES APPROVED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, PENSION TRUST FUNDS ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS "DERIVATIVES." DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS, HEDGE CURRENCY AND ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE TARGET ALLOCATION FOR PLAN ASSETS OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLAN IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY'S RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN (THE PLAN), WHICH REFLECTS THE 2009 MERGER OF THE RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN AND THE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN. THIS PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE RETIREMENT SAVINGS BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

100 PERCENT

OF THE FIRST

6 PERCENT

OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION ELECTION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES

3 PERCENT

OF EACH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE'S ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION.

IN APRIL 2011, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO THE DUPONT EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP). THE EIP PROVIDES FOR EQUITY-BASED AND CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AND CONSULTANTS. UNDER THE AMENDED EIP, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR THE GRANT OR SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS IS

110 MILLION

SHARES, PROVIDED THAT EACH SHARE IN EXCESS OF

30 MILLION

THAT IS ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD THAT IS NOT AN OPTION OR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE

110 MILLION

SHARE LIMIT AS FOUR AND ONE-HALF SHARES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

, APPROXIMATELY

51 MILLION

SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE COMPANY'S EIP. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (PSUS) WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK.

THE COMPANY'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, RSUS AND PSUS AND MAY AUTHORIZE NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE EXERCISE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2004 EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT; OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2008 SERIALLY VESTED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND CARRY A

SIX

-YEAR OPTION TERM. STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED BETWEEN 2009 AND 2013 EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. THE PLAN ALLOWS RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO RETAIN ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING GRANT DATE.

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AWARDS, THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE ASSUMPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN

RSUS AND PSUS

THE COMPANY ISSUES RSUS THAT SERIALLY VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND, UPON VESTING, CONVERT ONE-FOR-ONE TO DUPONT COMMON STOCK. A RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE RETAINS ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE. ADDITIONAL RSUS ARE ALSO GRANTED PERIODICALLY TO KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. THESE RSUS GENERALLY VEST OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM

TWO

TO

FIVE

YEARS. THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL STOCK-SETTLED RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT DATE.

THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTS PSUS TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP. IN

, THERE WERE

313,324

PSUS GRANTED. VESTING FOR PSUS GRANTED IN

2011

,

2012

20.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS.  THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS TO BE UTILIZED FOR FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT. THESE PROGRAMS REFLECT VARYING LEVELS OF EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK.

DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS HAVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS AND ARE APPROVED BY THE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED ARE FORWARDS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES ALSO ADDRESS COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, LIMITS AND ROUTINE EXPOSURE MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES COLLATERAL SUPPORT ANNEX AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSSES. THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS AND THEREFORE NO MATERIAL LOSS IS EXPECTED.  MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.  THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR.  INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS COPPER, CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.  THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME DEBT INSTRUMENTS WERE ISSUED.  ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THESE HEDGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FORWARDS AND OPTIONS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS, TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND AGRICULTURE COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

WHILE EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD, MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR PERIOD.  CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE AFTER-TAX EFFECT OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ON ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ARE MINIMIZED.  THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING; HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INTENDS TO ACHIEVE A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY UTILIZED CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON LONG-TERM INTERCOMPANY LOANS. THESE SWAPS MATURED DURING 2013.

IN 2012, THE COMPANY INITIATED A PROGRAM TO UTILIZE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE NET EXPOSURE RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.
