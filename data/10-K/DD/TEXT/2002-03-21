TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

DUPONT WAS FOUNDED IN 1802 AND WAS INCORPORATED

IN DELAWARE IN 1915. DUPONT IS A WORLD LEADER IN SCIENCE AND

TECHNOLOGY IN A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES INCLUDING HIGH-PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS, SYNTHETIC FIBERS, ELECTRONICS, SPECIALTY CHEMICALS,

AGRICULTURE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBALLY

THROUGH SOME 22 STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNITS. WITHIN THE STRATEGIC

BUSINESS UNITS, A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED FOR

DISTRIBUTION AND SALE TO MANY DIFFERENT MARKETS, INCLUDING THE

TRANSPORTATION, TEXTILE, CONSTRUCTION, MOTOR VEHICLE,

AGRICULTURAL, HOME FURNISHINGS, MEDICAL, PACKAGING, ELECTRONICS

AND THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH MARKETS.

THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNITS ARE

AGGREGATED INTO EIGHT REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION, NYLON, PERFORMANCE COATINGS &

POLYMERS, PHARMACEUTICALS, PIGMENTS & CHEMICALS, POLYESTER,

SPECIALTY FIBERS, AND SPECIALTY POLYMERS. THE FOLLOWING PAGES,

INCLUDING THOSE PAGES OF EXHIBIT 13 SPECIFICALLY

INCORPORATED HEREIN, PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE ON THESE EIGHT

SEGMENTS. THE COMPANYS NONALIGNED BUSINESSES AND EMBRYONIC

BUSINESSES ARE GROUPED UNDER OTHER. THESE BUSINESSES

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENT OF TOTAL 2001 SEGMENT

SALES AND ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGE 29 OF EXHIBIT 13.

FINANCIAL DATA FOR THE SEGMENTS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 32,

SEGMENT INFORMATION, ON PAGES 71

THROUGH 74 OF EXHIBIT 13.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE OPERATIONS

IN ABOUT 75 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND, AS A RESULT, ABOUT

50 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES ARE MADE TO CUSTOMERS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OF DUPONT

CONDUCT MANUFACTURING, SEED PRODUCTION, OR SELLING ACTIVITIES,

AND SOME ARE DISTRIBUTORS OF PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY THE

COMPANY. TOTAL WORLDWIDE EMPLOYMENT AT YEAR-END 2001 WAS ABOUT

79,000 PEOPLE.

IN FEBRUARY 2002, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE

REALIGNMENT OF ITS BUSINESSES INTO FIVE MARKET- AND

TECHNOLOGY-FOCUSED GROWTH PLATFORMS AND ITS PLANS FOR THE

CREATION OF A TEXTILES AND INTERIORS SUBSIDIARY. THE GROWTH

PLATFORMS ARE: DUPONT ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION

TECHNOLOGIES; DUPONT PERFORMANCE MATERIALS; DUPONT COATINGS

& COLOR TECHNOLOGIES; DUPONT SAFETY & PROTECTION; AND

DUPONT AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION. DUPONT WILL CONSIDER A FULL

RANGE OF OPTIONS TO SEPARATE DUPONT TEXTILES & INTERIORS

FROM THE COMPANY BY YEAR-END 2003, MARKET CONDITIONS PERMITTING.

THE DISCLOSURES CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE TO EXHIBIT 13 REFLECT THE COMPANYS

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS

ON OCTOBER 1, 2001, DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS

WAS SOLD TO THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY. DUPONT RETAINED

ITS INTEREST IN COZAAR® (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM) AND

HYZAAR® (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) BRANDS.

THESE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS WERE DISCOVERED BY DUPONT AND

DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH MERCK & CO. INC.

DUPONT HAS EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED MARKETING RIGHTS FOR

COZAAR® AND HYZAAR® TO MERCK AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH

THE SALE, BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB HAS AGREED TO CONTINUE TO

MANUFACTURE COZAAR® AND HYZAAR® FOR DUPONT AT THE

FORMER DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS MANUFACTURING SITE AT GARDEN CITY,

NEW YORK. EFFECTIVE WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER 2001 RESULTS, THE

PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT REFLECTS ONLY DUPONTS SHARE OF THE

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THIS ONGING COLLABORATION.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1998, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A PLAN TO DIVEST THE

COMPANYS 100 PERCENT-OWNED PETROLEUM BUSINESS, CONOCO

INC. ON OCTOBER 21, 1998, THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN

CONOCO WAS REDUCED TO 69.5 PERCENT FOLLOWING AN INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERING OF CONOCO CLASS A COMMON STOCK. ON

AUGUST 6, 1999, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE PLANNED

DIVESTITURE THROUGH A TAX-FREE SPLIT OFF WHEREBY THE COMPANY

EXCHANGED ITS 436,543,573 SHARES OF CONOCO CLASS B COMMON

STOCK FOR 147,980,872 SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK. THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES

REPORT ITS FORMER PETROLEUM BUSINESS AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

SOURCES OF SUPPLY

THE COMPANY UTILIZES NUMEROUS FIRMS AS WELL AS

INTERNAL SOURCES TO SUPPLY A WIDE RANGE OF RAW MATERIALS,

ENERGY, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT. TO ASSURE

AVAILABILITY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR FUELS

AND MOST RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS. LARGE

VOLUME PURCHASES ARE GENERALLY PROCURED UNDER COMPETITIVELY

PRICED SUPPLY CONTRACTS.

EXCLUDING PIONEER HI-BRED INTERNATIONAL INC. AND

THE NUTRITION & HEALTH BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE PART OF THE

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF

THE PRODUCTION AND SALES IN THE SEGMENTS BUSINESSES IS

DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS.

CURRENT HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK REQUIREMENTS ARE MET BY PURCHASES

FROM MAJOR PETROCHEMICAL COMPANIES. DUPONT PARTICIPATES IN A

JOINT VENTURE WITH EQUISTAR CHEMICALS, LP, WHICH MANUFACTURES

AND SUPPLIES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS

REQUIREMENTS FOR ETHYLENE GLYCOL, A HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK.

PIONEER, WHICH IS IN THE HYBRID SEED INDUSTRY,

HAS SEED PRODUCTION FACILITIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, IN

BOTH THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES. IN THE PRODUCTION OF

ITS PARENT AND COMMERCIAL SEED, PIONEER GENERALLY PROVIDES THE

SEED STOCK, DETASSELING AND ROGUING LABOR, AND CERTAIN OTHER

PRODUCTION INPUTS. THE BALANCE OF THE LABOR, EQUIPMENT, AND

INPUTS ARE SUPPLIED BY INDEPENDENT GROWERS. PIONEER BELIEVES THE

AVAILABILITY OF GROWERS, PARENT SEED STOCK, AND OTHER INPUTS

NECESSARY TO PRODUCE ITS COMMERCIAL SEED IS ADEQUATE FOR PLANNED

PRODUCTION LEVELS. THE PRINCIPAL RISK IN THE PRODUCTION OF SEED

IS THE ENVIRONMENT, WITH WEATHER BEING THE SINGLE LARGEST

VARIANT. PIONEER LESSENS THIS RISK BY DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTION

ACROSS MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. DUE TO ITS GLOBAL

PRESENCE, THE COMPANY CAN ENGAGE IN SEED PRODUCTION YEAR-ROUND.

PRODUCTION IN THE NUTRITION & HEALTH BUSINESSES IS PRIMARILY

DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF SOY FLAKE, WHICH IS READILY

AVAILABLE FROM MANY SOURCES.

AND SUPPLIES FOR THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IN 2001

IN ADDITION, DURING 2001, THE COMPANY CONSUMED

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR ENERGY.

DUPONT HAS CONTRACTED WITH COMPUTER SCIENCES

CORPORATION (CSC) AND ACCENTURE LLP TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES

FOR THE COMPANY. CSC OPERATES A MAJORITY OF DUPONTS GLOBAL

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURES AND PROVIDES

SELECTED APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE SERVICES. ACCENTURE LLP

PROVIDES INFORMATION SYSTEMS SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE

DUPONTS MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND

CUSTOMER SERVICE.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PATENT AND

TRADEMARK ESTATE PROVIDES IT WITH AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE AND HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ATTORNEYS AND

LICENSING PROFESSIONALS TO PROCURE, MAINTAIN AND PROTECT ITS

ESTATE.

THE COMPANY OWNS AND IS LICENSED UNDER VARIOUS

PATENTS, WHICH EXPIRE FROM TIME TO TIME, COVERING MANY PRODUCTS,

PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USES. THESE PATENTS PROTECT MANY ASPECTS

OF THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH PROGRAM AND THE

PROPRIETARY GOODS AND SERVICES IT SELLS. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION

AFFORDED BY THESE PATENTS VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND

DEPENDS UPON THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PATENT AS

WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY. THE

COMPANY OWNS OVER 20,000 WORLDWIDE PATENTS AND OVER 14,000

WORLDWIDE PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN 2001, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED

ALMOST 500 U.S. PATENTS AND OVER 1,800 INTERNATIONAL PATENTS.

THE COMPANYS RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS

WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO

THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE AND, TO VARYING DEGREES, IMPORTANT TO

EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

THE U.S. PATENTS COVERING COZAAR® (LOSARTAN

POTASSIUM) AND HYZAAR® (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM,

HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) COMPOUNDS, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION AND

METHODS FOR USE FOR TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION EXPIRE IN 2009.

THE COMPANY HAS EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED MARKETING RIGHTS FOR THE

COZAAR® AND HYZAAR® BRANDS TO MERCK & CO.

INC. AS PART OF ITS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH MERCK ON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN OCTOBER 2001, DUPONT

PHARMACEUTICALS WAS SOLD TO THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HOWEVER, DUPONT RETAINED ITS INTERESTS IN

COZAAR® AND HYZAAR®. EFFECTIVE WITH FOURTH QUARTER

2001 RESULTS, THE PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT REFLECTS ONLY THE

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT AND THE ONGOING

COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH MERCK.

THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER AND THE REST OF

THE COMPANIES WITHIN THE SEED INDUSTRY COMPETE IS INCREASINGLY

AFFECTED BY NEW PATENTS, PATENT POSITIONS, PATENT LAWSUITS AND

THE STATUS OF VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OWNERSHIP OF

AND ACCESS TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE

RELATING TO BIOTECHNOLOGY, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PIONEER BUSINESS

AND ITS COMPETITORS. NO SINGLE PATENT OWNED BY PIONEER IS

VITALLY IMPORTANT TO ITS BUSINESS. HOWEVER, PIONEERS

ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE FUTURE MAY BE AFFECTED BY ITS

COMPETITORS INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATING

TO GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS, PARTICULARLY IF THOSE RIGHTS

WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES, AND COMPETITORS DO NOT OFFER

LICENSES ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. SEE THE AGRICULTURE

& NUTRITION SEGMENT REVIEW ON PAGES 13-14 OF THIS

REPORT AND AS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE ON PAGE 4 OF THIS

REPORT TO PAGES 18 TO 20 OF EXHIBIT 13.

THE COMPANY HAS OVER 2,100 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR

ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND HAS OVER 23,000 WORLDWIDE

REGISTRATIONS AND APPLICATIONS FOR THESE TRADEMARKS. OWNERSHIP

RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS ARE

CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED. THE COMPANY HAS A

NUMBER OF TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE

CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL, INCLUDING DUPONT

TM

AND THE

DUPONT OVAL; LYCRA® BRAND PREMIUM STRETCH FIBERS;

STAINMASTER® CARPETS; TEFLON® FLUOROPOLYMERS, FILMS,

FABRIC PROTECTORS, FIBERS, AND DISPERSIONS; CORIAN®

SURFACES; CORDURA® NYLON; COOLMAX® FIBERS;

TACTEL® NYLON; TYVEK® AND KEVLAR® BRANDS

PROTECTIVE MATERIAL; AND PIONEER® BRAND SEEDS. THE COMPANY

IS ACTIVELY PURSUING LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED

TRADEMARKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TEFLON® TRADEMARK HAS BEEN

EXTENDED THROUGH BRAND LICENSING TO PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS,

AUTOMOTIVE CAR CARE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE WIPER BLADES, EYE GLASS

LENSES AND HOME CARE PRODUCTS.

SEASONALITY

SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN THE

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION AND THE PERFORMANCE

COATINGS & POLYMERS SEGMENTS AND, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,

THE NYLON SEGMENT, ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY. THE

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT PERFORMANCE IS

STRONGEST IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. PIONEER GENERALLY

OPERATES AT A LOSS DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE

YEAR, AND DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE SEED BUSINESS,

PIONEERS INVENTORY IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE END OF

THE CALENDAR YEAR AND IS SOLD DOWN IN THE FIRST AND SECOND

QUARTERS. TRADE RECEIVABLES IN THE AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION SEGMENT ARE AT A LOW POINT AT YEAR-END AND INCREASE

THROUGH THE SELLING SEASON TO PEAK AT THE END OF THE SECOND

QUARTER. PERFORMANCE COATINGS & POLYMERS SALES REFLECT

SEASONAL PATTERNS RELATED TO MOTOR VEHICLE BUILDS AND

AFTER-MARKET REFINISHING, AND NYLONS FLOORING BUSINESSES

ARE SOMEWHAT AFFECTED BY THE SEASONALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION

INDUSTRY, WHICH EXPERIENCES ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF ACTIVITY DURING

THE SUMMER MONTHS.

IN GENERAL, BUSINESSES IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS

ARE NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS.

MARKETING

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PIONEER BUSINESS, MOST

PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH DUPONTS SALES

FORCE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME REGIONS, MORE EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON

SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. IN NORTH AMERICA, THE MAJORITY OF

PIONEER® BRAND SEED IS MARKETED THROUGH INDEPENDENT SALES

REPRESENTATIVES. IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL CORN BELT,

SEED PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN MARKETED THROUGH DEALERS AND

DISTRIBUTORS WHO HANDLE OTHER AGRICULTURAL SUPPLIES. PIONEER

PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA THROUGH A NETWORK OF

SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES, AND INDEPENDENT

PRODUCER-DISTRIBUTORS.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANYS SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY

DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. THE

NYLON, POLYESTER, AND PERFORMANCE COATINGS & POLYMERS

SEGMENTS, HOWEVER, HAVE SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS IN THEIR

RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THESE SEGMENTS

OPERATING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

BUSINESSES IN DUPONTS EIGHT REPORTABLE

SEGMENTS COMPETE ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE, PRODUCT

QUALITY OR SPECIFICATIONS, CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY, CUSTOMER

SERVICE AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICULAR MARKET INVOLVED.

PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS FOR ALL SEGMENTS INCLUDE

MAJOR CHEMICAL COMPANIES BASED IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND

ASIA, PRINCIPALLY JAPAN, CHINA AND KOREA. COMPETITORS OFFER A

COMPARABLE RANGE OF PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL, COMMODITY AND

SPECIALTY CHEMICALS TO PLASTICS AND FIBERS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY

ALSO COMPETES IN CERTAIN PRODUCT MARKETS WITH SMALLER, MORE

SPECIALIZED FIRMS AND WITH PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS IN

OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES.

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING CROP PROTECTION

CHEMICALS, THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT ALSO

SELLS HYBRID SEEDS THROUGH PIONEER, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE GLOBAL

PRODUCTION OF CORN AND SOYBEANS, AND THUS DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH

OTHER HYBRID SEED SUPPLIERS. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

ALSO PROVIDES SOY-BASED FOOD INGREDIENTS AND FOOD SAFETY

EQUIPMENT IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR GRAIN AND FOOD

PROCESSORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH IN THE UNITED

STATES AT OVER 40 SITES IN 18 STATES AT EITHER

DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR MANUFACTURING PLANTS. THE

HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF RESEARCH IS CARRIED OUT AT SEVERAL OF

THE COMPANYS LARGE RESEARCH CENTERS IN AND AROUND

WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. AMONG THESE, THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION

LABORATORIES ENGAGE IN EXPLORATORY AND APPLIED RESEARCH, THE

CHESTNUT RUN LABORATORIES FOCUS ON APPLICATIONS RESEARCH, AND

THE STINE-HASKELL RESEARCH CENTER CONDUCTS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT

RESEARCH AND TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON COMPANY PRODUCTS TO

ASSURE THEY ARE SAFE FOR MANUFACTURE AND USE. IN ADDITION,

PIONEER CARRIES OUT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO DEVELOP HYBRIDS

OF CORN, SORGHUM AND SUNFLOWER, AND VARIETIES OF SOYBEAN,

ALFALFA, WHEAT, AND CANOLA FOR WORLDWIDE MARKETS. PIONEER

OPERATES MORE THAN 90 PRIMARY RESEARCH LOCATIONS, WITH ITS

LARGEST CENTER IN JOHNSTON, IOWA. HYBRIDS AND VARIETIES ARE

DEVELOPED AT THESE PRIMARY RESEARCH LOCATIONS AND TESTED AT

THOUSANDS OF OTHER LOCATIONS.

DUPONT ALSO OPERATES A NUMBER OF RESEARCH

FACILITIES AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN

COUNTRIES SUCH AS BELGIUM, CANADA, FRANCE, GERMANY, JAPAN,

LUXEMBOURG, MEXICO, THE NETHERLANDS, SPAIN, SWITZERLAND AND THE

UNITED KINGDOM, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS GLOBAL INTERESTS.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE TO DISCOVER NEW PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN RELEVANT FIELDS AND TO IMPROVE

EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES. EACH STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNIT OF

THE COMPANY FUNDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT

ITS BUSINESS MISSION.

THE CENTRAL RESEARCH LABORATORIES ARE RESPONSIBLE

FOR ASSURING THAT LEADING-EDGE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONCEPTS

ARE IDENTIFIED AND DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE DUPONT TECHNICAL

COMMUNITY. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE

COORDINATED BY SENIOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT

THROUGH A CORPORATE TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT TECHNICAL

ACTIVITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH BUSINESS AND CORPORATE PLANS, AND

THAT THE CORE TECHNICAL COMPETENCIES UNDERLYING DUPONTS

CURRENT AND FUTURE BUSINESSES REMAIN HEALTHY AND CONTINUE TO

PROVIDE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN

CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE

ACCURATE OR WILL BE REALIZED. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS

DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS IN THE COMPANYS LATEST ANNUAL REPORT, THE

FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THE

COMPANYS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE

PROJECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.



THE COMPANY OPERATES IN APPROXIMATELY

	75 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVES ABOUT HALF OF ITS

	REVENUES FROM SALES INSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND ABOUT HALF

	FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE,

	GOVERNMENTAL AND QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

	CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH THE

	COMPANY OPERATES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND

	PROFITABILITY IN THAT COUNTRY. ALSO, THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

	AND PROFITABILITY IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY COULD BE AFFECTED BY

	POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS ON A DOMESTIC, COUNTRY

	SPECIFIC OR GLOBAL LEVEL FROM TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND THE

	RESPONSE TO SUCH ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC FACTORS

	(INCLUDING A DECLINE IN U.S. OR EUROPEAN SALES FROM SLOWING

	ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THOSE REGIONS, INFLATION OR FLUCTUATIONS IN

	INTEREST AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES) AND COMPETITIVE

	FACTORS (SUCH AS GREATER PRICE COMPETITION OR EXPIRATION OF

	PATENT PROTECTION) IN THOSE COUNTRIES COULD AFFECT THE

	COMPANYS REVENUES, EXPENSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

	



THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GROW EARNINGS WILL

	BE AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS,

	PARTICULARLY OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM OIL AND

	NATURAL GAS. THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE

	EFFECTS OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES OR

	PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

	



THE COMPANYS GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY

	DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS

	AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET. THIS ABILITY MAY BE

	ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT

	DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO: IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW

	PRODUCTS; SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; OBTAIN

	RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS; OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL

	PROPERTY PROTECTION; OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW

ITEM 3.     LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

IN 1991, DUPONT BEGAN RECEIVING CLAIMS BY GROWERS

THAT USE OF BENLATE® 50 DF FUNGICIDE HAD CAUSED CROP

DAMAGE. DUPONT SINCE HAS BEEN SERVED WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED

LAWSUITS, MOST OF WHICH WERE DISPOSED OF BY TRIAL, DISMISSAL OR

SETTLEMENT. APPROXIMATELY 110 CASES ARE PENDING. SOME OF THESE

LAWSUITS WERE FILED BY GROWERS WHO ALLEGE PLANT DAMAGE FROM

USING BENLATE® 50 DF AND, IN SOME CASES,

BENLATE® WP. SOME INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED DAMAGE TO

SHRIMPING OPERATIONS FROM BENLATE® OD, AND A SMALLER

NUMBER OF CASES INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES.

ALSO, MANY OF THESE CASES INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND

MISCONDUCT, AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE

RACKETEERING LAWS. IN AUGUST 2001, A FLORIDA JURY FOUND

DUPONT LIABLE UNDER FLORIDAS RACKETEERING STATUTE AND FOR

PRODUCT DEFECT INVOLVING ALLEGED CROP DAMAGE. PLAINTIFFS ARE

SEEKING TO HAVE JUDGMENT ENTERED FOR ABOUT $88.5 MILLION.

THE COURT IS CONSIDERING POST-TRIAL MOTIONS; DUPONT WILL APPEAL.

IN ADDITION, A SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION WAS

FILED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY A SHAREHOLDER IN FEDERAL

DISTRICT COURT IN FLORIDA AGAINST THE COMPANY AND THE

THEN-CHAIRMAN. THIS ACTION IS STILL PENDING. THE PLAINTIFF IN

THIS CASE ALLEGES THAT DUPONT MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS ABOUT BENLATE® 50 DF, WITH THE

ALLEGED EFFECT OF INFLATING THE PRICE OF DUPONTS STOCK

BETWEEN JUNE 19, 1993 AND JANUARY 27, 1995. THE

DISTRICT COURT HAS CERTIFIED THE CASE AS A CLASS ACTION, AND

DISCOVERY IS PROCEEDING.

CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY SETTLED

WITH THE COMPANY HAVE FILED CASES ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER

MISCONDUCT RELATING TO THE LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT OF

BENLATE® 50 DF CLAIMS. APPROXIMATELY 47 SUCH CASES WERE

FILED. RECENTLY, THE FLORIDA FEDERAL COURT DISMISSED THE LEAD

CASE OF 25 CASES PENDING BEFORE IT. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE

APPEALED. THE REMAINING CASES ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF

DEVELOPMENT IN TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS IN FLORIDA AND HAWAII.

A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS FILED IN

AUGUST OF 2001 IN FLORIDA. THE SUIT ALLEGED THAT THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS BREACHED VARIOUS DUTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE

BENLATE® LITIGATION AND ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER THE FEDERAL

AND STATE RACKETEERING LAWS. THIS CASE HAS BEEN DISMISSED BY THE

PLAINTIFF.

TWENTY-EIGHT CASES ARE PENDING AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE COURT IN BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA. THESE CASES

WERE BROUGHT BY ECUADORIAN SHRIMP FARMERS ALLEGING THAT

BENLATE® OD APPLIED TO BANANA PLANTATIONS IN ECUADOR

RAN-OFF AND WAS DEPOSITED IN PLAINTIFFS SHRIMP FARMS,

CAUSING MASSIVE NUMBERS OF SHRIMP TO DIE. TWO CASES WERE TRIED

IN THE FALL OF 2000 AND IN EARLY 2001, AND RESULTED IN ADVERSE

JUDGMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION AND

$16 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED BOTH

CASES. DUPONT CONTENDS THAT THE INJURIES ALLEGED ARE

ATTRIBUTABLE TO A VIRUS, TAURA SYNDROME VIRUS, AND IN NO WAY

INVOLVED BENLATE® OD. THE UNTRIED CASES ARE ON HOLD

AWAITING RESOLUTION BY THE APPELLATE COURT OF THE CASE TRIED IN

2000.

DUPONT BELIEVES THAT BENLATE® DID NOT CAUSE

THE DAMAGES ALLEGED IN THESE CASES AND DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS OF

FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT. DUPONT CONTINUES TO DEFEND ITSELF IN

ONGOING MATTERS. DUPONT DISCONTINUED THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF

BENLATE® FUNGICIDE IN ALL ITS FORMS IN 2001. THE ULTIMATE

LIABILITIES FROM THE BENLATE® LAWSUITS DISCUSSED ABOVE MAY

BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED, BUT MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT

THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEETS REFLECT

ACCRUALS FOR ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER.

ADVERSE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES FOR SUCH LIABILITIES COULD RESULT

IN ADDITIONAL FUTURE CHARGES.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

ON MAY 19, 1997, APPROXIMATELY 11,500 POUNDS

OF A HYDROGEN FLUORIDE (HF)/TAR MIXTURE WAS RELEASED FROM

DUPONTS LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, FLUOROPRODUCTS FACILITY.

THIS RELEASE LASTED ABOUT FORTY MINUTES. THERE WERE NO ON-SITE

INJURIES, AND ONLY ONE OFF-SITE PERSON REPORTED ANY EXPOSURE. NO

TOXIC TORT SUITS WERE FILED AS A RESULT OF THIS RELEASE.

DUPONTS INCIDENT INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT AN

INADEQUATE VALVE STEM DESIGN WAS A KEY FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO

THE RELEASE (THE VALVE STEM TWISTED AND THE VALVE INDICATED IT

WAS IN A CLOSED POSITION, WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY OPEN).

DUPONTS PROCESS ISOLATION PROCEDURES WERE ALSO REVIEWED

AND MODIFIED AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF

JUSTICE (DOJ) PROPOSED A SETTLEMENT PRIOR TO FILING ITS

ACTION FOR $1,700,000. SUBSEQUENTLY, BY LETTER DATED

JULY 13, 1999, THE DOJ PROVIDED FORMAL NOTICE TO DUPONT,

THAT

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DUE TO THE MAY 1997 HF RELEASE, THE DOJ

INTENDED TO BRING A FEDERAL COURT ACTION AGAINST DUPONT UNDER

THE CAA SECTION 112(R)  GENERAL DUTY CLAUSE.

DUPONT CONTESTED THE PROPOSED $1,700,000 FINE AS EXCESSIVE AND

UNREASONABLE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL HARM OR HUMAN

HEALTH IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAY 1997 INCIDENT. DUPONT

PRESENTED A SETTLEMENT OFFER TO THE DOJ AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) IN DECEMBER 2000. DUPONT HAS RECENTLY

REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH DOJ AND EPA TO SETTLE THIS MATTER FOR

$1,102,000. THIS SETTLEMENT CONSISTS OF $552,000 IN SUPPLEMENTAL

ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS SUPPORTING LOCAL LOUISVILLE GOVERNMENTAL

AND NONGOVERNMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES AND $550,000 AS A

CASH PENALTY. THE DOJ HAS PREPARED A CONSENT DECREE AND

COMPLAINT THAT DUPONT IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING. SETTLEMENT IS

EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED SOMETIME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002.

THE INDIANA DEPARTMENTS OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

INTERIOR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A NATURAL RESOURCE

DAMAGE ASSESSMENT OF THE GRAND CALUMET RIVER AND THE INDIANA

HARBOR CANAL SYSTEM UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA) AND THE OIL

POLLUTION ACT. THE COMPANYS PLANT IN EAST CHICAGO,

INDIANA, WHICH DISCHARGES INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER INTO THESE

WATERWAYS, WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF SEVENTEEN POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) FOR THE COST OF THE ASSESSMENT AND

ANY DETERMINED NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES. THE TRUSTEES RECENTLY

INDICATED THAT THEIR PREFERRED REMEDY IS TO DREDGE THE ENTIRE

GRAND CAL/ INDIANA HARBOR SYSTEM. DUPONT HAS JOINED WITH EIGHT

OTHER PRPS TO CONTEST THE REMEDY. A SETTLEMENT OFFER HAS BEEN

TENDERED TO THE TRUSTEES AND NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING.

ON OCTOBER 31, 2001, THE SECRETARY OF THE

DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL (THE

SECRETARY), AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,

FILED A COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT THE DUPONT EDGEMOOR FACILITY HAD

(1) IMPROPERLY OPERATED STORAGE PONDS WITHOUT A PERMIT,

(2) IMPROPERLY OPERATED A STAGING PILE WITH OUT A PERMIT,

(3) ALLOWED THE DISCHARGE OF AN AIR CONTAMINANT WITHOUT A

PERMIT, AND (4) ALLOWED THE DISCHARGE OF A WATER POLLUTANT

TO SURFACE WATER WITHOUT A PERMIT. THE SECRETARY SOUGHT CIVIL

PENALTIES UNDER 7 DEL. C. 6005(B)(1) FOR $1,000

TO $10,000 PER DAY FOR EACH DAY OF VIOLATION OF COUNTS 2-4 AND

UNDER 7 DEL. C. 6309(B) FOR $1,000 TO $25,000 PER

DAY OF VIOLATION OF THE OTHER COUNTS. DUPONT DENIED THE

ALLEGATIONS BUT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WERE ENVIRONMENTAL

CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES AND AGREED TO CEASE

AND DESIST AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL ACTION. THEREFORE,

CONCURRENT WITH THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT IN THE DELAWARE

SUPERIOR COURT, THE SECRETARY FILED A CONSENT ORDER IN WHICH THE

PARTIES AGREED THAT DUPONT WILL (1) CLOSE THE SURFACE

IMPOUNDMENTS IN A MANNER PROTECTIVE OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

ENVIRONMENT, (2) CONDUCT A FACILITY WIDE CORRECTIVE ACTION,

(3) ENTER INTO A VOLUNTARY CLEAN-UP PROGRAM TO CLOSE THE

STAGING PILE, (4) INVESTIGATE AND MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS TO

HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT RESULTING FROM OFFSITE USES OF

THE STAGING MATERIAL AND (5) SUBMIT A PAYMENT OF $7,000 PER

YEAR FOR OVERSIGHT EXPENSES DURING THE LIFE OF THE CONSENT

ORDER. THE APPROXIMATE COST OF THESE ACTIVITIES IS ESTIMATED AT

$12,400,000 AND RESERVES WERE ESTABLISHED AT DECEMBER 31,

2001 TO COVER THESE COSTS. SINCE THE CONSENT ORDER RESOLVES THE

COMPLAINT, DUPONT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE CIVIL PENALTIES SOUGHT

IN THE LATTER.

GLYPHOSATE TOLERANT SOYBEANS

IN DECEMBER 1999, THE MONSANTO COMPANY FILED

	SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF

	MISSOURI AGAINST PIONEER CLAIMING THAT ITS MERGER WITH DUPONT

	BREACHED A 1992 LICENSE AGREEMENT GRANTING PIONEER THE RIGHT TO

	PRODUCE AND MARKET ROUNDUP READY® GLYPHOSATE TOLERANT

	SOYBEANS. MONSANTO ASKED FOR DAMAGES FOR THE BREACH AND

	TERMINATION OF THE LICENSE. MONSANTOS COMPLAINT ALSO

	ALLEGED CLAIMS FOR PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND TRADE SECRET

	MISAPPROPRIATION IF THE LICENSE WERE TERMINATED. ON

	MARCH 20, 2001, THE COURT, ON MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT,

	FOUND THAT DUPONTS ACQUISITION OF PIONEER TERMINATED THE

	AGREEMENT. THE COURT FOUND NO BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THEREFORE,

	AWARDED NO DAMAGES ON THIS CLAIM. IT HELD THAT ANY CLAIM FOR

	DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF MONSANTO SEEKS WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

	THE NEXT PHASE OF THE LITIGATION, WHICH INVOLVES MONSANTOS

	PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND TRADE SECRET ALLEGATIONS.

	

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COURT FOUND THAT ITS DETERMINATION INVOLVED

	CONTROLLING QUESTIONS OF LAW AS TO WHICH THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL

	DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND THAT AN IMMEDIATE APPEAL WOULD ADVANCE

	THE ULTIMATE DETERMINATION OF THIS LITIGATION. THOSE QUESTIONS

	INVOLVE WHETHER FEDERAL COMMON LAW OR STATE MERGER LAW SHOULD

	CONTROL THE TRANSFERABILITY OF PATENT LICENSES. THE COURT HAS

	CERTIFIED ITS DECISION FOR IMMEDIATE APPEAL TO THE U.S. COURT OF

	APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. PIONEER HAS FILED AN APPEAL.

	THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE APPELLATE COURT WILL ULTIMATELY

	FIND THAT STATE MERGER LAW RATHER THAN FEDERAL COMMON LAW

	CONTROLS IN MERGER SITUATIONS AND, THEREFORE, THAT NO PROHIBITED

	LICENSE TRANSFER TOOK PLACE WHEN DUPONT ACQUIRED PIONEER. THE

	DISTRICT COURT HAS STAYED ALL OTHER PROCEEDINGS REGARDING PATENT

	INFRINGEMENT AND TRADE SECRET CLAIMS PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE

	APPEAL. A FAVORABLE DECISION FOR PIONEER ON APPEAL WILL

	REINSTATE THE LICENSE AND PRECLUDE ALL OTHER CLAIMS. THE APPEAL

	WAS HEARD ON FEBRUARY 5, 2002. A DECISION IS NOT EXPECTED

	UNTIL LATER IN 2002.

	

ON OCTOBER 1, 1999, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE

	APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF PIONEER NOT PREVIOUSLY OWNED

	FOR $7,684 MILLION. AN INTANGIBLE ASSET HAS BEEN RECORDED TO

	RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE 1992 LICENSE AGREEMENT. SHOULD THE

	ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS LAWSUIT BE ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, THE

	VALUE OF THIS INTANGIBLE ASSET MAY BECOME IMPAIRED, RESULTING IN

	A ONE-TIME NONCASH CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

	

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ULTIMATE

	OUTCOME OF THIS LAWSUIT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

	THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE
