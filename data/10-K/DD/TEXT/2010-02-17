item 1.business
dupont was founded in 1802 and was incorporated in delaware in 1915. dupont is a world leader in science and innovation across a range of disciplines, including agriculture and industrial
biotechnology, chemistry, biology, materials science and manufacturing. the company operates globally and offers a wide range of innovative products and services for markets including agriculture and
food, building and construction, electronics and communications, general industrial, and transportation. total worldwide employment at december31, 2009, was approximately 58,000 people.
during
the fourth quarter of 2009, the company consolidated its 23businesses and six reportable segments into 13businesses, aggregated into 7reportable segments based on
similar economic characteristics, the nature of the products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and regulatory environment. the company's reportable
segments are agriculture& nutrition, electronics& communications, performance chemicals, performance coatings, performance materials, safety& protection, and pharmaceuticals.
the company includes certain embryonic businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as applied biosciences, and nonaligned businesses in other.

the company has operations in approximately 80 countries worldwide and about 60percent of consolidated net sales are made to customers outside the united
states of america (u.s.). subsidiaries and affiliates of dupont conduct manufacturing, seed production, or selling activities and some are distributors of products manufactured by the company.
sources of supply
the company utilizes numerous suppliers as well as internal sources to supply a wide range of raw materials, energy, supplies, services and equipment.
to ensure availability, the company maintains multiple sources for fuels and many raw materials, including hydrocarbon feedstocks. large volume purchases are generally procured under competitively
priced supply contracts.
the
company's wholly-owned subsidiary, pioneer hi-bred international,inc. (pioneer), operates in the seed industry and has seed production facilities located throughout the world.
seed production is performed directly by the company or contracted with independent growers and conditioners. the company's ability to produce seeds primarily depends upon weather conditions and
availability of reliable contract growers.
the
major commodities, raw materials and supplies for the company's reportable segments in 2009 include the following:
agriculture& nutrition:
benzene
and carbamic acid related intermediates; copper; insect control products; natural gas; soybeans; soy flake; soy lecithin; sulfonamides; corn and soybean seeds

commodities or raw materials are purchased for the pharmaceutical segment. this segment receives net proceeds and royalties from licensing arrangements for cozaar and
hyzaar antihypertensive drugs, which are manufactured and distributed by merck sharp& dohme corp., a subsidiary of merck& co.,inc. (merck).
dupont
has contracts with computer sciences corporation (csc) and accenturellp (accenture) to provide certain services for the company. csc operates a majority of the company's global
information systems and technology infrastructures and provides selected applications and software services. csc is contracted to provide these services through december 2014. accenture provides
selected applications, software services and enterprise resource planning solutions designed to enhance the company's manufacturing, marketing, distribution and customer service. accenture is
contracted to provide these services through december 2011.
in
november 2005, dupont contracted with convergys corporation (convergys) to provide the company with global human resources transactional services including employee development, workforce planning,
compensation management, benefits administration and payroll. in december 2009, the global agreement with convergys was renegotiated and under the new terms of the agreement, convergys will provide
the company with human resource transactional services for theu.s. and puerto rico through 2012.
backlog
in general the company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of
the level of future sales activity. production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. therefore, the company believes that backlog
information is not material to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial
performance.
intellectual property
dupont believes that its intellectual property estate provides it with an important competitive advantage. it has an established global network of
attorneys, as well as branding, advertising and licensing professionals, to procure, maintain, protect, enhance and gain value from this estate.
the
company has a large portfolio of and is licensed under various patents. these definite-lived patents cover many products, processes and product uses. these patents protect many aspects of the
company's significant research programs and the goods and services it sells. the actual protection afforded by these patents varies from country to country and depends upon the scope of coverage of
each individual patent as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. dupont owns approximately 18,000 worldwide patents and approximately 17,000 worldwide patent applications. in
2009, the company was granted about 600 u.s.patents and about 1,350 international patents. the
table of contents
parti
item 1.business, continued
decrease
in the number of worldwide patents from about 21,000 in 2008 to about 18,000 in 2009 is primarily from decisions made by the company as part of its improved patent maintenance review process.
dupont's rights under its patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company as a whole, and to varying degrees, important to each reportable segment.
for a discussion of the importance of patents to pharmaceuticals, see the segment discussion on page34 of this report.
the
environment in which pioneer competes has been characterized by the use among competitors of new patents, patent positions and patent lawsuits to gain advantage in commercial markets. ownership of
and access to intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to biotechnology and germplasm, will continue to be important to pioneer and its competitors. pioneer has a large collection of
patents related to biotechnology and germplasm and also licenses technology from others. pioneer will continue to address the dynamic environment
in which it competes through a variety of means that includes protecting and enforcing its own intellectual property rights, challenging claims made by others and, where appropriate, obtaining
licenses to important technologies on commercially reasonable terms. during 2007, pioneer entered into a business agreement on corn herbicide tolerance and insect control trait technologies with
monsanto company. among other provisions, modifications were made to the existing corn license agreements; both parties agreed to exchange certain non-assert and other intellectual
property rights; and both parties obtained rights to reference and access certain regulatory data and approvals in which the other has certain interests. see the contractual obligations table on
page39 for more information.
the
company has more than 200 unique trademarks for its products and services and approximately 19,000 worldwide registrations and applications for these trademarks. ownership rights in trademarks do
not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected. the company has many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or business to business
level. significant trademarks at the consumer retail level include the dupont oval and dupont (the "dupont brand trademarks"); pioneer brand seeds; teflon
fluoropolymers, films, fabric protectors, fibers and dispersions; corian surfaces; kevlar high strength material; nomex thermal resistant material and
tyvek protective material. the company actively pursues licensing opportunities for selected trademarks at the retail level.
seasonality
sales of the company's products in the agriculture& nutrition segment are affected by seasonal cropping and weather patterns. sales and
earnings performance in the agriculture& nutrition segment is strongest in the first half of the year. the segment generally operates at a loss during the third and fourth quarters of the
year. as a result of the seasonal nature of its business, agriculture& nutrition's inventory is at its highest level at the end of the calendar year and is sold down in the first and second
quarters. trade receivables in the agriculture& nutrition segment are at a low point at year-end and increase through the selling season to peak at the end of the second quarter.
in
general, businesses in the remaining segments are not significantly affected by seasonal factors.
marketing
with the exception of pioneer brand seeds and solae soy proteins, most products are marketed primarily through dupont's
sales force, although in some regions, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. pioneer brand products are promoted through multiple marketing channels in north america. in
the corn and soybean markets of the u.s.corn belt, products are sold through a specialized force of independent sales representatives. in other north american markets, pioneer
products are marketed through distributors and crop input retailers. pioneer products outside of north america are marketed through a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures and
independent producer-distributors. similarly, crop protection products are marketed and sold to growers and other end users through a network of wholesale distributors and crop input retailers.
solae isolated and functional soy proteins are marketed using a combination of outside distributors, joint ventures and direct sales.
major customers
the company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. however, collectively, performance coatings and
performance materials have several large customers, primarily in the motor
table of contents
parti
item 1.business, continued
vehicle
original equipment manufacturer (oem) industry supply chain. the company has long-standing relationships with these customers and they are considered to be important to the
segments' operating results.
competition
as a science and technology based company, dupont competes on a variety of factors such as product quality and performance or specifications,
continuity of supply, price, customer service and breadth of product line, depending on the characteristics of the particular market involved and the product or service provided.
major
competitors include diversified industrial companies principally based in theu.s., western europe, japan, china, korea and india. in the aggregate, these competitors offer a wide range
of products from agricultural, commodity and specialty chemicals to plastics, fibers and advanced materials. the company also competes in certain markets with smaller, more specialized firms who offer
a narrow range of products or converted products that functionally compete with the company's offerings.
pioneer
sells advanced plant genetics, principally for the global production of corn and soybeans and thus directly competes with other seed and plant biotechnology companies. the nutrition&
health business also provides food safety equipment and soy-based food ingredients in competition with other major grain and food processors.
research and development
the company conducts research in theu.s. at either dedicated research facilities or manufacturing plants. the highest concentration of
research is in the wilmington, delaware area at several large research centers. among these, the experimental station laboratories engage in investigative and applied research, the chestnut run
laboratories focus on applied research and the stine-haskell research center
conducts agricultural product research and toxicological research to assure the safe manufacture, handling and use of products and raw materials.
other
major research locations in theu.s. include mt.clemens in mt.clemens, michigan, dedicated to coatings research; pioneer research facilities in johnston, iowa; the solae
company facilities in st.louis, missouri; polymer research facilities in richmond, virginia, and parkersburg, west virginia; and electronic technology research facilities in research triangle
park, north carolina, towanda, pennsylvania, and santa barbara, california.
dupont,
reflecting the company's global interests, also operates additional research and development facilities at locations outside theu.s., with major facilities located in saopaulo,
brazil; kingston, canada; shanghai, china; meyrin, switzerland; seoul, korea; wuppertal, germany; hyderabad, india; and utsunomiya, japan.
the
objectives of the company's research and development programs are to create new technologies, processes and business opportunities in relevant fields, as well as to improve existing products and
processes. each segment of the company funds research and development activities that support its business mission. recently, the company has broadened its sustainability commitments beyond
environmental footprint reduction to include market-driven targets for research and development investment. the company is expanding its offerings addressing safety, environment, energy and climate
challenges in the global marketplace by developing and commercializing renewable, bio-based materials; advanced biofuels; energy-efficient technologies; enhanced safety and protection
products; and alternative energy products and technologies. the goals are tied directly to business growth, including increasing food production, increasing renewable sources for energy and raw
materials, and providing greater safety and protection for life, assets, and the environment.
the
corporate research laboratories are responsible for conducting research programs aligned with corporate strategy. all research and development activities are administered by senior research and
development management to ensure consistency with the business and corporate strategy. the future of the company is not dependent upon the outcome of any single research program.
additional
information with respect to research and development, including the amount incurred during each of the last three fiscal years, is included in item7, management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations, on page20 of this report.

soon as is reasonably practicable after the company files or furnishes them electronically with the securities and exchange commission.
item 1a.risk factors
the company's operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond its control. based on current information, the company believes that the following identifies the most significant
risk factors that could affect its businesses. past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends
in future periods.
price increases for energy and raw materials could have a significant impact on the company's ability to sustain and grow earnings.
the company's manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and
demand as well as other factors beyond the control of the company. significant variations in the cost of energy, which primarily reflect market prices for oil and natural gas and raw materials affect
the company's operating results from period to period. legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a price on carbon could create increases in energy
costs and price volatility. when possible, the company purchases raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. additionally, the
company enters into over-the-counter and exchange traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. the
company takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. success in offsetting higher
raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. if the company is not able to fully
offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs, it could have a significant impact on the company's financial results.
table of contents
parti
item 1a.risk factors, continued
failure to develop and market new products could impact the company's competitive position and have an adverse effect on the company's financial
results.
the company's operating results are largely dependent on its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and services and to bring those products
and services to market. the company plans to grow earnings by focusing on emerging markets and solutions to meet increasing demand for food productivity, decrease dependency on fossil fuels and
protect people, assets and the environment. this ability could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products,
successfully complete research and development, obtain relevant regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products and services. because of the
lengthy development process, technological challenges and intense competition, there can be no assurance that any of the products the company is currently developing, or could begin to develop in the
future, will achieve substantial commercial success. sales of the company's new products could replace sales of some of its current products, offsetting the benefit of even a successful product
introduction.
the company's results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies.
the company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including, but not limited to, product liability, patent
infringement, antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. the company has noted a nationwide trend in purported class
actions against chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental
torts without claiming present personal injuries. the company also has noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities alleging harm
to the general public. various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities such as a final adverse judgment, significant settlement or changes in applicable law. a
future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company. an adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could
be material to the company's financial results.
in
the ordinary course of business, the company may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to
divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations. if the company were required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued, thereby adversely affecting the
company's results of operations.
as a result of the company's current and past operations, including operations related to divested businesses, the company could incur significant
environmental liabilities.
the company is subject to various laws and regulations around the world governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the
management and disposal of hazardous substances. as a result of its operations, including its past operations and operations of divested businesses, the company could incur substantial costs,
including cleanup costs. the costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be
so for the foreseeable future. the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. the company's accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be
adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of
contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties (prps) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of
otherprps.
the company's ability to generate sales from genetically modified products, particularly seeds and other agricultural products, could be adversely
affected by market acceptance, government policies, rules or regulations and competition.
the company is using biotechnology to create and improve products, particularly in its agriculture& nutrition segment. the use of
biotechnology to characterize the genetic and performance characteristics of pioneer seeds provides pioneer with competitive advantages in the development of new products, and in the most effective
placement of those
table of contents
parti
item 1a.risk factors, continued
products
on customer acres. demand for these products could be affected by market acceptance of genetically modified products as well as governmental policies, laws and regulations that affect the
development, manufacture and distribution of products, including the testing and planting of seeds containing biotechnology traits and the import of commodity grain grown from those seeds.
the
company competes with major global companies that have strong intellectual property estates supporting the use of biotechnology to enhance products, particularly in the agricultural products and
production markets. speed in discovering and protecting new technologies and bringing products based on them to market is a significant competitive advantage. failure to predict and respond
effectively to this competition could cause the company's existing or candidate products to become less competitive, adversely affecting sales.
changes in government policies and laws could adversely affect the company's financial results.
sales outside the u.s. constitute approximately 60percent of the company's 2009 revenue. the company anticipates that international sales will
continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales and that continued growth and profitability will require further international expansion, particularly in emerging markets. sales from
emerging markets represent approximately 30percent of the company's revenue in2009 and the company's growth plans include focusing on expanding its presence in emerging markets. the
company's financial results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of u.s. and non-u.s. governments, agencies and
similar organizations. these conditions include, but are not limited to, changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and
marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on
currency exchange activities, burdensome taxes and tariffs and
other trade barriers. international risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities and war, could lead to reduced sales and
profitability.
economic factors, including inflation, deflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices could affect the
company's financial results.
the company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. because the company has significant
international operations, there are a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. the company actively manages currency exposures
that are associated with monetary asset positions, committed currency purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. failure to successfully manage
these risks could have an adverse impact on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
conditions in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect the company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash
flows.
the company's business and operating results may in the future be adversely affected by global economic conditions, including instability in credit
markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that could affect the global economy. the company's customers may
experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. as a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase products and
may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion. further, suppliers could experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to the company.
adversity within capital markets may impact future return on pension assets, thus resulting in greater future pension costs that impact the company's results. future weakness in the global economy
could adversely affect the company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.
business disruptions could seriously impact the company's future revenue and financial condition and increase costs and expenses.
business disruptions, including supply disruptions, increasing costs for energy, temporary plant and/or power outages and information technology
system and network disruptions, could seriously harm the company's operations as well as the operations of its customers and suppliers. although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or
consequences

of
any such events, they could result in reduced demand for the company's products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to deliver products to its customers or to receive raw materials
from suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain. the company actively manages the risks within its control
that could cause business disruptions to mitigate any potential impact from business disruptions regardless of cause including acts of terrorism or war, and natural disasters. despite these efforts,
the impact from business disruptions could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact the company's financial performance.
inability to protect and enforce the company's intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company's financial results.
intellectual property rights are important to the company's business. the company endeavors to protect its intellectual property rights in
jurisdictions in which its products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which its products are imported. however, the company may be unable to obtain protection for its intellectual
property in key jurisdictions. additionally, the company has designed and implemented internal controls to restrict access to and distribution of its intellectual property, including confidential
information and trade secrets. despite these precautions, it is possible that unauthorized parties may access and use such property. when misappropriation is discovered, the company reports such
situations to the appropriate governmental authorities for investigation and takes measures to mitigate any potential impact.

overview
visiondupont's vision is to be the world's most dynamic science company, creating sustainable solutions essential for a better, healthier, and safer life for
people everywhere. the company is committed to growing shareholder and societal value while reducing its environmental footprint over the long term.
strategyunderlying the company's strategy for growth are four significant global trends increasing food
production, decreasing dependency on fossil fuels, protecting people, assets and the
environment, and growth in emerging markets. the company believes it best serves its shareholders by increasing its global presence
in meeting challenges, including increasing food production, increasing renewable sources for energy and raw materials, and providing greater safety and protection for life, assets, and the
environment. the company has differentiated targets for growth in these strategic areas including future funding of capital expenditures, research and development, and marketing programs.
goalsby aggressively pursuing top line growth opportunities in key markets and improving productivity, the company met or surpassed its 2009 financial goals for
earnings per share, cash flow, and working capital reductions. the company announced a three-year 2010-2012 plan which includes $1billion fixed cost productivity
actions, $1billion working capital productivity programs, and compound annual growth targets of 10percent for sales and 20percent for earnings per share through 2012. sales in
emerging markets, which include china, india, and the countries located in latin america, eastern and central europe, middle east, africa, and southeast asia, are targeted to grow at a
14percent compound annual rate from 2009 to 2012. the company has reaffirmed its commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a
compelling opportunity to invest for growth.
global economic and financial market impactthe year 2009 was one of considerable economic change, transitioning from predominantly depressed conditions and
inventory destocking in most markets during the first half of the year to resumption of growth for most businesses and markets in the latter half. of particular importance to the company are motor
vehicle and construction related markets which, while gradually improving, remained depressed for most of the year. reflecting these conditions, the company's full year sales volume dropped
12percent versus 2008, and selling prices remained under pressure, principally for chemical and certain polymer products. the global recessionary economic conditions along with productivity
and cost reduction programs contributed to a 7percent reduction in the company's combined costs for raw materials, energy and transportation. depressed equity market values resulted in higher
non-cash pension costs, versus 2008. while financial and credit market conditions were challenging, the company continued to access the short and long-term debt markets without
difficulty.

following financial statement line items: cogs 60percent, sg&a 30percent, and r&d 10percent. this charge includes
$212million of severance and related benefits costs, $24million of other non-personnel costs and $104million of asset-related charges, including $77million
for asset shut downs and write-offs, $11million for asset impairments and $16million for accelerated depreciation.

item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued
in
the fourth quarter of 2009, the company recorded a $30million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2009 restructuring program primarily due to lower than estimated
individual severance costs and work force reductions through non-severance programs.
as
of december31, 2009, approximately 1,000 employees have been separated related to the 2009 restructuring program, and about 150 positions were eliminated through other
non-severance programs. the actions related to this program are expected to be complete by the end of 2010. these actions achieved pre-tax cost savings of about
$35million in 2009 and are expected to generate pre-tax cost savings of approximately $180million in 2010 and approximately $250million per year in subsequent
years.
2008 restructuring program
during 2008, in response to the challenging economic environment, the company initiated a global restructuring program to reduce costs and improve
profitability across its businesses. the 2008 restructuring program included the elimination of approximately 2,500 positions principally located in western europe and the u.s. primarily supporting

the fourth quarter of 2008, the company recorded a charge of $535million, which included $287million related to employee severance costs and $248million attributable to
asset shut-downs, asset impairments and other non-personnel charges. for 2009, the restructuring charge of $535million was reclassified from cost of goods sold and
other operating charges to employee separation/asset related charges, net.
in
2009, the company recorded a $100million net reduction in the estimated costs related to the 2008 restructuring program. the $100million net reduction in the estimated costs for the
2008 restructuring program was recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net and was primarily due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions through
non-severance programs.
as
of december31, 2009, approximately 1,700 employees have been separated related to the 2008 global restructuring program and about 400 positions were eliminated through other
non-severance programs. the actions related to the 2008 restructuring program are expected to be complete by the end of 2010. these actions achieved pre-tax cost savings of
about $130million in 2009 and are expected to generate pre-tax cost savings of approximately $225million in 2010 and approximately $250million per year in
subsequent years.
additional
details related to these programs are contained in the individual segment reviews and in note5 to the consolidated financial statements.

in 2009, the company recorded a tax provision of $415million reflecting a marginal increase from 2008. the increase in the 2009 effective tax rate
compared to 2008 is primarily due to geographic mix of earnings (see note6 to the consolidated financial statements).
in
2008, the company recorded a tax provision of $381million. the 2008 provision for income taxes decreased compared to 2007 primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income. the
decrease in the 2008 effective tax rate is driven by the significant decrease in pre-tax income attributable to u.s. operations, where the statutory tax rate is higher than the overall
global effective tax rate (see note6 to the consolidated financial statements).
in
2007, the company recorded a tax provision of $748million which included a benefit of $108million related to tax settlements offset by net tax expense in other operating results
(see note6 to the consolidated financial statements).

2009 versus 2008net income attributable to dupont ("earnings") for 2009 decreased $252million, or 13percent versus 2008. the decrease in earnings
is principally attributable to lower sales volume, unfavorable currency impacts, and higher non-cash pension costs. partly offsetting these factors were lower costs for raw materials,
energy, and freight, benefits from cost reductions and productivity actions, lower restructuring charges, and the absence of prior-year hurricane-related charges.
2008 versus 2007earnings for 2008 decreased $981million, or 33percent versus 2007. the decrease in earnings is attributable to a substantial
decline in sales volume, primarily occurring during the fourth quarter 2008, and higher fixed costs including restructuring and hurricane-related charges.
corporate outlook
for the year 2010, the company's earnings outlook is a range of $2.15 to $2.45 per share, with expected 10percent sales growth, reflecting
anticipated continued global economic recovery, increasing industrial production, and, on average, a weaker u.s.dollar versus 2009. favorable global agriculture market and competitive
conditions are expected to support continued sales and earnings growth for the agriculture& nutrition segment, partly offset by anticipated higher commodities costs. demand for the company's
polymer, chemical, material, and electronic product lines is expected to increase moderately versus the depressed levels of 2009. earnings from cozaar/hyzaar are expected to
decline about $690 to $740million pre-tax, reflecting expiration of certain patents for these pharmaceuticals. the company expects approximately $410million higher
pre-tax non-cash pension costs. this is expected to be partially offset by $160million lower pre-tax costs resulting from a change in other employee-related
benefits. the company plans to continue a differential level of support for businesses expected to have above-average growth rates and margins. for 2010, the company has set targets for capital
expenditures of about $1.6billion and fixed cost productivity programs totaling about $400million.
accounting standards issued not yet adopted
in june 2009, fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, which is applied to financial asset transfers on or
after the effective date, which is january1, 2010 for the company's financial statements. the new requirement limits the circumstances in which a financial asset may be
de-recognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset. the concept of a qualifying special-purpose
entity, which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers, is removed by the new requirement. the company expects that this will not have a material effect on its financial
position or results of operations.
in
june 2009, fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for variable interest entities, which is effective for reporting periods beginning after november15, 2009. the amendments change
the process for how an enterprise determines which party consolidates a variable interest entity (vie) to a primarily qualitative analysis. the party that consolidates the vie (the primary
beneficiary) is defined as the party with (1)the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly affect the vie's economic performance and (2)the obligation to absorb
losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie. upon adoption, reporting enterprises must reconsider their conclusions on whether an entity should be consolidated and should a change
result, the effect on net assets will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. the company expects that upon adoption this will not have a material effect on its financial
position or results of operations.

critical accounting estimates
the company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in note1 to the consolidated financial statements. management believes
that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating
results and financial condition.
the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit
obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. the company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. management believes that the following represents some
of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
long-term employee benefits
accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical
assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans.
management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of december31. these and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan
specific basis as appropriate. as permitted by gaap, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed
10percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining working life of current employees.
about
80percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit
plans in theu.s. the company utilizes published long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate at measurement date. where commonly available, the
company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments.
within
theu.s., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance
between return and risk. strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also
taken into consideration. the long-term expected return on plan assets in theu.s. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the
investment policy and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants.
in
determining annual expense for the principal u.s.pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. the market-related value of assets is calculated
by averaging market returns over 36months. accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. as a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately
reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. the following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal u.s.pension plan:

for
plans other than the principal u.s.pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. the fair value of assets in all pension plans was
$17.1billion at december31, 2009, and the related projected benefit obligations were $22.8billion. in addition, obligations under the company's unfunded other
long-term employee benefit plans were $4.1billion at december31, 2009.
the
following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other

environmental matters
dupont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be
made. the company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with
regulatory agencies and other prps at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other prps. the company has recorded a liability of $396million on the consolidated balance
sheet as of december31, 2009; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted.
considerable
uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount
accrued. much of this liability results from the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla, often referred to as the superfund), the resource conservation and
recovery act (rcra) and similar state and global laws. these laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted
operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. the accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be
required, but which are not currently the subject of enforcement activities. federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations
and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. over the next two decades, the company could incur
significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
remediation
activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. these activities and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation
technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of prps. therefore, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation
costs.
legal contingencies
the company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent
infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. the company records accruals for legal matters when the
information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect
the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits
and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial
table of contents
partii
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued
uncertainties
that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. these factors
include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input
from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. considerable judgment is required in determining
whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. in such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a
thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. a detailed discussion of significant
litigation matters is contained in note20 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes
the breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating
taxes the company will ultimately pay. the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and
resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. it is
reasonably possible that net reductions to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $50million to $75million within the next twelve months with the
majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities.
deferred
income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are
enacted. valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in evaluating the
need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful
implementation of various tax planning strategies. for example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in
recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. in some situations these changes could be material.
at
december31, 2009, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $6,810million, net of valuation allowance of $1,759million. realization of these assets is expected to
occur over an extended period of time. as a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets.
valuation of assets
assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an
integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best
estimates at a particular point in time. the dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected
selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. changes
in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are
recognized.
based
on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test in 2009, no impairments exist at this time. however, the company has certain businesses within the performance materials segment
with approximately 28percent excess of fair value over carrying value. the aggregate goodwill balance for these businesses was approximately $200million of the total goodwill for the
performance materials segment of $413million at december31, 2009. the company's methodology for determining the fair value of its businesses is based on present value
table of contents
partii
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued
techniques
of future cash flows. given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the potential impact on the company's businesses, there can be no assurance that the company's
estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, will prove to be accurate predictions
of the future. the company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. information with respect to the company's significant accounting policies on
long-lived assets is included in note1 to the consolidated financial statements.
segment reviews
segment sales include transfers to another business segment. products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as
practicable, the market value of the products. segment pre-tax operating income/(loss) (ptoi) is defined as operating income before income taxes, exchange gains/(losses), corporate
expenses, interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. a reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment ptoi to income before income taxes for 2009,
2008 and 2007 is included in note26 to the consolidated financial statements.
as
described in note5 to the consolidated financial statements, the company initiated global restructuring programs during 2009 and 2008. the 2009 and 2008 program charges reduced total
segment ptoi for 2009 and 2008 by $340million and $535million, respectively.
in
addition, in 2009, the company recorded a $100million and $30million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2008 program and 2009 programs, respectively.

agriculture& nutrition's businesses leverage the company's technology, customer relationships, and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality
and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry. land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be
achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted area. the segment's businesses deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are
specifically targeted to achieve

gains
in crop yields and productivity, including pioneer brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. the segment's businesses
operate across the food value chain from inputs for producing agriculture products to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients to food quality diagnostic testing
equipment. research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and
effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. the following are agriculture& nutrition's operating businesses:
pioneer is the world's leading seed brand and a world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and
provide effective plant insect protection and herbicide tolerance. the principal products of pioneer are hybrid seed corn and varietal soybean seed, as well as sunflower, canola, sorghum and rice.
crops grown from pioneer seed are used to meet the global demand for animal feed, food, biofuels, and fiber. agricultural seed research requires long-term commitment, investment and
innovation. pioneer research is focused on results that deliver higher crop yields and a consistent per acre income advantage for its customers. new product innovation is accomplished through an
effective integration of superior germplasm and value added native and biotechnology traits. in 2009, pioneer benefited from the north america launch of 26 new soybean varieties and 96 new
pioneer brand corn hybrids that include new combinations of corn borer, corn rootworm and weed management traits highlighted by the expansion of the herculex1
family of traits. as announced in december 2008, pioneer is expanding its reach into new markets through its proaccesssm business strategy to bring its seed genetics to more customers
and acres around the world through a network of partners and co-brands. sales of pioneer seeds amounted to 18percent, 13percent and 11percent of the company's total
consolidated net sales for the years ended december31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
in
the spring of 2009, monsanto company (monsanto) sued the company in u.s.district court claiming that stacking seed with pioneer's optimum gat trait and monsanto's
roundup ready2 herbicide tolerance trait violates its roundup ready license agreements with monsanto. monsanto also alleges that sales of pioneer stacked seeds
would infringe a monsanto patent that expires in 2014. monsanto seeks declaratory relief, unspecified damages and a permanent injunction to prevent sales of optimum gat/
roundup ready stacked seeds. dupont has filed an answer and counterclaims, including patent misuse and antitrust claims. in january 2010, the court in response to a motion filed by
monsanto ruled that the license agreements between the companies contain an unwritten ("implied") term that prohibits stacking the optimum gat and roundup ready
traits in soybean or corn seed. the court emphasized that the company's separate antitrust and patent fraud claims were not impacted by the ruling and would, therefore, proceed. pioneer continues to
develop soybean seed in which these traits are stacked and sales could occur as soon as 2013. pioneer also has been working to develop corn seed with the optimum gat trait
that meets the company's high yield standards. pioneer is intensifying its ongoing research efforts along multiple pathways for the corn trait working toward commercialization in the middle of the
next decade. the january 2010 ruling does not change pioneer's commercialization plans for products with the optimum gat trait. furthermore, management believes that the
monsanto lawsuit is unlikely to adversely affect the company's commercial results for soybean and corn seed.
dupont crop protection serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products for field crops such as wheat, corn, soybean and
rice; specialty crops such as fruit, nut, vine and vegetables; and non-crop segments, including forestry and land management. principal crop protection products are weed control, disease
control, and insect control products. the business continues to expand its product offerings in the professional pest control, lawn care, golf course, animal health and seed treatment markets.
nutrition& health operates principally within the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through the solae
company, a majority-owned venture with bunge limited. nutrition& health global production and distribution capabilities serves various areas within the food industries including meat and

products, dairy-alternative products and nutritional products. nutrition& health anticipates improved volume growth in its specialty food ingredients.
2009 versus 2008sales were $8.3billion, a 4percent increase versus the prior year, reflecting 5percent higher usd selling prices, partially
offset by a 1percent decrease in volume. the higher usd selling prices is related to pioneer seeds and crop protection proprietary insect, weed and disease control products, partially offset
by unfavorable currency impacts in europe, canada and latin america, as well as the impact of significantly lower
market-driven pricing for glyphosate resale. the decrease in volume was primarily due to lower sales of crop protection disease and insect control products, and lower sales of nutrition&
health products largely offset by higher pioneer corn and soybean seed sales market share gains in north america.
ptoi
for 2009 was $1.2billion, up 13percent versus the same period last year, principally due to the higher sales and higher value product mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency
impacts globally.
2008 versus 2007sales of $8billion were 16percent higher, reflecting 14percent higher usd selling prices and 3percent higher
volume, partially offset by a 1percent reduction from portfolio changes. the volume growth reflects higher pioneer sales due to increased demand for corn seeds in europe and brazil and record
soybean seed sales in north america and brazil due to market share gains and increased acreage shift from corn. the volume growth was also due to higher sales of crop protection products, mostly due
to strong global demand for disease and insect control products, as well as corn and cereal weed control products in europe. the higher usd selling prices reflect higher value product mix, pricing
actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and favorable currency impacts across all regions.
ptoi
for 2008 was $1.1billion, up 22percent versus $894million in 2007, principally driven by increased sales and higher value product mix, partially offset by continued
funding of strategic growth investments in research and development and sales and marketing.
outlookall of the segment's businesses anticipate continued growth in 2010. segment earnings are expected to benefit in particular from increased pioneer corn and
soybean value offerings. pioneer will continue to build on its north american product offerings with the addition of 29 new soybean varieties and 80 new pioneer brand corn hybrids.
pioneer anticipates continued market share gains in key corn and soybean markets including the u.s., canada and latin america. in addition, pioneer expects to drive value-based pricing coupled with
continued technology adoption and penetration. the introduction of new dupont crop protection products and technology is projected to support volume and targeted market segment share gains in growth
and emerging markets. however, price pressure on crop protection products is expected to intensify after three years of positive momentum, and combined with higher projected production and raw
material costs, are expected to moderate results. continued productivity and business improvement actions across the segment will continue to reduce the impact of rising costs.

one of the fastest growing segments of the solar energy market, dupont apolloltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, began producing thin-film photovoltaic modules in
2009. beyond photovoltaics, the segment is investing in its broad portfolio of materials for semiconductor fabrication and packaging, as well as its innovative materials for circuit applications, to
address critical needs of semiconductor and electronics manufacturers. in the market for flat panel displays, the segment continues to be a leading materials supplier for plasma displays. in addition,
the segment continues to invest in developing materials technologies for organic light-emitting diode (oled) displays. in packaging graphics, products such as
cyrelfast have rapidly grown, solidifying the segment's market leadership position. dupont is also expanding its leadership position in black
pigmented inks and investing in color pigmented inks for network printing applications.
in
january 2010, the segment announced an investment of $175million to complete the multi-phase expansion of its high-performance dupont tedlar pv2001 series oriented
film production line. this investment is in addition to $120million in capacity expansions, announced in august 2009 for raw materials used to make the film, bringing the total commitment of
these two phases to $295million. tedlar films serve as the critical component of photovoltaic backsheets, providing long-term durability and performance for
photovoltaic modules in all-weather conditions.
2009 versus 2008sales of $1.9billion were down 13percent, reflecting 11percent volume decline and 2percent lower usd selling
prices. the lower volumes reflect the effect of the global economic recession which impacted sales for products across all key markets. however, sales volumes improved throughout the year, most
significantly in asia pacific, where sales were essentially flat when compared to 2008. the lower usd selling prices were mainly due to contractual pass-through of lower precious metal
prices.
ptoi
was $87million compared to $251million in prior year. the decline in ptoi was primarily due to the impact of lower sales, lower income from affiliates, and higher charges
associated with low capacity utilization of production lines.
2008 versus 2007sales of $2.2billion were up 3percent, reflecting 4percent higher usd selling prices, partially offset by a
1percent decline in volume. the higher usd selling prices mainly reflect pricing actions to offset the
increases of raw materials costs and favorable currency impacts in europe and asia pacific. the lower volumes reflect decreased demand for products across the segment key markets, mostly towards the
end of 2008, partially offset by increased demand for photovoltaic products and higher sales in emerging markets.
ptoi
was $251million as compared to $314million in 2007. this decline was mainly due to the impact of higher raw materials cost, lower sales volumes and the $37million charge
related to the 2008 restructuring program.
outlookfor 2010, sales for electronic materials, photovoltaics and packaging graphics products are expected to increase as markets recover from the global economic
recession, and selling prices increase from pass-through of higher precious metal costs. in addition, segment earnings are expected to increase reflecting the impact of higher volumes,
cost control initiatives, and benefits from the 2009 restructuring program.

dupont titanium technologies is the world's largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide, and is dedicated to creating greater, more rewarding value for the
coatings, paper, plastics, specialties and minerals markets through service, brand, and product. the business' main products include its broad line of dupont
ti-pure titanium dioxide products, and starblast abrasives.
dupont chemicals and fluoroproducts is a leading global manufacturer of industrial and specialty fluorochemicals, fluoropolymers, and performance
chemicals. the business' broad line of products that include refrigerants, lubricants, propellants, solvents, fire extinguishants and electronic gases, cover a wide range of industries and markets.
key brands include duponttm teflon, dymel, isceon, suva, vertrel, zyron, vazo and
virkon.
2009 versus 2008sales of $5.0billion were 18percent lower than last year, due to a 12percent decline in volume and 6percent lower
usd selling prices. the lower volume principally reflects decreased demand for industrial chemicals and fluoroproducts across all regions reflecting the impact of the current economic downturn. sales
of titanium dioxide products recovered during the second half of 2009, and were higher than the pre-recession levels in the second half of 2007. the lower usd selling prices were mainly
due to contractual pass-through of lower raw material prices and unfavorable currency impact in europe and asia pacific.
ptoi
was $547million compared to $687million in the prior year. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by fixed costs reductions.
2008 versus 2007sales of $6.0billion were 3percent higher when compared to 2007, due to 12percent higher usd selling prices, partially
offset by a 7percent decline in volume and a 2percent decrease from portfolio changes. the higher usd selling prices primarily reflect pricing actions to offset the increases of raw
materials costs, contractual pass-through of raw material price changes, and positive currency impact in europe and latin america. the lower volume reflects decreased demand for titanium
dioxide, fluoroproducts and specialty chemicals due to the impact of the global economic downturn.
ptoi was $687million compared to $921million in 2007. the decline in ptoi was mainly due to the impact of higher raw material costs and lower volumes, and the $50million
restructuring charge recorded in 2008, partially offset by a $39million benefit related to a gain on a land sale and inventory valuation adjustments.
outlookperformance chemicals sales are expected to increase in 2010 as a result of higher global demand for titanium dioxide and specialty chemicals, positive
currency impacts and higher prices to offset raw material cost increases. total segment earnings are also expected to increase significantly due to the impact of higher sales, lower fixed costs and
benefits from the 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs. this segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with pfoa matters. see the discussion on page45
under the subheading pfoa for further information.

performance coatings is one of the world's leading motor vehicle coatings suppliers. products offered include high
performance liquid and powder coatings for motor vehicle original equipment manufacturers (oems), the motor vehicle after-market, and general industrial applications, such as coatings for heavy
equipment, pipes and appliances and electrical insulation. the company markets its after-market coatings products using the dupont standox, spies hecker and
nason brand names. standox and spies hecker are focused on the high-end motor vehicle after-markets, while nason is primarily focused on
economy coating applications.
in
2009 and 2008, the segment experienced a significant decline in sales, mainly to the oemsmarkets, due to the impact of the global economic recession in the automotive industry. in addition,
the north american automotive industry continued to experience structural changes, including the loss of u.s.market share by u.s.automakers. in 2009 the global production of
automobiles and light trucks declined by 14percent reflecting declines of 33percent in north america, and 10percent in the rest of the world, which was partially offset by an
increase in production of 44percent in greater china. the industry production forecast for 2010 projects a global increase of about 9percent, with increased production in all regions.
2009 versus 2008sales of $3.4billion were down 21percent when compared to prior year, reflecting a 20percent decline in volume and
1percent lower usd selling prices. the decline in volume reflects the impact of fewer motor vehicle and industrial truck builds of motor vehicle oems, and lower sales of industrial and
after-market products in all regions. sales to oemsimproved substantially during the second half of 2009, mostly due to the impact of government incentives programs and higher sales in asia
pacific. sales of after-market and industrial coatings have experienced a slower recovery from the inventory destocking experienced in the industry during fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of
2009. the lower usd selling prices reflect unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher local selling prices.
ptoi
was $69million as compared to a loss of $8million in 2008. the improvement in ptoi is primarily due to lower fixed costs, and the net year-over-year impact
of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities, partially offset by the effect of lower volumes.
2008 versus 2007sales of $4.4billion were essentially flat when compared to 2007, reflecting 7percent higher usd selling prices, offset by a
7percent volume decline. the higher usd selling prices primarily reflect favorable currency impacts in europe and latin america and pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials
costs. the decrease in volume was primarily due to lower sales of products sold to oemsin north america and europe, partially offset by higher sales of after-market and industrial coatings
products and strong sales in emerging markets.
pre-tax
loss of $8million compared to income of $366million in 2007. year-over-year decline in ptoi reflects the impact of the 2008 restructuring
charge, as well as the impact of higher raw material costs and lower volumes, partially offset by higher prices.
outlookfor 2010, the segment expects sales increases that will exceed the oemsbuild growth due to expected recovery of oemsand light truck markets
and positive currency impacts. ptoi is also expected to increase significantly due to fixed costs reductions, benefits from the company's 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs and the impact of higher
sales.

performance materials' businesses provide productive, higher performance polymers, elastomers, films, parts, and systems and solutions which improve the
uniqueness, functionality and profitability of its customers' offerings. the key markets served by the segment include the automotive oem and associated after-market industries, as well as electrical,
electronics, packaging, construction, oil, photovoltaics, aerospace, chemical processing and consumer durable goods. the following are performance materials' operating businesses:
performance polymers delivers a broad range of polymer-based high performance materials in its product portfolio, including elastomers and thermoplastic
and thermoset engineering polymers which are used by customers to fabricate components for mechanical, chemical and electrical systems. the main products include: dupont
zytel nylon resins, delrin acetal resins, hytrel polyester thermoplastic elastomer resins, tynex filaments, vespel parts and shapes,
vamac ethylene acrylic elastomer, kalrez perfluoroelastomer and viton fluoroelastomers. performance polymers also includes the dupont teijin films joint venture,
whose primary products are mylar and melinex polyester films.
packaging& industrial polymers specializes in resins and films used in packaging and industrial polymer applications, sealants and adhesives,
sporting goods, and interlayers for laminated safety glass. key brands include: dupont surlyn ionomer resins, bynel coextrudable adhesive resins,
elvax eva resins, sentryglas and butacite laminate interlayers.
2009 versus 2008sales of $4.8billion were 26percent lower reflecting 18percent lower volumes, 6percent decrease in usd selling
prices, and a 2percent reduction related to portfolio changes. the decrease in volume mainly reflects the effect of the global economic recession and the inventory destocking experienced
during the first part of the 2009. however, sales continuously improved during the second half of 2009, both sequentially and when compared to 2008, mainly due to overall economic recovery and higher
sales to the motor vehicle industry. the lower usd selling prices were a combination of significantly weaker product sales mix, unfavorable currency impacts, and for certain products, lower selling
prices in response to lower feedstock costs.
ptoi was $287million compared to $128million in 2008. the improvement in ptoi reflects the impact of lower raw material, energy and freight costs, lower fixed costs, the absence
of a $216million hurricane-related charge in 2008, a $26million benefit in 2009 related to a reduction in the hurricane-related reserve, proceeds from hurricane-related insurance
recoveries of $56million received in 2009, and the net year-over-year impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities. the company is aggressively pursuing
additional insurance recoveries in the range of $50 $100million.
2008 versus 2007sales of $6.4billion were 3percent lower, reflecting a 13percent decrease in volume and a 1percent reduction from
portfolio changes, which more than offset 11percent higher usd selling prices. sales volume declines were more pronounced beginning late in the third quarter, with continued and accelerated
deterioration through the fourth quarter, and occurred in all major regions and end-use market segments. the decline reflected a broad industry movement to reduce inventory and improve
cash positions to manage through weak global economic demand. volumes were also negatively impacted by extended operating unit shutdowns related to the time taken to implement facility repairs
stemming from damages associated with hurricanes gustav and ike. operating units outages associated with the hurricanes were of varying lengths depending on the level of damage incurred and the
ability to obtain utilities and ingredients to enable a restart.

ptoi was $128million compared to $626million in 2007. 2008 ptoi includes charges related to hurricane damages of $216million. in addition, as part of the company's
restructuring program, the segment recorded a charge of $94million to cover employee termination costs and other asset related charges. the decline in ptoi was also influenced by charges
associated with low capacity utilization of production units to reduce inventories due to the decreased demand. the decrease in ptoi in 2008 was partially offset by the absence of a
$165million impairment charge in 2007 to write down the company's investment in a polyester films joint venture.
outlook2010 sales are expected to grow due to anticipated increases in global motor vehicle oemsbuilds and continued recovery from the global economic
recession for most of the markets served by the segment. ptoi is also expected to improve due to the impact of higher sales, improved fixed cost performance, benefits from the company's 2008 and 2009
restructuring programs and market-driven innovations for products and processes.

corp., which is one of the world's leading publishers of safety, industrial skills and employee development training programs.
2009 versus 2008sales of $2.8billion were 25percent lower than last year, due to a 23percent decline in volume and 3percent lower
usd selling prices, partially offset by a 1percent increase from portfolio changes. the lower volume reflects decreased demand for products across all markets and regions due to the impact of
the current economic downturn. the lower usd selling prices were mainly due to unfavorable currency impact in europe and asia pacific.
ptoi
was $260million compared to $661million in the prior year. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of lower volumes and charges associated with low capacity
utilization of production units, partially offset by fixed costs reductions.

2008 versus 2007sales of $3.7billion were flat when compared to 2007, due to 5percent higher usd selling prices, offset by a 5percent
decline in volume. decreased volume primarily reflects lower sales to the u.s.residential and construction markets and the automotive industry, which accelerated and spread to other key
markets during the fourth quarter. the higher usd selling prices primarily reflect pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and positive currency impact in europe and latin
america.
ptoi was $661million compared to $1,032million in 2007. the decreased earnings were primarily due to higher production costs and the impact of lower volumes related to the global
recession. in addition, 2008 ptoi includes a charge of $96million to cover employee separation costs and other asset related charges as part of the company restructuring program.
outlookfor 2010, sales are expected to benefit from improved global market conditions. demand for kevlar and nomex is expected to
increase due to public sector sales growth and strengthening in the motor vehicle and personal protection markets. sales related to the building innovations business are expected to increase due to
global market improvements, continued volume increases in the u.s. and european residential construction markets and new product introductions. earnings in 2010 will also include benefits from the
restructuring actions announced in 2009 and 2008.

on october1, 2001, dupont pharmaceuticals was sold to the bristol-myers squibb company. dupont retained its interest in cozaar (losartan
potassium) and hyzaar (losartan potassium with
hydrochlorothiazide). these drugs were discovered by dupont and developed in collaboration with merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension. the u.s.patents covering the compounds,
pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, will expire in 2010. dupont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing
rights for cozaar and hyzaar to merck. pharmaceuticals receives net proceeds and royalties as outlined below. merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling
cozaar and hyzaar.
pharmaceuticals'
cozaar/hyzaar income is the sum of two parts: income related to a share of the profits from north american sales and certain markets in emea, and royalty
income derived from worldwide contract net sales linked to the exclusivity term in a particular country. patents and exclusivity have already started to expire and the u.s. exclusivity for
cozaar ends in april 2010. the worldwide agreement terminates when the following conditions are met: (i)the canadian exclusivity ends in 2013, and (ii)north american sales
fall below a certain level. therefore, absent any major changes in the markets, the company expects its income to take its first significant step-down in 2010, and from that year on,
continue to step-down each year to zero when the contract ends, which is expected to be after 2013. in general, management expects a traditional sales, earnings and cash decline for a drug
going off patent in the pharmaceutical industry.
in
the fourth quarter the company recorded a $63million charge to other income, net and a reduction to accounts and notes receivable, net in the pharmaceuticals segment to reflect increased
rebates and other sales deductions related to the cozaar/hyzaar licensing agreement. refer to note27 for further information.
outlookthe company expects revenues from cozaar/hyzaar to significantly decrease after the u.s. patents expire in 2010. earnings
contributions to the company from the collaboration with merck are expected to decline in 2010 about $690 $740million pre-tax from earnings generated in 2009.

the company includes certain embryonic businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as applied biosciences and nonaligned businesses in other. the potential
viability of each embryonic business depends on a number of factors including successful product development, market acceptance and production ramp up capabilities. using these factors and others,
management periodically assesses the potential and fit of these businesses and may make investment adjustments based on such assessments. applied biosciences is focused on the development and
commercialization of products to serve our customers with superior performing sustainable solutions that target industries spanning across energy, materials and health through the application of
biotechnology, chemistry, materials science and engineering in an integrated fashion. specific global growth projects across the company are consolidated within applied biosciences to capitalize on
the market opportunities and technology needs in this high-growth industry, including biomaterial and advanced biofuels products and technologies.
applied
biosciences will provide advantaged products for agricultural energy crops, feedstock processing and advanced biofuels through two businesses: one to commercialize non-food,
cellulosic ethanol and the second to commercialize biobutanol. to accelerate commercialization, dupont has formed a joint venture with danisco, dupont danisco cellulosic ethanolllc (ddce), for
the cellulosic ethanol technology. for biobutanol, a joint venture with bp p.l.c. was formed in 2009, butamax advanced biofuelsllc. ddce now operates a demonstration scale
facility in vonore, tennessee that is working to optimize technologies for large-scale production. butamax expects start-up of its demonstration scale in hull, united kingdom
in 2010.
dupont
continues its joint venture with tate& lyleplc, dupont tate and lyle bio productsllc, to produce 1,3-propanediol (bio-pdo) using a
proprietary fermentation and purification process using renewable feedstocks. bio-pdo is the key building block for dupont sorona polymer and
dupont cerenol polyols, two new families of renewably sourced products. under the zemea propanediol and susterra propanediol brands, it is also
being marketed for use as an ingredient in nearly 150 direct applications ranging from industrial to personal care uses. the first commercial-scale plant to manufacture
bio-pdo began production in november 2006, marking the beginning of commercial availability of the company's bio-based pipeline.
nonaligned
businesses include activities and costs associated with benlate fungicide and other discontinued businesses.
in
the aggregate, sales in other for 2009, 2008 and 2007 represent less than 1percent of total segment sales.
pre-tax loss of $171million compared to a loss of $181million in 2008. the lower pre-tax loss for the year was mainly due to the net
year-over-year
impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities, and lower pre-tax loss for applied biosciences.
pre-tax loss of $181million compared to a loss of $224million in 2007. the improvement for the year was mainly due to a benefit of $51million from a litigation
settlement in 2008 and the absence of a $69million charge recorded in 2007 for litigation related to a discontinued business.
liquidity& capital resources
management believes the company's ability to generate cash from operations, coupled with cost reduction initiatives and access to capital markets,
will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, debt maturities and other cash needs. the company's liquidity needs can be met
through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines,
equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. the company's current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings have not been materially impacted by the current credit
environment. in addition, cash generating actions have been implemented including spending reductions and restructuring to better align capital expenditures and costs. the company will continue to
monitor the financial markets in order to respond to changing conditions.
pursuant
to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is
compelling. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of $6.1billion as of december31, 2009, provide primary liquidity to support all

the company's cash provided by operating activities was $4.7billion in 2009, a $1.6billion increase from the $3.1billion generated in
2008. the increase is primarily due to the benefit of the weaker dollar, which was hedged by forward exchange contracts in investing activities.
the
company's cash provided by operating activities was $3.1billion in 2008, a $1.2billion decrease from the $4.3billion generated in 2007. the decrease is primarily due to
lower earnings and the impact of the stronger dollar on working capital items, which was hedged by forward exchange contracts in investing activities.

in 2009, cash used for investing activities totaled $4.3billion compared to $1.6billion used in 2008. the $2.7billion increase was mainly
due to the increase in investments in short-term financial instruments and the change in forward exchange contract settlements, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures.
in
2008, cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6billion compared to $1.8billion used in 2007. the $140million decrease was mainly due to higher proceeds from forward

purchases
of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.3billion, $2.0billion and $1.6billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. the decrease in 2009 spending is primarily
related to the company's cash management initiatives and matching capacity with market demand. the company expects 2010 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be $1.6billion, an
increase of $300million over 2009, driven by growth investments.

free cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and should not be viewed as an alternative to
gaap measures of performance. all companies do not calculate non-gaap financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent
with the methodologies used by other companies. the company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates
operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities, and other financing activities. free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash
flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.
the
company exceeded its 2009 free cash flow goal of $2.5billion due to working capital productivity and the currency impact on net monetary assets with the offset in forward exchange contract
settlements within investing activities. for 2010, the company has set a free cash flow target of greater than $1.5billion, while continuing to support growth investments including
$1.6billion of capital investment and working capital increases from improved levels of demand.
total
debt at december31, 2009 was $11.0billion, a $1.4billion increase from december31, 2008. the proceeds from the increased borrowings were primarily invested in
short-term financial instruments.
total
debt at december31, 2008 was $9.7billion, a $2.4billion increase from december31, 2007. the proceeds from the increased borrowings were invested in cash
equivalents and used for general corporate purposes.
dividends
paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.5billion in 2009 and 2008, and $1.4billion in 2007. dividends per share of common stock were $1.64 in 2009 and 2008, and
$1.52 in 2007. the common dividend declared in the first quarter 2010 was the company's 422ndconsecutive dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.
the
company's board of directors authorized a $2billion share buyback plan in june 2001. during 2009, 2008, and 2007, there were no purchases of stock under this program. as of
december31, 2009, the company has purchased 20.5million shares at a total cost of $962million. management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining shares
of stock under this plan.
in
october 2005, the board of directors authorized a $5billion share buyback plan. in 2007, the company purchased 34.7million shares for $1.7billion, thereby, completing this
program. see note21 to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of shares activity.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $6.1billion at december31, 2009, $3.7billion at
december31, 2008 and $1.4billion at december31, 2007. the $2.4 increase from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to cash proceeds from increased borrowings and cash generated from
general business activities. the $2.3billion increase from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to net increase in borrowings.

certain guarantee contracts
indemnifications
in
connection with acquisitions and divestitures, the company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions
and divestitures and related business activities prior to the completion of the transaction. the term of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and

liabilities, is generally indefinite. in addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law, against
liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. if the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability
increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. the maximum amount of potential future
payments is generally unlimited. the carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of december31, 2009 and 2008 were $100million and $110million, respectively. although
it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or
range of loss. no assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist.
in
connection with the 2004 sale of the majority of the net assets of textiles and interiors, the company indemnified invista against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and
environmental matters and other
representations and warranties under the purchase and sale agreement. the estimated fair value of the indemnity obligations under the purchase and sale agreement is $70million and is included
in the indemnifications balance of $100million at december31, 2009. under the purchase and sale agreement, the company's total indemnification obligation for the majority of the
representations and warranties cannot exceed $1.4billion. the other indemnities are not subject to this limit. in march 2008, invista filed suit in the southern district of new york alleging
that certain representations and warranties in the purchase and sale agreement were breached and, therefore, that dupont is obligated to indemnify it. dupont disagrees with the extent and value of
invista's claims. dupont has not changed its estimate of its total indemnification obligation under the purchase and sale agreement as a result of the lawsuit.
obligations for equity affiliates and others
the
company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other affiliated and
unaffiliated companies. at december31, 2009, the company had directly guaranteed $684million of such obligations, plus $119million relating to guarantees of obligations for
divested subsidiaries. this represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. the company would be required to
perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. at december31, 2009 and 2008, a liability of $146million and $121million, respectively, was
recorded for these obligations, representing the amount of payment/performance risk which the company deems probable. this liability is principally related to obligations of the company's polyester
films joint venture which are guaranteed by the company.
existing
guarantees for customers, suppliers and other unaffiliated companies arose as part of contractual agreements. existing guarantees for equity affiliates and other affiliated companies arose
for liquidity needs in normal operations. in certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers.
the
company has guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities of its divested subsidiaries including conoco and consolidation coal sales company. conoco and consolidation coal sales company have
indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. no material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. at december31,
2009, the company had no liabilities recorded for these obligations.
additional
information with respect to the company's guarantees is included in note20 to the consolidated financial statements. historically, the company has not had to make significant
payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.
master operating leases
prior to november 2009, the company leased short-lived equipment under a master operating lease program. lease payments for these assets totaled
$38million in 2009, $55million in 2008 and $59million in 2007, and were reported as operating expenses in the consolidated income statements. the leases under this program were
considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities were not recorded on the consolidated balance

the company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these
contractual obligations.
long-term employee benefits
the company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. the company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a
long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. these plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners
and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees (other long-term employee benefits). approximately 80percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation
for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the u.s. benefit plans. pension coverage for employees of the
company's non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. the company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global
pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. where permitted by applicable law, the company
reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.
benefits
under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with
applicable laws and regulations. unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. the actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are
reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. no
contributions are required to be made to the principal u.s.pension plan in 2010 and no contributions are currently anticipated. contributions beyond 2010 are not determinable since the amount
of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. u.s.pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by
separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows.
funding
for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense.
in general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. the company contributed $306million in 2009 and anticipates that it will make approximately
$270million in contributions in 2010 to pension plans other than the principal u.s.pension plan.
in
august 2006, the company announced major changes to the pension and defined contribution benefits that cover the majority of its u.s.employees. effective january1, 2007, for such
employees hired on that date or thereafter, and effective january1, 2008, for such active employees on the rolls as of december31, 2006, the company contributes 100percent of
the first 6percent of the employee's contribution election. additionally, for such employees, the company contributes 3percent of each eligible employee's compensation regardless of
the employee's contribution election. the definition of eligible compensation has also been expanded to be similar to the definition of eligible compensation used in determining pension benefits. such
full service employees on the rolls as of december31, 2006 will also accrue additional benefits in the pension plan, but the annual rate of pension accrual is about one-third of
the previous rate. in addition, company-paid postretirement survivor benefits for such employees do not continue to grow after december31, 2007. such employees hired in the u.s.
after december31, 2006 do not participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans.
the
company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual
net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $323million, $326million and $315million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. this amount is expected to be about
$341million in 2010. changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes and changes in participant premiums, co-pays
and deductibles.

the company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. the following table summarizes the extent to

the above (benefits)/charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. the increase in
pension expense in 2009 primarily reflects unfavorable returns on pension assets during 2008. the decrease in pension expense in 2008 primarily reflects favorable returns on pension assets during
2007.
the
company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the
discount rate (see note22 to the consolidated financial statements). for 2010, long-term employee benefits expense is expected to increase by about $410million, principally
due to lower market-related value of pension assets.
other employee-related benefits
in october 2009, the company announced revisions to its vacation benefits policy covering all u.s.employees. effective december31,
2010, entitled vacation for the following year will no longer
vest at the end of each preceding year. in addition, vacation will be earned monthly and accrued on the first day of each calendar month during the year beginning in 2011. these revisions to the
company's vacation benefits policy will provide a one-time benefit of approximately $160million in 2010.
environmental matters
dupont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and
regulations. such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed
legal and regulatory requirements. in addition, dupont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and
discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity
of proposed chemicals regulation. the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be
significant for the foreseeable future.
environmental
operating costs
as
a result of its operations, dupont incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution
controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. the company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including
environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. related to these activities, dupont incurred
environmental operating costs of $483million in 2009, $525million in 2008 and $500million in 2007.
remediation
expenditures
rcra,
which extensively regulates the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental
contamination. if conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. in contrast to cercla, the costs of the rcra corrective action

program
are typically borne solely by the company. the company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. annual
expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. longer term, expenditures are subject to
considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. the company's expenditures associated with rcra and similar remediation activities were approximately $49million, $51million
and $47million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
from
time to time, the company receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a prp under cercla or
similar state statutes. cercla is often referred to as the superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted
operations or where company generated waste has been disposed. the company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. these
requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company's past
operations.
as
of december31, 2009, the company has been notified of potential liability under cercla or state laws at about 400 sites around the u.s., with active remediation under way at approximately
150 of these sites. in addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 165 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other prps or by participating in "de minimis buyouts"
with other prps whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. the company received notice of potential liability at three new sites during
2009 compared with five and six similar notices in 2008 and 2007, respectively. the company's expenditures associated with cercla and similar state remediation activities were approximately
$18million, $17million and $20million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
for
nearly all superfund sites, the company's potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus
that attributable to all other prps at any given site is typically relatively low. other prps at sites, where the company is a party, typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations
and, where they do not, or where prps cannot be located or have declared bankruptcy, the company's own share of liability has not materially increased. there are relatively few sites where the company
is a major participant and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites and at all cercla sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position,
liquidity or results of operations of the company.
total
expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under rcra, cercla and similar state and global laws were $72million, $81million and $68million in 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively.
remediation
accruals
at
december31, 2009, the consolidated balance sheets included an accrued liability of $396million related to activities under rcra, cercla and similar state
and global laws compared to $379million at december31, 2008. considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, particularly those related to rcra, and,
under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of december31, 2009. of the $396million accrued liability,
approximately ten percent was reserved for non-u.s. facilities. approximately 65percent of the reserve balance was attributable to rcra and similar remediation liabilities, while
about 25percent was attributable to cercla liabilities. remediation accruals of $89million, $103million and $76million were added to the reserve in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that a material loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site or
location is reasonably possible.

about 75percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2009 resulted from operations in the
u.s.total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to operations in 2009 decreased $56million versus 2008 due principally to decreased environmental research activities and a
year over year decline in the increase in the remediation accrual. the decrease in total pre-tax environmental expenses in 2009 versus 2008, compared to an increase of $52million
in 2008 versus 2007 is not material to dupont's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year
changes, if any in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on dupont's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
environmental
capital expenditures
in
2009, dupont spent approximately $89million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental
goals. the company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $125million in 2010. in the u.s., significant capital expenditures are
expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the clean air act (caa). until all caa regulatory
requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. total caa capital costs over the next two years are currently
estimated to range from $40million to $70million.
climate
change
dupont
believes that climate change is an important global issue that will present risks and opportunities to business and society at large. since the early 1990s when
dupont began taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company has achieved major global reductions in emissions. voluntary emissions reductions implemented by dupont and other companies
are valuable but alone will not be sufficient to effectively address a problem of this scale. dupont is actively engaged in the effort to develop constructive public policies to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy.

the
kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change entered into force in february 2005 and, while not ratified by the u.s., has spurred policy action by many other
countries and regions around the world including the european union. considerable international attention is now focused on development of a post-2012 international policy framework to
guide international action to address climate change when the kyoto protocol expires in 2012. proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect the
company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with
greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services.
at
the national and regional level, there are existing efforts to address climate change. several dupont facilities in the european union are regulated under the eu emissions trading scheme ("eu
ets.") in other countries, including the u.s., policy debate continues. the current unsettled policy environment in the u.s., adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those
relating to long-term capital investments. if in the absence of federal legislation, states were to implement programs mandating ghg emissions reductions, dupont, its suppliers and
customers could be competitively disadvantaged by the added administrative costs and burden of complying with a variety of state-specific requirements. a 2007 u.s.supreme court ruling directed
epa to determine whether carbon dioxide endangers human health and, if so, to take steps to regulate it under the caa. in december 2009, epa made a determination that carbon dioxide emissions endanger
human health and the environment requiring epa to pursue regulation of carbon dioxide emissions under the caa. such regulation by epa, in the absence of or in addition to federal legislation, could
result in more costly, less efficient facility-by-facility controls versus a federal, market-based cap and trade program. differences in regional or national legislation could
present challenges in a global marketplace highlighting the need for coordinated global policy action.
in
the fourth quarter 2009, epa issued the final mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule which requires reporting of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions in the united states beginning in 2010. epa may
adopt additional requirements under the rule. the rule requires suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial greenhouse gases, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric
tons or more per year of ghg emissions to submit annual reports to epa. dupont has about 30 sites that have a stake in one or more of the covered gases at which emissions monitoring equipment must be
installed. until all regulatory requirements under the rule are finalized, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding cost estimates. based on the final rule and epa's 2009 proposal regarding
additional requirements, management does not expect that the cost to comply with the rule will be material to its operations and consolidated financial position.
the
company assesses the potential risks that climate change could present, and looks for opportunities to make its overall portfolio less energy and emissions intensive. dupont weighs energy use when
investments or divestitures are considered. the company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a
low-carbon economy.
registration
the
goal of the u.s.toxic substances control act (tsca) is to prevent unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment associated with the manufacture,
processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of chemical substances. under tsca, the epa has established reporting, record-keeping, testing and control-related requirements for new and
existing chemicals. in september 2009, epa announced its
comprehensive approach to enhance the agency's current chemicals management program under tsca, including development of action plans. the agency's actions on chemicals may include initiating
regulatory action to label, restrict, or ban a chemical, or to require the submission of additional data needed to determine the risk a chemical may pose. also in 2009, epa announced its "essential
principle for reform of chemicals management legislation." the company is monitoring these developments under tsca.
in
december 2006, the european union adopted a new regulatory framework concerning the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals. this regulatory framework known as reach entered into
force on june1, 2007. one
table of contents
partii
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued
of
its main objectives is the protection of human health and the environment. reach requires manufacturers and importers to gather information on the properties of their substances that meet certain
volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by the european chemicals agency. the regulation also contains a mechanism for the progressive
substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. complete registrations containing extensive data on the characteristics of the chemical will be required
in three phases, depending on production usage or tonnage imported per year, and the toxicological criteria of the chemical. the first registrations for substances that were preregistered in 2008 are
required in 2010; subsequent registrations are due in 2013 and 2018. new substances that will be manufactured or imported need to be registered prior to being placed on the market (also known as non
phase in substances). the company is working on both the 2010 registrations as well as the non phase in registrations. by june1, 2013, the commission will review whether substances with
endocrine disruptive properties should be authorized if safer alternatives exist. by june1, 2019, the commission will determine whether to extend the duty to warn from substances of very high
concern to those that could be dangerous or unpleasant. management does not expect that the costs to comply with reach will be material to its operations and consolidated financial position.
facility security
dupont recognizes that the security and safety of its operations are critical to its employees, neighbors and, indeed, to the future of the company.
as such, the company has merged chemical site security into its safety core value where it serves as an integral part of its long standing safety culture. physical security measures have been combined
with process safety measures (including the use of inherently safer technology), administrative procedures and emergency response preparedness into an integrated security plan. the company has
conducted vulnerability assessments at operating facilities in the u.s. and high priority sites worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical
and cyber attacks. dupont is partnering with carriers, including railroad, shipping and trucking companies, to secure chemicals in transit.
in
april 2007, the department of homeland security (dhs) issued an interim final rule (rule) that establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of u.s. chemical facilities.
covered chemical facilities are required to prepare security vulnerability assessments that identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement site security plans that include
measures satisfying the identified risk-based performance standards. the rule contains associated provisions addressing inspections and audits, recordkeeping, and the protection of
information that constitutes chemical-terrorism vulnerability
information. dhs can seek compliance through the issuance of orders, including orders assessing civil penalty and orders for the cessation of operations.
in
june of 2008 dhs notified those facilities that were preliminarily determined to be covered by the rule's security requirements. dupont facilities that were preliminarily determined to be covered
conducted and submitted security vulnerability assessments to dhs. based on its review of these assessments, dhs made final determinations as to which facilities were covered and the
risk-base tier into which each falls. these facilities are submitting site security plans to dhs. once dhs has reviewed and provided preliminary approval of the plans, it will meet with
facilities before providing final approval. dupont has already devoted substantial effort and resources in assessing security vulnerabilities and taking steps to reinforce security at its chemical
manufacturing facilities. until each facility develops and receives dhs approval for its site security plan, specific requirements cannot be determined and considerable uncertainty exists regarding
estimates for future capital expenditures. however, based on guidance issued by dhs regarding its risk-based performance standards, it is expected that new security measures will need to
be implemented at the regulated facilities and that total capital costs to implement such measures over the next four years will be about $50million.
pfoa
dupont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers, marketing many of them under the teflon and
zonyl brands. all of these products are part of the performance chemicals segment.

fluoropolymer
resins and dispersions are high-performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics, telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation, automotive fuel
systems, computer chip processing equipment, weather-resistant/breathable apparel and non-stick cookware. fluorotelomers are used to make soil, stain and grease repellants for paper,
apparel, upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings.
a
form of pfoa (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. for over
50years, dupont purchased its pfoa needs from a third party, but beginning in the fall of 2002, it began producing pfoa to support the manufacture of fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. pfoa
is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products.
dupont
performance elastomers,llc (dpe) uses pfoa in the manufacture of raw materials to manufacture kalrez perfluoroelastomer parts. pfoa is also used in the manufacture of some
fluoroelastomers
marketed by dpe under the viton trademark. the wholly owned subsidiary is a part of the performance materials segment.
pfoa
is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. as a result, the epa initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources
of pfoa in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to pfoa is occurring. in 2005, the epa issued a draft risk assessment on pfoa stating that the cancer data for pfoa may be best
described as "suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential" under the epa's guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment. at epa's request, the
science advisory board (sab) reviewed and commented on the scientific soundness of this assessment. in its may 2006 report, the sab set forth the view, based on laboratory studies in rats, that the
human carcinogenic potential of pfoa is more consistent with the guidelines' descriptor of "likely to be carcinogenic." however, the report stated that additional data should be considered before the
epa finalizes its risk assessment of pfoa. the epa has acknowledged that it will consider additional data, including new research and testing, and has indicated that another sab review will be sought
after the epa makes its risk assessment. dupont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the sab report. although the epa has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty
regarding potential risks associated with pfoa, it also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about pfoa.
dupont
respects the epa's position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of pfoa and dupont and other companies have outlined plans to continue research, emission
reduction and product stewardship activities to help address the epa's questions. in january 2006, dupont pledged its commitment to the epa's 2010/15 pfoa stewardship program. the epa program asks
participants (1)to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of pfoa, pfoa precursors and related higher
homologue chemicals and (2)to commit to working toward the elimination of pfoa, pfoa precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. in
october 2009, (for the year 2008), dupont reported to the epa that it had achieved about a 99percent reduction of pfoa emissions in u.s. manufacturing facilities. the company achieved about a
98percent reduction in global manufacturing emissions, exceeding the epa's 2010 objective. dupont will work individually and with others in the industry to inform epa's regulatory counterparts
in the european union, canada, china and japan about these activities and pfoa in general, including emissions reductions from dupont's facilities, reformulation of the company's fluoropolymer
dispersions and new manufacturing processes for fluorotelomers products.
dupont
introduced in late 2006, echelon technology which reduces the pfoa content 99percent in aqueous fluoropolymer dispersion products. dupont has converted customers
representing over 95percent of the sales volume for these product lines to newly formulated echelon technology.
in
february 2007, dupont announced its commitment to no longer make, use or buy pfoa by 2015, or sooner if possible. dupont has developed pfoa replacement technology and successfully used this
technology in its global manufacturing facilities to produce test materials for all major fluoropolymer product lines. dupont has begun to supply fluoropolymer products without pfoa to customers for
testing in their processes, and is working to obtain appropriate regulatory approvals for this technology.

the first quarter 2008, dupont introduced its next generation fluorotelomer products. the products are marketed as dupont capstone products for use in home furnishings,
stone and tile, fire fighting foam, fluorosurfactants, textiles and leather goods. the u.s.food and drug administration (fda) has authorized two new dupont grease and oil repellents for use in
paper packaging. additional products will be introduced for paper packaging and other end use markets pending appropriate regulatory approvals.
in
the fourth quarter of 2009, epa announced the start of a comprehensive approach to enhancing epa's current chemicals management program under tsca. as part of this enhancement, epa released four
existing chemical action plans (the plans) in december 2009 of which one covers long-chain perfluorinated chemicals (pfcs) including pfoa. the plans outline the risks that the use of the
specified chemicals may present and the specific steps that epa will take to address concerns. epa indicated that it intends to propose regulatory actions in 2012 to address the potential risks from
pfcs, but the specific steps noted in the pfcs plan are generally consistent with the requirements of the 2010/2015 pfoa stewardship program.
in
january 2009, the epa issued a national provisional health advisory for pfoa of 0.4 parts per billion (ppb) in drinking water. in march 2009, epa and dupont entered an order on consent under the
safe drinking water act (sdwa) reflecting an action level of 0.40 ppb (see note20 to the consolidated financial statements).
in
february 2007, the new jersey department of environmental protection (njdep) identified a preliminary drinking-water guidance level for pfoa of 0.04 ppb as part of the first phase of an ongoing
process to establish a state drinking-water standard. during the first quarter 2009, the njdep began the process to establish a permanent maximum contaminant level (mcl) for pfoa in drinking water.
the process is estimated to take 1 to 2years. while the njdep will continue sampling and evaluation of data from all sources, it has not recommended a change in consumption patterns.
based
on extensive health and toxicological studies, dupont believes that pfoa exposure does not pose a health risk to the general public. human studies have evaluated many health endpoints across a
wide range of exposed populations. while some associations have been reported, no human health effects are known to be caused by pfoa. a considerable number of human health studies are ongoing and
results will be available over the next several years.
there
have not been any regulatory or government actions that prohibit the production or use of pfoa. however, there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future. products currently
manufactured by the company representing approximately $1billion of 2009 revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition. dupont has established reserves in connection with
certain pfoa environmental and litigation matters (see note20 to the consolidated financial statements).

item 7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
financial instruments
derivatives and other hedging instruments
in the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest
rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. derivative instruments utilized include forwards, options, futures and swaps. the counterparties to these contractual
arrangements are major financial institutions and major commodity exchanges.
the
company hedges certain foreign currency denominated revenues, monetary assets and liabilities, certain business-specific foreign currency exposures and certain energy and agricultural feedstock
purchases.
concentration of credit risk
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments,
accounts receivable and derivatives.
as
part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service dupont and monitors actual
exposures versus established limits. the company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.
the
company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. these financial institutions are
generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.
the
company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. as of december31, 2009, no one individual customer balance represented more than
5percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity
associated with the company's global businesses.
the
company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. as a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain
circumstances. length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region.
foreign currency risk
the company's objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign
currency rate changes. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the u.s.dollar value of its existing foreign
currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, and cash flows.
the
company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. the
primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net
of related tax effects, are minimized. the company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain foreign currency-denominated revenues so that
gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s.dollar value of the related foreign currency-denominated revenues. the objective of the hedge program is to reduce earnings and
cash flow volatility related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the usd amount of future firm commitments
denominated in a foreign currency. decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and
duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash
requirements.
interest rate risk
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
interest
rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed or floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on usd libor. interest rate swaps allow the
company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt.
commodity price risk
the company enters into over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price
fluctuations on certain raw material purchases.
a
portion of certain energy feedstock purchases are hedged to reduce price volatility using fixed price swaps and options.
the
company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the
market price of grain during the contract period. derivative instruments having a high correlation to the underlying commodity are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating
growers.
the
company utilizes derivatives to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. these derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in
offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk.
additional
details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in note24 to the consolidated financial statements.

the financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are included herein, commencing on pagef-1 of this report.
item 9.changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure
none.
item 9a.controls and procedures
the company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures to give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the company's reports filed or submitted under the
securities exchange act of 1934 (exchange act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec. these controls and procedures also
give reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
as
of december31, 2009, the company's chief executive officer (ceo) and chief financial officer (cfo), together with management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company's
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rules13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the exchange act.
based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
there
has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. the company has completed its evaluation of its internal controls and has concluded that the company's system of internal controls over
financial reporting was effective as of december31, 2009 (see pagef-2).
the
company continues to take appropriate steps to enhance the reliability of its internal control over financial reporting. management has identified areas for improvement and discussed them with the
company's audit committee and independent registered public accounting firm.

management's report on responsibility for financial statements
management is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and the other financial information contained in this annual report on
form10-k. the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap) and are considered by
management to present fairly the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the financial statements include some amounts that are based on management's best estimates and
judgments. the financial statements have been audited by the company's independent registered public accounting firm, pricewaterhousecoopersllp. the purpose of their audit is to express an
opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form10-k present fairly, in all material respects, the company's financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. their report is presented on the following page.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in
rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934. the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap. the company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
i.pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company;
ii.provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the company; and
iii.provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
internal
control over financial reporting has certain inherent limitations which may not prevent or detect misstatements. in addition, changes in conditions and business practices may cause variation
in the effectiveness of internal controls.
management
assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2009, based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal control-integrated framework. based on its assessment and those criteria, management concluded
that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2009.
pricewaterhousecoopersllp,

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and the board of directors of
e. i. du pont de nemours and company:
in
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of e. i. du pont de nemours and company and its subsidiaries at december31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended december31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under item15(a) (2)presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2009, based on
criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway
commission (coso). the company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in "management's report on internal control over financial reporting" appearing on
pagef-2. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.
as
discussed in the consolidated financial statements, the company changed the manner in which it accounted for uncertainty in income taxes in 2007.
a
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

e. i. du pont de nemours and company  notes to the consolidated financial statements (dollars in millions, except per share)
1.summary of significant accounting policies
the company follows generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap). the significant accounting
policies described below, together with the other notes that follow, are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
preparation of financial statements
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
actual results could differ from those estimates.
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company, subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained and variable
interest entities (vies) for which dupont is the primary beneficiary. for those consolidated subsidiaries in which the company's ownership is less than 100percent, the outside stockholders'
interests are shown as noncontrolling interests. investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried on the equity basis. this
includes majority-owned entities for which the company does not consolidate because a minority investor holds substantive participating rights. investments in affiliates over which the company does
not have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method or as available-for-sale securities.
revenue recognition
the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. the company's revenues are from the sale of a wide range of products to a
diversified base of customers around the world. revenue for product sales is recognized upon delivery, when title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured and
pricing is fixed or determinable. substantially all product sales are sold
fob (free on board) shipping point or, with respect to non-u.s. customers, an equivalent basis. accruals are made for sales returns and other allowances based on the company's experience.
the company accounts for cash sales incentives as a reduction in sales and noncash sales incentives as a charge to cost of goods sold or selling expense, depending on the nature of the incentive.
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales and costs incurred by the company for the delivery of goods are classified as cost of goods sold and other
operating charges in the consolidated income statements. taxes on revenue-producing transactions are excluded from net sales.
the
company periodically enters into prepayment contracts with customers in the agriculture& nutrition segment and receives advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods.
these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as
shipments are made and title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer.
licensing
and royalty income is recognized in accordance with agreed upon terms, when performance obligations are satisfied, the amount is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably
assured.
cash and cash equivalents
cash equivalents represent investments with maturities of three months or less from time of purchase. they are carried at cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
investments in securities
marketable securities represent investments in fixed and floating rate financial instruments with maturities greater than three months and up to
twelve months at time of purchase. they are classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost.
other
assets include long-term investments in securities, which comprise investments for which market values are not readily available (cost investments) and
available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value (see note14).

e. i. du pont de nemours and company
notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
fair value measurements
under the accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures, a fair value hierarchy was established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level3 measurements). a financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to
the fair value measurement.
the
company uses the following valuation techniques to measure fair value for its assets and liabilities:
level1
quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
level2
significant other observable inputs (e.g.quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted
prices that are observable such as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs);
level3
unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are valued based on management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
inventories
the majority of the company's inventories are valued at cost, as determined by the last-in, first-out (lifo) method; in the
aggregate, such valuations are not in excess of market. seed inventories are valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out (fifo) method, or market.
elements
of cost in inventories include raw materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. stores and supplies are valued at cost or market, whichever is lower; cost is generally determined by
the average cost method.
property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment (pp&e) is carried at cost and is depreciated using the straight-line method. pp&e placed in service prior to
1995 is depreciated under the sum-of-the-years' digits method or other substantially similar methods. substantially all equipment and buildings are depreciated over
useful lives ranging from 15 to 25years. capitalizable costs associated with computer software for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 7years.
when assets are surrendered, retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, their gross carrying values and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and included in determining gain or
loss on such disposals.
maintenance
and repairs are charged to operations; replacements and improvements are capitalized.
goodwill and other intangible assets
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually; however, these tests are performed more frequently when
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the company's fair value methodology is based on quoted market prices, if available. if quoted market prices are
not available, an estimate of fair market value is made based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies including present value techniques. impairment losses are included in cost of
goods sold and other operating charges.
definite-lived
intangible assets, such as purchased and licensed technology, patents and customer lists are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally for periods ranging from 5 to
20years. the company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the consolidated balance sheets.
impairment of long-lived assets
the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are separately
identifiable and are less than its carrying value. in that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value
f-9
table of contents
e. i. du pont de nemours and company
notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
exceeds
the fair value of the long-lived asset. the company's fair value methodology is based on quoted market prices, if available. if quoted market prices are not available, an estimate
of fair market value is made based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies including present value techniques. long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale
are classified as held for use until their disposal. long-lived assets to be disposed by sale are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair
market value less cost to sell and depreciation is discontinued.
research and development
research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
environmental
accruals for environmental matters are recorded in operating expenses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated. accrued liabilities do not include claims against third parties and are not discounted.
costs
related to environmental remediation are charged to expense. other environmental costs are also charged to expense unless they increase the value of the property or reduce or prevent
contamination from future operations, in which case, they are capitalized.
asset retirement obligations
the company records asset retirement obligations at fair value at the time the liability is incurred. accretion expense is recognized as an operating
expense using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate in effect when the liability was recognized. the associated asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part of the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset, generally for periods ranging from 1 to 20years.
litigation
the company accrues for liabilities related to litigation matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.
insurance/self-insurance
the company self-insures certain risks where permitted by law or regulation, including workers' compensation, vehicle liability and
employee related benefits. liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. for other
risks, the company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance, reflecting comprehensive reviews of relevant risks.
income taxes
the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, deferred
taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or
payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the company's assets and liabilities and
are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not
be realized. provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely invested.
investment tax credits or grants are accounted for in the period earned (the flow-through method). interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits is included in miscellaneous income
and expenses, net, under other income, net. income tax related penalties are included in the provision for income taxes.
f-10
table of contents
e. i. du pont de nemours and company
notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
foreign currency translation
the u.s. dollar (usd) is the functional currency of most of the company's worldwide operations. for subsidiaries where the usd is the functional
currency, all foreign currency asset and liability amounts are remeasured into usd at end-of-period exchange rates, except for inventories, prepaid expenses, property, plant
and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured at historical rates. foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during the year,
except for expenses related to balance sheet amounts remeasured at historical exchange rates. exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and
liabilities are included in income in the period in which they occur.
for
subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies are translated into usd at end-of-period exchange
rates and the resultant translation adjustments are reported, net of their related tax effects, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. assets and
liabilities denominated in other than the local currency are remeasured into the local currency prior to translation into usd and the resultant exchange gains or losses are included in income in the
period in which they occur. income and expenses are translated into usd at average exchange rates in effect during the period.
variable interest entities (vies)
the company consolidates vies where dupont is considered the primary beneficiary. at december31, 2009, the assets, liabilities and operations
of these entities are not material to the consolidated financial statements of the company.
the
company is also involved with other entities that are vies for which the company is not currently the primary beneficiary. future events may require these vies to be consolidated if the company
becomes the primary beneficiary. at december31, 2009, the assets and liabilities of the other vies are not material to the consolidated financial statements of the company. the company's share
of the net income (loss) of these vies is included in other income, net, in the consolidated income statements and is not material.
hedging and trading activities
derivative instruments are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values. for derivative instruments designated as fair value
hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments will generally be offset on the income statement by changes in the fair value of the hedged items. for derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of any hedge is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until it is cleared to earnings during the same period in which the
hedged item affects earnings. the ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are
recorded in current period earnings.
in
the event that a derivative designated as a hedge of a firm commitment or an anticipated transaction is terminated prior to the maturation of the hedged transaction, gains or losses realized at
termination are deferred and included in the measurement of the hedged transaction. if a hedged transaction matures, or is sold, extinguished, or terminated prior to the maturity of a derivative
designated as a hedge of such transaction, gains or losses associated with the derivative through the date the transaction matured are included in the measurement of the hedged transaction and the
derivative is reclassified as for trading purposes. derivatives designated as a hedge of an anticipated transaction are reclassified as for trading purposes if the anticipated transaction is no longer
probable.
cash
flows from derivative instruments accounted for as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges are reported in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged. cash flows from
all other derivative instruments are generally reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. see note24 for additional discussion regarding the company's
objectives and strategies for derivative instruments.
reclassifications
certain reclassifications of prior years' data have been made to conform to 2009 classifications.

subsequent events
the company's management has evaluated the period from january1, 2010 through february17, 2010, the date the financial statements
herein were issued, for subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. in january 2010, the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar for the
first time since 2005 in an effort to stabilize the economy. this action is expected to impact the company's first quarter 2010 financial results. refer to note28 for further details. no
additional material subsequent events were identified.
accounting standards issued not yet adopted
in june 2009, fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, which is applied to financial asset transfers on or
after the effective date, which is january1, 2010 for the company's financial statements. the new requirement limits the circumstances in which a financial asset may be
de-recognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset. the concept of a qualifying special-purpose
entity, which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers, is removed by the new requirement. the company expects that this will not have a material effect on its financial
position or results of operations.
in
june 2009, fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for variable interest entities, which is effective for reporting periods beginning after november15, 2009. the amendments change
the process for how an enterprise determines which party consolidates a variable interest entity (vie) to a primarily qualitative analysis. the party that consolidates the vie (the primary
beneficiary) is defined as the party with (1)the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly affect the vie's economic performance and (2)the obligation to absorb
losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie. upon adoption, reporting enterprises must reconsider their conclusions on whether an entity should be consolidated and should a change
result, the effect on net assets will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. the company expects that upon adoption this will not have a material effect on its financial

in 2008, the company implemented the requirements for accounting of financial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value.
effective january1, 2009, the company prospectively implemented the requirements for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities reported or disclosed at fair
value, except for non-financial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).
the
company has determined that its financial assets and liabilities are level1 and level2 in the fair value hierarchy. see note22 for a schedule of pension assets measured at
fair value on a recurring basis. at december31, 2009, the following financial assets and financial liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the type of inputs shown:

company routinely uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign
currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. the objective of this program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies in order to minimize, on an

impact.

5.employee separation/asset related charges, net
during 2009, the company initiated additional actions to address the continuation of the global economic recession through a global
restructuring program described below. at december31, 2009, total liabilities relating to current and prior restructuring activities were $300.
2009 restructuring program
in second quarter 2009, in response to the protracted global economic recession, the company committed to an initiative to address the steep and
extended downturn in motor vehicle and construction markets, and the extension of the downturn into industrial markets. the plan was designed to restructure asset and fixed cost bases in order to
improve long-term competitiveness, simplify business processes, and maximize pre-tax operating income. the plan included the elimination of about 2,000 positions by severance
principally located in the united states of america (u.s.). as a result, a charge of $340 was recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net, which pertains to the following financial
statement line items; cost of goods sold and other operating charges 60percent, selling, general and administrative expenses 30percent, and
research and development expenses 10percent. this charge includes $212 of severance and related benefits costs, $24 of other non-personnel costs and $104 of
asset related charges, including $77 for asset shut downs and write-offs, $11 for asset impairments and $16 for accelerated depreciation.
the
2009 restructuring program charge of $340 reduced segment earnings as follows: electronics& communications$43; performance
chemicals$66; performance coatings$65; performance materials$110; safety&
protection$55; and other$1.
in
the fourth quarter of 2009, the company recorded a net reduction of $30 in the estimated costs associated with the 2009 restructuring program. this net reduction was primarily due to lower than
estimated individual severance costs and work force reductions through non-severance programs. the net reduction of $30 impacted segment earnings for the twelve months ended
december31, 2009 as follows: electronics and communications$6; performance chemicals$9; performance
coatings$(11); performance materials$23; safety& protection$8; and
other$(5).
there
were $33 of cash payments related to the 2009 restructuring program during 2009. as of december31, 2009, approximately 1,000 employees have been separated related to the 2009
restructuring program, and about 150 positions were eliminated through other non-severance programs. the company expects this initiative and all related payments to be substantially
complete by the end of 2010.

2008 restructuring program
during 2008, in response to the challenging economic environment, the company initiated a global restructuring program to reduce costs and improve
profitability across its businesses. the program included the elimination of approximately 2,500 positions principally located in western europe and the u.s.primarily supporting the motor
vehicle and construction markets. as a result, a charge of $535 was recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net, which pertains to the cost of goods sold and other operating charges
financial statement line item. this charge included $287 related to employee severance costs and $248 of asset related charges, including $111 for asset shut-downs, $119 for asset
impairments and $18 of other non-personnel charges.
the
2008 restructuring program charge of $535 reduced 2008 segment earnings as follows: agriculture& nutrition$18; electronics&
communications$37; performance chemicals$50; performance coatings$209; performance
materials$94; safety& protection$96; and other$31.
in
2009, the company recorded a $100 net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2008 restructuring program. this net reduction was primarily due to lower than estimated individual
severance costs and workforce reductions through non-severance programs. the $100 net reduction impacted segment earnings for the year ended december31, 2009 as follows:
agriculture& nutrition$1; performance chemicals$3; performance coatings$61; performance
materials$29; safety& protection$2; and other$4.
there
were $110 of cash payments related to the 2008 restructuring program in 2009. as of december31, 2009, approximately 1,700 employees have been separated related to the 2008 global
restructuring program, and about 400 positions were eliminated through other non-severance programs. the program is estimated to be complete by the end of 2010.

the drop in u.s. pre-tax earnings from 2008 to 2009 is primarily driven by two factors, overall decline in the u.s. economy as well as exchange. in
2008 the u.s. recorded $141 of exchange gains associated with the hedging program. however, in 2009, the program resulted in the company recording $485 of exchange losses. this swing in the exchange
gains and losses year over year combined with the underlying decline in the u.s. economy accounts for the significant decrease in the u.s. earnings per the chart above. while the taxation of the
amounts reflected on the chart above does not correspond precisely to the jurisdiction of taxation (due to taxation in multiple countries, exchange gains/losses, etc.), it represents a reasonable
approximation of the income before income taxes split between u.s. and international jurisdictions. see note24 for additional information regarding the company's hedging program.
under
the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the company operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward or back,
subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or taxes payable in future or prior years. at december31, 2009, the tax effect of such carryforwards/backs, net of valuation
allowance approximated $1,628. of this amount, $1,326 has no expiration date, $50 expires after 2009 but before the end of 2014 and $252 expires after 2014.
at
december31, 2009, unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. totaling $11,279 were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. no deferred tax liability has been recognized with regard
to the remittance of such earnings. it is not practical to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted to theu.s.
each
year the company files hundreds of tax returns in the various national, state and local income taxing jurisdictions in which it operates. these tax returns are subject to examination and possible
challenge by the taxing authorities. positions challenged by the taxing authorities may be settled or appealed by the company. as a result, there is an uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
company's financial statements in accordance with accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. in january 2007, the company implemented new provisions for the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes, which defines criteria that an individual income tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise's financial
statements and provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, accounting for interest in penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
the
company and/or its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, and various states and non-u.s. jurisdictions. with few exceptions, the company is no longer
subject to u.s.federal, state and local, or non-u.s.income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999. it is reasonably possible that net reductions to the
company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $50 to $75 within the next twelve months

germplasm is the pool of genetic source material and body of knowledge gained from the development and delivery stage of plant breeding.
the company recognized germplasm as an intangible asset upon the acquisition of pioneer. this intangible asset is expected to contribute to cash flows beyond the foreseeable future and there are no
legal, regulatory, contractual, or other factors which limit its useful life. prior to the adoption of the requirements for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, the company amortized
germplasm on a straight-line basis over a period of forty years, the maximum period previously allowed under generally accepted accounting principles.
the aggregate pre-tax amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was $252 for 2009, $275 for 2008, and $213 for 2007. the estimated
aggregate pre-tax amortization expense for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 is $184, $188, $191, $190 and $175, respectively, which are primarily reported in cost of goods sold and other

20.commitments and contingent liabilities
guarantees
product warranty liability
the company warrants that its products meet standard specifications. the company's product warranty liability as of december31, 2009 and 2008
was $17 and $24, respectively. estimates for warranty costs are based on historical claims experience.
indemnifications
in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, the company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in
connection with these transactions and business activities prior to the completion of the transaction. the term of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product
liabilities, is generally indefinite. in addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law, against liabilities
incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. if the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a
result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. the maximum amount of potential future payments is
generally unlimited. the carrying amount recorded for all indemnifications as of december31, 2009 and december31, 2008 was $100 and $110, respectively. although it is reasonably
possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it
is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. no assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist.
in
connection with the 2004 sale of the majority of the net assets of textiles and interiors, the company indemnified the purchasers, subsidiaries of koch industries,inc. (invista), against
certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters and other representations and warranties under the purchase and sale agreement. the estimated fair value of the
indemnity obligations under the purchase and sale agreement was $70 and was included in the indemnifications balance of $100 at december31, 2009. under the purchase and sale agreement, the
company's total indemnification obligation for the majority of the representations and warranties cannot exceed $1,400. the other indemnities are not subject to this limit. in march 2008, invista
filed suit in the southern district of new york alleging that certain representations and warranties in the purchase and sale agreement were breached and, therefore, that dupont is obligated to
indemnify it. dupont disagrees with the extent and value of invista's claims. dupont has not changed its estimate of its total indemnification obligation under the purchase and sale agreement as a
result of the lawsuit.
obligations for equity affiliates& others
the company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers
and other affiliated and unaffiliated companies. at december31, 2009, the company had directly guaranteed $684 of such obligations, and $119 relating to guarantees of historical obligations
for divested subsidiaries. this represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company
f-26
table of contents
e. i. du pont de nemours and company
notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
could
be required to make under the guarantees. the company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party.
the
company assesses the payment/performance risk by assigning default rates based on the duration of the guarantees. these default rates are assigned based on the external credit rating of the
counterparty or through internal credit analysis and historical default history for counterparties that do not have published credit ratings. for counterparties without an external rating or available
credit history, a cumulative average default rate is used.
at
december31, 2009 and december31, 2008, a liability of $146 and $121, respectively, was recorded for these obligations, representing the amount of payment/performance risk for which
the company deems probable. this liability is principally related to obligations of the company's polyester films joint venture, which are guaranteed by the company.
in
certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral, as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. assuming liquidation, these assets are estimated to cover
approximately 32percent of the $358 of guaranteed obligations of customers and suppliers. set forth below are the company's guaranteed obligations at december31, 2009:

conoco and consolidation coal sales company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees.
operating leases
the company uses various leased facilities and equipment in its operations. the terms for these leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement.
prior
to november 2009, the company leased short-lived equipment under a master operating lease program. lease payments for these assets totaled $38 in 2009, $55 in 2008 and $59 in 2007, and were
reported as operating expenses in the consolidated income statements. the leases under this program were considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities were not
recorded on the consolidated balance
sheets. in november 2009 the lease was terminated. the company purchased the assets for a total of $53, the residual value of the assets at the lease termination date.
future
minimum lease payments (including residual value guarantee amounts) under non-cancelable operating leases are $221, $182, $155, $123 and $88 for the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2014, respectively, and $147 for

years and are not reduced by non-cancelable minimum sublease rentals due in the future in the amount of $11. net rental expense under operating leases was $302 in 2009, $320 in
2008, and $322 in 2007.
asset retirement obligations
the company has recorded asset retirement obligations primarily associated with closure, reclamation and removal costs for mining operations related
to the production of titanium dioxide in performance chemicals. the company's asset retirement obligation liabilities were $56 and $60 at december31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
litigation
pfoa
regulatory and environmental actions
in january 2009, the u.s.environmental protection agency (epa) issued a national provisional health advisory for pfoa of 0.4 parts per billion
(ppb) in drinking water. in march 2009, epa and dupont entered an order on consent under the safe drinking water act (sdwa) reflecting an action level of 0.40 ppb. under the terms of the 2009 consent
order, dupont will conduct surveys, sampling and analytical testing in the area around its washington works site located in parkersburg, west virginia. if tests indicate the presence of
pfoa, (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acids and its salts, including the ammonium salt), in drinking water at 0.40 ppb or greater, the company will offer treatment or an alternative supply of
drinking water. the 2009 consent order supersedes the november 2006 order on consent between dupont and epa which established a precautionary interim screening level for pfoa of 0.50 ppb in drinking
water sources in the area around the washington works site. all of dupont's remaining obligations under the 2006 consent order have been incorporated into the 2009 consent order.
in
late 2005 dupont and the epa entered into a memorandum of understanding (epa mou) that required dupont to monitor pfoa in the soil, air, water and biota around the washington works site. the
required third party peer review of the data generated in the monitoring process has been completed. the final report was issued in september 2009 and dupont's response was issued in the fourth
quarter 2009.
in
late 2009, dupont received an information request from epa under the clean water act (cwa) regarding previously reported historic disposal practices for waste generated by the washington works site
that may contain pfoa. in december 2009, a similar request was made under the resource conservation and recovery act (rcra) regarding the chambers works site in deepwater, new jersey. dupont is in the
process of responding to these requests.
in
2009 dupont entered into a voluntary agreement with the new jersey department of environmental protection, (njdep), to sample private wells within a two-mile radius of its chambers
works site in deepwater, new jersey for the presence of pfoa and treat any wells with pfoa above 0.40 ppb. dupont has completed its obligations under the agreement and is treating one well.
at
december31, 2009, dupont has accruals of about $0.5 to fund its activities described above.
epa administrative complaints
in july and december 2004, the epa filed administrative complaints against dupont alleging that the company failed to comply with the technical
reporting requirements of the toxic substances control act (tsca) and the rcra regarding pfoa. under a 2005 agreement settling the matter, the company paid civil fines of $10.25 and will complete two
supplemental environmental projects at a total cost of $6.25.
civil actions: drinking water
in august 2001, a class action, captioned leach v. dupont, was filed in west virginia state court against dupont and the lubeck public service
district. dupont uses pfoa as a processing aid to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions at various sites around the world including its washington works plant in west virginia. the
complaint alleged that residents living near the washington works facility had suffered, or may suffer, deleterious health effects from exposure to pfoa in drinking water. the relief sought included
damages for medical monitoring, diminution of property values and punitive damages plus injunctive relief to stop releases of pfoa. dupont and attorneys for the class reached a settlement agreement in
2004 and as a result, the company established accruals of $108 in 2004. the
f-28
table of contents
e. i. du pont de nemours and company
notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
agreement
was approved by the wood county circuit court on february28, 2005 after a fairness hearing. the settlement binds a class of approximately 80,000 residents. as defined by the court,
the class includes those individuals who have consumed, for at least one year, water containing 0.05 ppb or greater of pfoa from any of six designated public water sources or from sole source private
wells.
in
july 2005, the company paid the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and expenses of $23 and made a payment of $70, which class counsel has designated to fund a community health project. the company is also
funding a series of health studies by an independent science panel of experts in the communities exposed to pfoa to evaluate available scientific evidence on whether any probable link exists between
exposure to pfoa and human disease. the company expects the independent science panel to complete these health studies between 2009 and year-end 2011 at a total estimated cost of $29, of
which $5 was originally placed in an interest-bearing escrow account. in addition, the company is providing state-of-the art water treatment systems designed to reduce the
level of pfoa in water to six area water districts, including the little hocking water association (lhwa), until the science panel determines that pfoa does not cause disease or until applicable water
standards can be met without such treatment. all of the water treatment systems are operating. the estimated cost of constructing, operating and maintaining these systems is about $24 of which $10 was
originally placed in an interest-bearing escrow account. at december31, 2009, the accrual balance relating to the funding of the independent science panel health studies and operating and
maintaining the water treatment systems was $13, including $4 in interest bearing escrow accounts.
the
settlement resulted in the dismissal of all claims asserted in the lawsuit except for personal injury claims. if the independent science panel concludes that no probable link exists between
exposure to pfoa and any diseases, then the settlement would also resolve personal injury claims. if it concludes that a probable link does exist between exposure to pfoa and any diseases, then dupont
would also fund up to $235 for a medical monitoring program to pay for such medical testing. in this event, plaintiffs would retain their right to pursue personal injury claims. all other claims in
the lawsuit would remain dismissed by the settlement. dupont believes that it is remote that the panel will find a probable link. therefore, at december31, 2009, the company had not
established any accruals related to medical monitoring or personal injury claims. however, there can be no assurance as to what the independent science panel will conclude.
in
september 2007, lhwa refiled the suit it originally filed in ohio state court and voluntarily dismissed in 2006. the suit claims that perfluorinated compounds, including pfoa, allegedly released
from the washington works plant contaminated lhwa's well fields and underlying aquifer. in november 2009, lhwa sued dupont in ohio federal court alleging among other claims "imminent and substantial
endangerment to health and or the
environment" under rcra based on detection of pfoa in its wells. lhwa seeks a variety of relief in both cases including compensatory and punitive damages, and an injunction requiring dupont to provide
a new "pristine" well field and the infrastructure to deliver it.
in
the third quarter 2009, emerald coast utilities authority, owner and operator of public drinking water systems in pensacola, florida and nearby areas, filed suit against several defendants
including the company alleging water contamination from pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos). the case, originally filed in florida state court, was removed to federal court in the fourth quarter
2009. dupont does not have any facilities in the water district served by the emerald coast utilities authority that manufacture or use pfoa. dupont does not and has not manufactured pfos and does not
use the compound in its processes. the complaint seeks testing, treatment, remediation and monitoring.
in
the second quarter 2006, three purported class actions were filed alleging that drinking water had been contaminated by pfoa in excess of 0.05 ppb due to alleged releases from certain dupont
plants. one of these cases was filed in west virginia state court by three individual plaintiffs on behalf of customers of the parkersburg city water district, but was removed on dupont's motion to
the u.s.district court for the southern district of west virginia. in september 2008, the u.s.district court ruled that the case could not proceed as a class action. plaintiffs' appeal
of the ruling was denied. in the second quarter 2009, the plaintiffs added a claim based on public nuisance and moved for again class certification. in the third quarter 2009, the court granted
summary judgment in dupont's favor dismissing all claims brought by the three plaintiffs, including public nuisance and class certification, except for medical monitoring. in the fourth quarter 2009,
plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the medical monitoring claims. the court entered final judgment for dupont in january 2010.

the
other two purported class actions were filed in new jersey. one was filed in federal court on behalf of individuals who allegedly drank water contaminated by releases from dupont's chambers works
plant in deepwater, new jersey. the second was filed in state court on behalf of customers serviced primarily by the pennsville township water department and was removed to new jersey federal district
court on dupont's motion. the new jersey cases have been combined for purposes of discovery and the complaints have been amended to allege that drinking water had been contaminated by pfoa in excess
of 0.04 ppb. in december 2008, the court denied class action status in both cases, but ordered additional briefing on certain issues. in october 2009, the court granted class certification for certain
sub-classes regarding public and private nuisance claims, while denying class certification for all other claims. the court also certified a legal question related to strict liability. in
the fourth quarter 2009, plaintiffs in both cases filed motions for leave to add a claim under rcra alleging "imminent and substantial endangerment to health and or the environment" based on detection
of pfoa in public and private water wells. the motions will be decided before the june 2010 trial date recently set for both cases.
dupont
denies the claims alleged in these civil drinking water actions and is defending itself vigorously.
while
dupont believes that it is reasonably possible that it could incur losses related to pfoa matters in addition to those matters discussed above for which it has established accruals, a range of
such losses, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

in the second quarter 2009, plaintiffs' counsel dismissed all twenty-two purported class actions that were filed against dupont on behalf of
consumers who purchased cookware with teflon non-stick coating in federal district courts.
in
december 2005, a motion was filed by a single named plaintiff in the superior court for the province of quebec, canada seeking authorization to institute a class action on behalf of all quebec
consumers who have purchased or used kitchen items, household appliances or food-packaging containing teflon or zonyl non-stick coatings. in the third
quarter 2009, the court dismissed the motion.
elastomers antitrust matters
since 2002, the u.s., european union (eu) and canadian antitrust authorities have investigated the synthetic rubber markets for possible violations.
these investigations included dupont dow elastomers,llc (dde), as a result of its participation in the polychloroprene (pcp) and ethylene propylene diene monomer (epdm) markets. dde was a
joint venture between the dow chemical company (dow) and dupont.
in
april 2004, dupont and dow entered into a series of agreements under which dupont obtained complete control over directing dde's response to these investigations and the related litigation and
dupont agreed to a disproportionate share of the venture's liabilities and costs related to these matters. consequently, dupont bears any potential liabilities and costs up to the initial $150. dow is
obligated to indemnify dupont for up to $72.5 by paying 15 to 30percent toward liabilities and costs in excess of $150. on june30, 2005, dde became a wholly owned subsidiary of dupont
and was renamed dupont performance elastomers,llc (dpe).

in july 2007, dpe pled guilty to conspiring to fix prices and paid a fine of cdn $4, approximately $3.8usd, resolving all criminal antitrust allegations against it
related to pcp in canada.
in
late march 2007, the eu antitrust authorities issued a statement of objections that made antitrust allegations regarding the pcp market against dpe, relating to the joint venture's activities, and
dupont, to which both responded. in december 2007, the eu antitrust authorities issued their decision, including the imposition of fines against dpe, dow and dupont totaling euro 59.25. in february
2008, dupont appealed the decision to the eu's court of first instance which has jurisdiction to review the findings and adjust the fine. it is very unlikely that the fine would be increased as a
result of the review. in march 2008, the company provisionally paid the fine of euro 59.25 ($90.9usd); a portion of the payment may be refunded if the appeal is successful. while a decision on
the february 2008 appeal has not been issued, the eu antitrust authorities revised the december 2007 decision by imposing an incremental fine on dow of euro 4.425 ($6.5usd). dow provisionally
paid the incremental fine in the third quarter of 2008 which dupont reimbursed under the agreements between the companies.
dde
resolved all criminal antitrust allegations against it related to pcp in the u.s. through a plea agreement with the department of justice (doj) in january 2005 which was approved by the court on
march29, 2005. the agreement requires the subsidiary to pay a fine of $84 which, at its election, is being paid in six equal, annual installments. the last remaining installment will be paid
during the first quarter 2010. the agreement also requires the subsidiary to provide ongoing cooperation with the doj's investigation.
at
december31, 2009, the company has accruals of approximately $14 related to this matter and a receivable of $1.7 for the remaining amount that it expects to be reimbursed by dow.
benlate
in 1991, dupont began receiving claims by growers that use of benlate 50 df fungicide had caused crop damage. dupont has since been
served with thousands of lawsuits, most of which have been disposed of through trial, dismissal or settlement. the status of benlate cases is indicated in the table below:

at december31, 2009, there were ten cases pending in florida state court, involving allegations that benlate caused crop damage. one
attorney represents the plaintiffs in 6 out of the 10 cases. another attorney represents the plaintiffs in 3 of the 10 cases including 2 cases involving twenty-seven costa rican fern growers. during
the second quarter 2006 trial of these 2 cases, the plaintiffs sought damages in the range of $270 to $400. a $56 judgment was rendered against the company, but was reduced to $24 on dupont's motion.
in the fourth quarter 2009, the appeal was resolved in dupont's favor. the judgment was reversed, vacated and the cases were reverted to be tried separately. plaintiffs will likely seek further
appellate review. in the third quarter 2009, a case alleging crop damage was filed for the third time having been dismissed twice before on dupont's motion. it has been, and continues to be, the
company's position that the plaintiff does not own the property allegedly damaged. one case alleging crop damage is scheduled for trial during the second quarter 2010.

new trial thus reinstating the cases. previously, these plaintiffs had been awarded unspecified attorneys' fees as sanctions for
alleged discovery abuses by dupont. in june 2009, the judge issued an order striking dupont's pleadings and entering a default judgment against the company as to liability and causation. dupont will
appeal the order after the trial on damages which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2010.
in
january 2009, a case was filed in florida state court claiming that plaintiff's exposure to benlate allegedly contaminated with atrazine caused plaintiff's kidney and brain cancer. the
case has been removed to federal court.
the
company does not believe that benlate caused the damages alleged in each of these cases and denies the allegations of fraud and misconduct. the company continues to defend itself in
ongoing matters. as of december31, 2009, the company has incurred costs and expenses of approximately $2,000 associated with these matters, but does not expect additional significant costs or
expenses associated with the remaining 13 cases. the company has recovered approximately $275 of its costs and expenses through insurance and does not expect additional insurance recoveries, if any,
to be significant. at december31, 2009, the company has accruals of $0.1 related to benlate.
spelter, west virginia
in september 2006, a west virginia state court certified a class action against dupont that seeks relief including the provision of remediation
services and property value diminution damages for 7,000 residential properties in the vicinity of a closed zinc smelter in spelter, west virginia. the action also seeks medical monitoring for an
undetermined number of residents in the class area. the smelter was owned and operated by at least three companies between 1910 and 2001, including dupont between 1928 and 1950. dupont performed
remedial measures at the request of the epa in the late 1990s and in 2001 repurchased the site to facilitate and complete the remediation. the fall 2007 trial was conducted in four phases: liability,
medical monitoring, property and punitive damages. the jury found against dupont in all four phases awarding $55.5 for property remediation and $196.2 in punitive damages. in post trial motions, the
court adopted the plaintiffs' forty-year medical monitoring plan estimated by plaintiffs to cost $130 and granted plaintiffs' attorneys legal fees of $127 plus $8 in expenses based on and
included in the total jury award. in june 2008, dupont filed its petitions for appeal with the west virginia supreme court seeking review of a number of issues associated with the trial court's
decisions before, during and after the trial. on september25, 2008, the court decided to accept the case and consider the parties' appeal on the merits. the oral argument was heard on
april7, 2009. a decision is anticipated in due course during the court's term beginning january 2010 through june 2010. effective with dupont posting a bond, the execution of judgment against
the company is stayed pending final disposition of dupont's appeal to the west virginia supreme court of appeals. as of december31, 2009, the company had recorded accruals of $55, although
given the uncertainties inherent in litigation, there can be no assurance as to the final outcome.
general
the company is subject to various lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of its business. these lawsuits and claims include actions
based on alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters and contract and antitrust claims. management has noted a nationwide trend in purported class actions against
chemical manufacturers generally seeking relief such as
medical monitoring, property damages, off-site remediation and punitive damages arising from alleged environmental torts without claiming present personal injuries. such cases may allege
contamination from unregulated substances or remediated sites. the company also has noted a trend in public and private nuisance suits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities and utilities
alleging harm to the general public. although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these various lawsuits and claims, management does not anticipate they will have a materially adverse effect
on the company's consolidated financial position or liquidity. however, the ultimate liabilities may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized. the company accrues for
contingencies when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.

notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
environmental
the company is also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the company to take further
action to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum substances by the company or other parties. the company accrues for environmental
remediation activities consistent with the policy set forth in note1. much of this liability results from the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla,
often referred to as superfund), the resource conservation and recovery act (rcra) and similar state and global laws. these laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial
activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. the accrual also includes estimated costs related to a number of
sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of enforcement activities.
remediation
activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. these activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation
technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of potentially responsible parties. at december31, 2009, the condensed consolidated
balance sheets included a liability of $396, relating to these matters and, in management's opinion, is appropriate based on existing facts and circumstances. the average time frame, over which the
accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be paid, based on past history, is estimated to be 15-20years. considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and, under
adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of december31, 2009.
other
the company has various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. in the aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in
excess of current market.
21.stockholders' equity
the company's board of directors authorized a $2billion share buyback plan in june 2001. during 2009, 2008 and 2007, there
were no purchases of stock under this program. as of december31, 2009, the company has purchased 20.5million shares at a total cost of $962. management has not established a timeline
for the buyback of the remaining stock under this plan.
in
addition to the plan described above, in october 2005 the board of directors authorized a $5billion share buyback plan. during 2007, the company paid $1.7billion to purchase and
immediately retire 34.7million shares at an average price of $48.85 per share, completing the $5billion share buyback plan with the purchase and retirement of 112.8million
shares at an average price of $44.33 per share.
common
stock held in treasury is recorded at cost. when retired, the excess of the cost of treasury stock over its par value is allocated between reinvested earnings and additional paid-in
capital.

22.long-term employee benefits
the company offers various long-term benefits to its employees. where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves
the right to change, modify or discontinue the plans.
defined benefit pensions
the company has both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of the u.s. employees. the benefits under
these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. the company's funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations.
pension
coverage for employees of the company's non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. obligations under such plans are
funded by depositing funds with trustees, covered by insurance contracts, or remain unfunded.
other long-term employee benefits
the parent company and certain subsidiaries provide medical, dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors, and disability and life
insurance protection to employees. the associated plans for retiree benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from company funds. essentially all of the cost and liabilities
for these retiree benefit plans are attributable to the u.s.parent company plans. the retiree medical plan is contributory with pensioners and survivors' contributions adjusted annually to
achieve a 50/50 target sharing of cost increases between the company and pensioners and survivors. in addition, limits are applied to the company's portion of the retiree medical cost coverage.
employee
life insurance and disability benefit plans are insured in many countries. however, primarily in the u.s., such plans are generally self-insured or are fully experience-rated.
obligations and expenses for self-insured and fully experience-rated plans are reflected in the figures below.

in
august 2006, the company announced major changes to the pension and defined contribution benefits that cover the majority of its u.s.employees. effective january1, 2008, such full
service employees on the rolls as of december31, 2006 continue to accrue benefits in the pension plan, but at a reduced rate of about one-third of its previous level. in addition,
company-paid postretirement survivor benefits for these employees do not continue to grow after december31, 2007. such employees hired after december31, 2006 do not
participate in the pension plan. as a result of this plan amendment, pension expense was reduced by about $40 in 2007. the combined pension and defined contribution plan expenses were reduced by about
$60 and $40 in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
the
company utilizes published long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate at measurement date. where commonly available, the company considers indices of
various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments.

plan assets
on december31, 2009, the company prospectively implemented new disclosure requirements which expand disclosure for assets held by employer
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
all
pension plan assets in the u.s. are invested through a single master trust fund. the strategic asset allocation for this trust fund is selected by management, reflecting the results of
comprehensive asset liability modeling. the general principles guiding u.s. pension asset investment policies are those embodied in the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa). these
principles include discharging the company's investment responsibilities for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and in accordance with the "prudent expert" standard and other erisa rules and
regulations. the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return
and risk. strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. where appropriate, asset liability studies are utilized in this
process. u.s. plan assets and a significant portion of non-u.s. plan assets are managed by investment professionals employed by the company. the remaining assets are managed by
professional investment firms unrelated to the company. the company's pension investment professionals have discretion to manage the assets within established asset allocation ranges approved by
senior management of the company. additionally, pension trust funds are permitted to enter into certain contractual arrangements generally described as "derivatives." derivatives are primarily used to
reduce specific market risks, hedge currency and adjust portfolio duration and asset allocation in a cost-effective manner.
the
company's target allocations for plan assets are 52percent equity securities, 31percent fixed income securities, and 17percent alternative investments. equity securities
include u.s. (30percent target allocation) and non-u.s. companies (22percent target allocation) with varying market capitalization levels. u.s. equity investments are
primarily large-cap companies. fixed income investments include corporate-issued, government-issued and asset-backed securities. corporate debt investments include a range of credit risk
and industry diversification. u.s. fixed income investments are weighted heavier than non-u.s fixed income securities. alternative investments include real estate (7percent target
allocation) and private market securities (10percent target allocation) such as interests in private equity and venture capital partnerships.
fair
value calculations may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. furthermore, although the company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value
measurement at the reporting date.

defined contribution plan
the company sponsors several defined contribution plans, which cover substantially all u.s. employees. the most significant is the retirement savings
plan (the plan), which reflects the 2009 merger of the retirement savings plan and the savings and investment plan. this plan includes a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (esop).
employees are not required to participate in the esop and those who do are free to diversify out of the esop. the purpose of the plan is to provide additional retirement savings benefits for employees
and to provide employees an opportunity to become stockholders of the company. the plan is a tax qualified contributory profit sharing plan, with cash or deferred arrangement and any eligible employee
of the company may participate. the company contributed an amount to the plan in 2007 equal to 50percent of the first 6percent of the employee's contribution election. as part of the
retirement plan changes in august 2006, effective january1, 2007, for employees hired on that date or thereafter and effective january1, 2008, for active employees as of
december31, 2006, the company contributes 100percent of the first 6percent of the employee's contribution election and also contributes 3percent of each eligible
employee's eligible compensation regardless of the employee's contribution. in addition, the definition of eligible compensation has been expanded to be similar to the definition of eligible
compensation used in determining pension benefits.
the
company's contributions to the u.s. parent company's defined contribution plans were $191, $189 and $57 for the years ended december31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. the company's
matching contributions vest immediately upon contribution. the 3percent nonmatching company contribution vests for employees with at least three years of service. in addition, the company made
contributions of $54, $45 and $42 for the years ended december31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to other defined contribution plans. the company expects to contribute about $250 to its
defined contribution plans in 2010.

23.compensation plans
the total stock-based compensation cost included in the consolidated income statements was $115, $112 and $144 for 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. the income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements were $38, $37 and $48 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
on
april25, 2007, the shareholders approved the dupont equity and incentive plan("eip"). the eip consolidated several of the company's existing compensation plans (the stock
performance plan, variable compensation plan, and equity awards of the stock accumulation and deferred compensation plan for directors) into one plan providing for equity-based and cash incentive
awards to certain employees, directors and consultants. currently, equity-based compensation awards consist of stock options, time-vested restricted stock units (rsus), performance-based
restricted stock units (psus) and stock appreciation rights.
the
company satisfies stock option exercises and vesting of rsus and psus with newly issued shares of dupont common stock. under the eip, the maximum number of shares reserved for the grant or
settlement of awards is 60million shares, provided that each share in excess of 20million that is issued with respect to any award that is not an option or stock appreciation right
will be counted against the 60million share limit as four shares. at december31, 2009, approximately 30million shares were authorized for future grants under the company's eip.
awards or grants made in 2007, prior to shareholder approval of the eip, were issued under the company's previously existing compensation plans. awards outstanding under each of these plans have not
been terminated. these awards remain outstanding and are administered under the terms of the applicable existing plan. no further awards will be made under the company's previously existing
compensation plans.
the
company's compensation committee determines the long-term incentive mix, including stock options, rsus and psus and may authorize new grants annually.
stock options
the purchase price of shares subject to option is equal to the market price of the company's stock on the date of grant. options granted prior to 2004
expire 10years from date of grant; options granted between 2004 and 2008 serially vested over a three-year period and carry a six-year option term. stock option awards
granted in 2009 expire seven years after the grant date. the plan allows retirement eligible employees to retain any granted awards upon retirement provided the employee has rendered at least six
months of service following grant date.
for
purposes of determining the fair value of stock options awards, the company uses the black-scholes option pricing model and the assumptions set forth in the table below. the weighted-average
grant-date fair value of options granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $2.68, $5.30 and $9.47, respectively.

the company determines the dividend yield by dividing the current annual dividend on the company's stock by the option exercise price. a historical daily
measurement of volatility is determined based on the expected life of the option granted. the risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the yield on an outstanding u.s.
treasury note with a term equal to the expected life of the option granted. expected life is determined by reference to the company's historical experience.

10.1million options outstanding from the 2002 corporate sharing program grants of 200 shares to all eligible employees at an
option price of $44.50. these options are currently exercisable and expire 10years from date of grant.
the aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the company's closing stock
price on the last trading day of 2009 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all
option holders exercised their in-the-money options at year end. the amount changes based on the fair market value of the company's stock. total intrinsic value of options
exercised for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $0, $18 and $96, respectively. in 2009, the company realized a tax benefit of $0 from options exercised.
as
of december31, 2009, $16 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.54years.
rsus and psus
in 2004, the company began issuing rsus in addition to stock options. these rsus serially vest over a three-year period and, upon vesting,
convert one-for-one to dupont common stock. a retirement eligible employee retains any granted awards upon retirement provided the employee has rendered at least six months of
service following the grant date. additional rsus are also granted periodically to key senior management employees. these rsus generally vest over periods ranging from two to five years. the fair
value of all stock-settled rsus is based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.
the
company also grants psus to senior leadership. in 2009, there were 468,000 psus granted. vesting for psus granted in 2008 and 2009 is equally based upon corporate revenue growth relative to peer
companies and total shareholder return (tsr) relative to peer companies. performance and payouts are determined independently for each metric. the actual award, delivered as dupont common stock, can
range from zero percent to 200percent of the original grant. the grant-date fair value of the psus granted in 2009, subject to the tsr metric, was $27.87, estimated using a monte
carlo simulation. the grant-date fair value of the psus, subject to the revenue metric, was based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.
for
psus granted prior to 2008, vesting occurs upon attainment of (i)corporate revenue growth relative to peer companies and (ii)return on invested capital objectives (relative to peer
companies for periods prior to 2008 and relative to internal targets for periods beginning in 2008). the actual award, delivered as dupont common stock, can range from zero percent to
200percent of the original grant. the fair value of psus granted prior to 2008 is based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.

as of december31, 2009, there was $33 unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested awards. that cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 1.52years. the total fair value of stock units vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $74, $60 and $53, respectively.
other cash-based awards
cash awards under the eip plan may be granted to employees who have contributed most to the company's success, with consideration being given to the
ability to succeed to more important managerial responsibility. such awards were $141, $140 and $163 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. the amounts of the awards are dependent on company earnings
and are subject to maximum limits as defined under the governing plans.
in
addition, the company has other variable compensation plans under which cash awards may be granted. these plans include pioneer's annual reward program and the company's regional and local variable
compensation plans. such awards were $213, $196 and $217 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
24.derivatives and other hedging instruments
effective january1, 2009, the company prospectively implemented the revised requirements for enhancing the disclosures of
derivative and hedging instruments to provide users of financial statements with a better understanding of the objectives of a company's derivative use and the risks managed.
objectives and strategies for holding derivative instruments
in the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to reduce its exposure to foreign currency,
interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. the company has established a variety of approved derivative instruments to be utilized in each financial risk
management program, as well as varying levels of exposure coverage and time horizons based on an assessment of risk factors related to each hedging program. derivative instruments utilized during the
period include forwards, options, futures and swaps. the company has not designated any nonderivatives as hedging instruments.
the
company established a financial risk management framework that incorporated the corporate financial risk management committee and established financial risk management policies and guidelines that
authorize the use of specific derivative instruments and further establishes procedures for control and valuation, counterparty credit approval and routine monitoring and reporting. the counterparties
to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and major commodity exchanges. the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. the
company manages this exposure to credit loss through the aforementioned credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures and, to the extent possible, by restricting the period over which unpaid
balances are allowed to accumulate. the company anticipates performance by counterparties to
f-44
table of contents
e. i. du pont de nemours and company
notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
these
contracts and therefore no material loss is expected. market and counterparty credit risks associated with these instruments are regularly reported to management.
the
company hedges foreign currency denominated revenue and monetary assets and liabilities, certain business specific foreign currency exposures and certain energy feedstock purchases. in addition,
the company enters into exchange traded agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge exposures relevant to agricultural feedstock purchases.
foreign currency risk
the company's objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign
currency rate changes. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency-denominated
assets, liabilities, commitments, and cash flows.
the
company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. the
primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net
of related tax effects, are minimized.
interest rate risk
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
interest
rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on usd libor. interest rate swaps allow the
company to achieve a target range of floating rate debt.
commodity price risk
commodity price risk management programs serve to reduce exposure to price fluctuations on purchases of inventory such as natural gas, ethane, corn,
soybeans and soybean meal.
the
company enters into over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge the commodity price risk associated with energy feedstock and
agricultural commodity exposures.
fair value hedges
at december31, 2009, the company maintained a number of interest rate swaps, implemented at the time the debt instruments were issued, that
involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments which allows the company to achieve a target range of floating rate debt. all interest rate swaps qualify for the shortcut method of
hedge accounting, thus there is no ineffectiveness related to these hedges. the company maintains no other significant fair value hedges. at december31, 2009, the company had interest rate
swap agreements with gross notional amounts of approximately $1,900.
cash flow hedges
the company maintains a number of cash flow hedging programs to reduce risks related to foreign currency and commodity price risk. while each risk
management program has a different time maturity period, most programs currently do not extend beyond the next two-year period.
the
company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain foreign currency denominated revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset
changes in the u.s.dollar value of the related foreign currency-denominated revenues. at december31, 2009, the company had foreign currency exchange contracts with gross notional
amounts of approximately $293.
a
portion of natural gas purchases are hedged to reduce price volatility using fixed price swaps and options. at december31, 2009, the company had energy feedstock contracts with gross
notional amounts of approximately $277.
f-45
table of contents
e. i. du pont de nemours and company
notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) (dollars in millions, except per share)
the
company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the
market price of grain for a period of time following harvest. derivative instruments, such as commodity futures and options that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity, are used to hedge
the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers.
the
company utilizes agricultural commodity futures to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. these derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are
deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk.
at
december31, 2009, the company had agricultural commodity contracts with gross notional amounts of approximately $332.
the
company entered into treasury rate contracts to hedge the company's exposure to treasury rates on a portion of a planned bond issue. the contracts were terminated at the time the bond was issued.
at december31, 2009, the gross notional amount was $0.
cash
flow hedge results are reclassified into earnings during the same period in which the related exposure impacts earnings. reclassifications are made sooner if it is not probable that a forecasted
transaction will materialize. the following table summarizes the effect of cash flow hedges on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended december31, 2009:

hedges of net investment in a foreign operation
at december31, 2009, the company did not maintain any hedges of net investment in a foreign operation.
derivatives not designated in hedging relationships
the company uses forward exchange contracts to reduce its net exposure, by currency, related to foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and
liabilities. the netting of such exposures precludes the use of hedge accounting. however, the required revaluation of the forward contracts and the associated foreign currency-denominated monetary
assets and liabilities results in a minimal earnings impact, after taxes. at december31, 2009, the company had forward exchange contracts with gross notional amounts of approximately $7,634.
in
addition, the company has risk management programs for agricultural commodities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. at december31, 2009, the company had agricultural
commodities contracts with gross notional amounts of approximately $206.
contingent features
at december31, 2009, the company did not maintain any derivative contracts with credit-risk-related contingent
features.

26.segment information
during the fourth quarter of 2009, the company consolidated its 23 businesses and six reportable segments into 13 businesses,
aggregated into seven reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics, the nature of the products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and
regulatory environment. the new reportable segments are agriculture& nutrition, electronics& communications, performance chemicals, performance coatings, performance materials,
safety& protection, and pharmaceuticals. the company includes certain embryonic businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as applied biosciences, and nonaligned businesses in
other.
prior
to the fourth quarter of 2009, the company's reportable segments consisted of five growth platforms: agriculture& nutrition, coatings& color technologies, electronic&
communication technologies, performance materials and safety& protection; and pharmaceuticals. the change in segment reporting was reflected on a retrospective basis, with prior years also
revised to reflect the new segment reporting structure.
major
products by segment include: agriculture& nutrition (hybrid seed corn and soybean seed, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, value enhanced grains and soy protein); electronics&
communications (photopolymers and electronic materials); performance chemicals (fluorochemicals, fluoropolymers, specialty and industrial chemicals, and white pigments); performance coatings
(automotive finishes, and industrial coatings); performance materials (engineering polymers, packaging and industrial polymers, films and elastomers); safety& protection (nonwovens, aramids
and solid surfaces); and pharmaceuticals (representing the company's interest in
the collaboration relating to cozaar/hyzaar antihypertensive drugs, which is reported as other income). the company operates globally in substantially all of its product
lines.
in
general, the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. exceptions are noted as follows and are shown in the
reconciliations below. prior years' data have been reclassified to reflect the 2009 organizational structure. segment sales include transfers to another business segment. products are transferred
between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. segment pre-tax operating income/(loss) (ptoi) is defined as operating income
before income taxes, exchange gains/(losses), corporate expenses, interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. segment net assets includes net working capital, net property,
plant and equipment and other noncurrent operating assets and liabilities of the segment. affiliate net assets (pro rata share) excludes borrowing and other long-term liabilities.
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on research and development facilities and amortization of other intangible assets, excluding write-down of assets which is discussed in
note5. expenditures for long-lived assets exclude investments in affiliates and include payments for property, plant and equipment as part of business acquisitions.

28.subsequent event
in january 2010, the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar for the first time since 2005 in an effort to
stabilize the economy. venezuela set the bolivar at 4.3per u.s.dollar for non-essential items and 2.6per u.s.dollar for food, medical supplies and other
national priorities. before the change, all items were set at 2.15 bolivars per u.s.dollar. this action is expected to result in an exchange loss from the revaluation of balance sheet accounts
of approximately $40 to $50, which will be reflected in the company's first quarter 2010 financial results.
