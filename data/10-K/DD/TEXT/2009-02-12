BACKLOG

IN GENERAL THE COMPANY DOES NOT MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS AGAINST

A BACKLOG OF ORDERS AND DOES NOT CONSIDER BACKLOG TO BE A

SIGNIFICANT INDICATOR OF THE LEVEL OF FUTURE SALES ACTIVITY.

PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF

INCOMING ORDERS AS WELL AS PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE DEMAND.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BACKLOG INFORMATION IS NOT

MATERIAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS OVERALL BUSINESS AND SHOULD NOT BE

CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATE

PROVIDES IT WITH AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IT HAS AN

ESTABLISHED GLOBAL NETWORK OF ATTORNEYS, AS WELL AS BRANDING,

ADVERTISING AND LICENSING PROFESSIONALS, TO PROCURE, MAINTAIN,

PROTECT, ENHANCE AND GAIN VALUE FROM THIS ESTATE.

THE COMPANY HAS A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF AND IS LICENSED UNDER

VARIOUS PATENTS. THESE DEFINITE-LIVED PATENTS COVER MANY

PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USES. THESE PATENTS PROTECT MANY

ASPECTS OF THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND

THE GOODS AND SERVICES IT SELLS. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED

BY THESE PATENTS VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND DEPENDS UPON

THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PATENT AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY. THE COMPANY OWNS

APPROXIMATELY 21,000 WORLDWIDE PATENTS AND APPROXIMATELY 17,000

WORLDWIDE PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN 2008, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED

ABOUT 500 U.S. PATENTS AND ABOUT 1,500 INTERNATIONAL

PATENTS. THE COMPANYS RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND

LICENSES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE

IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, AND TO VARYING DEGREES,

IMPORTANT TO EACH REPORTABLE

SEGMENT. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS TO

PHARMACEUTICALS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON PAGE 33 OF

THIS REPORT.

THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER AND THE REST OF THE COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SEED INDUSTRY COMPETE IS INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY NEW

PATENTS, PATENT POSITIONS, PATENT LAWSUITS AND THE STATUS OF

VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OWNERSHIP OF AND ACCESS TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO

BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GERMPLASM, ARE IMPORTANT TO PIONEER AND ITS

COMPETITORS. NO SINGLE PATENT OWNED BY PIONEER OR ITS

COMPETITORS IS ESSENTIAL TO PIONEERS ABILITY TO COMPETE.

HOWEVER, PIONEER WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS FREEDOM TO OPERATE

ISSUES BY ENFORCING ITS OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

CHALLENGING CLAIMS MADE BY OTHERS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE,

OBTAINING LICENSES TO IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS. DURING 2007, PIONEER ENTERED INTO A BUSINESS

AGREEMENT ON CORN HERBICIDE TOLERANCE AND INSECT CONTROL TRAIT

TECHNOLOGIES WITH MONSANTO COMPANY. AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS,

MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE EXISTING CORN LICENSE AGREEMENTS;

BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN NON-ASSERT AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND BOTH PARTIES OBTAINED RIGHTS

TO REFERENCE AND ACCESS CERTAIN REGULATORY DATA AND APPROVALS IN

WHICH THE OTHER HAS CERTAIN INTERESTS. SEE THE CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TABLE ON PAGE 38 FOR MORE INFORMATION.

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 1,800 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR ITS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 17,000 WORLDWIDE

REGISTRATIONS AND APPLICATIONS FOR THESE TRADEMARKS. OWNERSHIP

RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS ARE

CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED. THE COMPANY HAS MANY

TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER

RETAIL LEVEL

AND/OR

BUSINESS TO BUSINESS LEVEL. SIGNIFICANT TRADEMARKS AT THE

CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL INCLUDE THE DUPONT OVAL AND

DUPONT

TM

(THE DUPONT BRAND TRADEMARKS);

PIONEER

®

BRAND SEEDS;

TEFLON

®

FLUOROPOLYMERS, FILMS, FABRIC PROTECTORS, FIBERS AND

DISPERSIONS;

CORIAN

®

SURFACES;

KEVLAR

®

HIGH STRENGTH MATERIAL; AND

TYVEK

®

PROTECTIVE MATERIAL. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY PURSUES LICENSING

OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED TRADEMARKS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL.

SEASONALITY

SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL PATTERNS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITIONS SALES AND EARNINGS

PERFORMANCE IS STRONGEST IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE

SEGMENT GENERALLY OPERATES AT A LOSS DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH

QUARTERS OF THE YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THE SEASONAL NATURE OF ITS

SEED BUSINESS, AGRICULTURE & NUTRITIONS

INVENTORY IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR

YEAR AND IS SOLD DOWN IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. TRADE

RECEIVABLES IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ARE AT A LOW

POINT AT YEAR-END AND INCREASE THROUGH THE SELLING SEASON TO

PEAK AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER.

IN GENERAL, BUSINESSES IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS ARE NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS.

MARKETING

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

PIONEER

®

BRAND SEEDS AND

SOLAE

®

SOY PROTEINS, MOST PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH

DUPONTS SALES FORCE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME REGIONS, MORE

EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

PIONEER

®

BRAND PRODUCTS ARE PROMOTED THROUGH MULTIPLE MARKETING CHANNELS

IN NORTH AMERICA. IN THE CORN AND SOYBEAN MARKETS OF THE

U.S. CORN BELT, PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH A SPECIALIZED

FORCE OF INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES. IN OTHER NORTH

AMERICAN MARKETS,

PIONEER

®

PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND CROP INPUT

RETAILERS.

PIONEER

®

PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA ARE MARKETED THROUGH A NETWORK

OF SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND INDEPENDENT

PRODUCER-DISTRIBUTORS.

SOLAE

®

ISOLATED AND FUNCTIONAL SOY PROTEINS ARE MARKETED USING A

COMBINATION OF OUTSIDE DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIRECT

SALES.

MAJOR

CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANYS SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A

SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER,

COLLECTIVELY, COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES AND

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS HAVE SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY IN

THE MOTOR VEHICLE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) INDUSTRY

SUPPLY CHAIN. THE COMPANY HAS LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

THESE CUSTOMERS AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE

SEGMENTS OPERATING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS,

CONTINUED

COMPETITION

AS A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BASED COMPANY, DUPONT COMPETES ON A

VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS PRODUCT QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OR

SPECIFICATIONS, CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY, PRICE, CUSTOMER SERVICE

AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF

THE PARTICULAR MARKET INVOLVED AND THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE

PROVIDED.

MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES

PRINCIPALLY BASED IN THE U.S., WESTERN EUROPE, JAPAN, CHINA,

KOREA AND INDIA. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COMPETITORS OFFER A

WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL, COMMODITY AND

SPECIALTY CHEMICALS TO PLASTICS, FIBERS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS.

THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES IN CERTAIN MARKETS WITH SMALLER, MORE

SPECIALIZED FIRMS WHO OFFER A NARROW RANGE OF PRODUCTS OR

CONVERTED PRODUCTS THAT FUNCTIONALLY COMPETE WITH THE

COMPANYS OFFERINGS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SELLS ADVANCED PLANT GENETICS

THROUGH PIONEER, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF CORN

AND SOYBEANS AND THUS DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH OTHER SEED AND

PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

ALSO PROVIDES FOOD SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND SOY-BASED FOOD

INGREDIENTS IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR GRAIN AND FOOD

PROCESSORS.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH IN THE U.S. AT OVER 30 SITES

AT EITHER DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR MANUFACTURING PLANTS.

THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF RESEARCH IS IN THE WILMINGTON,

DELAWARE AREA AT SEVERAL LARGE RESEARCH CENTERS. AMONG THESE,

THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION LABORATORIES ENGAGE IN INVESTIGATIVE

AND APPLIED RESEARCH, THE CHESTNUT RUN LABORATORIES FOCUS ON

APPLIED RESEARCH AND THE STINE-HASKELL RESEARCH CENTER CONDUCTS

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH AND TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH TO

ASSURE THE SAFE MANUFACTURE, HANDLING AND USE OF PRODUCTS AND

RAW MATERIALS.

OTHER MAJOR RESEARCH LOCATIONS IN THE U.S. INCLUDE MARSHALL

LAB IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, AND MT. CLEMENS IN MT.

CLEMENS, MICHIGAN, BOTH DEDICATED TO COATINGS RESEARCH; PIONEER

RESEARCH FACILITIES IN JOHNSTON, IOWA; THE SOLAE COMPANY

FACILITIES IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; POLYMER RESEARCH

FACILITIES IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, AND PARKERSBURG, WEST

VIRGINIA; AND ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH FACILITIES IN

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA, TOWANDA, PENNSYLVANIA,

AND SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA.

DUPONT, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS GLOBAL INTERESTS, ALSO

OPERATES MORE THAN 20 ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

FACILITIES AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., WITH MAJOR FACILITIES

LOCATED IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL; KINGSTON, CANADA; SHANGHAI, CHINA;

MEYRIN, SWITZERLAND; SEOUL, KOREA; WUPPERTAL, GERMANY; AND

UTSUNOMIYA, JAPAN. A NEW RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITY WAS

OPENED IN HYDERABAD, INDIA IN 2008 TO BETTER SERVE THE ASIA

PACIFIC MARKET.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS ARE TO CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES IN RELEVANT FIELDS, AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE EXISTING

PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES. EACH SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY FUNDS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS

MISSION. RECENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS BROADENED ITS SUSTAINABILITY

COMMITMENTS BEYOND ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTION TO INCLUDE

MARKET-DRIVEN TARGETS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT.

THE COMPANY IS EXPANDING ITS OFFERINGS ADDRESSING SAFETY,

ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL

MARKETPLACE BY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING RENEWABLE,

BIO-BASED MATERIALS; ADVANCED BIOFUELS; ENERGY-EFFICIENT

TECHNOLOGIES; ENHANCED SAFETY AND PROTECTION PRODUCTS; AND

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE GOALS ARE TIED

DIRECTLY TO BUSINESS GROWTH, SPECIFICALLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

SAFER AND ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPROVED PRODUCTS THAT ENHANCE THE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE OF ITS TRADITIONAL BUSINESSES FOR

DUPONTS KEY GLOBAL MARKETS, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION,

BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD AND

COMMUNICATIONS.

THE CORPORATE RESEARCH LABORATORIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

CONDUCTING RESEARCH PROGRAMS ALIGNED WITH CORPORATE STRATEGY AS

PROVIDED BY THE GROWTH SEGMENTS. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE ADMINISTERED BY SENIOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE BUSINESS AND CORPORATE

STRATEGY. THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE

OUTCOME OF ANY SINGLE RESEARCH PROGRAM.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

ITEM 1A. RISK

FACTORS

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS

RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS

BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE

INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT

BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

PRICE INCREASES

FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND GROW

EARNINGS.

THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE

SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS

BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE

COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL

AND NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WHEN POSSIBLE, THE

COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND

EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL

PURCHASES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS

OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE

INCREASES, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION

PROGRAMS. SUCCESS IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH

PRICE INCREASES IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON

THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET

THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

FAILURE TO

DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANYS

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON

ITS ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THIS ABILITY

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY

VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, OBTAIN RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS, OBTAIN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF

NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT

PROCESS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND INTENSE COMPETITION, THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY DEVELOPING, OR COULD BEGIN TO DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE,

WILL ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. SALES OF THE

COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS COULD REPLACE SALES OF SOME OF ITS

CURRENT PRODUCTS, OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF EVEN A SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCT INTRODUCTION.

THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND

ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND

CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY

STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED

A NATIONWIDE TREND IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL

MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL

MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE

DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT

CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES. VARIOUS FACTORS OR

DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF

LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT, SIGNIFICANT

SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING

OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. AN ADVERSE

OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE MATERIAL TO

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND

INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF

THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED,

THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

AS A RESULT OF

THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD

INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND

THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF

POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST

OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY

COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS. THE

COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE

SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE

FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE

TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE

COMPANYS ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT

BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE

BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE

MATTER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND

EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF

DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER

AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM GENETICALLY

ENHANCED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY SEEDS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE,

GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND

COMPETITION.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE

PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

SEGMENT. DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS

GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE

DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY

TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF CROPS GROWN FROM THOSE SEEDS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE

STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES SUPPORTING THE USE OF

BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION MARKETS. SPEED IN

DISCOVERING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING

PRODUCTS BASED ON THEM TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS

COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANYS EXISTING OR CANDIDATE

PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

CHANGES IN

GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND LAWS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF ITS TOTAL SALES AND THAT CONTINUED GROWTH AND

PROFITABILITY WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE, MONETARY AND

FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF

U.S. AND

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS,

AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO CHANGES IN A COUNTRYS OR REGIONS

ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRADE REGULATIONS AFFECTING

PRODUCTION, PRICING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, LOCAL LABOR

CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS, REDUCED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY OR

LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES,

BURDENSOME TAXES AND TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS.

INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CHANGING SOCIAL

AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TERRORISM, POLITICAL

HOSTILITIES AND WAR, COULD LEAD TO REDUCED INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH SALES.

ECONOMIC FACTORS,

INCLUDING INFLATION AND FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES,

INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY

HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THERE ARE A LARGE

NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL

SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY

ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES

AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE RISKS COULD HAVE

AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

CONDITIONS IN THE

GLOBAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN AND

WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL RECESSION, INCLUDING

THE CREDIT MARKET CRISIS, DECLINING CONSUMER AND BUSINESS

CONFIDENCE, FLUCTUATING COMMODITY PRICES, VOLATILE EXCHANGE

RATES, AND OTHER CHALLENGES CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY. THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE

DETERIORATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES, CASH FLOW SHORTAGES, AND

DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING. AS A RESULT, EXISTING OR

POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS MAY DELAY OR CANCEL PLANS TO PURCHASE

PRODUCTS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN A

TIMELY FASHION. FURTHER, SUPPLIERS MAY BE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR

CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FULFILL THEIR

OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY. IF THE GLOBAL RECESSION CONTINUES

FOR SIGNIFICANT FUTURE PERIODS OR DETERIORATES SIGNIFICANTLY,

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS COULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FUTURE

REVENUE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND INCREASE COSTS AND

EXPENSES.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, INCREASING

COSTS FOR ENERGY, TEMPORARY PLANT

AND/OR

POWER

OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND NETWORK

DISRUPTIONS, COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR

CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, THEY COULD RESULT IN REDUCED

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR

IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS

OR TO RECEIVE RAW MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS

AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY

MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD CAUSE BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM OR

WAR, AND NATURAL DISASTERS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, THE IMPACT

FROM BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST

OF DOING BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INABILITY TO

PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE

PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS

ARE IMPORTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN

PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL

CONTROLS TO RESTRICT

IDENTIFIED BY THEIR USE OF WORDS LIKE PLANS,

EXPECTS, WILL, ANTICIPATES,

INTENDS, PROJECTS, ESTIMATES

OR OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ALL STATEMENTS THAT ADDRESS

ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT

THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE ACCURATE OR WILL BE

OVERVIEW

LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGIES

 DUPONT

STRIVES TO GROW SHAREHOLDER VALUE OVER THE LONG TERM BY

EXECUTING ITS THREE GROWTH

STRATEGIES 

PUTTING SCIENCE TO WORK,

LEVERAGING THE POWER OF ONE DUPONT AND GOING WHERE THE GROWTH

IS

. DUPONT SCIENCE AND INNOVATION IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING

SOLUTIONS FOR SOME OF THE WORLDS TOUGHEST CHALLENGES SUCH

AS THE NEED FOR INCREASED FOOD PRODUCTION, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND

RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND GREATER SAFETY AND

PROTECTION. THE INITIATIVES EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE THE STRATEGIES

ARE: #1 GROW IN THE AREAS OF AGRICULTURE, BIOSCIENCES,

SAFETY AND PROTECTION AND POLYMER SCIENCE BY DELIVERING

SCIENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS. #2 EXPAND THE COMPANYS

POSITION IN EMERGING MARKETS. #3 EXTEND COST AND CAPITAL

PRODUCTIVITY GAINS. OVER THE LONG TERM, DUPONT CONTINUES TO SEE

THE POTENTIAL FOR ATTRACTIVE EARNINGS GROWTH FROM THESE

INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION TO ITS GROWTH STRATEGIES, DUPONTS

FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE PRINCIPLES ARE CRITICAL TO DELIVERING

SHAREHOLDER VALUE OVER TIME. THE PRINCIPLES ARE FIRST TO

MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND TO RETURN EXCESS CASH

TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THERE IS A COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY TO

INVEST FOR GROWTH. THE COMPANYS STRONG BALANCE SHEET

SUPPORTS LIQUIDITY AND A LOW COST OF BORROWING AND IS A DIRECT

RESULT FROM THE DISCIPLINED EXECUTION OF THESE PRINCIPLES.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

 THE YEAR 2008

WAS CHALLENGING DUE TO A GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION WITH DEMAND

WEAKNESS IN NORTH AMERICAN AND WESTERN EUROPEAN MOTOR VEHICLE

AND CONSTRUCTION RELATED MARKETS AND DRAMATIC ESCALATION OF

GLOBAL RAW MATERIAL, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS. DESPITE

THESE CHALLENGES, THE COMPANY DELIVERED 4 PERCENT SALES

GROWTH AND STRONG PERFORMANCES FROM THE AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION SEGMENT, PHARMACEUTICALS, AND MOST BUSINESSES IN

EMERGING MARKETS. EARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2008 A FINANCIAL

CRISIS SPREADING GLOBALLY TRIGGERED UNPRECEDENTED MARKET

VOLATILITY AND DEPRESSED ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008 WAS THE CLEAR PIVOT POINT IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WITH

A STEEP DECLINE IN DEMAND BECOMING PERVASIVE ACROSS A BROADER

RANGE OF END MARKETS AND GEOGRAPHIES. REFLECTING THESE

CONDITIONS, THE COMPANYS FULL YEAR SALES VOLUME DROPPED

5 PERCENT VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.

RESPONSE TO CHALLENGING GLOBAL MARKET

CONDITIONS

 IN DECEMBER 2008, DUPONT

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO ADDRESS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING MARKET

CONDITIONS AND STRENGTHEN THE COMPANYS FUTURE

COMPETITIVENESS. PLANS ARE FOCUSED ON GENERATING CASH BY BETTER

ALIGNING COST, WORKING CAPITAL AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

EXPENDITURES TO THE REVISED DEMAND SIGNALS OF THE FOURTH

QUARTER. THESE PLANS INCLUDE A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WITH AN

ASSOCIATED FOURTH QUARTER PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $535 MILLION,

WITH EXPECTED PRE-TAX SAVINGS OF ABOUT $130 MILLION FOR

2009, AND ABOUT $250 MILLION ANNUAL SAVINGS THEREAFTER. THE

RESTRUCTURING WILL REDUCE ABOUT 2,500 EMPLOYEE POSITIONS,

PRIMARILY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH MOTOR VEHICLE AND CONSTRUCTION

RELATED BUSINESSES IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE U.S. IN

ADDITION TO THE EXPECTED $130 MILLION COST SAVINGS IN 2009

FROM RESTRUCTURING, THE COMPANY DETAILED PLANS TO DELIVER AN

ADDITIONAL $600 MILLION COST REDUCTION IN 2009. THESE PLANS

INCLUDE FIXED COST PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS, AS WELL AS

IMMEDIATE COST REDUCTIONS IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE COMPANY SUCH AS

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING, TEMPORARILY

IDLING OVER 100 SITES, REDUCING ABOUT 4,000 CONTRACTORS AND

CONTINUING PRODUCTIVITY PROJECTS FOR STREAMLINING AND LEVERAGING

OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OPERATIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN AND SUPPORT

FUNCTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO OUTLINED 2009 PLANS TO ACHIEVE A

$1 BILLION NET WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTION, AND A 10 TO

20 PERCENT REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING.

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES

FOR 2007 WERE $29.4 BILLION, UP 7 PERCENT. THIS GROWTH

WAS PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF AN 11 PERCENT INCREASE IN

SALES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., REFLECTING IN PART THE BENEFIT OF A

WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR (USD), WHICH ADDED 3 PERCENT TO

WORLDWIDE SALES. WORLDWIDE VOLUMES AND LOCAL SELLING PRICES EACH

INCREASED 2 PERCENT. SALES IN THE U.S. INCREASED

1 PERCENT REFLECTING 3 PERCENT HIGHER SELLING PRICES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 2 PERCENT LOWER VOLUME. THE DECREASE IN

U.S. SALES VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION AND MOTOR

VEHICLE PRODUCTION MARKETS. SALES IN CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA

INCREASED 15 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 10 PERCENT

VOLUME INCREASE REFLECTING A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN SALES OF

SEED AND CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN SOUTH AMERICA.

2007 VERSUS 2006

OTHER INCOME, NET,

DECREASED $286 MILLION VERSUS 2006. THIS REDUCTION IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $165 MILLION TO

OF $81 MILLION IN NET PRE-TAX EXCHANGE GAINS AND A DECREASE

®

/HYZAAR

®

INCOME OF $128 MILLION (SEE PAGE 33 FOR

PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT INFORMATION AND NOTE 3 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

THE DECREASE IN MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS RESULTED FROM THE ABSENCE OF

2006 BENEFITS OF $90 MILLION FOR THE REVERSAL OF ACCRUED

INTEREST RELATED TO THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN

PRIOR-YEAR TAX CONTINGENCIES AND $76 MILLION OF INSURANCE

RECOVERIES FROM ITS INSURANCE CARRIERS AS PART OF ASBESTOS

LITIGATION MATTERS. OF THE $76 MILLION, $61 MILLION

RELATED TO COSTS, INCLUDING OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES

AND SETTLEMENTS PAID OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. DURING THIS

TWENTY YEAR PERIOD, DUPONT HAS BEEN SERVED WITH THOUSANDS OF

LAWSUITS ALLEGING INJURY FROM EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS ON DUPONT

PREMISES. MOST OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF THROUGH

TRIAL, DISMISSAL OR SETTLEMENT. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS REMOTE

THAT THE OUTCOME OF REMAINING OR FUTURE ASBESTOS LITIGATION

MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THESE ASBESTOS RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES WERE REFLECTED IN

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE REMAINING

$15 MILLION IS PART OF A TOTAL RECOVERY OF

$143 MILLION RELATING TO INSURANCE RECOVERIES ASSOCIATED

WITH DAMAGES TO THE COMPANYS FACILITIES SUFFERED AS A

RESULT OF HURRICANE KATRINA IN 2005. THE MAJORITY OF THE

HURRICANE KATRINA RECOVERY WAS INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD

AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME

STATEMENTS. NO AMOUNTS WERE RECEIVED FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR

DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF HURRICANE RITA.

INCREASE OF 11 PERCENT. COGS WAS 79 PERCENT OF NET

SALES FOR 2008 VERSUS 74 PERCENT FOR THE YEAR 2007. THE

5 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS A

$535 MILLION CHARGE FOR RESTRUCTURING AS DISCUSSED BELOW, A

$227 MILLION CHARGE FOR HURRICANE-RELATED CLEANUP AND

REPAIR, AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL, ENERGY AND

FREIGHT COSTS.

IN 2008, THE COMPANY INITIATED A GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN

RESPONSE TO THE DECLINE IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE AND CONSTRUCTION

MARKETS, AS WELL AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION. THE PROGRAM

WAS ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY ACROSS

THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES THE

ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 2,500 POSITIONS PRINCIPALLY LOCATED

IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THE U.S. PRIMARILY SUPPORTING THE

MOTOR VEHICLE AND CONSTRUCTION MARKETS.

A RESULTING CHARGE OF $535 MILLION HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN

COGS. THIS CHARGE INCLUDES COSTS OF $287 MILLION RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS AND $248 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO

ASSET SHUT-DOWNS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER NON-PERSONNEL

CHARGES. ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM ARE

CONTAINED IN THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT REVIEWS AND IN NOTE 5

ESSENTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM

WILL BEGIN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. THE PROGRAM IS

ESTIMATED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE IN 2010. THERE WERE NO

CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM IN 2008.

EXPECTED PRE-TAX COST SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION

PER YEAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM WHEN COMPLETE.

APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION OF THIS SAVINGS IS EXPECTED TO

BE REALIZED IN 2009.

2007 VERSUS 2006

COGS FOR THE YEAR 2007

WERE $21.7 BILLION, VERSUS $20.6 BILLION IN 2006, AN

INCREASE OF 5 PERCENT. COGS WAS 74 PERCENT OF NET

SALES FOR 2007 VERSUS 75 PERCENT FOR THE YEAR 2006. THE

1 PERCENTAGE POINT REDUCTION PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS THE

ABSENCE OF 2006 CHARGES FOR RESTRUCTURING, THE EFFECTS OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AND A CURRENT YEAR

BENEFIT FROM THE WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR DUE TO CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES WHICH INCREASED SALES AT A HIGHER RATE

THAN THE RATE THEY INCREASED COGS. PARTLY OFFSETTING THESE

FACTORS WERE INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL AND FINISHED PRODUCT

DISTRIBUTION COSTS, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF A 2006 BENEFIT OF

$128 MILLION IN INSURANCE RECOVERIES.

THE 2006 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS INCLUDED THE ELIMINATION OF

APPROXIMATELY 3,200 POSITIONS AND REDEPLOYMENT OF ABOUT 650. THE

COMPANY RECORDED A NET CHARGE OF $326 MILLION IN 2006

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES. THIS INCLUDED $184 MILLION TO PROVIDE SEVERANCE

BENEFITS FOR APPROXIMATELY 2,800 EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN

MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SALES, ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL

ACTIVITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE 2006 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE. ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO

THESE PROGRAMS ARE CONTAINED IN THE SEGMENT REVIEWS AND IN

$125 MILLION PER YEAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM, APPROXIMATELY

$53 MILLION OF WHICH IS REFLECTED IN COGS. CUMULATIVE

SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY 100 PERCENT, 80 PERCENT AND

FOR THE YEAR 2009, THE COMPANYS EARNINGS OUTLOOK IS A

RANGE OF $2.00 TO $2.50 PER SHARE, ANTICIPATING THAT THE GLOBAL

ECONOMIC RECESSION WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

RESULTS. FAVORABLE GLOBAL AGRICULTURE MARKET AND COMPETITIVE

CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT CONTINUED SALES AND EARNINGS

GROWTH FOR THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT.

HOWEVER, LOWER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS MAJOR POLYMER,

CHEMICAL, MATERIAL, AND ELECTRONIC PRODUCT LINES AND THE IMPACT

OF CURRENCY ARE EXPECTED TO LIMIT THE COMPANYS OVERALL

REVENUE GROWTH. THE COMPANY PLANS TO CONTINUE ITS APPROPRIATE

LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES EXPECTED TO HAVE ABOVE-AVERAGE

GROWTH RATES AND MARGINS. IN ADDITION, CASH-GENERATING ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED INCLUDING SPENDING REDUCTIONS AND

RESTRUCTURING TO BETTER ALIGN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND COSTS

WITH ANTICIPATED CONTINUING LOWER GLOBAL DEMAND. FOR 2009, THE

COMPANY HAS SET TARGETS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF ABOUT

$1.6 BILLION, AND FIXED COST AND WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTIONS

OF ABOUT $730 MILLION AND $1 BILLION RESPECTIVELY.

STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 141 (REVISED 2007) BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS (SFAS 141R) WHICH REPLACES

SFAS NO. 141. SFAS 141R ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION

AND MEASUREMENT OF IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES

ASSUMED, AND NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

SFAS 141R ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE THAT ENABLES USERS OF

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO BETTER EVALUATE THE NATURE AND

FINANCIAL EFFECT OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. SFAS 141R

APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE

ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST

ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2008. SFAS 141R WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AT THE

TIME OF ADOPTION SFAS 141R WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS THAN CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. THUS, ACCOUNTING FOR

POTENTIAL FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AFTER ADOPTION MAY

PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESULT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT

IMPACT THAN UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH

BULLETIN NO. 51 (SFAS 160) WHICH

CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS AND

FOR THE DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT

A THIRD-PARTY, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN A CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY IS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY

THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. SFAS 160 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE THAT CLEARLY

IDENTIFIES AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF THE PARENT

AND THE INTERESTS OF THE NON-CONTROLLING OWNERS. SFAS 160

IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2008. SFAS 160 WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AT THE

TIME OF ADOPTION SFAS 160 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133

(SFAS 161). EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS

BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008, THE NEW STANDARD

REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BETTER CONVEY THE PURPOSE OF

DERIVATIVE USE AND THE RISKS MANAGED. SFAS 161 WILL NOT

AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. THE NEW STANDARD SOLELY AFFECTS THE DISCLOSURE OF

INFORMATION.

IN DECEMBER 2008, FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP)

FAS 132(R)-1, EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009. THE NEW

STANDARD EXPANDS DISCLOSURES FOR ASSETS HELD BY EMPLOYER PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. FSP FAS 132(R)-1

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE

FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE

POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE

THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE

INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE

UNITES STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY

VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES,

RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION.

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY

REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS

APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS

SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS

ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON

PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. MANAGEMENT

REVIEWS THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY AS OF

DECEMBER 31ST. THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE UPDATED

PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS

ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS APPROPRIATE. AS PERMITTED BY GAAP,

ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED

ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES

EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PLAN OBLIGATIONS OR

THE APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS, THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE

AVERAGE REMAINING WORKING LIFE OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS BENEFIT OBLIGATION

FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS OTHER

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

BENEFIT PLANS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY UTILIZES PUBLISHED

LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT

RATE AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. WHERE COMMONLY AVAILABLE, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS INDICES OF VARIOUS DURATIONS TO REFLECT THE

TIMING OF FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

WITHIN THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET

ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR

SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT

BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN

OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND

PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY

STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON

HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES

COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION

OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO

PLAN PARTICIPANTS.

IN DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE

OF ASSETS RATHER THAN THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE

MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS IS CALCULATED BY AVERAGING MARKET

RETURNS OVER 36 MONTHS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY BE A LAG IN

RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A RESULT, CHANGES

IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED

IN THE COMPANYS CALCULATION OF NET PENSION COST. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE AND FAIR MARKET

VALUE OF ASSETS. THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS IN ALL PENSION

PLANS WAS $16.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND THE

RELATED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS WERE $21.5 BILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES ARE

BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

COMPLEXITY OF THE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF

CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS

WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTIPARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER OF AND

FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED A

LIABILITY OF $379 MILLION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE

CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE

AMOUNT ACCRUED. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY

ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE

CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS.

THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN

INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE

COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES

A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS

PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT

WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK

FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE VARIOUS LAWS AND

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE

LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY FOR CLEANING UP THE DAMAGE RESULTING

FROM COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE DISPOSAL. OVER THE NEXT TWO

DECADES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS UNDER BOTH

CERCLA AND RCRA.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST

FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS,

DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING

REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

PRPS. THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP PRECISE ESTIMATES OF

FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS.

LEGAL

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY

SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND

CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY

STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS

ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE

INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ACCRUALS TO REFLECT THE

IMPACT AND STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS, SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE

OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO

A PARTICULAR MATTER. PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND

LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES

SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY

MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES. IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY

OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY

FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE

NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE

COMPANYS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE

JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED, INPUT FROM OUTSIDE

LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING THE MATTER THROUGH

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND THE MATTERS

CURRENT STATUS. CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING

WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION ACCRUAL WHEN AN ADVERSE

JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A COURT PROCEEDING.

IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF,

BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND

INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE

PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNED ON APPEAL. A

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION MATTERS IS

CONTAINED IN NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL

COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF

UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE TAXES THE

COMPANY WILL PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN

VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION

OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX

AUDITS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANYS TAX ASSETS AND TAX

LIABILITIES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE

SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE

TIMING OF COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A

CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES OR DECREASES THAT MAY

OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX

LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED

TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE

VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE

REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE

TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS

TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL

REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN RECORDING A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND

GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN

SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD A DEFERRED TAX ASSET

BALANCE OF $6,524 MILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF

$1,693 MILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO

OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN

TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND

TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE

ASSETS.

VALUATION OF

ASSETS

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN

AFFILIATES IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANYS NORMAL

ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS. TESTING FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT

OF THESE ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS

ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AT A

PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. THE DYNAMIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN

WHICH THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES OPERATE, AND KEY ECONOMIC

AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTED SELLING

PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS. ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE

ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.

CHANGES IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EXISTENCE AND

MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIME IN WHICH SUCH

IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED. FUTURE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT

AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE ASSETS BEING EVALUATED COULD

ALSO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. BASED ON THE

RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN 2008, NO

IMPAIRMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE GLOBAL

RECESSION, THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION IN THE FAIR VALUES IN

EXCESS OF BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS WITHIN GOODWILL AND OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE

CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UTILIZED ARE BOTH REASONABLE

AND APPROPRIATE. FUTURE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE ASSETS BEING EVALUATED COULD RESULT IN

AN INCREASE OR DECREASE OF EXCESS FAIR VALUES OF BOOK VALUE, OR

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE

COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ON LONG-LIVED

ASSETS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION LEVERAGES THE COMPANYS

TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE TO

IMPROVE THE QUANTITY, QUALITY AND SAFETY OF THE GLOBAL FOOD

SUPPLY. LAND AVAILABLE FOR WORLDWIDE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS

INCREASINGLY LIMITED. THEREFORE, INCREASES IN PRODUCTION WILL

NEED TO BE ACHIEVED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH IMPROVING CROP YIELDS

AND PRODUCTIVITY RATHER THAN THROUGH INCREASES IN PLANTED

ACREAGE. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION DELIVERS A BROAD

PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY

TARGETED TO ACHIEVE GAINS IN CROP YIELDS AND PRODUCTIVITY,

INCLUDING

PIONEER

®

BRAND SEED PRODUCTS AND WELL-ESTABLISHED BRANDS OF INSECTICIDES,

FUNGICIDES AND HERBICIDES. THE SEGMENT OPERATES ACROSS THE FOOD

VALUE CHAIN FROM INPUTS FOR PRODUCING AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS TO

GLOBAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOY-BASED FOOD INGREDIENTS

TO FOOD QUALITY DIAGNOSTIC TESTING EQUIPMENT. RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FOCUSES ON LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE GROWER

PRODUCTIVITY AND ENHANCE THE VALUE OF GRAINS AND SOY THROUGH

IMPROVED SEED TRAITS, SUPERIOR GERMPLASM AND THE EFFECTIVE USE

OF INSECTICIDES, HERBICIDES AND FUNGICIDES.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION INCLUDES THE COMPANYS

WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, PIONEER HI-BRED INTERNATIONAL, INC.

(PIONEER), WHICH IS ALSO THE WORLDS LEADING SEED BRAND AND

A WORLD LEADER IN IMPROVING CROP YIELDS WITH HYBRID AND VARIETAL

SEEDS THAT IMPROVE GROWER YIELDS AND PROVIDE INSECT PROTECTION

AND HERBICIDE TOLERANCE. THE PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS OF PIONEER ARE

HYBRID SEED CORN AND SOYBEAN SEED. IN 2008, PIONEER BENEFITED

FROM THE GLOBAL LAUNCH OF APPROXIMATELY 30 NEW SOYBEAN VARIETIES

AND 60 NEW

PIONEER

®

BRAND CORN HYBRIDS THAT INCLUDE NEW COMBINATIONS OF CORN BORER,

CORN ROOTWORM AND WEED MANAGEMENT TRAITS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE

PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WITH CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN

THE GRAIN AND SPECIALTY CROP SECTORS, FORESTRY AND VEGETATION

MANAGEMENT. PRINCIPAL CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS ARE HERBICIDES,

FUNGICIDES, INSECT CONTROL PRODUCTS AND PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS.

THE SEGMENT CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS PRESENCE IN FRUIT AND

VEGETABLE SPECIALTY MARKETS AND CONTINUES TO EXPAND PRODUCT

OFFERINGS IN THE PROFESSIONAL PEST CONTROL MARKET. ADDITIONALLY,

THE SEGMENT OPERATES WITHIN THE SPECIALTY FOOD INGREDIENTS

MARKET, INCLUDING SOY PROTEINS AND LECITHINS THROUGH ITS

MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE WITH BUNGE LIMITED, THE SOLAE COMPANY.

2008 VERSUS 2007

SALES OF

$8 BILLION WERE 16 PERCENT HIGHER REFLECTING

14 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND 3 PERCENT

HIGHER VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1 PERCENT REDUCTION

FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES. THE VOLUME GROWTH REFLECTS HIGHER CORN

SEED SALES IN EUROPE AND BRAZIL, RECORD SOYBEAN SEED SALES IN

NORTH AMERICA AND BRAZIL DUE TO MARKET SHARE GAINS AND INCREASED

ACREAGE SHIFT FROM CORN, AND STRONG DEMAND FOR CORN AND CEREAL

HERBICIDES AND CEREAL FUNGICIDES IN EUROPE. THE HIGHER USD

SELLING PRICES REFLECT HIGHER VALUE PRODUCT MIX, PRICING ACTIONS

TO OFFSET THE INCREASES OF RAW MATERIALS COSTS AND FAVORABLE

CURRENCY IMPACTS IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA.

PTOI FOR 2008 WAS $1.1 BILLION, UP 22 PERCENT VERSUS

$894 MILLION IN 2007, PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES

AND HIGHER VALUE PRODUCT MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED

FUNDING OF STRATEGIC GROWTH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT AND SALES AND MARKETING.

2007 VERSUS 2006

SALES OF

$6.8 BILLION WERE 14 PERCENT HIGHER REFLECTING

9 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND A 5 PERCENT

INCREASE IN VOLUME. HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES REFLECTED A RICHER

MIX OF CORN AND SOYBEAN SEED, AND CROP PROTECTION HERBICIDES AND

FUNGICIDES. VOLUME INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY CORN SEED SALES IN

NORTH AMERICA, HERBICIDES IN EUROPE AND FUNGICIDES IN LATIN

AMERICA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE SALE OF SOYBEAN

SEED ON LOWER PLANTING ACREAGE IN NORTH AMERICA.

THE SEGMENTS TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE BUSINESS HAS MOVED

FROM A STARTUP TO AN ESTABLISHED, GROWING BUSINESS, SHIPPING

PRODUCT GLOBALLY. IN 2008, CONSTRUCTION WAS COMPLETED AND

OPERATIONS BEGAN AT A $30 MILLION TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE

FACILITY AT ITS TITANIUM DIOXIDE PLANT IN TENNESSEE.

THE KEY MARKETS IN WHICH COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES

OPERATES CONTINUED TO GROW FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, WITH GROWTH IN

THE EMERGING REGIONS, OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN DEMAND

ACROSS THE SEGMENT DURING THE LAST FOUR MONTHS OF 2008 AS THE

INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAINS DESTOCKED WORLDWIDE IN RESPONSE TO THE

GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION.

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE PRODUCTS WAS DOWN IN 2008

WITH GLOBAL MARKET VOLUMES DOWN 5 PERCENT FROM 2007. SALES

FOR REFINISH PRODUCTS INCREASED IN ALL REGIONS, EXCEPT THE

U.S. THE OEM MARKET REALIZED GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA AND

ASIA PACIFIC, HOWEVER THIS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT

DECLINES IN EUROPE, U.S., AND CANADA AS A RESULT OF LOWER BUILDS

OF AUTOMOBILES AND LIGHT TRUCKS IN 2008. INDUSTRIAL COATINGS

SALES INCREASED IN MOST REGIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND

CANADA, WITH LARGER INCREASES IN ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA.

IN DECEMBER 2008, AS PART OF THE COMPANYS RESTRUCTURING

PLAN, THE SEGMENT RECORDED A CHARGE OF $236 MILLION THAT

INCLUDED COSTS FOR EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS AND ASSET RELATED

CHARGES AND WILL COVER THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1,600

POSITIONS AND THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN MANUFACTURING UNITS. THE

PLAN IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2010 AND WILL RESULT IN COST

SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION IN 2009, WITH AN

ANNUAL SAVINGS RATE OF APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION.

2008 VERSUS 2007

SALES OF

$6.6 BILLION WERE FLAT WHEN COMPARED TO 2007, REFLECTING

8 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, OFFSET BY AN

8 PERCENT VOLUME DECLINE. THE HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES

PRIMARILY REFLECT FAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS IN EUROPE AND LATIN

AMERICA AND PRICING ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE INCREASES OF RAW

MATERIALS COSTS. THE DECREASE IN VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER SALES OF PRODUCTS SOLD TO OEMS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE

AND LOWER DEMAND FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

STRONG SALES IN EMERGING MARKETS.

2008 PTOI WAS $326 MILLION AS COMPARED TO

$840 MILLION IN 2007. YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN PTOI

REFLECTS THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS

THE IMPACT OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND LOWER VOLUMES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRICES AND STRONG SALES IN EMERGING

MARKETS.

2007 VERSUS 2006

SALES OF

$6.6 BILLION WERE UP 5 PERCENT, REFLECTING ABOUT

4 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES FOR THE SEGMENT, AS

WELL AS A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN VOLUME. USD SELLING PRICES

WERE HIGHER ACROSS A MAJORITY OF THE SEGMENTS PRODUCTS.

THE INCREASE IN VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SALES

OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC.

THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN VOLUME FOR

PRODUCTS SOLD TO OEM PRODUCERS, PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA AND

EUROPE. VOLUMES FOR SALES OF REFINISH PRODUCTS WERE RELATIVELY

FLAT AS COMPARED TO 2006.

PTOI IN 2007 OF $840 MILLION INCREASED FROM

$817 MILLION IN 2006. THE PTOI IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF HIGHER REVENUE DRIVEN BY HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES

AND BENEFITS REALIZED FROM THE 2006 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL AND TRANSPORTATION

COSTS. PTOI IN 2006 INCLUDED A NET CHARGE OF $132 MILLION

FOR RESTRUCTURING AND $30 MILLION PRIMARILY FOR ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION RELATED TO THE TRANSFORMATION PLAN THAT WAS

INITIATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2006 (SEE NOTE 5 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THESE CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY $142 MILLION IN INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE HURRICANE DAMAGES INCURRED IN 2005.

OUTLOOK

SALES IN 2009 ARE EXPECTED TO

DECREASE, REFLECTING CONTINUED WEAKNESS DUE TO THE GLOBAL

RECESSION. INDUSTRY DEMAND FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE IS EXPECTED TO

BE LOWER IN 2009, WITH CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN NORTH AMERICAN AND

EUROPEAN CONSTRUCTION AND MOTOR VEHICLE MARKETS. CONDITIONS IN

THE GLOBAL COATINGS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A

CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN 2009. MODEST DECLINES ARE

EXPECTED FOR REFINISH MARKETS IN MATURE ECONOMIES WHILE MODEST

GROWTH IS EXPECTED IN EMERGING MARKETS. PROFITABILITY OF

COATINGS SOLD TO OEM PRODUCERS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON VOLUME

AT SPECIFIC PLANTS THE COMPANY SERVICES. GLOBAL MOTOR VEHICLE

INDUSTRY BUILDS IN 2009 ARE EXPECTED TO BE DOWN FROM 2008 WITH

ALL REGIONS SHOWING DECLINES. LOWER RAW MATERIAL COST, FIXED

COST BENEFITS FROM THE COMPANYS 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO PARTIALLY OFFSET

THE IMPACT OF LOWER VOLUMES.

2008 VERSUS 2007

SALES OF

$4 BILLION WERE UP 5 PERCENT, REFLECTING

7 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, 3 PERCENT VOLUME

DECLINE AND A 1 PERCENT INCREASE FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES.

THE HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES MAINLY REFLECT PRICING ACTIONS TO

OFFSET THE INCREASES OF RAW MATERIALS COSTS AND FAVORABLE

CURRENCY IMPACTS IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC. THE LOWER VOLUMES

REFLECT DECREASED DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS ACROSS THE SEGMENT KEY

MARKETS, MOSTLY TOWARDS THE END OF 2008, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED DEMAND FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC PRODUCTS AND HIGHER SALES IN

EMERGING MARKETS.

PTOI WAS $436 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $594 MILLION IN

2007. THIS DECLINE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY HIGHER RAW MATERIALS

COST, LOWER SALES VOLUMES AND THE IMPACT OF THE $55 MILLION

CHARGE FOR THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. 2007 PTOI ALSO

INCLUDES A BENEFIT OF $53 MILLION RELATED TO A GAIN ON A

LAND SALE AND INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS.

2007 VERSUS 2006

SALES OF

$3.8 BILLION WERE UP 6 PERCENT VERSUS 2006, REFLECTING

5 PERCENT VOLUME GROWTH AND 1 PERCENT HIGHER USD

SELLING PRICES. THE VOLUME GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED

DEMAND FOR FLUOROPRODUCTS AND PACKAGING GRAPHICS. SALES GROWTH

WAS STRONGEST OUTSIDE THE U.S.

PTOI IN 2007 WAS $594 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF

3 PERCENT COMPARED TO 2006. THIS INCREASE REFLECTS

5 PERCENT SALES VOLUME GROWTH, AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT OF

$53 MILLION RELATED TO A GAIN ON A LAND SALE AND INVENTORY

VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER INGREDIENT AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS AS WELL AS INCREASED

FIXED COST FROM GROWTH INITIATIVES.

OUTLOOK

FOR 2009, SALES FOR ELECTRONIC

MATERIALS, FLUOROPRODUCTS, AND PACKAGING GRAPHICS PRODUCTS WILL

BE IMPACTED BY THE GLOBAL RECESSION. CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE

PHOTOVOLTAICS MARKET, COST CONTROL INITIATIVES AND BENEFITS FROM

THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WILL PARTIALLY OFFSET THE EFFECT

OF LOWER VOLUMES. THIS SEGMENT MANUFACTURES PRODUCTS THAT COULD

BE AFFECTED BY UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA MATTERS. SEE

2008 VERSUS 2007

SALES OF

$6.4 BILLION WERE 3 PERCENT LOWER, DRIVEN BY A

13 PERCENT DECREASE IN VOLUME AND A 1 PERCENT

REDUCTION FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET

11 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES. SALES VOLUME DECLINES

WERE MORE PRONOUNCED BEGINNING LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER, WITH

CONTINUED AND ACCELERATED DETERIORATION THROUGH THE FOURTH

QUARTER, AND OCCURRED IN ALL MAJOR REGIONS AND END-USE MARKET

SEGMENTS. THE DECLINE REFLECTS A BROAD INDUSTRY MOVEMENT TO

REDUCE INVENTORY AND IMPROVE CASH POSITIONS TO MANAGE THROUGH

WHAT IS PROJECTED TO BE A PROTRACTED PERIOD OF WEAK GLOBAL

ECONOMIC DEMAND. VOLUMES WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY

EXTENDED OPERATING UNIT SHUTDOWNS RELATED TO THE TIME TAKEN TO

IMPLEMENT FACILITY REPAIRS STEMMING FROM DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH

HURRICANES GUSTAV AND IKE. OPERATING UNITS OUTAGES ASSOCIATED

WITH THE HURRICANES WERE OF VARYING LENGTHS DEPENDING ON THE

LEVEL OF DAMAGE INCURRED AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN UTILITIES AND

INGREDIENTS TO ENABLE A RESTART.

2008 PTOI WAS $128 MILLION COMPARED TO

$626 MILLION IN 2007. 2008 PTOI INCLUDES CHARGES RELATED TO

HURRICANE DAMAGES OF $216 MILLION. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF

THE COMPANYS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, THE SEGMENT RECORDED A

CHARGE OF $94 MILLION TO COVER EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS

AND OTHER ASSETS RELATED CHARGES. THE DECLINE IN PTOI WAS ALSO

INFLUENCED BY CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH LOW CAPACITY UTILIZATION

OF PRODUCTION UNITS TO REDUCE INVENTORIES DUE TO THE DECREASED

DEMAND. THE DECREASE IN PTOI IN 2008 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

ABSENCE OF A $165 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN 2007 TO

WRITE DOWN THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN A POLYESTER FILMS

JOINT VENTURE.

2007 VERSUS 2006

SALES OF

$6.6 BILLION WERE 7 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2006

REFLECTING 8 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, PARTLY

OFFSET BY 1 PERCENT LOWER VOLUME. SALES VOLUME DECLINES

REFLECT THE IMPACT OF INGREDIENTS SHORTAGES, TEMPORARY OPERATING

UNIT SHUTDOWNS AND SOFTNESS IN NORTH AMERICA, PRINCIPALLY IN THE

AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PARTLY OFFSET BY VOLUME IMPROVEMENTS IN

LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC.

2007 PTOI INCREASED 12 PERCENT TO $626 MILLION.

2007 PTOI INCLUDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $165 MILLION TO

WRITE DOWN THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN A POLYESTER FILMS

JOINT VENTURE. THE IMPAIRMENT RESULTED FROM SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE RAPID

RISE IN OIL-RELATED RAW MATERIAL COSTS, WHICH HAVE HAD A

NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY ON THE VENTURES

OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. IMPROVEMENT IN 2007 PTOI

WAS DRIVEN BY IMPROVED PRICING, WHICH REFLECTED BOTH THE OFFSET

OF THE INGREDIENT COST INCREASES SEEN DURING THE YEAR AND

IMPROVED PRODUCT SALES MIX, AND POSITIVE CURRENCY BENEFITS,

OFFSET IN PART BY THE WEAKER VOLUME. THE SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN

THE ELASTOMERS ANTITRUST MATTERS AND RECORDED A NET

$20 MILLION CHARGE IN 2007 RELATED TO THESE MATTERS (SEE

NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

OUTLOOK

GLOBAL MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY

BUILDS IN 2009 ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE. MOST OF THE MARKETS

SERVED BY THE SEGMENT ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN SOFT IN 2009. THE

2009 OUTLOOK ALSO ASSUMES A SOFTENING FROM A WEAK PETROCHEMICAL

CYCLE. REVENUE IS ALSO EXPECTED TO DECLINE IN PART DUE TO LOWER

PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACTS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER LOCAL CURRENCY AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. PTOI IS

EXPECTED TO DECLINE, AS BENEFITS FROM LOWER AVERAGE INGREDIENT

PRICES, IMPROVED FIXED COST PERFORMANCE, BENEFITS FROM THE

2008 PTOI WAS $829 MILLION COMPARED TO

$1,199 MILLION IN 2007. THE DECREASED EARNINGS WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS AND THE IMPACT OF LOWER

VOLUMES RELATED TO THE GLOBAL RECESSION. IN ADDITION, 2008 PTOI

INCLUDES A CHARGE OF $101 MILLION TO COVER EMPLOYEE

SEPARATION COSTS AND OTHER ASSET RELATED CHARGES AS PART OF THE

COMPANY RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

2007 VERSUS 2006

SALES OF

$5.6 BILLION WERE 3 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2006, DUE TO

HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE

SEGMENT. SALES VOLUMES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT AS HIGHER SALES

OF

KEVLAR

®

AND

NOMEX

®

WERE OFFSET BY DECREASED SALES OF PRODUCTS FOR

U.S. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKETS.

PTOI IN 2007 WAS $1,199 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF

11 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASED EARNINGS WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES OF

KEVLAR

®

AND

NOMEX

®.

2006 PTOI INCLUDED A $47 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

RELATED TO AN INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL ASSET HELD FOR SALE, PARTIALLY

ENDS IN APRIL 2010. THE WORLDWIDE AGREEMENT TERMINATES WHEN THE

FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET: (I) THE CANADIAN EXCLUSIVITY

ENDS IN 2013, AND (II) NORTH AMERICAN SALES FALL BELOW A

CERTAIN LEVEL. THEREFORE, ABSENT ANY MAJOR CHANGES IN THE

MARKETS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS INCOME TO TAKE ITS FIRST

SIGNIFICANT STEP-DOWN IN 2010, AND FROM THAT YEAR ON, CONTINUE

TO STEP-DOWN EACH YEAR TO ZERO WHEN THE CONTRACT ENDS, WHICH IS

EXPECTED TO BE AFTER 2013. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE

MAGNITUDE OF THE EARNINGS STEP-DOWN IN EACH YEAR. IN GENERAL,

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS A TRADITIONAL SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH

DECLINE FOR A DRUG GOING OFF PATENT IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL

THE COMPANY INCLUDES EMBRYONIC BUSINESSES NOT INCLUDED IN THE

GROWTH SEGMENTS, SUCH AS APPLIED BIOSCIENCES AND NONALIGNED

BUSINESSES IN OTHER. THE POTENTIAL VIABILITY OF EACH EMBRYONIC

CAPABILITIES. USING THESE FACTORS AND OTHERS, MANAGEMENT

PERIODICALLY ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL AND FIT OF THESE BUSINESSES

APPLIED BIOSCIENCES IS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

BIOTECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS USING BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, MATERIALS

SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION TO SERVE OUR

ASSETS OF TEXTILES & INTERIORS.

IN THE AGGREGATE, SALES IN OTHER FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006

REPRESENT LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF TOTAL SEGMENT SALES.

PTOI IN 2008 WAS A LOSS OF $181 MILLION COMPARED TO A LOSS

OF $224 MILLION IN 2007. THE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE YEAR WAS

MAINLY DUE TO A BENEFIT OF $51 MILLION FROM A LITIGATION

SETTLEMENT IN 2008 AND THE ABSENCE OF A $69 MILLION CHARGE

RECORDED IN 2007 FOR LITIGATION RELATED TO A DISCONTINUED

BUSINESS.

PTOI IN 2007 WAS A LOSS OF $224 MILLION COMPARED TO A LOSS

OF $173 MILLION IN 2006. THE 29 PERCENT INCREASE IN

THE PRE-TAX LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVENTORY, FREIGHT

AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS. PTOI IN 2007 INCLUDED LITIGATION

CHARGES FOR FORMER BUSINESSES OF $69 MILLION. PTOI IN 2006

INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $27 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN CERTAIN

LIQUIDITY &

CAPITAL RESOURCES

DESPITE THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION AND ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN

THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS, COUPLED

WITH COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS,

WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS TO FUND

WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL SPENDING, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DEBT

MATURITIES AND OTHER CASH NEEDS. THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY

NEEDS CAN BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, SYNDICATED CREDIT

LINES, BILATERAL CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS

AND ASSET SALES. THE COMPANYS CURRENT STRONG FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RATINGS HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIALLY

IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, CASH

GENERATING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED INCLUDING SPENDING

REDUCTIONS AND RESTRUCTURING TO BETTER ALIGN CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES AND COSTS WITH ANTICIPATED CONTINUING LOWER GLOBAL

PURSUANT TO ITS CASH DISCIPLINE POLICY, THE COMPANY SEEKS FIRST

TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND, TO RETURN EXCESS

CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH

IS COMPELLING. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE

SECURITIES BALANCES OF $3.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, PROVIDE PRIMARY LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ALL SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY

$2.7 BILLION IN CREDIT LINES WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, AS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO MEET SHORT TERM LIQUIDITY

NEEDS. THESE CREDIT LINES ARE PRIMARILY MULTI-YEAR FACILITIES.

THE $1.6 BILLION DECREASE FROM THE $4.3 BILLION IN

CREDIT LINES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

EXPIRATION OF CREDIT LINES OBTAINED TO SUPPORT THE

COMPANYS CASH REPATRIATION PROGRAM UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS

CREATION ACT OF 2004 (AJCA).

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DEBT PORTFOLIO AND

OCCASIONALLY MAY REBALANCE IT TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND

CONTRACTS IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANYS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$4.3 BILLION IN 2007, A $554 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE

THE $3.9 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING

ACTIVITIES IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

INCREASE IN THE NET PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS AND THE ABSENCE OF

THE PURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY THE

DECREASE IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE

TERMINATED WITH A COMBINED NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.25 BILLION

FOR CASH PROCEEDS OF $226 MILLION, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED

WITHIN FINANCING CASH FLOWS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

REDUCTION TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE

DEBT, THROUGH 2018.

THE $746 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING

ACTIVITIES IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

COMPANYS SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED.

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS $9.7 BILLION, A

$2.4 BILLION INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE

PROCEEDS FROM THE INCREASED BORROWINGS WERE INVESTED IN CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $7.3 BILLION, A

$205 MILLION DECREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2006. THIS

DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS

RELATED TO THE 2005 AJCA CASH REPATRIATION PROGRAM, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE ISSUANCE OF $750 MILLION IN 5 YEAR NOTES

IN DECEMBER 2007.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO COMMON AND PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS WERE

REMAINING SHARES OF STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN.

IN OCTOBER 2005, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A

$5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN. IN OCTOBER 2005, THE COMPANY

REPURCHASED 75.7 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER

AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND PAID

$3.0 BILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE. UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE

AGREEMENT IN 2006, THE COMPANY PAID $180 MILLION IN CASH TO

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, IN 2006, THE COMPANY MADE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF

ITS SHARES FOR $100 MILLION. IN 2007, THE COMPANY PURCHASED

34.7 MILLION SHARES FOR $1.7 BILLION, THEREBY,

COMPLETING THIS PROGRAM. SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A RECONCILIATION OF SHARES ACTIVITY.

COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TERM OF THESE

INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX

AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY INDEFINITE. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS

AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW,

AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR

THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION

MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR

HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM,

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007 WERE $110 MILLION AND

$101 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO

THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF

LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE

PROVISIONS EXIST.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2004 SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE NET

ASSETS OF TEXTILES AND INTERIORS, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED

INVISTA AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES,

LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PURCHASE AND

SALE AGREEMENT IS $70 MILLION AND IS INCLUDED IN THE

INDEMNIFICATIONS BALANCE OF $110 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008. UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT,

THE COMPANYS TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION FOR THE

MAJORITY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CANNOT EXCEED

$1.4 BILLION. THE OTHER INDEMNITIES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS

LIMIT. IN MARCH 2008, INVISTA FILED SUIT IN THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WERE BREACHED AND,

THEREFORE, THAT DUPONT IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY IT. DUPONT

DISAGREES WITH THE EXTENT AND VALUE OF INVISTAS CLAIMS.

DUPONT HAS NOT CHANGED ITS ESTIMATE OF ITS TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION

OBLIGATION UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AS A RESULT OF

THE LAWSUIT.

OBLIGATIONS FOR

EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS

UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY

AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER AFFILIATED AND

UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY

HAD DIRECTLY GUARANTEED $605 MILLION OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS,

PLUS $121 MILLION RELATING TO GUARANTEES OF OBLIGATIONS FOR

DIVESTED SUBSIDIARIES. THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL

AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE COMPANY COULD

BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT

BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, A

LIABILITY OF $121 MILLION AND $135 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WAS RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS, REPRESENTING

THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK WHICH THE COMPANY DEEMS

PROBABLE. THIS LIABILITY IS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OBLIGATIONS

OF THE COMPANYS POLYESTER FILMS JOINT VENTURE WHICH ARE

GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY.

EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER

UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES AROSE AS PART OF CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS.

EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHER AFFILIATED

COMPANIES AROSE FOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN NORMAL OPERATIONS. IN

CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY HAS RECOURSE TO ASSETS HELD AS

COLLATERAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL GUARANTEES FROM CUSTOMERS AND

SUPPLIERS.

THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES

OF ITS DIVESTED SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDING CONOCO AND CONSOLIDATION

COAL SALES COMPANY. CONOCO AND CONSOLIDATION COAL SALES COMPANY

HAVE INDEMNIFIED THE COMPANY FOR ANY LIABILITIES THE COMPANY MAY

INCUR PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES. NO MATERIAL LOSS IS

ANTICIPATED BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NO SIGNIFICANT

LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS

GUARANTEES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HAD TO

MAKE SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS TO SATISFY GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO

SATISFY THESE GUARANTEES.

MASTER OPERATING

LEASES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAS ONE MASTER OPERATING

LEASE PROGRAM RELATING TO MISCELLANEOUS SHORT-LIVED EQUIPMENT

WITH AN UNAMORTIZED VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $106 MILLION.

LEASE PAYMENTS FOR THESE ASSETS TOTALED $55 MILLION IN

2008, $59 MILLION IN 2007 AND $58 MILLION IN 2006, AND

WERE REPORTED AS OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGH

ITS NORMAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND BELIEVES IT HAS THE

FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SATISFY THESE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

SHOULD UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE.

LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND

RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN

MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE

TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL,

DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS

AND DISABILITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES.

APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS.

PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANYS

NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE,

THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN

THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE

EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE.

WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE

RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE

PENSION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY

ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES PAY NEAR RETIREMENT.

PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED

TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED

BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN

EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND

PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS

ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE

ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE

REQUIRED TO BE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IN

2009 AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED.

CONTRIBUTIONS BEYOND 2009 ARE NOT DETERMINABLE SINCE THE AMOUNT

OF ANY CONTRIBUTION IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT, INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS, AND

PENDING REGULATION. U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED

FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED PLANS AND

THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM

OPERATING CASH FLOWS.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE

SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT

NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND

PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS

FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE

COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $252 MILLION IN 2008 AND ANTICIPATES

THAT IT WILL MAKE APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN

CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2009 TO PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (THE ACT) WAS

SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN AUGUST 2006. THE ACT

INTRODUCES NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-EMPLOYER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING PENSION

PLAN ASSETS AND PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR FUNDING PURPOSES,

INTRODUCES BENEFIT LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN UNDERFUNDED PLANS AND

RAISES TAX DEDUCTION LIMITS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT

PLANS. THE NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE FOR

PLAN YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS.

IN AUGUST 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED MAJOR CHANGES TO THE

PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS THAT COVER THE

MAJORITY OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2007, FOR SUCH EMPLOYEES HIRED ON THAT DATE OR THEREAFTER, AND

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, FOR SUCH ACTIVE EMPLOYEES ON THE

ROLLS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

100 PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE

EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. ADDITIONALLY, FOR SUCH

EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES 3 PERCENT OF EACH

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE

EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. THE DEFINITION OF

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION HAS ALSO BEEN EXPANDED TO BE SIMILAR TO

THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION USED IN DETERMINING

PENSION BENEFITS. SUCH FULL SERVICE EMPLOYEES ON THE ROLLS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL ALSO ACCRUE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IN

THE PENSION PLAN, BUT THE ANNUAL RATE OF PENSION ACCRUAL IS

ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE PREVIOUS RATE. IN ADDITION, COMPANY-PAID

POSTRETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR SUCH EMPLOYEES DO NOT

CONTINUE TO GROW AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. SUCH EMPLOYEES

HIRED IN THE U.S. AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2006 DO NOT

PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL

AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION

PLAN, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO RE-MEASURE ITS PENSION EXPENSE

FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006, REFLECTING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE RE-MEASUREMENT DATE. AS A RESULT OF BETTER

THAN EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE

OF 6 PERCENT AS OF THE RE-MEASUREMENT DATE, PRE-TAX PENSION

EXPENSE DECREASED BY $72 MILLION FOR 2006. FOR 2007, THE

PLAN AMENDMENT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN PENSION EXPENSE OF

ABOUT $40 MILLION. FOR 2008, THE PLAN AMENDMENT RESULTED IN

A REDUCTION OF ABOUT $40 MILLION IN COMBINED PENSION AND

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS EXPENSE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

RELATED TO THESE CHANGES IN THE PLANS NOTED ABOVE IS INCLUDED IN

NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 158 AND

RECORDED A $1,555 MILLION AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY PRIMARILY DUE TO RECLASSIFYING

UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS RELATED TO

THE PENSION PLANS.

MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY PLANS ARE

UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM

OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRE-TAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL

NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE

$326 MILLION, $315 MILLION AND $335 MILLION FOR

2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE

ABOUT $330 MILLION IN 2009. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS

REFLECT THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS,

DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS

AND DEDUCTIBLES.

THE COMPANYS INCOME CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY

PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS AS WELL AS RETIREE

MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

SUMMARIZES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMPANYS INCOME OVER

EACH OF THE LAST 3 YEARS WAS AFFECTED BY PRE-TAX CHARGES

THE ABOVE (BENEFITS)/CHARGES FOR PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH

YEAR. THE DECREASE IN PENSION EXPENSE IN 2008 PRIMARILY REFLECTS

FAVORABLE RETURNS ON PENSION ASSETS DURING 2007. THE DECREASE IN

PENSION EXPENSE IN 2007 REFLECTS FAVORABLE RETURNS ON PENSION

ASSETS DURING 2006, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS

AND DISCOUNT RATES. THE INCREASE IN 2007 OTHER LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CHARGES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS CHANGES IN

DEMOGRAPHICS, DISCOUNT RATES AND HIGHER THAN EXPECTED HEALTH

CARE COSTS.

THE COMPANYS KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS

PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND

THE DISCOUNT RATE (SEE NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2009, LOWER PENSION ASSETS AND HIGHER

HEALTH CARE COST ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE OF ABOUT $565 MILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

DUPONT OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, PRODUCT HANDLING AND

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT

ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, DUPONT IMPLEMENTS VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS

TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, ELIMINATE THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS

WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WASTE WATER DISCHARGES, INCREASE

THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF

PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS. MANAGEMENT HAS

NOTED A GLOBAL UPWARD TREND IN THE AMOUNT AND COMPLEXITY OF

PROPOSED CHEMICALS REGULATION. THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL

VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE

FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WHILE THESE COSTS MAY INCREASE IN

THE FUTURE, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

PRE-TAX ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS

TOTALED $628 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED WITH

$576 MILLION IN 2007 AND $521 MILLION IN 2006. THESE

EXPENSES INCLUDE THE REMEDIATION ACCRUALS DISCUSSED BELOW;

OPERATING, MAINTENANCE AND DEPRECIATION COSTS FOR SOLID WASTE,

AIR AND WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES AND THE COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS EXPENSES

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES TO BECOME

PROPORTIONALLY GREATER AS THE COMPANY INCREASES ITS

PARTICIPATION IN BUSINESSES FOR WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS

ARE REQUIRED DURING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. ABOUT 75 PERCENT

OF TOTAL ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES RESULTED FROM OPERATIONS

IN THE U.S.

IN 2008, DUPONT SPENT APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION ON

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR

NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANYS INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL

GOALS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$98 MILLION IN 2009. IN THE U.S., SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE

FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND

HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA).

UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN,

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING FUTURE ESTIMATES

FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL CAA CAPITAL COSTS OVER THE NEXT

TWO YEARS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO RANGE FROM $40 MILLION

TO $70 MILLION.

REGISTRATION

THE GOAL OF THE U.S. TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) IS

TO PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISKS OF INJURY TO HEALTH OR THE

ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURE, PROCESSING,

DISTRIBUTION IN COMMERCE, USE, OR DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL

SUBSTANCES. UNDER TSCA, THE EPA HAS ESTABLISHED REPORTING,

RECORD-KEEPING, TESTING AND CONTROL-RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW

AND EXISTING CHEMICALS. IN 1998, THE EPA CHALLENGED THE

U.S. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TO VOLUNTARILY CONDUCT SCREENING

LEVEL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING ON NEARLY 3,000

HIGH PRODUCTION VOLUME (HPV) CHEMICALS OR TO MAKE EQUIVALENT

INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AN HPV CHEMICAL IS A CHEMICAL

LISTED ON THE 1990 INVENTORY UPDATE RULE WITH ANNUAL

U.S. CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS OF ONE MILLION

POUNDS OR MORE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE ITS COMMITMENTS

REGARDING THE HPV CHEMICALS IT VOLUNTEERED TO SPONSOR WITHIN THE

NEXT TWO YEARS. APPROXIMATELY 500 CHEMICALS IN COMMERCE HAVE

ATTAINED HPV STATUS SINCE 1990. THE EXTENDED HPV (EHPV) PROGRAM

IS AN EXPANSION OF THE VOLUNTARY HPV PROGRAM AIMED AT FULFILLING

THE SAME GOALS ON THESE 500 CHEMICALS. DUPONT COMMITTED TO

CONDUCT TESTING ON TEN OF THESE EHPV CHEMICALS IN 2008 AND

TESTING IS UNDERWAY AND EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT TWO

YEARS.

IN DECEMBER 2006, THE EUROPEAN UNION ADOPTED A NEW REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK CONCERNING THE REGISTRATION, EVALUATION AND

AUTHORIZATION OF CHEMICALS. THIS REGULATORY FRAMEWORK KNOWN AS

REACH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON JUNE 1, 2007. ONE OF ITS MAIN

OBJECTIVES IS THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

ENVIRONMENT. REACH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS TO

GATHER INFORMATION ON THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR SUBSTANCES THAT

MEET CERTAIN VOLUME OR TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA AND REGISTER THE

INFORMATION IN A CENTRAL DATABASE TO BE MAINTAINED BY A CHEMICAL

AGENCY IN FINLAND. THE REGULATION ALSO CONTAINS A MECHANISM FOR

THE PROGRESSIVE SUBSTITUTION OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CHEMICALS

WHEN SUITABLE ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. DUPONT MET THE

DEADLINE OF DECEMBER 1, 2008 FOR THE PRE-REGISTRATION OF

THOSE CHEMICALS MANUFACTURED IN, OR IMPORTED INTO THE EUROPEAN

ECONOMIC AREA IN QUANTITIES OF 1 METRIC TON OR MORE THAT WERE

NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPTED. COMPLETE REGISTRATIONS CONTAINING

EXTENSIVE DATA ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHEMICAL WILL BE

REQUIRED IN THREE PHASES, DEPENDING ON PRODUCTION USAGE OR

TONNAGE IMPORTED PER YEAR, AND THE TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA OF THE

CHEMICAL. THE FIRST REGISTRATIONS ARE REQUIRED IN 2010;

SUBSEQUENT REGISTRATIONS ARE DUE IN 2013 AND 2018. THE

TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA CONSIDERED FOR REGISTRATION

DETERMINATIONS ARE CARCINOGENICITY, MUTAGENICITY, REPRODUCTIVE

TOXICITY (CATEGORY 1 AND 2), AND AQUATIC TOXICITY. BY

JUNE 1, 2013, THE COMMISSION WILL REVIEW WHETHER SUBSTANCES

WITH ENDOCRINE DISRUPTIVE PROPERTIES SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED IF

SAFER ALTERNATIVES EXIST. BY JUNE 1, 2019, THE COMMISSION

WILL DETERMINE WHETHER TO EXTEND THE DUTY TO WARN FROM

SUBSTANCES OF VERY HIGH CONCERN TO THOSE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS

OR UNPLEASANT. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE COSTS TO

COMPLY WITH REACH WILL BE MATERIAL TO ITS OPERATIONS AND

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

CLIMATE

CHANGE

DUPONT BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE

THAT WILL PRESENT NUMEROUS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BUSINESS

AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. SINCE THE EARLY 1990S WHEN DUPONT BEGAN

TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, THE COMPANY

HAS ACHIEVED MAJOR GLOBAL REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS. VOLUNTARY

EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY DUPONT AND OTHER COMPANIES

ARE VALUABLE BUT ALONE WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO EFFECTIVELY

ADDRESS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

A PROBLEM OF THIS SCALE. THE KYOTO PROTOCOL TO THE UNITED

NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE ENTERED INTO

FORCE IN FEBRUARY 2005 AND, WHILE NOT RATIFIED BY THE U.S., HAS

SPURRED POLICY ACTION BY MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND REGIONS AROUND

THE WORLD INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION. CONSIDERABLE

INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION IS NOW FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT OF A

POST-2012 INTERNATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE INTERNATIONAL

ACTION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN THE KYOTO PROTOCOL EXPIRES

IN 2012. PROPOSED AND EXISTING LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CONTROL OR

LIMIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS

ENERGY SOURCE AND SUPPLY CHOICES AS WELL AS INCREASE THE COST OF

ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM FOSSIL FUELS. HOWEVER, THE

SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SENSIBLE NATIONAL,

REGIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES COULD

PROVIDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THE

REGULATORY FUTURE, HELP GUIDE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND DRIVE

GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR LOW-CARBON AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS,

TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES.

THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES THE POTENTIAL RISKS THAT CLIMATE

CHANGE COULD PRESENT, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS PHYSICAL ASSETS, AS WELL AS REGULATORY AND

ECONOMIC ISSUES. DUPONT LOOKS FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE ITS

OVERALL PORTFOLIO LESS ENERGY INTENSIVE, AND ENERGY USE IS ONE

FACTOR THAT IS WEIGHED WHEN INVESTMENTS OR DIVESTITURES ARE

CONSIDERED. DUPONT IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET

MORE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEET NEW AND EXPANDED DEMANDS OF A

LOW-CARBON ECONOMY.

REMEDIATION

EXPENDITURES

THE RCRA EXTENSIVELY REGULATES AND REQUIRES PERMITS FOR THE

TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. RCRA

REQUIRES THAT PERMITTED FACILITIES UNDERTAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT THE FACILITY. IF CONDITIONS

WARRANT, COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION

CAUSED BY PRIOR OPERATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO CERCLA, THE COSTS OF

THE RCRA CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY BORNE SOLELY BY

THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT SIGNIFICANT ONGOING

EXPENDITURES FOR RCRA REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES MAY BE REQUIRED

OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEAR

TERM, HOWEVER, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE

RANGE OF SUCH EXPENDITURES EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE

UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANYS

EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION

ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION, $47 MILLION

AND $44 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

OR NOTICES OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM THE EPA AND STATE

ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IS A PRP UNDER

CERCLA OR SIMILAR STATE STATUTES. CERCLA IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS

THE SUPERFUND AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN

INVESTIGATIVE AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE IT CONDUCTS

OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR WHERE COMPANY GENERATED WASTE

HAS BEEN DISPOSED. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO, ON OCCASION, BEEN

ENGAGED IN COST RECOVERY LITIGATION INITIATED BY THOSE AGENCIES

OR BY PRIVATE PARTIES. THESE REQUESTS, NOTICES AND LAWSUITS

ASSERT POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT VARIOUS

SITES THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT COMPANY OWNED, BUT ALLEGEDLY

CONTAIN WASTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS PAST

OPERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF

POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA OR STATE LAWS AT 394 SITES

AROUND THE U.S., WITH ACTIVE REMEDIATION UNDER WAY AT 151 OF

THESE SITES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED ITS LIABILITY

AT 160 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER

PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS WITH

OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANYS, REPRESENTED

ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE

COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT FIVE NEW SITES

DURING 2008 COMPARED WITH SIX SIMILAR NOTICES IN 2007 AND 2006.

THE COMPANYS EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH CERCLA AND

SIMILAR STATE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY

$17 MILLION, $20 MILLION AND $19 MILLION IN 2008,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR NEARLY ALL SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL

LIABILITY WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TOTAL SITE

REMEDIATION COSTS BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF WASTE ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE COMPANY VERSUS THAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALL OTHER PRPS IS

RELATIVELY LOW. OTHER PRPS AT SITES, WHERE THE COMPANY IS A

PARTY, TYPICALLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO MEET THEIR

OBLIGATIONS AND, WHERE THEY DO NOT, OR WHERE PRPS CANNOT BE

LOCATED, THE COMPANYS OWN SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS NOT

MATERIALLY INCREASED. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW SITES WHERE THE

COMPANY IS A MAJOR PARTICIPANT AND THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF

REMEDIATION AT THOSE SITES AND AT ALL CERCLA SITES IN THE

AGGREGATE, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANY.

REMEDIATION

ACCRUALS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

INCLUDED AN ACCRUED LIABILITY OF $379 MILLION COMPARED TO

$357 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. CONSIDERABLE

UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL

LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. OF THE $379 MILLION ACCRUED

LIABILITY, APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT WAS RESERVED FOR

NON-U.S. FACILITIES.

APPROXIMATELY 69 PERCENT OF THE RESERVE BALANCE WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION LIABILITIES, WHILE

ABOUT 23 PERCENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERCLA LIABILITIES.

REMEDIATION ACCRUALS OF $103 MILLION, $76 MILLION AND

$71 MILLION WERE ADDED TO THE RESERVE IN 2008, 2007 AND

2006, RESPECTIVELY.

FACILITY

SECURITY

DUPONT RECOGNIZES THAT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF ITS OPERATIONS

ARE CRITICAL TO ITS EMPLOYEES, NEIGHBORS AND, INDEED, TO THE

FUTURE OF THE COMPANY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY HAS MERGED CHEMICAL

SITE SECURITY INTO ITS SAFETY CORE VALUE WHERE IT SERVES AS AN

INTEGRAL PART OF ITS LONG STANDING SAFETY CULTURE. PHYSICAL

SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN COMBINED WITH PROCESS SAFETY

MEASURES (INCLUDING THE USE OF INHERENTLY SAFER TECHNOLOGY),

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PREPAREDNESS

INTO AN INTEGRATED SECURITY PLAN. THE COMPANY HAS CONDUCTED

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AT OPERATING FACILITIES IN THE

U.S. AND HIGH PRIORITY SITES WORLDWIDE AND IDENTIFIED AND

IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES

FROM PHYSICAL OR CYBER ATTACKS. DUPONT IS PARTNERING WITH

CARRIERS, INCLUDING RAILROAD, SHIPPING AND TRUCKING COMPANIES,

TO SECURE CHEMICALS IN TRANSIT.

IN APRIL 2007, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) ISSUED

AN INTERIM FINAL RULE (RULE) THAT ESTABLISHES RISK-BASED

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THE SECURITY OF U.S. CHEMICAL

FACILITIES. COVERED CHEMICAL FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE

SECURITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS THAT IDENTIFY FACILITY

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SITE

SECURITY PLANS THAT INCLUDE MEASURES SATISFYING THE IDENTIFIED

RISK-BASED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THE RULE CONTAINS ASSOCIATED

PROVISIONS ADDRESSING INSPECTIONS AND AUDITS, RECORDKEEPING, AND

THE PROTECTION OF INFORMATION THAT CONSTITUTES

CHEMICAL-TERRORISM VULNERABILITY INFORMATION. DHS CAN SEEK

COMPLIANCE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ORDERS, INCLUDING ORDERS

ASSESSING CIVIL PENALTY AND ORDERS FOR THE CESSATION OF

OPERATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER OF 2007, DHS FINALIZED THE LIST OF CHEMICALS

REGULATED BY THE RULE AND REQUIRED FACILITIES THAT HAVE THOSE

CHEMICALS IN SPECIFIED QUANTITIES TO REGISTER WITH DHS.

DUPONTS U.S. FACILITIES HAVE SUBMITTED THIS

INFORMATION AND IN JUNE OF 2008 DHS NOTIFIED THOSE FACILITIES

THAT WERE DETERMINED TO BE COVERED BY THE RULES SECURITY

REQUIREMENTS. DUPONT FACILITIES THAT WERE NOTIFIED BY DHS

CONDUCTED AND SUBMITTED SECURITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS TO

DHS. ONCE DHS HAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED THOSE ASSESSMENTS, IT

WILL WORK WITH THE COMPANY TO ESTABLISH SECURITY EXPECTATIONS

SPECIFIC TO EACH FACILITY. DUPONT HAS ALREADY DEVOTED

SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT AND RESOURCES IN ASSESSING SECURITY

VULNERABILITIES AND TAKING STEPS TO REINFORCE SECURITY AT ITS

CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. UNTIL EACH FACILITY DEVELOPS

AND RECEIVES DHS APPROVAL FOR ITS SITE SECURITY PLAN, SPECIFIC

REQUIREMENTS CAN NOT BE DETERMINED AND CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY

EXISTS REGARDING ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

HOWEVER, BASED ON GUIDANCE ISSUED BY DHS REGARDING ITS

RISK-BASED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT NEW

SECURITY MEASURES WILL NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE REGULATED

FACILITIES AND THAT CAPITAL COSTS TO IMPLEMENT SUCH MEASURES

OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WILL BE ABOUT $50 MILLION.

FIREFIGHTING FOAMS AND COATINGS.

A FORM OF PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS

SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT) IS USED AS A PROCESSING

AGENT TO MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS. FOR

OVER 50 YEARS, DUPONT PURCHASED ITS PFOA NEEDS FROM A THIRD

PARTY, BUT BEGINNING IN THE FALL OF 2002, IT BEGAN PRODUCING

PFOA TO SUPPORT THE MANUFACTURE OF FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND

DISPERSIONS. PFOA IS NOT USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF

FLUOROTELOMERS; HOWEVER, IT IS AN UNINTENDED BY-PRODUCT PRESENT

AT TRACE LEVELS IN SOME FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS.

DUPONT PERFORMANCE ELASTOMERS, LLC (DPE) USES PFOA IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF RAW MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURE

KALREZ

®

PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS. PFOA IS ALSO USED IN THE MANUFACTURE

OF SOME FLUOROELASTOMERS MARKETED BY DPE UNDER THE

VITON

®

TRADEMARK. THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY IS A PART OF THE

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT.

PFOA IS BIO-PERSISTENT AND HAS BEEN DETECTED AT VERY LOW LEVELS

IN THE BLOOD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. AS A RESULT, THE EPA

INITIATED A PROCESS TO ENHANCE ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOURCES

OF PFOA IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH HUMAN

EXPOSURE TO PFOA IS OCCURRING. IN 2005, THE EPA ISSUED A DRAFT

RISK ASSESSMENT ON PFOA STATING THAT CANCER DATA FOR PFOA MAY BE

BEST DESCRIBED AS SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE OF CARCINOGENICITY,

BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO ASSESS HUMAN CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL

UNDER THE EPAS GUIDELINES FOR CARCINOGEN RISK ASSESSMENT.

AT THE EPAS REQUEST, THE SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD (SAB)

REVIEWED AND COMMENTED ON THE SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS OF THIS

ASSESSMENT. IN ITS MAY 2006 REPORT, THE SAB SET FORTH THE VIEW,

BASED ON LABORATORY STUDIES IN RATS, THAT THE HUMAN CARCINOGENIC

POTENTIAL OF PFOA IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDELINES

DESCRIPTOR OF LIKELY TO BE CARCINOGENIC. HOWEVER,

THE REPORT STATED THAT ADDITIONAL DATA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

BEFORE THE EPA FINALIZES ITS RISK ASSESSMENT OF PFOA. THE EPA

HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER ADDITIONAL DATA,

INCLUDING NEW RESEARCH AND TESTING, AND HAS INDICATED THAT

ANOTHER SAB REVIEW WILL BE SOUGHT AFTER THE EPA MAKES ITS RISK

ASSESSMENT. DUPONT DISPUTES THE CANCER CLASSIFICATION

RECOMMENDED IN THE SAB REPORT. ALTHOUGH THE EPA HAS STATED THAT

THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY REGARDING

POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA, IT ALSO STATED THAT IT

DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY REASON FOR CONSUMERS TO STOP

USING ANY PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT PFOA.

DUPONT RESPECTS THE EPAS POSITION RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT

EXPOSURE ROUTES AND THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF PFOA AND DUPONT

AND OTHER COMPANIES HAVE OUTLINED PLANS TO CONTINUE RESEARCH,

EMISSION REDUCTION AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES TO HELP

ADDRESS THE EPAS QUESTIONS. IN JANUARY 2006, DUPONT

PLEDGED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE EPAS

2010/15

PFOA

STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. THE EPA PROGRAM ASKS PARTICIPANTS

(1) TO COMMIT TO ACHIEVE, NO LATER THAN 2010, A

95 PERCENT REDUCTION IN BOTH FACILITY EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT

CONTENT LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER

HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS AND (2) TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE

ELIMINATION OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER

HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY NO LATER THAN

2015. IN OCTOBER 2008, (FOR THE YEAR 2007), DUPONT REPORTED TO

THE EPA THAT IT HAD ACHIEVED A 98 PERCENT REDUCTION OF PFOA

EMISSIONS IN U.S. MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE COMPANY

ACHIEVED ABOUT A 97 PERCENT REDUCTION IN GLOBAL

MANUFACTURING EMISSIONS, EXCEEDING THE EPAS 2010

OBJECTIVE. DUPONT WILL WORK INDIVIDUALLY AND WITH OTHERS IN THE

INDUSTRY TO INFORM EPAS REGULATORY COUNTERPARTS IN THE

EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, CHINA AND JAPAN ABOUT THESE ACTIVITIES

AND PFOA IN GENERAL, INCLUDING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM

DUPONTS FACILITIES, REFORMULATION OF THE COMPANYS

FLUOROPOLYMER DISPERSIONS AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES FOR

FLUOROTELOMERS PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS PLANNED COMMITMENT TO NO

LONGER MAKE, USE OR BUY PFOA BY 2015 OR SOONER IF POSSIBLE.

DUPONT HAS DEVELOPED PFOA REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGY AND

SUCCESSFULLY USED THIS TECHNOLOGY IN ITS GLOBAL MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES TO PRODUCE TEST MATERIALS FOR ALL MAJOR FLUOROPOLYMER

PRODUCT LINES. DUPONT HAS BEGUN TO SUPPLY FLUOROPOLYMER PRODUCTS

MADE WITHOUT PFOA TO CUSTOMERS FOR TESTING IN THEIR PROCESSES,

AND IS WORKING TO OBTAIN THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY APPROVALS

FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY.

IN THE MEANTIME, DUPONT INTRODUCED

ECHELON

TM

TECHNOLOGY WHICH REDUCES PFOA CONTENT BY 99 PERCENT IN

AQUEOUS FLUOROPOLYMER DISPERSION PRODUCTS. DUPONT HAS NOW

CONVERTED CUSTOMERS REPRESENTING OVER 95 PERCENT OF THE

SALES VOLUME FOR THESE PRODUCTS TO THE NEWLY FORMULATED

ECHELON

TECHNOLOGY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2008, DUPONT INTRODUCED ITS

NEXT GENERATION FLUOROTELOMER PRODUCTS. THE PRODUCTS ARE

MARKETED AS

PRODUCTS FOR USE IN HOME FURNISHINGS, FIRE FIGHTING FOAM,

FLUOROSURFACTANTS, AND LEATHER GOODS. ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS WILL

BE INTRODUCED FOR PAPER PACKAGING, TEXTILES, AND OTHER END USE

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

IN NOVEMBER 2006, DUPONT ENTERED INTO AN ORDER ON CONSENT UNDER

THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA) WITH THE EPA ESTABLISHING A

PRECAUTIONARY INTERIM SCREENING LEVEL FOR PFOA OF 0.5 PART PER

BILLION (PPB) IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE AREA AROUND THE

WASHINGTON WORKS SITE LOCATED IN PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA. IN

JANUARY 2009 THE EPA ISSUED A PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY FOR

PFOA OF 0.4 PPB IN DRINKING WATER.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION (NJDEP) IDENTIFIED A PRELIMINARY DRINKING-WATER

GUIDANCE LEVEL FOR PFOA OF 0.04 PPB AS PART OF THE FIRST PHASE

OF AN ONGOING PROCESS TO ESTABLISH A STATE DRINKING-WATER

STANDARD. WHILE THE NJDEP WILL CONTINUE SAMPLING AND EVALUATION

OF DATA FROM ALL SOURCES, IT HAS NOT RECOMMENDED A CHANGE IN

CONSUMPTION PATTERNS.

OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO PFOA HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SMALL

INCREASES IN SOME LIPIDS (E.G. CHOLESTEROL). THESE ASSOCIATIONS

WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN A RECENT COMMUNITY STUDY. IT IS NOT KNOWN

WHETHER THESE ARE CAUSAL ASSOCIATIONS. BASED ON HEALTH AND

TOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES, DUPONT BELIEVES THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE

INDICATES THAT PFOA EXPOSURE DOES NOT POSE A HEALTH RISK TO THE

GENERAL PUBLIC. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS KNOWN

TO BE CAUSED BY PFOA, ALTHOUGH STUDY OF THE CHEMICAL CONTINUES.

THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY REGULATORY OR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS THAT

WOULD PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION OR USE OF PFOA. HOWEVER, THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EPA, ANY OTHER REGULATORY ENTITY OR

GOVERNMENT BODY WILL NOT CHOOSE TO REGULATE OR PROHIBIT THE

PRODUCTION OR USE OF PFOA IN THE FUTURE. PRODUCTS CURRENTLY

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY

$1 BILLION OF 2008 REVENUES COULD BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH

REGULATION OR PROHIBITION. DUPONT HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES IN

CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN PFOA ENVIRONMENTAL AND LITIGATION

MATTERS (SEE NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS).

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVES

AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER

ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

UTILIZED INCLUDE FORWARDS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS. THE

COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES.

THE COMPANY HEDGES CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

REVENUES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND CERTAIN ENERGY

AND AGRICULTURAL FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES.

CONCENTRATION

OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF

CASH, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DERIVATIVES.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT

CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF

THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS

ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE

SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY

DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR

AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANYS SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A

SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE

REPRESENTED MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS

RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC,

INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING

AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT

CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY

INDUSTRY AND REGION.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW

VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT

CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND CASH

FLOWS.

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET

ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS

OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING

PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING

FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE

MINIMIZED. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO

CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR

VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE

OBJECTIVE OF THE HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACTS OF THIS PROGRAM ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, AND INCLUDES THE

COMPANYS PRO RATA SHARE OF ITS EQUITY AFFILIATES

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES AND CORRESPONDING GAINS AND LOSSES ON

ABOUT MARKET RISK

CONTINUED

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE USD AMOUNT OF

FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY.

DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT

ARE MADE ON A

CASE-BY-CASE

BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE

EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO

MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS.

INTEREST RATE

RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE

MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED OR FLOATING

RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT

INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR. INTEREST RATE SWAPS

ALLOW THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE

DEBT.

COMMODITY

PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES.

A PORTION OF CERTAIN ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES ARE HEDGED TO

REDUCE PRICE VOLATILITY USING FIXED PRICE SWAPS AND OPTIONS.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS TO PRODUCE

FINISHED SEED INVENTORY. UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, GROWERS ARE

COMPENSATED WITH BUSHEL EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE MARKETED TO THE

COMPANY FOR THE MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN DURING THE CONTRACT

PERIOD. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HAVING A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE

UNDERLYING COMMODITY ARE USED TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK

INVOLVED IN COMPENSATING GROWERS.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THE PRICE VOLATILITY

OF SOYBEAN MEAL. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HAVE A HIGH

CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY EXPOSURE AND ARE DEEMED

EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING SOYBEAN MEAL FEEDSTOCK PRICE RISK.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THESE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

SET FORTH IN NOTE 23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

ANALYSIS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING

EFFECT ON FAIR VALUES OF A HYPOTHETICAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE

MARKET PRICES OR RATES THAT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007. THE SENSITIVITY FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS BASED ON A

ONE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE MARKET INTEREST RATE. FOREIGN

THE CHANGES IN 2008 SENSITIVITY, AS COMPARED TO 2007, ARE THE

RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN PRICE VOLATILITY AND AN INCREASE IN

SIZE OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PORTFOLIOS.

SINCE THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY

EFFECTIVE, THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE FOR EACH RISK MANAGEMENT

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN

ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

DEFINED IN

RULES 13A-15(F)

AND

15D-15(F)

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND

THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME,

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT DE

NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR

OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)

(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION,

THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORTS ON RESPONSIBILITY

FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING APPEARING ON

PAGE F-2.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AND ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED

ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTED

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES IN 2007.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(DOLLARS

IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

1.

SUMMARY OF

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT

FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES

AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

BASIS OF

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS

MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE) FOR WHICH DUPONT

IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

IN WHICH THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN

100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS INTERESTS ARE

SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A

CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS. THIS

INCLUDES MAJORITY-OWNED ENTITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE A MINORITY INVESTOR HOLDS SUBSTANTIVE

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE

COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY

THE COST METHOD OR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. GAINS OR

LOSSES ARISING FROM ISSUANCES BY AN AFFILIATE OR A SUBSIDIARY OF

ITS OWN STOCK ARE RECORDED AS NON-OPERATING ITEMS.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS

COMPLETE. THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE FROM THE SALE OF A

WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND

THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS RECOGNIZED UPON

DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED,

COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND PRICING IS FIXED OR

DETERMINABLE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD FOB (FREE

ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO

NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS,

AN EQUIVALENT BASIS. ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND

OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE. THE

COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN

SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS

SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING

FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY

FOR THE DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD

AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME

STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED

FROM NET SALES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH

CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT AND

RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE

PERIODS. THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE

AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE

PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE,

OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.

LICENSING AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED,

THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS

REASONABLY ASSURED.

CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST

PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF

THE SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN

SECURITIES

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND

FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN

THREE MONTHS AND UP TO TWELVE MONTHS AT TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY

ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED

COST.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

E. I. DU PONT DE

NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS

IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

OTHER ASSETS INCLUDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, WHICH

COMPRISE INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY

AVAILABLE (COST INVESTMENTS) AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

THAT ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE (SEE NOTE 13).

INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT

COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE

LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD; IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH VALUATIONS ARE

NOT IN EXCESS OF MARKET. SEED INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE

LOWER OF COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD, OR MARKET.

ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT

LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED

AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) IS CARRIED AT COST AND

IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PP&E PLACED

IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED UNDER THE

SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY

SIMILAR METHODS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE

DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 15 TO 25 YEARS.

CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR

INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 5 TO

7 YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR

OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND

INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS

AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED

MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANYS

FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF

AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AN

ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR

ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE

TECHNIQUES. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD

AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED AND LICENSED

TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 5 TO

20 YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE

REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE

ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO

BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING

VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE

TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSET ARE

SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN

THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANYS FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET

PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS

MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD FOR USE UNTIL THEIR DISPOSAL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE

DISPOSED BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE

REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR MARKET VALUE

LESS COST TO SELL AND DEPRECIATION IS DISCONTINUED.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS

IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING

EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES

AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE

UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR

PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE,

THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE

AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS

RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED

RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS

RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE

CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED

ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE

OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO

20 YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION

MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS

OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE

PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR

REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS COMPENSATION, VEHICLE

LIABILITY AND EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL

CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF

INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS

OF RELEVANT RISKS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND

LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS

APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES

EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME

TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT

YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED

TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX

BASES OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE

ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE

ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT

WILL NOT BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES

ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT

FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY

INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED

RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN

MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET, UNDER OTHER INCOME, NET.

INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAXES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES FROM FUTURE

COMPLETED TAX EXAMINATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED TO

THE COMPANYS GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, HOWEVER,

DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF

THESE AUDITS AND THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF

THE RANGE OF INCREASE OR DECREASE THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT

TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR (USD) IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF MOST OF

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET

AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD

EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN

CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE

RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO

BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES.

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES

ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES AND THE

RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR

RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE

REMEASURED INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD

AND THE RESULTANT EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN

INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES

ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT

DURING THE PERIOD.

VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES (VIES)

THE COMPANY CONSOLIDATES VIES WHERE DUPONT IS CONSIDERED THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE NOT MATERIAL TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE VIES

FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

FUTURE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THESE VIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE

COMPANY BECOMES THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE OTHER VIES ARE NOT

MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME (LOSS) OF

THESE VIES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET, IN THE CONSOLIDATED

INCOME STATEMENTS AND IS NOT MATERIAL.

HEDGING AND

TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET ON THE

INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW

HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS

CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE HEDGED

ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM

COMMITMENT OR AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO

THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES

REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION

MATURES, OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE

MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH

TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE

THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AND THE DERIVATIVE IS

RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS

A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR

TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER

LIKELY TO OCCUR.

CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EITHER

FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME

CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. CASH

FLOWS FROM ALL OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY

REPORTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 23 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

REGARDING THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEARS DATA HAVE BEEN

MADE TO CONFORM TO 2008 CLASSIFICATIONS.

ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 141 (REVISED 2007) BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS (SFAS 141R) WHICH REPLACES

SFAS NO. 141. SFAS 141R ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION

AND MEASUREMENT OF IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES

ASSUMED, AND NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

SFAS 141R ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE THAT ENABLES USERS OF

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO BETTER EVALUATE THE NATURE AND

FINANCIAL EFFECT OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. SFAS 141R

APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE

ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST

ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2008. SFAS 141R WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AT THE

TIME OF ADOPTION SFAS 141R WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR

F-11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS

IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAN CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. THUS,

ACCOUNTING FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AFTER

ADOPTION MAY PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESULT AND

FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT THAN UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH

BULLETIN NO. 51 (SFAS 160) WHICH

CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS AND

FOR THE DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT

A THIRD-PARTY, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN A CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY IS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY

THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. SFAS 160 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE THAT CLEARLY

IDENTIFIES AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF THE PARENT

AND THE INTERESTS OF THE NON-CONTROLLING OWNERS. SFAS 160

IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2008. SFAS 160 WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AT THE

TIME OF ADOPTION SFAS 160 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133

(SFAS 161). EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS

BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008, THE NEW STANDARD

REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BETTER CONVEY THE PURPOSE OF

DERIVATIVE USE AND THE RISKS MANAGED. SFAS 161 WILL NOT

AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. THE NEW STANDARD SOLELY AFFECTS THE DISCLOSURE OF

INFORMATION.

IN DECEMBER 2008, FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP)

FAS 132(R)-1, EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2009. THE NEW

STANDARD EXPANDS DISCLOSURES FOR ASSETS HELD BY EMPLOYER PENSION

RECOGNIZED WITH REGARD TO THE REMITTANCE OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS

NOT PRACTICAL TO ESTIMATE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE

INCURRED IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE REMITTED TO THE U.S.

EACH YEAR THE COMPANY FILES HUNDREDS OF TAX RETURNS IN THE

VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXING JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH IT OPERATES. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION

AND POSSIBLE CHALLENGE BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES. POSITIONS

CHALLENGED BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED OR APPEALED

BY THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR

INCOME TAXES (SFAS 109) AND FASB INTERPRETATION

NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES (FIN 48). EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 48 WHICH CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF

SFAS 109 BY DEFINING CRITERIA THAT AN INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX

POSITION MUST MEET FOR ANY PART OF THE BENEFIT OF THAT POSITION

TO BE RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON MEASUREMENT, DERECOGNITION,

CLASSIFICATION, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST IN PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING

IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE AND TRANSITION.

THE COMPANY

WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO

TAX EXAMINATIONS BY TAX AUTHORITIES FOR YEARS BEFORE 1999. IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL

RESPECTIVELY. ESTIMATES FOR WARRANTY COSTS ARE BASED ON

HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, THE COMPANY

HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES

THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS AND

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO

ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY

INDEFINITE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY

ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST

EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW, AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED

AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE

JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED

PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS

A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE

INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE

INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE

PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNT RECORDED

FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $110 AND $101, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH

IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED

AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS

NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM

POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS

COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2004 SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE NET

ASSETS OF TEXTILES AND INTERIORS, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED THE

PURCHASERS, SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH INDUSTRIES, INC. (INVISTA),

AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES, LEGAL

AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PURCHASE AND

SALE AGREEMENT WAS $70 AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE INDEMNIFICATIONS

BALANCE OF $110 AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. UNDER THE PURCHASE

AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION

OBLIGATION FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES CANNOT EXCEED $1,400. THE OTHER INDEMNITIES ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT. IN MARCH 2008, INVISTA FILED SUIT IN THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE

AGREEMENT WERE BREACHED AND, THEREFORE, THAT DUPONT IS OBLIGATED

TO INDEMNIFY IT. DUPONT DISAGREES WITH THE EXTENT AND VALUE OF

INVISTAS CLAIMS. DUPONT HAS NOT CHANGED ITS ESTIMATE OF

ITS TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE

AGREEMENT AS A RESULT OF THE LAWSUIT.

OBLIGATIONS FOR

EQUITY AFFILIATES & OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS

UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY

AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER AFFILIATED AND

UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY

HAD DIRECTLY GUARANTEED $605 OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND $121

RELATING TO GUARANTEES OF HISTORICAL OBLIGATIONS FOR DIVESTED

SUBSIDIARIES. THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF

FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE

COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE

EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY.

THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK BY ASSIGNING

DEFAULT RATES BASED ON THE DURATION OF THE GUARANTEES. THESE

DEFAULT RATES ARE ASSIGNED BASED ON THE EXTERNAL CREDIT RATING

OF THE COUNTERPARTY OR THROUGH INTERNAL CREDIT ANALYSIS AND

HISTORICAL DEFAULT HISTORY FOR COUNTERPARTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE

PUBLISHED CREDIT RATINGS. FOR COUNTERPARTIES WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL

RATING OR AVAILABLE CREDIT HISTORY, THE NON-INVESTMENT GRADE

DEFAULT RATE IS USED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, A

LIABILITY OF $121 AND $135, RESPECTIVELY, WAS RECORDED FOR THESE

OBLIGATIONS, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT/PERFORMANCE RISK

FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DEEMS PROBABLE. THIS LIABILITY IS

PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANYS

POLYESTER FILMS JOINT VENTURE, WHICH ARE GUARANTEED BY THE

PFOA

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACTIONS INVOLVING THE WASHINGTON WORKS SITE AND SURROUNDING

AREA

IN NOVEMBER 2006, DUPONT ENTERED INTO AN ORDER ON CONSENT UNDER

THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA) WITH THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ESTABLISHING A

PRECAUTIONARY INTERIM SCREENING LEVEL FOR PFOA (COLLECTIVELY,

PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM

SALT) OF 0.5 PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES

IN THE AREA AROUND THE DUPONT WASHINGTON WORKS SITE LOCATED IN

PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA. AS PART OF THE ORDER ON CONSENT,

DUPONT CONDUCTED SURVEYS, SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL TESTING OF

CERTAIN AREA PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS, AND INSTALLED AND

IS OPERATING WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS IN THE AREA.

IN LATE 2005 DUPONT AND THE EPA ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF

UNDERSTANDING (EPA MOU) THAT REQUIRED DUPONT TO MONITOR PFOA IN

THE SOIL, AIR, WATER AND BIOTA AROUND THE WASHINGTON WORKS SITE.

THE DATA GENERATED IN THE MONITORING PROCESS IS SUBJECT TO A

THIRD PARTY PEER REVIEW. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, DUPONT HAS

ACCRUALS OF ABOUT $0.5 TO FUND ITS ACTIVITIES UNDER THE EPA MOU

AND ORDER ON CONSENT.

EPA

ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINTS

IN JULY AND DECEMBER 2004, THE EPA FILED ADMINISTRATIVE

COMPLAINTS AGAINST DUPONT ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO

COMPLY WITH THE TECHNICAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE TOXIC

SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) AND THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) REGARDING PFOA. UNDER A 2005 AGREEMENT

SETTLING THE MATTER, THE COMPANY PAID CIVIL FINES OF $10.25 AND

WILL COMPLETE TWO SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS AT A TOTAL

COST OF $6.25.

ACTIONS.

DRINKING WATER

IN AUGUST 2001, A CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED LEACH V. DUPONT, WAS

FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AGAINST DUPONT AND THE LUBECK

PUBLIC SERVICE DISTRICT. DUPONT USES PFOA AS A PROCESSING AID TO

MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AT VARIOUS

SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN

WEST VIRGINIA. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR

THE WASHINGTON WORKS FACILITY HAD SUFFERED, OR MAY SUFFER,

DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING

WATER. THE RELIEF SOUGHT INCLUDED DAMAGES FOR MEDICAL

MONITORING, DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUES AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES

PLUS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP RELEASES OF PFOA. DUPONT AND

ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN 2004

AND AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS OF $108 IN

2004. THE AGREEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE WOOD COUNTY CIRCUIT

COURT ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005 AFTER A FAIRNESS HEARING. THE

SETTLEMENT BINDS A CLASS OF APPROXIMATELY 80,000 RESIDENTS. AS

DEFINED BY THE COURT, THE CLASS INCLUDES THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

HAVE CONSUMED, FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR, WATER CONTAINING 0.05 PPB

OR GREATER OF PFOA FROM ANY OF SIX DESIGNATED PUBLIC WATER

SOURCES OR FROM SOLE SOURCE PRIVATE WELLS.

IN JULY 2005, THE COMPANY PAID THE PLAINTIFFS

ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES OF $23 AND MADE A PAYMENT OF

$70, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL HAS DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY

HEALTH PROJECT. THE COMPANY IS ALSO FUNDING A SERIES OF HEALTH

STUDIES BY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS IN THE

COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC

EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY PROBABLE LINK EXISTS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO

PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE INDEPENDENT

SCIENCE PANEL TO COMPLETE THESE HEALTH STUDIES BETWEEN 2009 AND

YEAR-END 2011

AT A TOTAL ESTIMATED COST OF $26, OF WHICH $5 WAS ORIGINALLY

PLACED IN AN INTEREST-BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNT. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY IS PROVIDING STATE-OF-THE ART WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS

DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PFOA IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER

DISTRICTS, INCLUDING THE LITTLE HOCKING WATER ASSOCIATION

(LHWA), UNTIL THE SCIENCE PANEL DETERMINES THAT PFOA DOES NOT

CAUSE DISEASE OR UNTIL APPLICABLE WATER STANDARDS CAN BE MET

WITHOUT SUCH TREATMENT. ALL OF THE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS ARE

OPERATING. THE ESTIMATED COST OF CONSTRUCTING, OPERATING AND

MAINTAINING THESE SYSTEMS IS ABOUT $22 OF WHICH $10 WAS

ORIGINALLY PLACED IN AN INTEREST-BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNT. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE ACCRUAL BALANCE RELATING TO THE

FUNDING OF THE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL HEALTH STUDY AND THE

WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS WAS $16, INCLUDING $9 IN INTEREST

BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

THE SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN THE DISMISSAL OF ALL CLAIMS ASSERTED

IN THE LAWSUIT EXCEPT FOR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF THE

INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL CONCLUDES THAT NO PROBABLE LINK EXISTS

BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY DISEASES, THEN THE SETTLEMENT

WOULD ALSO RESOLVE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF IT CONCLUDES THAT

A PROBABLE LINK DOES EXIST BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY

DISEASES, THEN DUPONT WOULD ALSO FUND UP TO $235 FOR A MEDICAL

MONITORING PROGRAM TO PAY FOR SUCH MEDICAL TESTING. IN THIS

EVENT, PLAINTIFFS WOULD RETAIN THEIR RIGHT TO PURSUE PERSONAL

INJURY CLAIMS. ALL OTHER CLAIMS IN THE LAWSUIT WOULD REMAIN

DISMISSED BY THE SETTLEMENT. DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REMOTE

THAT THE PANEL WILL FIND A PROBABLE LINK. THEREFORE, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NOT ESTABLISHED ANY

ACCRUALS RELATED TO MEDICAL MONITORING OR PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHAT THE

INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL WILL CONCLUDE.

IN JUNE 2007, THE LHWA NOTIFIED DUPONT THAT IT INTENDS TO FILE

SUIT UNDER RCRA ALLEGING IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL

ENDANGERMENT TO HEALTH AND OR THE ENVIRONMENT BASED ON

DETECTION OF PFOA IN ITS WELLS. DUPONT DENIES ANY SUCH

ENDANGERMENT EXISTS AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITSELF IF A

LAWSUIT IS FILED.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, LHWA REFILED THE SUIT IT ORIGINALLY FILED IN

OHIO STATE COURT AND VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED IN 2006. THE SUIT

CLAIMS THAT PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING PFOA, ALLEGEDLY

RELEASED FROM THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT CONTAMINATED

LHWAS WELL FIELDS AND UNDERLYING AQUIFER. LHWAS

COMPLAINT SEEKS A VARIETY OF RELIEF INCLUDING COMPENSATORY AND

PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND AN INJUNCTION REQUIRING DUPONT TO PROVIDE

A NEW PRISTINE WELL FIELD AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

DELIVER IT.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2006, THREE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE

FILED ALLEGING THAT DRINKING WATER HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED BY PFOA

IN EXCESS OF 0.05 PPB DUE TO ALLEGED RELEASES FROM CERTAIN

DUPONT PLANTS. ONE OF THESE CASES WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA

STATE COURT ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS OF THE PARKERSBURG CITY WATER

DISTRICT, BUT WAS REMOVED ON DUPONTS MOTION TO THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST

VIRGINIA. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT RULED

THAT THE CASE COULD NOT PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION.

PLAINTIFFS APPEAL OF THE RULING WAS DENIED. THE THREE

PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A CASE BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS.

THE OTHER TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED IN NEW JERSEY.

ONE WAS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

ALLEGEDLY DRANK WATER CONTAMINATED BY RELEASES FROM

DUPONTS CHAMBERS WORKS PLANT IN DEEPWATER, NEW JERSEY. THE

SECOND WAS FILED IN STATE COURT ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS SERVICED

PRIMARILY BY THE PENNSVILLE TOWNSHIP WATER DEPARTMENT AND WAS

REMOVED TO NEW JERSEY FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ON DUPONTS

MOTION. THE NEW JERSEY CASES HAVE BEEN COMBINED FOR PURPOSES OF

DISCOVERY AND THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN AMENDED TO ALLEGE THAT

DRINKING WATER HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED BY PFOA IN EXCESS OF 0.04

PPB. IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COURT DENIED CLASS ACTION STATUS IN

BOTH CASES, BUT ORDERED ADDITIONAL BRIEFING ON CERTAIN ISSUES.

THE PLAINTIFF IN ONE OF THE CASES IS SEEKING LEAVE FROM THE

THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS TO APPEAL THE DENIAL. THE COMPANY

IS DEFENDING ITSELF VIGOROUSLY AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGING

CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER SOURCES.

WHILE DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IT

COULD INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO PFOA MATTERS IN ADDITION TO THOSE

MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR WHICH IT HAS ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS, A

RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES, IF ANY, CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT

THIS TIME.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF IOWA RULED THAT THE CASES COULD NOT PROCEED AS A

CLASS ACTION, BUT MUST BE TRIED SEPARATELY. PLAINTIFFS ARE

SEEKING LEAVE TO APPEAL THE RULING.

THE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT DUPONT VIOLATED STATE LAWS BY ENGAGING

IN DECEPTIVE AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY FAILING TO

DISCLOSE TO CONSUMERS THAT PRODUCTS CONTAINING

TEFLON

SEEK UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES FOR CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED

AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF FUNDS FOR MEDICAL MONITORING AND

INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE TWENTY-TWO CLASS ACTIONS AND THE

MOTION FILED IN QUEBEC ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND, THEREFORE,

BELIEVES IT IS REMOTE THAT IT WILL INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO THESE

ACTIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD NOT

ELASTOMERS

ANTITRUST MATTERS

SINCE 2002, THE U.S., EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND CANADIAN ANTITRUST

AUTHORITIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE SYNTHETIC RUBBER MARKETS FOR

POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDED DUPONT DOW

ELASTOMERS, LLC (DDE), AS A RESULT OF ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE

POLYCHLOROPRENE (PCP) AND ETHYLENE PROPYLENE DIENE MONOMER

(EPDM) MARKETS. DDE WAS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN THE DOW CHEMICAL

COMPANY (DOW) AND DUPONT.

IN APRIL 2004, DUPONT AND DOW ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF

AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH DUPONT OBTAINED COMPLETE CONTROL OVER

DIRECTING DDES RESPONSE TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND THE

RELATED LITIGATION AND DUPONT AGREED TO A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE

OF THE VENTURES LIABILITIES AND COSTS RELATED TO THESE

MATTERS. CONSEQUENTLY, DUPONT BEARS ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITIES

AND COSTS UP TO THE INITIAL $150. DOW IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY

DUPONT FOR UP TO $72.5 BY PAYING 15 TO 30 PERCENT TOWARD

LIABILITIES AND COSTS IN EXCESS OF $150. ON JUNE 30, 2005,

DDE BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF DUPONT AND WAS RENAMED

DUPONT PERFORMANCE ELASTOMERS, LLC (DPE).

IN JULY 2007, DPE PLED GUILTY TO CONSPIRING TO FIX PRICES AND

PAID A FINE OF CDN $4, APPROXIMATELY $3.8 USD, RESOLVING ALL

CRIMINAL ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS AGAINST IT RELATED TO PCP IN

CANADA.

IN LATE MARCH 2007, THE EU ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES ISSUED A

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS THAT MADE ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS

REGARDING THE PCP MARKET AGAINST DPE, RELATING TO THE JOINT

VENTURES ACTIVITIES, AND DUPONT, TO WHICH BOTH RESPONDED.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE EU ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES ISSUED THEIR

DECISION, INCLUDING THE IMPOSITION OF FINES AGAINST DPE, DOW AND

DUPONT TOTALING EURO 59.25. IN FEBRUARY 2008, DUPONT

APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE EUS COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE

WHICH HAS JURISDICTION TO REVIEW THE FINDINGS AND ADJUST THE

FINE. IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE FINE WOULD BE INCREASED AS A

RESULT OF THE REVIEW. IN MARCH 2008, THE COMPANY PROVISIONALLY

PAID THE FINE OF EURO 59.25 ($90.9 USD); A PORTION OF THE

PAYMENT MAY BE REFUNDED IF THE APPEAL IS SUCCESSFUL. WHILE A

DECISION ON THE FEBRUARY 2008 APPEAL HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED, THE EU

ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES REVISED THE DECEMBER 2007 DECISION BY

IMPOSING AN INCREMENTAL FINE ON DOW OF EURO 4.425 ($6.5

USD). DOW PROVISIONALLY PAID THE INCREMENTAL FINE IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2008 WHICH DUPONT REIMBURSED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS

BETWEEN THE COMPANIES.

DDE RESOLVED ALL CRIMINAL ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS AGAINST IT

RELATED TO PCP IN THE U.S. THROUGH A PLEA AGREEMENT WITH

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) IN JANUARY 2005 WHICH WAS

APPROVED BY THE COURT ON MARCH 29, 2005. THE AGREEMENT

REQUIRES THE SUBSIDIARY TO PAY A FINE OF $84 WHICH, AT ITS

ELECTION, IS BEING PAID IN SIX EQUAL, ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS. THE

ANNUAL INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS FOR 2005, 2006, 2007 AND 2008 HAVE

BEEN MADE. THE AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE SUBSIDIARY TO PROVIDE

ONGOING COOPERATION WITH THE DOJS INVESTIGATION.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUALS OF

APPROXIMATELY $28 RELATED TO THIS MATTER AND A RECEIVABLE OF

$3.9 FOR THE REMAINING AMOUNT THAT IT EXPECTS TO BE REIMBURSED

BY DOW.

DISMISSAL OF ONE OF THE NINE CASES FOR FAILURE TO PROSECUTE AND

THE APPELLATE COURT REINSTATED THE CASE. TWO OF THE NINE CASES,

INVOLVING TWENTY-SEVEN COSTA RICAN FERN GROWERS, WERE TRIED

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 RESULTING IN A $56 JUDGMENT

AGAINST THE COMPANY, WHICH WAS REDUCED TO $24 ON DUPONTS

MOTION. AT TRIAL, THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT DAMAGES IN THE RANGE OF

$270 TO $400. THE PLAINTIFFS AND DUPONT HAVE APPEALED THE

THE JUDGMENT.

IN THE REMAINING TWO CASES PENDING IN FLORIDA, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE

SPELTER, WEST

VIRGINIA

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, A WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS

ACTION AGAINST DUPONT THAT SEEKS RELIEF INCLUDING THE PROVISION

OF REMEDIATION SERVICES AND PROPERTY VALUE DIMINUTION DAMAGES

FOR 7,000 RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN THE VICINITY OF A CLOSED

ZINC SMELTER IN SPELTER, WEST VIRGINIA. THE ACTION ALSO SEEKS

MEDICAL MONITORING FOR AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN

THE CLASS AREA. THE SMELTER WAS OWNED AND OPERATED BY AT LEAST

THREE COMPANIES BETWEEN 1910 AND 2001, INCLUDING DUPONT BETWEEN

1928 AND 1950. DUPONT PERFORMED REMEDIAL MEASURES AT THE REQUEST

OF THE EPA IN THE LATE 1990S AND IN 2001 REPURCHASED THE SITE TO

FACILITATE AND COMPLETE THE REMEDIATION. THE FALL 2007 TRIAL WAS

CONDUCTED IN FOUR PHASES: LIABILITY, MEDICAL MONITORING,

PROPERTY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE JURY FOUND AGAINST DUPONT IN

ALL FOUR PHASES AWARDING $55.5 FOR PROPERTY REMEDIATION AND

$196.2 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN POST TRIAL MOTIONS, THE COURT

ADOPTED THE PLAINTIFFS FORTY-YEAR MEDICAL MONITORING PLAN

ESTIMATED BY PLAINTIFFS TO COST $130 AND GRANTED

PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS LEGAL FEES OF $127 PLUS $8 IN

EXPENSES. IN JUNE 2008, DUPONT FILED ITS PETITIONS FOR APPEAL

WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT SEEKING REVIEW OF A NUMBER

OF ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRIAL COURTS DECISIONS

BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE TRIAL. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2008,

THE COURT DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE CASE AND CONSIDER THE

PARTIES APPEAL ON THE MERITS. A DECISION ON THE APPEAL IS

NOT EXPECTED UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF 2009. EFFECTIVE WITH

DUPONT POSTING A BOND, THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT AGAINST THE

COMPANY IS STAYED PENDING FINAL DISPOSITION OF DUPONTS

APPEAL TO THE WEST VIRGINIA SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED ACCRUALS OF

$55, ALTHOUGH GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN LITIGATION,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE FINAL OUTCOME.

GENERAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARISING

OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THESE LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS INCLUDE ACTIONS BASED ON ALLEGED EXPOSURES TO PRODUCTS,

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND CONTRACT AND

ANTITRUST CLAIMS. MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY

SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES,

OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES.

SUCH CASES MAY ALLEGE CONTAMINATION FROM UNREGULATED SUBSTANCES

OR REMEDIATED SITES. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT

IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO CORRECT THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR

RELEASES OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET FORTH IN NOTE 1.

MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA,

OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE

THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL

ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED

OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS

DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A

NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS

PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT

WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING

REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND

STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A

$2 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN IN JUNE 2001. DURING 2008 AND

2007, THERE WERE NO PURCHASES OF STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 9.9 MILLION

SHARES AT A TOTAL COST OF $505. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED 20.5 MILLION SHARES AT A TOTAL

COST OF $962. MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A TIMELINE FOR THE

BUYBACK OF THE REMAINING STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN.

IN ADDITION TO THE PLAN DESCRIBED ABOVE, IN OCTOBER 2005 THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK

PLAN. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT WITH GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. (GOLDMAN SACHS)

UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 75.7 MILLION

SHARES OF DUPONTS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FROM GOLDMAN

SACHS ON OCTOBER 27, 2005 AT A PRICE OF $39.62 PER SHARE,

WITH GOLDMAN SACHS PURCHASING AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES IN

THE OPEN MARKET OVER THE FOLLOWING NINE-MONTH PERIOD.

ON JULY 27, 2006, GOLDMAN SACHS COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE OF

75.7 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONTS COMMON STOCK AT A

VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP) OF $41.99 PER SHARE. UPON

THE CONCLUSION OF THE AGREEMENT IN 2006, THE COMPANY PAID $180

IN CASH TO GOLDMAN SACHS TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT. THE FINAL

SETTLEMENT PRICE WAS BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VWAP

PER SHARE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD, WHICH ENDED JULY 27,

2006, AND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF $39.62 PER SHARE. THE AMOUNT

PAID TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO

ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL DURING THE THIRD QUARTER 2006. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF ITS SHARES

IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2006 FOR $100 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $42.27

PER SHARE.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY PAID $1.7 BILLION TO PURCHASE AND

IMMEDIATELY RETIRE 34.7 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE

OF $48.85 PER SHARE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY

HAS COMPLETED THE $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN WITH THE

PURCHASE AND RETIREMENT OF 112.8 MILLION SHARES AT AN

AVERAGE PRICE OF $44.33 PER SHARE.

COMMON STOCK HELD IN TREASURY IS RECORDED AT COST. WHEN RETIRED,

THE EXCESS OF THE COST OF TREASURY STOCK OVER ITS PAR VALUE IS

ALLOCATED BETWEEN REINVESTED EARNINGS AND ADDITIONAL PAID-IN

CAPITAL.

LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY OFFERS VARIOUS LONG-TERM BENEFITS TO ITS EMPLOYEES.

WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE

RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE THE PLANS.

DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSIONS

THE COMPANY HAS BOTH FUNDED AND UNFUNDED NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING A MAJORITY OF THE

U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE BENEFITS UNDER THESE PLANS ARE BASED

PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES PAY NEAR

RETIREMENT. THE COMPANYS FUNDING POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH

THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANYS

NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE,

THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH PLANS ARE FUNDED

BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH TRUSTEES, UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES, OR

REMAIN UNFUNDED.

OTHER LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE PARENT COMPANY AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE MEDICAL,

DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS,

AND DISABILITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PROTECTION TO EMPLOYEES. THE

ASSOCIATED PLANS FOR RETIREE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST

OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM COMPANY FUNDS. ESSENTIALLY

ALL OF THE COST AND LIABILITIES FOR THESE RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS

ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY PLANS. THE

RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS CONTRIBUTORY WITH PENSIONERS AND

SURVIVORS CONTRIBUTIONS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY TO ACHIEVE A

50/50 TARGET SHARING OF COST INCREASES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND

PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. IN ADDITION, LIMITS ARE APPLIED TO THE

COMPANYS PORTION OF THE RETIREE MEDICAL COST COVERAGE.

EMPLOYEE LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE INSURED

IN MANY COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., SUCH PLANS

ARE GENERALLY SELF-INSURED OR ARE FULLY EXPERIENCE-RATED.

OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSES FOR SELF-INSURED AND FULLY

EXPERIENCE-RATED PLANS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIGURES BELOW.

U.S. PENSION PLANS NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST WAS

INCREASED TO 6.00 PERCENT AS OF AUGUST 31, 2006 DUE TO

RE-MEASUREMENT.

IN AUGUST 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED MAJOR CHANGES TO THE

PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS THAT COVER THE

MAJORITY OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2008, SUCH FULL SERVICE EMPLOYEES ON THE ROLLS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 CONTINUE TO ACCRUE BENEFITS IN THE

PENSION PLAN, BUT AT A REDUCED RATE OF ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF ITS

PREVIOUS LEVEL. IN ADDITION, COMPANY-PAID POSTRETIREMENT

SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR THESE EMPLOYEES DO NOT CONTINUE TO GROW

AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. SUCH EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2006 DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION PLAN.

AS A RESULT OF THIS PLAN AMENDMENT, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO

RE-MEASURE ITS PENSION EXPENSE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006,

REFLECTING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE

RE-MEASUREMENT DATE. BETTER THAN

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE OF

6.00 PERCENT DECREASED PRE-TAX PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2006 BY

$72. FOR 2007, THE PLAN AMENDMENT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN

PRE-TAX PENSION EXPENSE OF ABOUT $40. FOR 2008, THE PLAN

AMENDMENT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF ABOUT $40 IN COMBINED

PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS EXPENSE.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES PUBLISHED LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE

BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE AT MEASUREMENT DATE.

WHERE COMMONLY AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS INDICES OF

VARIOUS DURATIONS TO REFLECT THE TIMING OF FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS.

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IN THE U.S. WAS

SELECTED FROM WITHIN THE REASONABLE RANGE OF RATES DETERMINED BY

(A) HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE

ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND

(B) PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD

DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FOR

ALL PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. ARE INVESTED THROUGH A

THIS TRUST FUND IS SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT, REFLECTING THE

RESULTS OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSET LIABILITY MODELING. THE GENERAL

PRINCIPLES GUIDING INVESTMENT OF U.S. PENSION ASSETS ARE

THOSE EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF

1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE

BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

PRUDENT EXPERT STANDARD AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND

REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION

PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT

ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE

BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES

OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET LIABILITY STUDIES

ARE UTILIZED

IN 2008, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $252 TO ITS PENSION PLANS. NO

CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED OR MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN TRUST FUND IN 2008 AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS

ARE REQUIRED OR EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO THIS PLAN IN 2009. THE

PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (THE ACT) WAS SIGNED

INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN AUGUST 2006. THE ACT INTRODUCED NEW

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-EMPLOYER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

PLANS, PROVIDED GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING PENSION PLAN ASSETS AND

PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR FUNDING PURPOSES, INTRODUCED BENEFIT

LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN UNDERFUNDED PLANS AND RAISED TAX

DEDUCTION LIMITS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT PLANS. THE NEW

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE FOR PLAN YEARS

BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO

CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $300 IN 2009 TO ITS PENSION PLANS OTHER

THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND ALSO EXPECTS TO

MAKE CASH PAYMENTS OF $330 IN 2009 UNDER ITS OTHER LONG-TERM

IN 2007, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $277 TO ITS PENSION

PLANS. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED OR MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH

COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT IS THE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN (THE PLAN). THIS

PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

(ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP

AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS

BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY

TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX

QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR

DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY

MAY PARTICIPATE. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED AN AMOUNT TO THE PLAN

IN 2006 AND 2007 EQUAL TO 50 PERCENT OF THE FIRST

6 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. AS

PART OF THE RETIREMENT PLAN CHANGES IN AUGUST 2006, EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2007, FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED ON THAT DATE OR

THEREAFTER AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, FOR ACTIVE

EMPLOYEES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

100 PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE

EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION

ELECTION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES 3 PERCENT OF EACH ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE

EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION. IN ADDITION, THE DEFINITION OF

ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE

DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION USED IN DETERMINING PENSION

BENEFITS.

THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. PARENT

COMPANYS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WERE $189, $57 AND $52

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007, AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS VEST

IMMEDIATELY UPON CONTRIBUTION. THE 3 PERCENT AUTOMATIC

COMPANY CONTRIBUTION ALSO VESTS IMMEDIATELY FOR EMPLOYEES WITH

AT LEAST THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE

CONTRIBUTIONS OF $45, $42 AND $34 FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, TO OTHER

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE

ABOUT $255 TO ITS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN 2009.

COMPENSATION

PLANS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

SFAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

TRANSITION METHOD. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE FAIR VALUE

RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123, AS AMENDED,

PROSPECTIVELY ON JANUARY 1, 2003, THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, THE NOMINAL VESTING

APPROACH WAS FOLLOWED FOR ALL AWARDS. UPON ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN

EXPENSING NEW STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS USING A

NON-SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH, UNDER WHICH COMPENSATION COSTS ARE

RECOGNIZED OVER AT LEAST SIX MONTHS FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE AT THE DATE OF THE GRANT

OR WOULD BECOME RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD OF

THE GRANT. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, THE COMPANY

REPORTED THE TAX BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AS OPERATING

CASH FLOWS. UPON THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, TAX BENEFITS

RESULTING FROM TAX DEDUCTIONS IN EXCESS OF COMPENSATION COST

RECOGNIZED FOR THOSE OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE

REPORTED AS FINANCING CASH FLOWS.

THE TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS WAS $112, $144 AND $140 FOR 2008,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS WERE $37, $48 AND $46 FOR

2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

ON APRIL 25, 2007, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE DUPONT

EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP). THE EIP

CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS EXISTING COMPENSATION

PLANS (THE STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN, VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN,

AND EQUITY AWARDS OF THE STOCK ACCUMULATION AND DEFERRED

COMPENSATION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS) INTO ONE PLAN PROVIDING FOR

EQUITY-BASED AND CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES,

DIRECTORS AND CONSULTANTS. CURRENTLY, EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS CONSIST OF STOCK OPTIONS, TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS (RSUS), PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (PSUS)

AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.

UNDER THE EIP, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR THE

GRANT OR SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS IS 60 MILLION SHARES,

PROVIDED THAT EACH SHARE IN EXCESS OF 20 MILLION THAT IS

ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD THAT IS NOT AN OPTION OR STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHT WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE 60 MILLION

SHARE LIMIT AS FOUR SHARES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

APPROXIMATELY 49 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE

GRANTS UNDER THE COMPANYS EIP. AWARDS OR GRANTS MADE IN

2007, PRIOR TO SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE EIP, WERE ISSUED

UNDER THE COMPANYS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING COMPENSATION PLANS.

AWARDS OUTSTANDING UNDER EACH OF THESE PLANS HAVE NOT BEEN

TERMINATED. THESE AWARDS REMAIN OUTSTANDING AND ARE ADMINISTERED

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE EXISTING PLAN. NO FURTHER

AWARDS WILL BE MADE UNDER THE COMPANYS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING

COMPENSATION PLANS.

THE COMPANYS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, RSUS AND PSUS

AND MAY AUTHORIZE NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

STOCK

OPTIONS

THE PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE

MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT.

PRIOR TO 2004, OPTIONS EXPIRED 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT;

HOWEVER, BEGINNING IN 2004, OPTIONS SERIALLY VEST OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND CARRY A SIX-YEAR OPTION TERM. THE PLAN

ALLOWS RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO RETAIN ANY GRANTED

AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT

LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING GRANT DATE.

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS

AWARDS, THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL

AND THE ASSUMPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN

2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $5.30, $9.47 AND $7.28, RESPECTIVELY.

VOLATILITY IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE

OPTION GRANTED. THE RISK FREE INTEREST RATE IS DETERMINED BY

REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON AN OUTSTANDING U.S. TREASURY NOTE

WITH A TERM EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION GRANTED.

EXPECTED LIFE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE COMPANYS

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. TOTAL

INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS EXERCISED FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006

WERE $18, $96 AND $22, RESPECTIVELY. IN 2008, THE COMPANY

REALIZED A TAX BENEFIT OF $6 FROM OPTIONS EXERCISED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, $21 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED

COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS IS EXPECTED TO BE

RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.58 YEARS.

RSUS AND

PSUS

IN 2004, THE COMPANY BEGAN ISSUING RSUS IN ADDITION TO STOCK

OPTIONS. THESE RSUS SERIALLY VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND,

UPON VESTING, CONVERT ONE-FOR-ONE TO DUPONT COMMON STOCK. A

RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE RETAINS ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON

RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX

MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE. ADDITIONAL RSUS ARE

ALSO GRANTED PERIODICALLY TO KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES.

THESE RSUS GENERALLY VEST OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM TWO TO FIVE

YEARS. THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL STOCK-SETTLED RSUS IS BASED UPON

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT

DATE.

THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTS PSUS TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP. IN 2008,

THERE WERE 306,480 PSUS GRANTED. VESTING FOR PSUS GRANTED IN

2008 IS EQUALLY BASED UPON CORPORATE REVENUE GROWTH RELATIVE TO

PEER COMPANIES AND TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) RELATIVE TO

PEER COMPANIES. PERFORMANCE AND PAYOUTS ARE DETERMINED

INDEPENDENTLY FOR EACH METRIC. THE ACTUAL AWARD, DELIVERED AS

DUPONT COMMON STOCK, CAN RANGE FROM ZERO PERCENT TO

200 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT. THE GRANT-DATE FAIR

VALUE OF THE PSUS, SUBJECT TO THE TSR METRIC, WAS $63.86,

ESTIMATED USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION. THE GRANT-DATE FAIR

VALUE OF THE PSUS, SUBJECT TO THE REVENUE METRIC, WAS BASED UPON

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT

DATE.

FOR PSUS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2008, VESTING OCCURS UPON ATTAINMENT

OF (I) CORPORATE REVENUE GROWTH RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES

AND (II) RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL OBJECTIVES (RELATIVE TO

PEER COMPANIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO 2007 AND RELATIVE TO

INTERNAL TARGETS FOR PERIODS BEGINNING IN 2007). THE ACTUAL

AWARD, DELIVERED AS DUPONT COMMON STOCK, CAN RANGE FROM ZERO

PERCENT TO 200 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT. THE FAIR

VALUE OF PSUS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2008 IS BASED UPON THE MARKET

PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT DATE.

NON-VESTED AWARDS OF RSUS AND PSUS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND $153 FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNTS OF

THE AWARDS ARE DEPENDENT ON COMPANY EARNINGS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

MAXIMUM LIMITS AS DEFINED UNDER THE GOVERNING PLANS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS OTHER VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLANS

UNDER WHICH CASH AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED. THESE PLANS INCLUDE

PIONEERS ANNUAL REWARD PROGRAM AND THE COMPANYS

REGIONAL AND LOCAL VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLANS. SUCH AWARDS WERE

$196, $217 AND $178 FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

DERIVATIVES AND

OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND

STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER

ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

A VARIETY OF APPROVED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE UTILIZED IN

EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS VARYING LEVELS OF

EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO EACH HEDGING PROGRAM. DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS UTILIZED DURING THE PERIOD INCLUDE FORWARDS,

OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY

NON-DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY ESTABLISHES AN

OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES THAT

AUTHORIZE THE USE OF SPECIFIC DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FURTHER

ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR

CONTROL AND VALUATION, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL AND ROUTINE

MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS

IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES. THE

COMPANY MANAGES THIS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS THROUGH THE

AFOREMENTIONED CREDIT APPROVALS, LIMITS AND MONITORING

PROCEDURES AND, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, BY RESTRICTING THE

PERIOD OVER WHICH UNPAID BALANCES ARE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO

THESE CONTRACTS AND NO MATERIAL LOSS WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH

NONPERFORMANCE. MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY HEDGES FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES,

CERTAIN BUSINESS SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES, AND

CERTAIN ENERGY TYPE AND AGRICULTURAL FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES.

FAIR VALUE

HEDGES

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT INVOLVE THE

EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS WHICH

ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE

DEBT. ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF

HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO

THESE HEDGES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT

HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE EACH

PERIOD. THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED

DEBT ARE ALSO RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS NO OTHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE TERMINATED WITH A COMBINED

NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $1.25 BILLION FOR CASH PROCEEDS OF $226,

WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN FINANCING CASH FLOWS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THIS GAIN WILL BE

AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS AS A REDUCTION TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER

THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT, THROUGH 2018.

CASH FLOW

HEDGES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF CASH FLOW HEDGING PROGRAMS TO

REDUCE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE

RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAMS INVOLVE HEDGING A PORTION OF

CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES OUTSIDE OF THE

U.S. COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE

EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS

NATURAL GAS, ETHANE, CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL. WHILE EACH

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD,

MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR

PERIOD.

HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES ARE REPORTED ON

THE NET SALES LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS, AND

THE EFFECTS OF HEDGES OF INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING

THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS.

RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A

FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE. CASH FLOW HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR 2008 WAS A PRE-TAX LOSS

OF $19. PRE-TAX HEDGE LOSSES EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS FOR 2008 WAS $1. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

DERIVATIVES

NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE

ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE

NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTS IN

A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

HAS RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES THAT

DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.

CURRENCY

RISK

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET

EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES

OTHER THAN THE DESIGNATED FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE PRIMARY

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED

POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES

RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX

EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS ARE USED TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE

OBJECTIVE OF THE HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN

ANOTHER CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A

GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A

CASE-BY-CASE

BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE

EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS.

INTEREST RATE

RISK

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE

INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED

OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING

RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH UNDERLYING

FIXED-RATE BONDS OR NOTES TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT

INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS WITH TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1,150,

WHEREBY THE COMPANY, OVER THE REMAINING TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING

NOTES, WILL RECEIVE A FIXED RATE PAYMENT EQUIVALENT TO THE FIXED

INTEREST RATE OF THE UNDERLYING NOTE AND PAY A FLOATING RATE OF

INTEREST THAT IS BASED ON USD LIBOR.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS OVERALL COST OF BORROWING AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 AND 2007. SEE NOTE 17 FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTIONS OF

INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

COMMODITY

PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY

EXPOSURES.
