THROUGH 2018.

BACKLOG

THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER BACKLOG TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

INDICATOR OF THE LEVEL OF FUTURE SALES ACTIVITY. IN GENERAL, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS AGAINST A BACKLOG OF

ORDERS. PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BASED ON THE LEVEL

OF INCOMING ORDERS AS WELL AS PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE DEMAND.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BACKLOG INFORMATION IS NOT

MATERIAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS OVERALL BUSINESS AND SHOULD NOT BE

CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATE

PROVIDES IT WITH AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IT HAS

ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ATTORNEYS, AS WELL AS BRANDING,

ADVERTISING AND LICENSING PROFESSIONALS, TO PROCURE, MAINTAIN,

PROTECT, ENHANCE AND GAIN VALUE FROM THIS ESTATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS,

CONTINUED

THE COMPANY OWNS AND IS LICENSED UNDER VARIOUS PATENTS, WHICH

EXPIRE FROM TIME TO TIME, COVERING MANY PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND

PRODUCT USES. THESE PATENTS PROTECT MANY ASPECTS OF THE

COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND THE GOODS AND

SERVICES IT SELLS. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THESE

PATENTS VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND DEPENDS UPON THE

SCOPE OF COVERAGE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PATENT AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY. THE COMPANY OWNS

APPROXIMATELY 21,000 WORLDWIDE PATENTS AND APPROXIMATELY 16,000

WORLDWIDE PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN 2007, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED

ABOUT 600 U.S. PATENTS AND ABOUT 1,500 INTERNATIONAL

PATENTS. THROUGH AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PRODUCTIVITY, SINCE 2000, THE COMPANYS U.S. PATENT

FILINGS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED AND THE NUMBER OF

U.S. PATENTS GRANTED HAS INCREASED MORE THAN 50 PERCENT FOR

DUPONTS FIVE GROWTH PLATFORMS AND EMBRYONIC BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANYS RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS

WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO

THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, AND TO VARYING DEGREES, IMPORTANT TO

EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF

PATENTS TO PHARMACEUTICALS, SEE THE SEGMENT DISCUSSION ON

PAGE 34 OF THIS REPORT.

THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER AND THE REST OF THE COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SEED INDUSTRY COMPETE IS INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY NEW

PATENTS, PATENT POSITIONS, PATENT LAWSUITS AND THE STATUS OF

VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OWNERSHIP OF AND ACCESS TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO

BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GERMPLASM, ARE IMPORTANT TO PIONEER AND ITS

COMPETITORS. NO SINGLE PATENT OWNED BY PIONEER OR ITS

COMPETITORS IS ESSENTIAL TO PIONEERS ABILITY TO COMPETE.

HOWEVER, PIONEER WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS FREEDOM TO OPERATE

ISSUES BY ENFORCING ITS OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

CHALLENGING CLAIMS MADE BY OTHERS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE,

OBTAINING LICENSES TO IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS. DURING 2007, PIONEER ENTERED INTO A BUSINESS

AGREEMENT ON CORN HERBICIDE TOLERANCE AND INSECT CONTROL TRAIT

TECHNOLOGIES WITH MONSANTO COMPANY. AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS,

MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE EXISTING CORN LICENSE AGREEMENTS;

BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN NON-ASSERT AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND BOTH PARTIES OBTAINED RIGHTS

TO REFERENCE AND ACCESS CERTAIN REGULATORY DATA AND APPROVALS IN

WHICH THE OTHER HAS CERTAIN INTERESTS. SEE THE CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS TABLE ON PAGE 39 AND NOTE 11 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 2,000 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR ITS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 18,000 WORLDWIDE

REGISTRATIONS AND APPLICATIONS FOR THESE TRADEMARKS. OWNERSHIP

RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS ARE

CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED. THE COMPANY HAS MANY

TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER

RETAIL LEVEL

AND/OR

BUSINESS TO BUSINESS LEVEL. SIGNIFICANT TRADEMARKS AT THE

CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL INCLUDE THE DUPONT OVAL AND

DUPONT

TM

(THE DUPONT BRAND TRADEMARKS);

PIONEER

®

BRAND SEEDS;

TEFLON

®

FLUOROPOLYMERS, FILMS, FABRIC PROTECTORS, FIBERS AND

DISPERSIONS;

CORIAN

®

SURFACES;

KEVLAR

®

HIGH STRENGTH MATERIAL; AND

TYVEK

®

PROTECTIVE MATERIAL. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY PURSUES LICENSING

OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED TRADEMARKS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL.

SEASONALITY

SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL PATTERNS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITIONS SALES AND EARNINGS

PERFORMANCE IS STRONGEST IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE

SEGMENT GENERALLY OPERATES AT A LOSS DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH

QUARTERS OF THE YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THE SEASONAL NATURE OF ITS

SEED BUSINESS, AGRICULTURE & NUTRITIONS

INVENTORY IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR

YEAR AND IS SOLD DOWN IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. TRADE

RECEIVABLES IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ARE AT A LOW

POINT AT YEAR-END AND INCREASE THROUGH THE SELLING SEASON TO

PEAK AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER.

IN GENERAL, BUSINESSES IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS ARE NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS.

MARKETING

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

PIONEER

®

BRAND SEEDS AND

SOLAE

®

SOY PROTEINS, MOST PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH

DUPONTS SALES FORCE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME REGIONS, MORE

EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

PIONEER

®

BRAND PRODUCTS ARE PROMOTED THROUGH MULTIPLE MARKETING CHANNELS

IN NORTH AMERICA. IN THE CORN AND SOYBEAN MARKETS OF THE

U.S. CORN BELT, PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH A SPECIALIZED

FORCE OF INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES. IN OTHER NORTH

AMERICAN MARKETS,

PIONEER

®

PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND CROP INPUT

RETAILERS.

PIONEER

®

PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA ARE MARKETED THROUGH A NETWORK

OF SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND INDEPENDENT

PRODUCER-DISTRIBUTORS.

SOLAE

®

ISOLATED AND FUNCTIONAL SOY PROTEINS ARE MARKETED USING A

COMBINATION OF OUTSIDE DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIRECT

SALES.

MAJOR

CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANYS SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A

SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER,

COLLECTIVELY, COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES AND

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS HAVE SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY IN

THE AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) INDUSTRY.

THE COMPANY HAS LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS

AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE SEGMENTS

OPERATING RESULTS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY COMPETES ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE,

PRODUCT QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OR SPECIFICATIONS, CONTINUITY OF

SUPPLY, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING

ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICULAR MARKET INVOLVED AND THE

PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDED.

MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES

PRINCIPALLY BASED IN THE U.S., WESTERN EUROPE, JAPAN, CHINA AND

KOREA. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COMPETITORS OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF

PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL, COMMODITY AND SPECIALTY CHEMICALS TO

PLASTICS, FIBERS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS. THE COMPANY ALSO

COMPETES IN CERTAIN MARKETS WITH SMALLER, MORE SPECIALIZED FIRMS

WHO OFFER A NARROW RANGE OF PRODUCTS OR CONVERTED PRODUCTS THAT

FUNCTIONALLY COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS OFFERINGS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SELLS ADVANCED PLANT GENETICS

THROUGH PIONEER, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF CORN

AND SOYBEANS AND THUS DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH OTHER SEED AND

PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

ALSO PROVIDES FOOD SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND SOY-BASED FOOD

INGREDIENTS IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR GRAIN AND FOOD

PROCESSORS.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH IN THE U.S. AT OVER 30 SITES

AT EITHER DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR MANUFACTURING PLANTS.

THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF RESEARCH IS IN THE WILMINGTON,

DELAWARE AREA AT SEVERAL LARGE RESEARCH CENTERS. AMONG THESE,

THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION LABORATORIES ENGAGE IN INVESTIGATIVE

AND APPLIED RESEARCH, THE CHESTNUT RUN LABORATORIES FOCUS ON

APPLIED RESEARCH AND THE STINE-HASKELL RESEARCH CENTER CONDUCTS

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH AND TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH TO

ASSURE THE SAFE MANUFACTURE, HANDLING AND USE OF PRODUCTS AND

RAW MATERIALS.

OTHER MAJOR RESEARCH LOCATIONS IN THE U.S. INCLUDE MARSHALL

LAB IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, AND MT. CLEMENS IN MT.

CLEMENS, MICHIGAN, BOTH DEDICATED TO COATINGS RESEARCH; PIONEER

RESEARCH FACILITIES IN JOHNSTON, IOWA; THE SOLAE COMPANY

FACILITIES IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; POLYMER RESEARCH

FACILITIES IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, AND PARKERSBURG, WEST

VIRGINIA; AND ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH FACILITIES IN

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA, TOWANDA, PENNSYLVANIA,

AND SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA.

DUPONT, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS GLOBAL INTERESTS, ALSO

OPERATES MORE THAN 20 ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

FACILITIES AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., WITH MAJOR FACILITIES

LOCATED IN MEYRIN, BELGIUM; WUPPERTAL, GERMANY; KINGSTON,

CANADA; UTSUNOMIYA, JAPAN; AND SHANGHAI, CHINA. A NEW RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITY WAS OPENED IN TAIWAN IN 2006 TO BETTER

SERVE THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT MARKET. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2007, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO CONSTRUCT ITS FIRST RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER IN INDIA. THE CENTER, WHICH IS LOCATED IN

HYDERABAD, IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN EARLY 2008.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS ARE TO CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES IN RELEVANT FIELDS, AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE EXISTING

PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES. EACH SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY FUNDS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS

MISSION. RECENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS BROADENED ITS SUSTAINABILITY

COMMITMENTS BEYOND ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTION TO INCLUDE

MARKET-DRIVEN TARGETS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT.

THE COMPANY IS EXPANDING ITS OFFERINGS ADDRESSING SAFETY,

ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL

MARKETPLACE BY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING RENEWABLE,

BIO-BASED MATERIALS; ADVANCED BIOFUELS; ENERGY-EFFICIENT

TECHNOLOGIES; ENHANCED SAFETY AND PROTECTION PRODUCTS; AND

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE GOALS ARE TIED

DIRECTLY TO BUSINESS GROWTH, SPECIFICALLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

SAFER AND ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPROVED PRODUCTS THAT ENHANCE THE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE OF ITS TRADITIONAL BUSINESSES FOR

DUPONTS KEY GLOBAL MARKETS, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION,

BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD AND

COMMUNICATIONS.

THE CORPORATE RESEARCH LABORATORIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

CONDUCTING RESEARCH PROGRAMS ALIGNED WITH CORPORATE STRATEGY AS

PROVIDED BY THE GROWTH PLATFORMS. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE ADMINISTERED BY SENIOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE BUSINESS AND CORPORATE

STRATEGY. THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY IS NOT DEPENDENT UPON THE

OUTCOME OF ANY SINGLE RESEARCH PROGRAM.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

INCLUDING THE AMOUNT INCURRED DURING EACH OF THE LAST THREE

FACILITY

SECURITY

DUPONT RECOGNIZES THAT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF ITS OPERATIONS

ARE CRITICAL TO ITS EMPLOYEES, NEIGHBORS AND, INDEED, TO THE

FUTURE OF THE COMPANY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY HAS MERGED CHEMICAL

SITE SECURITY INTO ITS SAFETY CORE VALUE WHERE IT SERVES AS AN

INTEGRAL PART OF ITS LONG STANDING SAFETY CULTURE. PHYSICAL

SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN COMBINED WITH PROCESS SAFETY

MEASURES (INCLUDING THE USE OF INHERENTLY SAFER TECHNOLOGY),

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PREPAREDNESS

INTO AN INTEGRATED SECURITY PLAN. THE COMPANY HAS CONDUCTED

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AT OPERATING FACILITIES IN THE

U.S. AND HIGH PRIORITY SITES WORLDWIDE AND IDENTIFIED AND

IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES

FROM PHYSICAL OR CYBER ATTACKS. DUPONT IS PARTNERING WITH

CARRIERS, INCLUDING RAILROAD, SHIPPING AND TRUCKING COMPANIES,

TO SECURE CHEMICALS IN TRANSIT.

IN APRIL 2007, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) ISSUED

AN INTERIM FINAL RULE (RULE) THAT ESTABLISHES RISK-BASED

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THE SECURITY OF U.S. CHEMICAL

FACILITIES. COVERED CHEMICAL FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE

SECURITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS THAT IDENTIFY FACILITY

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SITE

SECURITY PLANS THAT INCLUDE MEASURES SATISFYING THE IDENTIFIED

RISK-BASED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THE RULE CONTAINS ASSOCIATED

PROVISIONS ADDRESSING INSPECTIONS AND AUDITS, RECORDKEEPING, AND

THE PROTECTION OF INFORMATION THAT CONSTITUTES

CHEMICAL-TERRORISM VULNERABILITY INFORMATION. DHS CAN SEEK

COMPLIANCE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ORDERS, INCLUDING ORDERS

ASSESSING CIVIL PENALTY AND ORDERS FOR THE CESSATION OF

OPERATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER OF 2007, DHS FINALIZED THE LIST OF CHEMICALS

REGULATED BY THE RULE AND REQUIRED FACILITIES THAT HAVE THOSE

CHEMICALS IN SPECIFIED QUANTITIES TO REGISTER WITH DHS. THOSE

FACILITIES MUST PROVIDE INFORMATION BY WHICH DHS WILL DETERMINE

IF AND HOW THE FACILITY WILL BE COVERED BY THE RULES

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. DUPONTS U.S. FACILITIES HAVE

SUBMITTED THIS INFORMATION AND ARE AWAITING DHS

DETERMINATION OF COVERAGE. ONCE DHS HAS DETERMINED WHICH DUPONT

FACILITIES ARE COVERED, IT WILL WORK WITH THE COMPANY TO

ESTABLISH SECURITY EXPECTATIONS SPECIFIC TO EACH FACILITY. AS A

RESULT, MANAGEMENT WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER ASSESS THE RULES

IMPACT ON THE COMPANY AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS

ALREADY DEVOTED SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT AND RESOURCES IN ASSESSING

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND TAKING STEPS TO REINFORCE SECURITY

AT ITS CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS

THAT THESE STEPS WILL FULFILL MOST OF THE RULES RISK-BASED

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS

BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE

COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL

AND NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WHEN POSSIBLE, THE

COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND

EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL

PURCHASES. THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS

OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE

INCREASES, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION

PROGRAMS. SUCCESS IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH

PRICE INCREASES IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON

THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET

THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

FAILURE TO

DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANYS

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON

ITS ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THIS ABILITY

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW

PRODUCTS, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OBTAIN

RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS, OBTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS,

TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND INTENSE COMPETITION, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

DEVELOPING, OR COULD BEGIN TO DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, WILL

ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. SALES OF THE

COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS COULD REPLACE SALES OF SOME OF ITS

CURRENT PRODUCTS, OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF EVEN A SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCT INTRODUCTION.

THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND

ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND

ANTITRUST CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY

SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES,

OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES.

VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT

ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT,

SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE

CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND

INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF

THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED,

THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

AS A RESULT OF

THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD

INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND

THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF

POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST

OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY

COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS,

THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. THE COSTS

OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS

WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS

UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANYS ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS

AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON

WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS

INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATION, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE

TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT

MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF

OTHER PRPS.

THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM GENETICALLY

ENHANCED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY SEEDS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE,

GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND

COMPETITION.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE

PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

SEGMENT. DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS

GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE

DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY

TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF CROPS GROWN FROM THOSE SEEDS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE

STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES SUPPORTING THE USE OF

BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION MARKETS. SPEED IN

DISCOVERING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING

PRODUCTS BASED ON THEM TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS

COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANYS EXISTING OR CANDIDATE

PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES.

CHANGES IN

GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND LAWS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF ITS TOTAL SALES AND THAT CONTINUED GROWTH AND

PROFITABILITY WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION,

PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE, MONETARY AND

FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF

U.S. AND

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS,

AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO CHANGES IN A COUNTRYS OR REGIONS

ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRADE REGULATIONS AFFECTING

PRODUCTION, PRICING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, LOCAL LABOR

CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS, REDUCED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY OR

LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES,

BURDENSOME TAXES AND TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS.

INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CHANGING SOCIAL

AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TERRORISM, POLITICAL

HOSTILITIES AND WAR, COULD LEAD TO REDUCED INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH SALES.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,

ECONOMIC FACTORS,

INCLUDING INFLATION AND FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES,

INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY

HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THERE ARE A LARGE

NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL

SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY

ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES

AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE RISKS COULD HAVE

AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS COULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FUTURE

REVENUE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND INCREASE COSTS AND

EXPENSES.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, INCREASING

COSTS FOR ENERGY, TEMPORARY PLANT

AND/OR

POWER

OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND NETWORK

DISRUPTIONS, COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR

CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, THEY COULD RESULT IN REDUCED

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR

IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS

OR TO RECEIVE RAW MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS

AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY

MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD CAUSE BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM OR

WAR, AND NATURAL DISASTERS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, THE IMPACT

FROM BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST

OF DOING BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INABILITY TO

PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE

PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS

ARE IMPORTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN

PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL

CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND

TRADE SECRETS. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY ACCESS AND USE SUCH PROPERTY. WHEN

MISAPPROPRIATION IS DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH

SITUATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR

INVESTIGATION AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL

IMPACT.

ACID PLANTS NEW

SOURCE REVIEW ENFORCEMENT ACTION

IN 2003, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND FINDING OF

VIOLATION FOR THE COMPANYS FORT HILL SULFURIC

ACID PLANT IN OHIO. THE EPA CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF CAPITAL

PROJECTS AT THE PLANT OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. BASED ON ITS

REVIEW, THE EPA BELIEVES THAT TWO OF THE PROJECTS TRIGGERED A

REQUIREMENT TO MEET THE NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR

SULFURIC ACID PLANTS AND THAT THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A

PERMIT UNDER THE NEW SOURCE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS OF THE CLEAN AIR

ACT (CAA). IN JULY 2004, THE EPA ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION

FOR THE JAMES RIVER SULFURIC ACID PLANT IN VIRGINIA WITH SIMILAR

ALLEGATIONS. THE COMPANYS SULFURIC ACID PLANTS IN

LOUISIANA AND KENTUCKY USE SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY.

IN JULY 2007 A CONSENT DECREE WAS REACHED UNDER WHICH THE

COMPANY PAID A TOTAL OF $4,125,000 IN CIVIL PENALTIES TO THE

U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, LOUISIANA, OHIO AND VIRGINIA.

UNDER THE DECREE, DUPONT MUST RETROFIT ITS BURNSIDE PLANT IN

LOUISIANA BY SEPTEMBER 1, 2009 AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF AT

LEAST $66 MILLION. IN ADDITION, BY MARCH 1, 2012, THE

OTHER THREE PLANTS MUST BE RETROFITTED AT AN ESTIMATED TOTAL

COST OF AT LEAST $87 MILLION OR SHUT DOWN.

BELLE SPENT ACID

PLANT NEW SOURCE REVIEW NOTICE OF VIOLATION

ON AUGUST 2, 2007, THE EPA ISSUED A NOTICE AND FINDING OF

VIOLATION TO DUPONT AND LUCITE INTERNATIONAL REGARDING THE SPENT

ACID REGENERATION UNIT AT THE BELLE PLANT IN SOUTH CHARLESTON,

WEST VIRGINIA. DUPONT SOLD THE UNIT TO IMPERIAL CHEMICAL

INDUSTRIES, PLC (ICI) IN 1993, WHO SOLD IT TO LUCITE IN

1999. DUPONT HAS OPERATED THE UNIT SINCE IT WAS BUILT IN 1964,

INCLUDING AFTER THE SALE TO ICI, THROUGH THE PRESENT. THE NOTICE

ALLEGES 5 PROJECTS IN THE TIME PERIOD 1988 TO 1996 SHOULD HAVE

TRIGGERED THE NEW SOURCE REVIEW OR NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE

STANDARD REQUIREMENTS OF CAA. IF SO, THESE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED

RETROFIT TO BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY. DUPONT AND

LUCITE ARE CONTESTING THE ALLEGATIONS. IF THE EPA DECLINES TO

RECONSIDER ITS FINDINGS IT MAY BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN

THE COURTS

SEEKING RETROFIT AND PENALTIES. LUCITE HAS NOTIFIED THE COMPANY

GIBSON CITY,

ILLINOIS

THE EPA HAS ALLEGED THAT THE SOLAE COMPANY VIOLATED THE

CAAS NEW SOURCE REVIEW REGULATIONS AND CERTAIN PREVENTION

OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION REQUIREMENTS AT ITS PLANT IN GIBSON

CITY, ILLINOIS. THE SOLAE COMPANY, A MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE WITH

BUNGE LIMITED, WAS FORMED IN 2003. THE EPA HAS PROPOSED A

SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER THAT WOULD INCLUDE SITES LOCATED IN

INDIANA, OHIO, OKLAHOMA AND TENNESSEE, SOME OF WHICH ARE WHOLLY

OWNED BY DUPONT, IN ADDITION TO THE GIBSON CITY SITE. THE

EPAS PROPOSED SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A PENALTY OF $350,000

AND SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS INVOLVING EXPENDITURES

OF AT LEAST $500,000. THE COMPANY AND THE SOLAE COMPANY ARE

NEGOTIATING WITH THE EPA AND U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

(DOJ).

PASCAGOULA,

MISSISSIPPI

IN OCTOBER 2002, THE FIRST CHEMICAL CORPORATION (FCC) PLANT IN

PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI EXPERIENCED AN EXPLOSION AT ONE OF ITS

PROCESS UNITS  THE MONONITROTOLUENE

UNIT  STILL NUMBER 1 (MNT STILL). THE UNIT

OVERHEATED, PRESSURE BUILT UP IN THE COLUMN AND A SIGNIFICANT

RELEASE OCCURRED. NO SIGNIFICANT INJURIES OCCURRED, NOR WAS

THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL HARM AS A RESULT OF THE

INCIDENT.

AT THE TIME OF THE OCTOBER 2002 INCIDENT, FCC WAS NOT AFFILIATED

WITH DUPONT; HOWEVER, DUPONT WAS IN FINAL NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE

PURCHASE OF CHEMFIRST, INC., OF WHICH FCC WAS A SUBSIDIARY.

AFTER AN EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT BY FCC AND

DUPONT, DUPONT COMPLETED THE PURCHASE IN NOVEMBER 2002.

TWO YEARS AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE EPA BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION

UNDER THE CAAS PREVENTION OF ACCIDENTAL

RELEASES  GENERAL DUTY OF CARE

PROVISIONS  CAA 112(R). OVER THE LAST THREE

YEARS, THE EPA HAS REQUESTED SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENTATION REGARDING

THE INCIDENT AND THE REBUILD OF THE MNT STILL. THE EPA ALSO

REQUESTED, AND FCC AGREED TO AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY

PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT AUDIT OF THE FCC FACILITY,

SEEKING INFORMATION ON PRE-INCIDENT DOCUMENTS AS WELL AS THE

POST-INCIDENT REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF THE MNT STILL.

THE EPA HAS REFERRED THE MATTER TO DOJ FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTION

AGAINST FCC UNDER THE CAA. THE EPA/DOJ AND DUPONT ARE CURRENTLY

ENGAGED IN SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS TO RESOLVE THE PROPOSED CAA

112(R) ENFORCEMENT ACTION. MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME

OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AT THIS TIME.

OVERVIEW

DUPONT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING ITS THREE GROWTH

STRATEGIES 

PUTTING SCIENCE TO WORK,

LEVERAGING THE POWER OF ONE DUPONT AND GOING WHERE THE GROWTH

IS

. IN 2007, APPROXIMATELY 1,200 NEW PRODUCTS WERE

COMMERCIALIZED, APPROXIMATELY 2,000 NEW U.S. PATENT

APPLICATIONS WERE FILED AND MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF 2007 SALES

WERE DERIVED FROM PRODUCTS INTRODUCED IN THE LAST 5 YEARS.

THE COMPANY AGAIN REDUCED FIXED COSTS AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES.

IN 2007, OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS SALES WERE TO

CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ACHIEVED

18 PERCENT GROWTH IN THE EMERGING MARKETS OF EUROPE, ASIA

PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE COMPANY OUTLINED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

BEYOND 2008 THROUGH 2010 IN A FIVE POINT PLAN. THE COMPANY SEES

POTENTIAL FOR DOUBLE DIGIT EARNINGS GROWTH DRIVEN BY ADVANCES IN

SEVERAL STRATEGIC AREAS.

NEW SCIENCE FOR GROWING AGRICULTURE

MARKETS

 WITH DEMAND FOR PROTEIN RISING

RAPIDLY, GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION WILL HAVE TO DOUBLE BETWEEN NOW

AND 2025 ON VIRTUALLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF LAND CURRENTLY IN

PRODUCTION. AS ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST PRODUCERS OF CORN

AND SOY SEED AND CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS, DUPONT IS BRINGING TO

MARKET MORE EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR

WEEDS, INSECTS AND FUNGUS TO BOOST FARM PRODUCTIVITY, QUALITY

AND YIELD. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT NEW PRODUCTS SUCH AS

OPTIMUM

TM

GAT

TM

TRAITS AND

RYNAXYPR

TM

INSECTICIDE, WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH.

GROWING DEMAND FOR SAFETY &

PROTECTION

 PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL SAFER AND

MORE SECURE AT HOME, ON THE JOB, IN THEIR

CARS  EVERYWHERE. THE COMPANYS LONG

EXPERIENCE AND $6 BILLION BASE BUSINESS IN ADVANCED

MATERIALS SUCH AS

KEVLAR

®

,

NOMEX

®

AND

TYVEK

®

HAVE RESULTED IN A BROAD OFFERING OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT

ADDRESS THIS GROWING GLOBAL NEED. IN 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

A NEW $500 MILLION

KEVLAR

®

BRAND FIBER PRODUCTION FACILITY IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICH CAME ON

THE HEELS OF CAPACITY EXPANSIONS FOR

NOMEX

®

FLAME-RESISTANT FIBERS. IN 2008, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO

USE ITS SCIENCE AND GROWTH INVESTMENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

OPPORTUNITY IT SEES FOR ATTRACTIVE GROWTH IN ITS

SAFETY & PROTECTION SEGMENT.

SPRINGBOARD POSITION IN EMERGING

MARKETS

 THE COMPANYS RAPID TOP LINE

GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS IS A KEY FACTOR IN COUNTER-BALANCING

SOFTNESS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE AND U.S. HOUSING

MARKETS. BUSINESS UNIT LEADERS IN THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS,

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES AND

ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES SEGMENTS ARE

SUCCEEDING IN GENERATING STRONG GROWTH IN THE EMERGING MARKETS

OF ASIA PACIFIC, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, AND LATIN AMERICA.

EXTEND COST PRODUCTIVITY GAINS

 DUPONT

CONTINUES TO REDUCE FIXED COSTS AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES. COST

SAVINGS PROJECTS HAVE OFFSET INFLATION IN PERSONNEL COSTS AND

HAVE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF GROWTH INVESTMENTS.

DUPONT IS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO GENERATE COST PRODUCTIVITY

GAINS AS A MECHANISM FOR FUNDING GROWTH.

CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF APPLIED

BIOSCIENCES

 SCIENCE AND INNOVATION ARE

CRITICAL TO THE COMPANYS SUCCESS. ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND

COMMERCIALIZATION OF DUPONT APPLIED

BIOSCIENCES

TM

PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH AT LEAST 2010 WITH INCREASING

INTENSITY.

2007 VERSUS 2006

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES

FOR 2007 WERE $29.4 BILLION, UP 7 PERCENT. THIS GROWTH

WAS PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF AN 11 PERCENT INCREASE IN

SALES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., REFLECTING IN PART THE BENEFIT OF A

WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR (USD), WHICH ADDED 3 PERCENT TO

WORLDWIDE SALES. WORLDWIDE VOLUMES AND LOCAL SELLING PRICES EACH

INCREASED 2 PERCENT. SALES IN THE U.S. INCREASED

1 PERCENT REFLECTING 3 PERCENT HIGHER SELLING PRICES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 2 PERCENT LOWER VOLUME. THE DECREASE IN

U.S. SALES VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS RELATED TO HOUSING AND AUTOMOTIVE

PRODUCTION MARKETS. SALES IN CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA INCREASED

15 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 10 PERCENT VOLUME

INCREASE REFLECTING A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN SALES OF SEED AND

CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN SOUTH AMERICA.

DURING 2006, SIGNIFICANT VOLUME INCREASES IN KEY GROWTH REGIONS,

PARTICULARLY ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA, ALONG WITH MODEST

GROWTH IN EUROPE, MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER U.S. VOLUME.

VOLUME DECLINES IN THE U.S. ARE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

LOWER DEMAND IN HOUSING AND AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION MARKETS. THESE

DECLINES MORE THAN OFFSET THE RECOVERY IN THE U.S. OF

TITANIUM DIOXIDE, INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL AND PACKAGING POLYMER

HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA.

OTHER INCOME, NET,

DECREASED $286 MILLION VERSUS 2006. THIS REDUCTION IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $165 MILLION TO

/HYZAAR

®

INCOME OF $136 MILLION (SEE PAGE 34 FOR

PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT INFORMATION AND NOTE 2 TO THE

THE DECREASE IN MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS RESULTED FROM THE ABSENCE OF

2006 BENEFITS OF $90 MILLION FOR THE REVERSAL OF ACCRUED

INTEREST RELATED TO THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN

PRIOR-YEAR TAX CONTINGENCIES AND $76 MILLION OF INSURANCE

RECOVERIES FROM ITS INSURANCE CARRIERS. OF THE $76 MILLION,

$61 MILLION RELATED TO COSTS, INCLUDING OUTSIDE COUNSEL

FEES AND EXPENSES AND SETTLEMENTS PAID OVER THE PAST TWENTY

YEARS AS PART OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION MATTERS. DURING THIS TWENTY

YEAR PERIOD, DUPONT HAS BEEN SERVED WITH THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS

ALLEGING INJURY FROM EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS ON DUPONT PREMISES.

MOST OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF THROUGH TRIAL,

DISMISSAL OR SETTLEMENT. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS REMOTE THAT

THE OUTCOME OF REMAINING OR FUTURE ASBESTOS LITIGATION MATTERS

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. THESE ASBESTOS

RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES WERE REFLECTED IN CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE REMAINING $15 MILLION IS PART

OF A TOTAL RECOVERY OF $143 MILLION RELATING TO INSURANCE

RECOVERIES ASSOCIATED WITH DAMAGES TO THE COMPANYS

FACILITIES SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF HURRICANE KATRINA IN 2005.

THE MAJORITY OF THE HURRICANE KATRINA RECOVERY WAS INCLUDED IN

COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. NO AMOUNTS WERE RECEIVED FROM

INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE COMPANY AS A

RESULT OF HURRICANE RITA.

2006 VERSUS 2005

OTHER INCOME, NET

DECREASED $291 MILLION VERSUS 2005. THIS REDUCTION IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A $407 MILLION DECREASE IN NET PRETAX

EXCHANGE GAINS (SEE PAGE 46 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

COMPANYS PROGRAM TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISK AND NOTE 2

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). IN 2006, THE COMPANY

RECORDED $76 MILLION OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES IN OTHER

SALES FOR 2007 VERSUS 75 PERCENT FOR THE YEAR 2006. THE

2 PERCENTAGE POINT REDUCTION PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS THE

ABSENCE OF 2006 CHARGES FOR RESTRUCTURING, THE EFFECTS OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AND A CURRENT YEAR

BENEFIT FROM THE WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR DUE TO CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES WHICH INCREASED SALES AT A HIGHER RATE

THAN THE RATE THEY INCREASED COGS. PARTLY OFFSETTING THESE

FACTORS WERE INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL AND FINISHED PRODUCT

DISTRIBUTION COSTS, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF A 2006 BENEFIT OF

$128 MILLION IN INSURANCE RECOVERIES.

THE 2006 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS INCLUDED THE ELIMINATION OF

APPROXIMATELY 3,200 POSITIONS AND REDEPLOYMENT OF ABOUT

400 EMPLOYEES IN EXCESS POSITIONS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET CHARGE OF $326 MILLION IN 2006

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES. THIS INCLUDED $184 MILLION TO PROVIDE SEVERANCE

BENEFITS FOR APPROXIMATELY 2,800 EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN

MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SALES, ADMINISTRATIVE AND TECHNICAL

ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THESE PROGRAMS ARE

RESULT OF THE 2006 PLANS TOTALED $77 MILLION DURING 2007

ABOUT $125 MILLION PER YEAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM, APPROXIMATELY

$53 MILLION OF WHICH IS REFLECTED IN COGS. CUMULATIVE

SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT AND 35 PERCENT WAS

4 PERCENT. COGS WAS 75 PERCENT OF SALES IN 2006 VERSUS

74 PERCENT IN 2005. THE 1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN

COGS AS A PERCENT OF SALES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS HIGHER RAW

MATERIAL COSTS NOT ENTIRELY COVERED BY SELLING PRICE INCREASES

AND HIGHER COSTS FOR RESTRUCTURING PLANS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED A BENEFIT TO COGS FOR

$128 MILLION FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE

PROPERTY DAMAGE SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF HURRICANE KATRINA. IN

2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF $160 MILLION RELATED

TO THE

CLEAN-UP

AND

RESTORATION OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE

WRITE-OFF OF INVENTORY AND PLANT ASSETS THAT WERE DESTROYED BY

HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA. HURRICANE RELATED CHARGES REDUCED

SEGMENT EARNINGS AS FOLLOWS: COATINGS & COLOR

TECHNOLOGIES  $116 MILLION; PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS  $17 MILLION; AND

SAFETY & PROTECTION  $27 MILLION.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET CHARGE OF $326 MILLION IN 2006

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. IN 2005, THE COMPANY EVALUATED

CAPITAL INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS AT ITS LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY

FACILITY AND THE DECLINING DEMAND FOR THE NEOPRENE PRODUCTS

PRODUCED AT THE FACILITY. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS MADE

PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE NEOPRENE PRODUCTION AT ITS UPGRADED

FACILITY IN LAPLACE, LOUISIANA. ON DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE

COMPANY INITIATED THE SHUTDOWN, ABATEMENT AND DISMANTLEMENT

PROCESS AT THE LOUISVILLE FACILITY. A CHARGE OF $34 MILLION

WAS RECORDED IN 2005 REFLECTING SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS FOR

APPROXIMATELY 275 EMPLOYEES, PRINCIPALLY AT THE LOUISVILLE

SITE. ADDITIONALLY, A BENEFIT OF $13 MILLION WAS RECORDED

IN 2005 TO REFLECT CHANGES IN ESTIMATES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE

SEPARATIONS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED IN EARLIER YEARS.

CHARGES FOR RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. 2005 RESULTS

INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT HURRICANE RELATED CHARGES AS WELL AS TAX

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPATRIATION OF CASH UNDER AJCA.

CORPORATE

OUTLOOK

THE COMPANYS CURRENT 2008 EARNINGS OUTLOOK IS A RANGE OF

$3.35 TO $3.55 PER SHARE BASED ON THE EXPECTATION OF CONTINUED

REVENUE GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS AND EARNINGS GROWTH ACROSS

ALL OF THE GROWTH PLATFORMS. NEW PRODUCT ACCELERATION, MIX

ENRICHMENT, PRICING DISCIPLINE AND CONTINUED COST AND CAPITAL

PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ACROSS THE COMPANY ARE EXPECTED TO BE

ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. THE COMPANYS 2008 OUTLOOK

IS POSITIVE; HOWEVER, IT IS MODERATED BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN

U.S. HOUSING AND NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS AND

CONTINUED ESCALATION OF ENERGY, INGREDIENT AND TRANSPORTATION

COSTS.

ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS,

(SFAS 157) WHICH ADDRESSES HOW COMPANIES SHOULD

MEASURE FAIR VALUE WHEN REQUIRED FOR RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE

PURPOSES UNDER GAAP. THE STANDARDS PROVISIONS WILL BE

APPLIED TO EXISTING ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED

DISCLOSURES THAT ARE BASED ON FAIR VALUE. SFAS 157 DOES NOT

REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARD APPLIES A

COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE TO BE USED THROUGHOUT GAAP, WITH

EMPHASIS ON FAIR VALUE AS A MARKET BASED MEASUREMENT

VERSUS AN ENTITY-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENT, AND ESTABLISHES A

HIERARCHY OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT METHODS. THE DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH

COMPANIES USE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE METHODS AND

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON EARNINGS. SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007. THE NEW

STANDARDS PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE

APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008. THE FASB,

ON FEBRUARY 12, 2008, ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP)

FAS 157-2.

THIS FSP PERMITS A DELAY IN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS 157

TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008, FOR

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR

ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY).

THE DELAY IS INTENDED TO ALLOW THE BOARD AND CONSTITUENTS

ADDITIONAL TIME TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS IMPLEMENTATION

ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN, OR THAT MAY ARISE, FROM THE APPLICATION

OF SFAS 157. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP

FAS 157-1

TO EXCLUDE SFAS 13, ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES, AND ITS RELATED

INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE SCOPE OF

SFAS 157. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT ADOPTION OF SFAS 157

WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141 (REVISED

2007) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (SFAS 141R)

WHICH REPLACES FASB STATEMENT NO. 141. SFAS 141R

ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS

ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AND NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. SFAS 141R ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE

THAT ENABLES USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO BETTER

EVALUATE THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL EFFECT OF BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS. SFAS 141R APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER THE

BEGINNING OF THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR

AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SFAS 141R WILL BE ADOPTED BY

THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH

BULLETIN NO. 51 (SFAS 160) WHICH

CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS AND

FOR THE DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT

A THIRD-PARTY, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN A CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY IS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY

THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. SFAS 160 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE THAT CLEARLY

IDENTIFIES AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF THE PARENT

AND THE INTERESTS OF THE NON-CONTROLLING OWNERS. SFAS 160

IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2008. SFAS 160 WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE

IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE

FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE

POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE

THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE

INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF

TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES,

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY

REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS

APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS

SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS

ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS ARE TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MEASURING THE COST

AND BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE TWO

KEY ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY AS OF DECEMBER 31ST. THESE AND

OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS

APPROPRIATE. AS PERMITTED BY GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER

FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND

TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF

THE GREATER OF THE PLAN OBLIGATIONS OR THE APPLICABLE PLAN

ASSETS, THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING

WORKING LIFE OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS BENEFIT OBLIGATION

FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS OTHER

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

BENEFIT PLANS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY UTILIZES PUBLISHED

LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT

RATE AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. WHERE COMMONLY AVAILABLE, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS INDICES OF VARIOUS DURATIONS TO REFLECT THE

TIMING OF FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

WITHIN THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET

ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR

SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT

BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN

OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND

PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY

STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON

HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES

COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION

OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO

PLAN PARTICIPANTS.

IN DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE

OF ASSETS RATHER THAN THEIR FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY

BE A LAG IN RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A

RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT

IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS CALCULATION OF NET

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES ARE

BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF

REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTIPARTY SITES

AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS. THE

COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $357 MILLION ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007; THESE

ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE

NOT DISCOUNTED.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE

AMOUNT ACCRUED. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY

ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE

CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS.

THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN

INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE

COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES

A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS

PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT

WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK

FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE VARIOUS LAWS AND

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE

LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY FOR CLEANING UP THE DAMAGE RESULTING

FROM COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE DISPOSAL. OVER THE NEXT TWO

DECADES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS UNDER BOTH

CERCLA AND RCRA.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST

FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS,

DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING

REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

PRPS. THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP PRECISE ESTIMATES OF

FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS.

LEGAL

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY

SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND ANTITRUST

CLAIMS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A

LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE

ACCRUALS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT AND STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS,

SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION

AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR MATTER. PREDICTING

THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS

AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES. IN MAKING

DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS,

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING

UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR

TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED,

INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING

THE MATTER THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND

THE MATTERS CURRENT STATUS. CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION

ACCRUAL WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY

IN A COURT PROCEEDING. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT

RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF, BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY

OVERTURNED ON APPEAL. A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT

LITIGATION MATTERS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 19 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL

COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF

UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE TAXES THE

COMPANY WILL PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN

VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION

OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX

AUDITS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANYS TAX ASSETS AND TAX

LIABILITIES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES FROM FUTURE

COMPLETED TAX EXAMINATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED TO

THE COMPANYS GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, HOWEVER DUE

TO THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF THESE

AUDITS AND THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE

RANGE OF INCREASE OR DECREASE THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT

TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX

LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED

TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE

VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE

REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE

TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS

TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL

REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN RECORDING A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND

GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN

SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED TAX

ASSET BALANCE OF $4,750 MILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE

OF $1,424 MILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED

TO OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES

IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME

AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE

ASSETS.

VALUATION OF

ASSETS

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE

COMPANYS NORMAL ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS. TESTING FOR

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATES AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. THE DYNAMIC

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES

OPERATE AND KEY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT

TO PROJECTED SELLING PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES,

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS.

ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY

FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. CHANGES IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION LEVERAGES THE COMPANYS

TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE TO

IMPROVE THE QUANTITY, QUALITY AND SAFETY OF THE GLOBAL FOOD

SUPPLY. LAND AVAILABLE FOR WORLDWIDE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS

INCREASINGLY LIMITED. THEREFORE, INCREASES IN PRODUCTION WILL

NEED TO BE ACHIEVED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH IMPROVING CROP YIELDS

AND PRODUCTIVITY RATHER THAN THROUGH INCREASES IN PLANTED

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER 2007, PIONEER ENTERED INTO A BUSINESS

AGREEMENT ON CORN HERBICIDE TOLERANCE AND INSECT CONTROL TRAIT

TECHNOLOGIES WITH MONSANTO COMPANY. AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS,

MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE EXISTING CORN LICENSE AGREEMENTS;

BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN NON-ASSERT AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND BOTH PARTIES OBTAINED RIGHTS

TO REFERENCE AND ACCESS CERTAIN REGULATORY DATA AND APPROVAL IN

WHICH THE OTHER PARTY HAS CERTAIN INTERESTS. REFER TO

NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ALSO SERVES THE GLOBAL

PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WITH CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN

THE GRAIN AND SPECIALTY CROP SECTORS, FORESTRY AND VEGETATION

MANAGEMENT. PRINCIPAL CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS ARE HERBICIDES,

FUNGICIDES, INSECT CONTROL PRODUCTS AND PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS.

THE SEGMENT CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS PRESENCE IN FRUIT AND

VEGETABLE SPECIALTY MARKETS AND CONTINUES TO EXPAND PRODUCT

OFFERINGS IN THE PROFESSIONAL PEST CONTROL MARKET. ADDITIONALLY,

THE SEGMENT OPERATES WITHIN THE SPECIALTY FOOD INGREDIENTS

MARKET, INCLUDING SOY PROTEINS AND LECITHINS THROUGH ITS

MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE WITH BUNGE LIMITED, THE SOLAE COMPANY.

IN 2006, THE SEGMENT LAUNCHED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO INCREASE

INVESTMENT IN PLANT GENETICS, BIOTECHNOLOGY AND OTHER GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES WHILE CONSOLIDATING MANUFACTURING ASSETS,

TECHNOLOGY CENTERS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES IN ITS NUTRITION AND

CROP PROTECTION BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENT RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$122 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2006 FOR EMPLOYEE

SEPARATIONS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

INVESTMENT AND STREAMLINING PLAN. THE PLAN INCLUDES THE CLOSURE

OF MANUFACTURING UNITS AND THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY

1,500 POSITIONS. OPERATING COSTS SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY

$100 MILLION PER YEAR WILL BE REINVESTED INTO THE SEED

BUSINESS (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS). DURING 2007, OPERATING COSTS SAVINGS OF

$40 MILLION WERE REALIZED, WHICH PARTIALLY OFFSET THE

GROWTH INVESTMENT IN THE SEED BUSINESS.

2007 VERSUS 2006

SALES OF

$6.8 BILLION WERE 14 PERCENT HIGHER REFLECTING

9 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND A 5 PERCENT

INCREASE IN VOLUME. HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES REFLECTED A RICHER

MIX OF CORN AND SOYBEAN SEED, AND CROP PROTECTION HERBICIDES AND

FUNGICIDES. VOLUME INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY CORN SEED SALES IN

NORTH AMERICA, HERBICIDES IN EUROPE AND FUNGICIDES IN LATIN

AMERICA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE SALE OF SOYBEAN

SEED ON LOWER PLANTING ACREAGE IN NORTH AMERICA.

2007 PTOI WAS $894 MILLION VERSUS $604 MILLION IN

2006. 2006 PTOI INCLUDED A $122 MILLION RESTRUCTURING

CHARGE. IN ADDITION, 2007 PTOI BENEFITED FROM SALES VOLUME AND

PRICE GAINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS ACROSS

MOST OF THE SEGMENT AND THE GROWTH INVESTMENT IN THE SEED

BUSINESS.

2006 VERSUS 2005

SALES OF

$6.0 BILLION WERE 1 PERCENT LOWER REFLECTING SLIGHTLY

LOWER USD SELLING PRICES AND VOLUMES. LOWER SELLING PRICES

REFLECTED DECLINES IN THE CROP PROTECTION MARKET PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY PRICES FOR A RICHER MIX IN CORN AND SOYBEAN SEED.

VOLUME DECLINES WERE DRIVEN BY LOWER CORN SEED SALES IN NORTH

AMERICA, SPECIALTY PRODUCTS IN INDIA AND HERBICIDE SALES IN

NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE

SALE OF SOYBEAN SEED. 2006 INCLUDED SOME EARLIER THAN

ANTICIPATED SEED SALES FOR THE 2007 PLANTING SEASON IN EUROPE.

2006 PTOI WAS $604 MILLION VERSUS $875 MILLION IN

2005. THE DECLINE IN 2006 PTOI REFLECTED THE CHARGE OF

$122 MILLION DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, 2006 PTOI

REFLECTED THE SALES DECLINE AND HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS ACROSS

MOST OF THE SEGMENT, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY INCOME RELATED TO

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS, LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND ASSET SALES.

OUTLOOK

IN 2008, THE SEGMENT

ANTICIPATES CONTINUED PTOI GROWTH THROUGH INCREASED PIONEER CORN

VALUE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING STACKED TRAITS AND SEED TREATMENTS IN

THE U.S. AND CANADA. PIONEER WILL BUILD ON THEIR NORTH

AMERICAN PRODUCT OFFERINGS WITH THE ADDITION OF APPROXIMATELY 30

NEW SOYBEAN VARIETIES AND 60 NEW

®

BRAND CORN HYBRIDS. IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, PIONEER EXPECTS

CONTINUED MARKET SHARE GAINS SUPPORTED BY STRONG PRODUCT

PERFORMANCE. PIONEER ALSO EXPECTS CONTINUED MARKET SHARE GAINS

IN KEY SOYBEAN MARKETS INCLUDING THE U.S., CANADA AND BRAZIL.

THE SEGMENTS INTRODUCTION OF NEW CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS

IS PROJECTED TO DRIVE VOLUME GAINS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND

LATIN AMERICA, AND HIGHER BENEFITS FROM THE 2006 RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. HIGHER PRODUCTION AND RAW

MATERIAL COSTS AND CONTINUED GROWTH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH,

SALES AND MARKETING WILL BE MODERATING FACTORS.

WELL AS A 1 PERCENT INCREASE IN VOLUME. USD SELLING PRICES

WERE HIGHER ACROSS A MAJORITY OF THE SEGMENTS PRODUCTS.

THE INCREASE IN VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SALES

OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC.

THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN VOLUME FOR

PRODUCTS SOLD TO AUTOMOTIVE OEM PRODUCERS, PRIMARILY IN NORTH

AMERICA AND EUROPE. VOLUMES FOR SALES OF REFINISH PRODUCTS WERE

RELATIVELY FLAT AS COMPARED TO 2006.

PTOI IN 2007 OF $840 MILLION INCREASED FROM

$817 MILLION IN 2006. THE PTOI IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF HIGHER REVENUE DRIVEN BY HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES

AND BENEFITS REALIZED FROM THE 2006 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL AND TRANSPORTATION

COSTS. PTOI IN 2006 INCLUDED A NET CHARGE OF $132 MILLION

FOR RESTRUCTURING AND $30 MILLION PRIMARILY FOR ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION RELATED TO THE TRANSFORMATION PLAN THAT WAS

INITIATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2006 (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THESE CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY $142 MILLION IN INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE HURRICANE DAMAGES INCURRED IN 2005.

2006 VERSUS 2005

SALES OF

$6.3 BILLION WERE UP 4 PERCENT, REFLECTING ABOUT

2 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES FOR THE SEGMENT. AN

ADDITIONAL 2 PERCENT INCREASE FROM VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY

REALIZED IN THE PIGMENTS BUSINESS, REFLECTING STRONG GLOBAL

DEMAND AS WELL AS THE FIRST QUARTER STARTUP OF THE DELISLE,

MISSISSIPPI PLANT FOLLOWING HURRICANE KATRINA. HIGHER SELLING

PRICES REFLECTED CONCERTED EFFORTS WITHIN THE SEGMENT TO

INCREASE PRICES FOR THE MAJORITY OF ITS PRODUCTS AS PART OF ITS

EFFORTS TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND

THE IMPACT OF LOWER GLOBAL OEM AUTOMOTIVE VOLUMES.

PTOI IN 2006 OF $817 MILLION INCREASED FROM

$536 MILLION IN 2005. LOWER FIXED COSTS IN BOTH YEARS AND

HIGHER VOLUMES IN PIGMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVED 2006

EARNINGS. PTOI IN 2006 INCLUDED A NET CHARGE OF

$132 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING AND $30 MILLION

PRIMARILY FOR ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION. 2006 PTOI ALSO INCLUDED

$142 MILLION IN INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

THE HURRICANE DAMAGES SUFFERED IN 2005. 2005 PTOI INCLUDED

RESPONSE TO A LONG-TERM DECLINING DEMAND FOR THE POLYCHLOROPRENE

PRODUCTS AND THE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS AT

THE LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS CONSOLIDATING

PRODUCTION AT ITS UPGRADED LAPLACE, LOUISIANA FACILITY. ON

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY INITIATED THE SHUTDOWN,

ABATEMENT AND DISMANTLEMENT PROCESS AT THE LOUISVILLE FACILITY.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF

$34 MILLION, REFLECTING SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS FOR

APPROXIMATELY 275 EMPLOYEES. CASH PAYOUTS OF

$25 MILLION ARE LARGELY EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN 2008. ANNUAL

2007 PTOI INCREASED 12 PERCENT TO $626. 2007 PTOI

INCLUDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $165 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN A POLYESTER FILMS JOINT

VENTURE. THE IMPAIRMENT RESULTED FROM SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE RAPID RISE IN

OIL-RELATED RAW MATERIAL COSTS, WHICH HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT

ON THE PROFITABILITY ON THE VENTURES OPERATIONS IN NORTH

AMERICA AND EUROPE. PTOI IN 2006 INCLUDED A $72 RESTRUCTURING

HIGHER PRODUCTION IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008. GLOBAL PACKAGING

MARKET GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT CURRENT LEVELS. THE

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET IN NORTH AMERICA IS EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE TO BE WEAK THROUGH 2008, BUT IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE

ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. THE

2008 OUTLOOK ALSO ASSUMES A SECOND HALF SOFTENING FROM A WEAK

PETROCHEMICAL CYCLE. REVENUE GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE

THROUGH VOLUME GROWTH AND HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES IN 2008.

PTOI IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE, BENEFITTING FROM HIGHER REVENUE,

PRICE INCREASES, IMPROVED FIXED COST PERFORMANCE AND

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN INNOVATIONS FOR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES. THE

LEVEL OF EARNINGS IMPROVEMENTS IN 2008 WILL DEPEND ON OFFSETTING

THE CONTINUED HIGH INTERMEDIATE FEEDSTOCK COSTS WITH PRICE

THE PRETAX LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVENTORY, FREIGHT

AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS. PTOI IN 2007 INCLUDED LITIGATION

CHARGES FOR FORMER BUSINESSES OF $69 MILLION. PTOI IN 2006

INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $27 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN CERTAIN

SPECIALTY RESINS MANUFACTURING ASSETS TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

PTOI IN 2006 WAS A LOSS OF $173 MILLION COMPARED TO A LOSS

OF $90 MILLION IN 2005. THE LOSSES IN 2006 ARE REFLECTIVE

OF THE CONCENTRATION OF ACTIVITIES IN APPLIED BIOSCIENCES AND

INCLUDE THE $27 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN CERTAIN

SPECIALTY RESINS MANUFACTURING ASSETS TO ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

PTOI IN 2005 INCLUDED A NET GAIN OF $62 MILLION RELATED TO

THE DISPOSITION OF EQUITY AFFILIATES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH

THE TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEPARATION.

LIQUIDITY &

CAPITAL RESOURCES

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE

CASH AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET

ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL,

CAPITAL SPENDING, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND OTHER CASH NEEDS FOR THE

FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN BE

MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE

SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES, BILATERAL

CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS AND ASSET SALES.

THE COMPANYS CURRENT STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY

AND CREDIT RATINGS PROVIDE EXCELLENT ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL

MARKETS.

PURSUANT TO ITS CASH DISCIPLINE POLICY, THE COMPANY SEEKS FIRST

TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND, TO RETURN EXCESS

CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH

IS COMPELLING. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE

SECURITIES BALANCES OF $1.4 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, PROVIDE PRIMARY LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ALL SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE

ABLE TO MEET ITS SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS, THE COMPANY HAS

ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION IN CREDIT LINES WITH

SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE CREDIT LINES ARE

PRIMARILY MULTI-YEAR FACILITIES.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DEBT PORTFOLIO FOR

APPROPRIATENESS AND OCCASIONALLY MAY REBALANCE IT TO ENSURE

ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND AN OPTIMUM MATURITY DEBT SCHEDULE.

THE COMPANYS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$4.3 BILLION IN 2007, A $554 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE

$3.7 BILLION GENERATED IN 2006. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR NONCASH ITEMS. NET

INCOME FOR 2006 INCLUDED NONCASH TAX BENEFITS TOTALING

$615 MILLION (SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.) WHILE THE CHANGE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL WAS

ESSENTIALLY FLAT YEAR OVER YEAR, THE COMPANY DID REALIZE

PRODUCTIVITY GAINS IN INVENTORY DAYS SUPPLY AND DAYS PAYABLE

THE COMPANYS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$3.7 BILLION IN 2006, A $1.2 BILLION INCREASE FROM THE

$2.5 BILLION GENERATED IN 2005. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME IN 2006 AND A REDUCTION IN

CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO PENSION PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS. WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES OF

DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING AND INVENTORY DAYS SUPPLY WERE

ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN 2006 VERSUS 2005, WHILE DAYS PAYABLE

DUPONT DISAGREES WITH KOCHS PRESENTATION. THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PURCHASE AND

SALE AGREEMENT IS $70 MILLION AND IS INCLUDED IN THE

INDEMNIFICATIONS BALANCE OF $101 MILLION AT

LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND

RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN

MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE

TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL,

DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS

AND DISABILITY AND LIFE INSURANCE PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES.

APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE

BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS.

PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANYS

NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE,

THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN

THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE

EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE.

WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE

RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE

PENSION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY

ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES PAY NEAR RETIREMENT.

PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED

TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED

BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN

EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND

PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS

ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE

ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. BY LAW, NO

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2008 AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED. CONTRIBUTIONS BEYOND 2008 ARE NOT

DETERMINABLE SINCE THE AMOUNT OF ANY CONTRIBUTION IS HEAVILY

DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT

RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS. U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT

EXCEED FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED

PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS

FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE

SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT

NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND

PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS

FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. IN

2007, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $277 MILLION TO ITS PENSION

PLANS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL MAKE APPROXIMATELY

$250 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2008 TO PENSION PLANS

OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (THE ACT) WAS

SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN AUGUST 2006. THE ACT

INTRODUCES NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-EMPLOYER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING PENSION

PLAN ASSETS AND PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR FUNDING PURPOSES,

INTRODUCES BENEFIT LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN UNDERFUNDED PLANS AND

RAISES TAX DEDUCTION LIMITS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT

PLANS. THE NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE FOR

PLAN YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ACT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

ITS REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS.

IN AUGUST 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED MAJOR CHANGES TO ITS

PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND PRINCIPAL DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION PLAN. AS PART OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THE DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS FOR MOST U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE IN

TRANSITION. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED

ON THAT DATE OR THEREAFTER, AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008,

FOR ACTIVE EMPLOYEES ON THE ROLLS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE COMPANY WILL MAKE A CONTRIBUTION OF 100 PERCENT OF THE

FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION

ELECTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY WILL CONTRIBUTE

3 PERCENT OF EACH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION

REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. THE

DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION HAS ALSO BEEN EXPANDED TO BE

SIMILAR TO THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION IN THE

U.S. PENSION PLAN. COVERED FULL SERVICE EMPLOYEES ON THE

ROLLS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL ALSO ACCRUE ADDITIONAL

BENEFITS IN THE PENSION PLAN, BUT THE ANNUAL RATE OF PENSION

ACCRUAL WILL BE ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE PREVIOUS RATE. IN

ADDITION, COMPANY-PAID POSTRETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR

THESE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT CONTINUE TO GROW AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2007. COVERED EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE

U.S. AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN

THE PENSION PLAN.

AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION

PLAN, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO REMEASURE ITS PENSION EXPENSE

FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006, REFLECTING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE REMEASUREMENT DATE. AS A RESULT OF BETTER

THAN EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE

OF 6 PERCENT AS OF THE REMEASUREMENT DATE, PRETAX PENSION

EXPENSE DECREASED BY $72 MILLION FOR 2006. FOR 2007, THE

PLAN AMENDMENT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN PENSION EXPENSE OF

ABOUT $40 MILLION. FOR 2008, THE PLAN AMENDMENT IS EXPECTED

TO RESULT IN A NET

REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN COMBINED PENSION

AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS EXPENSE. THIS ESTIMATE IS

COMPOSED OF A REDUCTION IN PENSION EXPENSE OF ABOUT

$190 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION PLAN EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION.

ACTUAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE SAVINGS PLAN WILL INCREASE

LESS THAN $130 MILLION IN 2008. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

RELATED TO THESE CHANGES IN THE PLANS NOTED ABOVE IS INCLUDED IN

ON DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 158 AND

RECORDED A $1,555 MILLION AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY PRIMARILY DUE TO RECLASSIFYING

UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS RELATED TO

THE PENSION PLANS.

MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY PLANS ARE

UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM

OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRETAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL

NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE

$315 MILLION, $335 MILLION AND $408 MILLION FOR

2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE

ABOUT $315 MILLION IN 2008. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS

REFLECT THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS,

DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS

AND DEDUCTIBLES.

THE ABOVE CHARGES FOR PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR. THE

DECREASE IN PENSION EXPENSE IN 2007 REFLECTS FAVORABLE RETURNS

ON PENSION ASSETS, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS

AND DISCOUNT RATES. THE INCREASE IN 2007 OTHER LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CHARGES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS CHANGES IN

DEMOGRAPHICS, DISCOUNT RATES AND HIGHER THAN EXPECTED HEALTH

CARE COSTS. THE DECREASE IN PENSION EXPENSE IN 2006 REFLECTS

FAVORABLE RETURNS ON PENSION ASSETS, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES

IN DISCOUNT RATES. THE DECREASE IN 2006 OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT CHARGES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE MEDICAL

TRENDS IN 2005 AND REFINEMENTS IN ESTIMATES TO REFLECT THE

ANTICIPATED COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

PROGRAM.

THE COMPANYS KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS

PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND

THE DISCOUNT RATE (SEE NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2008, LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED MEDICAL

TRENDS, THE NET IMPACT OF THE U.S. RETIREMENT PLAN

AMENDMENTS, CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND DISCOUNT RATES, AND THE

EXPIRATION OF A PRIOR SERVICE COST AMORTIZATION CREDIT IN 2007

ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN PENSION AND OTHER

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PRETAX EXPENSES OF ABOUT

$170 MILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

DUPONT OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, PRODUCT HANDLING AND

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT

ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, DUPONT IMPLEMENTS VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS

TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, ELIMINATE THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS

WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WASTE WATER DISCHARGES, INCREASE

THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF

PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS. THE COSTS TO

COMPLY WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL

AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND

WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WHILE THESE COSTS MAY

INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRETAX ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS

TOTALED $576 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED WITH

$521 MILLION IN 2006 AND $468 MILLION IN 2005. THESE

EXPENSES INCLUDE THE REMEDIATION ACCRUALS DISCUSSED BELOW;

OPERATING, MAINTENANCE AND DEPRECIATION COSTS FOR SOLID WASTE,

AIR AND WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES AND THE COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. WHILE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT

COMPONENT OF THE COMPANYS OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THESE COSTS TO BECOME PROPORTIONALLY GREATER

AS THE COMPANY INCREASES ITS PARTICIPATION IN BUSINESSES FOR

WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE REQUIRED DURING PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. THE LARGEST OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES IN 2007

WAS $113 MILLION FOR THE OPERATION OF WATER POLLUTION

CONTROL FACILITIES AND $131 MILLION FOR SOLID WASTE

MANAGEMENT. ABOUT 78 PERCENT OF TOTAL ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENSES RESULTED FROM OPERATIONS IN THE U.S.

IN 2007, DUPONT SPENT APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION ON

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR

NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANYS INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL

GOALS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$150 MILLION IN 2008. IN THE U.S., SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE

FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND

HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA).

UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN,

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING FUTURE ESTIMATES

FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL CAA CAPITAL COSTS OVER THE NEXT

TWO YEARS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO RANGE FROM $40 MILLION

TO $70 MILLION.

THE GOAL OF THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) IS TO

PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISKS OF INJURY TO HEALTH OR THE

ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURE, PROCESSING,

DISTRIBUTION IN COMMERCE, USE, OR DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL

SUBSTANCES. UNDER TSCA, THE EPA HAS ESTABLISHED REPORTING,

RECORD-KEEPING, TESTING AND CONTROL-RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW

AND EXISTING CHEMICALS. IN 1998, THE EPA CHALLENGED THE

U.S. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TO VOLUNTARILY CONDUCT SCREENING

LEVEL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING ON NEARLY 3,000

HIGH PRODUCTION VOLUME (HPV) CHEMICALS OR TO MAKE EQUIVALENT

INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AN HPV CHEMICAL IS A CHEMICAL

LISTED ON THE 1990 INVENTORY UPDATE RULE WITH ANNUAL

U.S. CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS OF ONE MILLION

POUNDS OR MORE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE ITS COMMITMENTS

REGARDING THE HPV CHEMICALS IT VOLUNTEERED TO SPONSOR WITHIN THE

NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS.

IN DECEMBER 2006, THE EUROPEAN UNION ADOPTED A NEW REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK CONCERNING THE REGISTRATION, EVALUATION AND

AUTHORIZATION OF CHEMICALS. THIS REGULATORY FRAMEWORK KNOWN AS

REACH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON JUNE 1, 2007. ONE OF ITS MAIN

OBJECTIVES IS THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

ENVIRONMENT. REACH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS TO

GATHER INFORMATION ON THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR SUBSTANCES THAT

MEET CERTAIN VOLUME OR TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA AND REGISTER THE

INFORMATION IN A CENTRAL DATABASE TO BE MAINTAINED BY A CHEMICAL

AGENCY IN FINLAND. THE REGULATION ALSO CALLS FOR THE PROGRESSIVE

SUBSTITUTION OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CHEMICALS WHEN SUITABLE

ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. PRE-REGISTRATION WILL OCCUR

BETWEEN JUNE 1, 2008 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2008; COMPLETE

REGISTRATIONS CONTAINING EXTENSIVE DATA ON THE CHARACTERISTICS

OF THE CHEMICAL WILL BE REQUIRED IN 2010 IF PRODUCTION USAGE OR

TONNAGE EXCEEDS 1,000 METRIC TONS PER YEAR; 2013 IF IT IS

BETWEEN 100 AND 1,000 METRIC TONS PER YEAR; AND 2018 IF IT IS

100 METRIC TONS PER YEAR OR LESS. BY JUNE 1, 2013, THE

COMMISSION WILL REVIEW WHETHER SUBSTANCES WITH ENDOCRINE

DISRUPTIVE PROPERTIES SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED IF SAFER ALTERNATIVES

EXIST. BY JUNE 1, 2019, THE COMMISSION WILL DETERMINE

WHETHER TO EXTEND THE DUTY TO WARN FROM SUBSTANCES OF VERY HIGH

CONCERN TO THOSE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS OR UNPLEASANT.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH REACH

WILL BE MATERIAL TO ITS OPERATIONS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION.

DUPONT BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE

THAT WILL PRESENT NUMEROUS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BUSINESS

AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. SINCE THE EARLY 1990S WHEN DUPONT BEGAN

TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, THE COMPANY

HAS ACHIEVED MAJOR GLOBAL REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS. VOLUNTARY

EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY DUPONT AND OTHER COMPANIES

ARE VALUABLE BUT ALONE WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO EFFECTIVELY

ADDRESS A PROBLEM OF THIS SCALE. THE KYOTO PROTOCOL TO THE

UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE ENTERED

INTO FORCE IN FEBRUARY 2005 AND, WHILE NOT RATIFIED BY THE U.S.,

HAS SPURRED POLICY ACTION BY MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND REGIONS

AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION. CONSIDERABLE

INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION IS NOW FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT OF A

POST-2012 INTERNATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE INTERNATIONAL

ACTION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN THE KYOTO PROTOCOL EXPIRES

IN 2012. PROPOSED AND EXISTING LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CONTROL OR

LIMIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS

ENERGY SOURCE AND SUPPLY CHOICES AS WELL AS INCREASE THE COST OF

ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM FOSSIL FUELS. HOWEVER, THE

SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SENSIBLE NATIONAL,

42

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

REGIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES COULD

PROVIDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THE

REGULATORY FUTURE, HELP GUIDE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND DRIVE

GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR LOW-CARBON AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS,

TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES.

THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES THE POTENTIAL RISKS THAT CLIMATE

CHANGE COULD PRESENT, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS PHYSICAL ASSETS, AS WELL AS WITH REGULATORY AND

ECONOMIC ISSUES. DUPONT LOOKS FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE ITS

OVERALL PORTFOLIO LESS ENERGY INTENSIVE, AND ENERGY USE IS ONE

FACTOR THAT IS WEIGHED WHEN INVESTMENTS OR DIVESTITURES ARE

CONSIDERED. DUPONT IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET

MORE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEET NEW AND EXPANDED DEMANDS OF A

LOW-CARBON ECONOMY.

DUPONT HAS DISCOVERED THAT VERY LOW LEVELS OF DIOXINS (PARTS PER

TRILLION TO LOW PARTS PER BILLION) AND RELATED COMPOUNDS ARE

INADVERTENTLY GENERATED DURING ITS TITANIUM DIOXIDE PIGMENT

PRODUCTION PROCESS. OVER 99 PERCENT OF THE DIOXIN GENERATED

AT DUPONTS PRODUCTION PLANTS BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH

PROCESS SOLID WASTES THAT ARE DISPOSED IN CONTROLLED LANDFILLS

WHERE PUBLIC EXPOSURE IS NEGLIGIBLE. A MULTI-YEAR RESEARCH AND

PROCESS ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HAS CULMINATED IN

CAPITAL PROJECTS AND OTHER PROCESS MODIFICATIONS INTENDED TO

REDUCE DIOXIN GENERATION BY AT LEAST 90 PERCENT. THE LAST

OF THESE PROJECTS AND PROCESS MODIFICATIONS WERE COMPLETED

DURING 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS HAD RESULTS VERIFYING THE CAPABILITY TO REDUCE DIOXIN

GENERATION BY 90 PERCENT.

REMEDIATION

EXPENDITURES

THE RCRA EXTENSIVELY REGULATES AND REQUIRES PERMITS FOR THE

TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. RCRA

REQUIRES THAT PERMITTED FACILITIES UNDERTAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT THE FACILITY. IF CONDITIONS

WARRANT, COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION

CAUSED BY PRIOR OPERATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO CERCLA, THE COSTS OF

THE RCRA CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY BORNE SOLELY BY

THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT SIGNIFICANT ONGOING

EXPENDITURES FOR RCRA REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES MAY BE REQUIRED

OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEAR

TERM, HOWEVER, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE

RANGE OF SUCH EXPENDITURES EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE

UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANYS

EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION

ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $47 MILLION, $44 MILLION

AND $49 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

OR NOTICES OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM THE EPA AND STATE

ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IS A PRP UNDER

CERCLA OR SIMILAR STATE STATUTES. CERCLA IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS

THE SUPERFUND AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN

INVESTIGATIVE AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE IT CONDUCTS

OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR WHERE COMPANY GENERATED WASTE

HAS BEEN DISPOSED. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO, ON OCCASION, BEEN

ENGAGED IN COST RECOVERY LITIGATION INITIATED BY THOSE AGENCIES

OR BY PRIVATE PARTIES. THESE REQUESTS, NOTICES AND LAWSUITS

ASSERT POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT VARIOUS

SITES THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT COMPANY OWNED, BUT ALLEGEDLY

CONTAIN WASTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS PAST

OPERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF

POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA OR STATE LAWS AT 383 SITES

AROUND THE U.S., WITH ACTIVE REMEDIATION UNDER WAY AT 139 OF

THESE SITES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED ITS LIABILITY

AT 161 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER

PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS WITH

OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANYS, REPRESENTED

ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE

COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT SIX NEW SITES

DURING 2007 COMPARED WITH SIX SIMILAR NOTICES IN 2006 AND EIGHT

IN 2005. THE COMPANYS EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH CERCLA

AND SIMILAR STATE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY

$20 MILLION, $19 MILLION AND $27 MILLION IN 2007,

2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR NEARLY ALL SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL

LIABILITY WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TOTAL SITE

REMEDIATION COSTS BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF WASTE ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE COMPANY VERSUS THAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALL OTHER PRPS IS

RELATIVELY LOW. OTHER PRPS AT SITES, WHERE THE COMPANY IS A

PARTY, TYPICALLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO MEET THEIR

OBLIGATIONS AND, WHERE THEY DO NOT, OR WHERE PRPS CANNOT BE

LOCATED, THE COMPANYS OWN SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS NOT

MATERIALLY INCREASED. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW SITES WHERE THE

COMPANY IS A MAJOR PARTICIPANT AND THE COST TO THE

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANY.

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

UNDER CERCLA, RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS WERE $68 MILLION,

$64 MILLION AND $79 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY.

REMEDIATION

ACCRUALS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

INCLUDED AN ACCRUED LIABILITY OF $357 MILLION COMPARED TO

$349 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. CONSIDERABLE

UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL

LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. OF THE $357 MILLION ACCRUED

LIABILITY, APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT WAS RESERVED FOR

NON-U.S. FACILITIES.

APPROXIMATELY 65 PERCENT OF THE RESERVE BALANCE WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION LIABILITIES, WHILE

ABOUT 25 PERCENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERCLA LIABILITIES.

REMEDIATION ACCRUALS OF $76 MILLION, $71 MILLION AND

$64 MILLION WERE ADDED TO THE RESERVE IN 2007, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY.

PFOA

DUPONT MANUFACTURES FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AS WELL

AS FLUOROTELOMERS, MARKETING MANY OF THEM UNDER THE

TEFLON

®

AND

ZONYL

®

BRANDS. THE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS BUSINESSES ARE

PART OF THE ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES

SEGMENT; THE FLUOROTELOMERS BUSINESS IS PART OF THE

SAFETY & PROTECTION SEGMENT.

FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS ARE HIGH-PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS WITH MANY END USES INCLUDING ARCHITECTURAL FABRICS,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONIC WIRING INSULATION, AUTOMOTIVE

FUEL SYSTEMS, COMPUTER CHIP PROCESSING EQUIPMENT,

WEATHER-RESISTANT/BREATHABLE APPAREL AND NON-STICK COOKWARE.

FLUOROTELOMERS ARE USED TO MAKE SOIL, STAIN AND GREASE

REPELLANTS FOR PAPER, APPAREL, UPHOLSTERY AND CARPETS AS WELL AS

FIREFIGHTING FOAMS AND COATINGS.

A FORM OF PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS

SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT) IS USED AS A PROCESSING

AGENT TO MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS. FOR

OVER 50 YEARS, DUPONT PURCHASED ITS PFOA NEEDS FROM A THIRD

PARTY, BUT BEGINNING IN THE FALL OF 2002, IT BEGAN PRODUCING

PFOA TO SUPPORT THE MANUFACTURE OF FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND

DISPERSIONS. PFOA IS NOT USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF

FLUOROTELOMERS; HOWEVER, IT IS AN UNINTENDED BY-PRODUCT PRESENT

AT TRACE LEVELS IN SOME FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS.

DUPONT PERFORMANCE ELASTOMERS, LLC (DPE) USES PFOA IN THE

MANUFACTURE OF RAW MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURE

KALREZ

®

PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS. PFOA IS ALSO USED IN THE MANUFACTURE

OF SOME FLUOROELASTOMERS MARKETED BY DPE UNDER THE

VITON

®

TRADEMARK. THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY IS A PART OF THE

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT.

PFOA IS BIO-PERSISTENT AND HAS BEEN DETECTED AT VERY LOW LEVELS

IN THE BLOOD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. AS A RESULT, THE EPA

INITIATED A PROCESS TO ENHANCE ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOURCES

OF PFOA IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH HUMAN

EXPOSURE TO PFOA IS OCCURRING. IN 2003, THE EPA ISSUED A

PRELIMINARY RISK ASSESSMENT ON PFOA THAT FOCUSES ON THE EXPOSURE

OF THE U.S. GENERAL POPULATION TO PFOA AND POSSIBLE HEALTH

EFFECTS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY CONCERNS. ON

JANUARY 12, 2005, THE EPA ISSUED A DRAFT RISK ASSESSMENT ON

PFOA. THE DRAFT STATED THAT CANCER DATA FOR PFOA MAY BE BEST

DESCRIBED AS SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE OF CARCINOGENICITY, BUT

NOT SUFFICIENT TO ASSESS HUMAN CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL

UNDER THE EPAS GUIDELINES FOR CARCINOGEN RISK ASSESSMENT.

UNDER THE GUIDELINES, THE DESCRIPTOR SUGGESTIVE IS

TYPICALLY APPLIED TO AGENTS IF ANIMAL TESTING FINDS ANY EVIDENCE

THAT EXPOSURE CAUSES TUMORS IN ONE SPECIES OF ANIMAL.

THE EPA REQUESTED THAT THE SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD (SAB) REVIEW

AND COMMENT ON THE SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS OF THIS ASSESSMENT. ON

MAY 31, 2006, THE SAB RELEASED ITS REPORT SETTING FORTH THE

VIEW, BASED ON LABORATORY STUDIES IN RATS, THAT THE HUMAN

CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL OF PFOA IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE

EPAS DESCRIPTOR OF LIKELY TO BE CARCINOGENIC

AS DEFINED IN THE GUIDELINES FOR CARCINOGEN RISK ASSESSMENT.

HOWEVER, IN ITS REPORT THE SAB INDICATED THAT ADDITIONAL DATA

SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE THE EPA FINALIZES ITS RISK

ASSESSMENT OF PFOA. UNDER THE GUIDELINES THE LIKELY

DESCRIPTOR IS TYPICALLY APPLIED TO AGENTS THAT HAVE TESTED

POSITIVE IN MORE THAN ONE SPECIES, SEX, STRAIN, SITE OR EXPOSURE

ROUTE WITH OR WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF CARCINOGENICITY IN HUMANS. THE

EPA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER ADDITIONAL DATA,

INCLUDING NEW RESEARCH AND TESTING, AND HAS INDICATED THAT

ANOTHER SAB REVIEW WILL BE SOUGHT AFTER THE EPA MAKES ITS RISK

ASSESSMENT. DUPONT DISPUTES THE CANCER CLASSIFICATION

RECOMMENDED IN THE

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

SAB REPORT. THE EPA HAS STATED THAT IT IS PREMATURE TO DRAW ANY

CONCLUSIONS ON THE POTENTIAL RISKS, INCLUDING CANCER, FROM PFOA

UNTIL THE ADDITIONAL DATA ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE RISK

ASSESSMENT. ALTHOUGH THE EPA HAS STATED THAT THERE REMAINS

CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY REGARDING POTENTIAL RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA, IT ALSO STATED THAT IT DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT THERE IS ANY REASON FOR CONSUMERS TO STOP USING ANY

PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT PFOA.

DUPONT RESPECTS THE EPAS POSITION RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT

EXPOSURE ROUTES AND THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF PFOA AND DUPONT

AND OTHER COMPANIES HAVE OUTLINED PLANS TO CONTINUE RESEARCH,

EMISSION REDUCTION AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES TO HELP

ADDRESS THE EPAS QUESTIONS. IN JANUARY 2006, DUPONT

PLEDGED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE EPAS

2010/15

PFOA

STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. THE EPA PROGRAM ASKS PARTICIPANTS

(1) TO COMMIT TO ACHIEVE, NO LATER THAN 2010, A

95 PERCENT REDUCTION IN BOTH FACILITY EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT

CONTENT LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER

HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS AND (2) TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE

ELIMINATION OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER

HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY NO LATER THAN

2015. IN OCTOBER 2007, (FOR THE YEAR 2006), DUPONT REPORTED TO

THE EPA THAT IT HAD ACHIEVED AN ALMOST 98 PERCENT REDUCTION

OF PFOA EMISSIONS IN U.S. MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. ABOUT A

95 PERCENT REDUCTION WAS ACHIEVED IN GLOBAL MANUFACTURING

EMISSIONS, MEETING THE EPA 2010 OBJECTIVE WELL AHEAD OF THE

TIMELINE. DUPONT WILL WORK INDIVIDUALLY AND WITH OTHERS IN THE

INDUSTRY TO INFORM EPAS REGULATORY COUNTERPARTS IN THE

EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA, CHINA AND JAPAN ABOUT THESE ACTIVITIES

AND PFOA IN GENERAL, INCLUDING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM

DUPONTS FACILITIES, REFORMULATION OF THE COMPANYS

FLUOROPOLYMER DISPERSIONS AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES FOR

FLUOROTELOMERS PRODUCTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATE

THE NEED TO MAKE, USE OR BUY PFOA BY 2015. DUPONT HAS DISCOVERED

TECHNOLOGY THAT SHOULD ENABLE THE ELIMINATION OF PFOA USE IN

FLUOROPOLYMER PRODUCTION. COMMERCIAL SCALE QUANTITIES OF SOME

FLUOROPOLYMER PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT PFOA AND CUSTOMERS

WERE NOTIFIED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2007 THAT THESE PRODUCTS

WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR TESTING IN THEIR PROCESSES IN 2008. ALSO,

DUPONT IS DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF FLUOROTELOMER

PRODUCTS AND ALREADY INTRODUCED TWO OF THEM IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER 2007.

IN THE MEANTIME, DUPONT HAS DEVELOPED

ECHELON

TM

TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN REDUCE THE PFOA CONTENT IN FLUOROPOLYMER

DISPERSIONS BY 97 PERCENT. THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY

CONVERTED 90 PERCENT OF ITS PRODUCT LINE BY VOLUME TO

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES BASED ON

ECHELON

TM.

DUPONT ALSO HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZED A NEW, PATENTED

MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO REMOVE GREATER THAN 97 PERCENT OF

TRACE BY-PRODUCT LEVELS OF PFOA, ITS HOMOLOGUES AND DIRECT

PRECURSORS FROM ITS FLUOROTELOMER PRODUCTS. THE NEW PRODUCTS ARE

BEING MARKETED AS LX

PLATFORM

TM

PRODUCTS.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, DUPONT ENTERED INTO AN ORDER ON CONSENT UNDER

THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA) WITH THE EPA ESTABLISHING A

PRECAUTIONARY INTERIM SCREENING LEVEL FOR PFOA OF 0.5 PART PER

BILLION (PPB) IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE AREA AROUND THE

WASHINGTON WORKS SITE LOCATED IN PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA.

DUPONT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE AGREEMENT TO OFFER TO INSTALL WATER

TREATMENT SYSTEMS OR AN EPA-APPROVED ALTERNATIVE IF PFOA LEVELS

ARE DETECTED AT OR ABOVE 0.5 PPB.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION (NJDEP) IDENTIFIED A PRELIMINARY DRINKING-WATER

GUIDANCE LEVEL FOR PFOA OF 0.04 PPB AS PART OF THE FIRST PHASE

OF AN ONGOING PROCESS TO ESTABLISH A STATE DRINKING-WATER

STANDARD. WHILE THE NJDEP WILL CONTINUE SAMPLING AND EVALUATION

OF DATA FROM ALL SOURCES, IT HAS NOT RECOMMENDED A CHANGE IN

CONSUMPTION PATTERNS.

WHILE OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO PFOA HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH

SMALL INCREASES IN SOME LIPIDS (E.G. CHOLESTEROL), IT IS NOT

KNOWN WHETHER THESE ARE CAUSAL ASSOCIATIONS. THESE ASSOCIATIONS

WERE NOT OBSERVED IN A COMMUNITY STUDY. BASED ON HEALTH AND

TOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES, DUPONT BELIEVES THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE

INDICATES THAT PFOA EXPOSURE DOES NOT POSE A HEALTH RISK TO THE

GENERAL PUBLIC. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS KNOWN

TO BE CAUSED BY PFOA, ALTHOUGH STUDY OF THE CHEMICAL CONTINUES.

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO REGULATORY ACTIONS PENDING THAT WOULD

PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION OR USE OF PFOA. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THERE

CONTINUES TO BE REGULATORY INTEREST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT THE EPA OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY ENTITY WILL NOT CHOOSE TO

REGULATE OR PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION OR USE OF PFOA IN THE

FUTURE. PRODUCTS CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY

REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF 2007 REVENUES

COULD BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH REGULATION OR PROHIBITION. DUPONT

HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN PFOA

ENVIRONMENTAL AND LITIGATION MATTERS (SEE NOTE 19 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

UNDER PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST

RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

PETROCHEMICAL AND PETROLEUM COMPANIES AND EXCHANGES.

THE COMPANY HEDGES FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES AND CERTAIN ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE TRADED AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY

DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE EXPOSURES RELEVANT TO AGRICULTURAL

FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES.

CONCENTRATION

OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF

CASH, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DERIVATIVES.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT

CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF

THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS

ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT

SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT- AND

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY

DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR

AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANYS SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A

SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE

REPRESENTED MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS

RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC,

INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING

AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT

CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY

INDUSTRY AND REGION.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS VOLATILITY

ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS

EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

COMMITMENTS.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET

ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS

OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING

PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING

FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE

MINIMIZED.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE USD AMOUNT OF FUTURE

FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. DECISIONS

REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON

A

CASE-BY-CASE

EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO MANAGE

NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE

FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST RATE

RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE

MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING

RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT

INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR. INTEREST RATE SWAPS

ALLOW THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE

DEBT.

COMMODITY

PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES.

A PORTION OF ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES ARE HEDGED TO REDUCE

PRICE VOLATILITY USING FIXED PRICE SWAPS AND OPTIONS. HEDGED

FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES INCLUDE NATURAL GAS AND ETHANE.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS TO PRODUCE

FINISHED SEED INVENTORY. UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, GROWERS ARE

COMPENSATED WITH BUSHEL EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE MARKETED TO THE

COMPANY FOR THE MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

FOLLOWING HARVEST. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMODITY

FUTURES THAT HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING

COMMODITY, ARE USED TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK INVOLVED

IN COMPENSATING GROWERS.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY FUTURES TO MANAGE

THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF SOYBEAN MEAL. THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY

EXPOSURE AND ARE DEEMED EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING SOYBEAN MEAL

FEEDSTOCK PRICE RISK.

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, AND THE

EFFECT ON FAIR VALUES OF A HYPOTHETICAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE

MARKET PRICES OR RATES THAT EXISTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2007

AND 2006. THE SENSITIVITY FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS BASED ON A

ONE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE MARKET INTEREST RATE. FOREIGN

CURRENCY, AGRICULTURAL AND ENERGY DERIVATIVE SENSITIVITIES ARE

BASED ON A 10 PERCENT CHANGE IN MARKET RATES.

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA (GAAP) AND ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT

FAIRLY THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME

AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE

COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM,

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO

EXPRESS AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THEIR

REPORT IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN

ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

DEFINED IN

RULES 13A-15(F)

AND

15D-15(F)

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED

TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

I.

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE

DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

II.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND

THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

III.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITIONS, USE OR DISPOSITION OF

THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING HAS CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY NOT PREVENT

OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AND

BUSINESS PRACTICES MAY CAUSE VARIATION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS.

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND

THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME,

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT DE

NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR

OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)

(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION,

THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY

THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE,

FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN

MANAGEMENTS REPORTS ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

APPEARING ON

PAGE F-2.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AND ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED

ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOMES TAXES IN 2007.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

1.

SUMMARY OF

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DUPONT FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT

FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES

AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

ACCOUNTING

CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF

SFAS 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES,

(SFAS 109) BY DEFINING CRITERIA THAT AN INDIVIDUAL

INCOME TAX POSITION MUST MEET FOR ANY PART OF THE BENEFIT OF

THAT POSITION TO BE RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON MEASUREMENT, DERECOGNITION,

CLASSIFICATION, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES,

ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS, DISCLOSURE, AND TRANSITION. UPON

ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $116 REDUCTION IN THE

PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND A CORRESPONDING $116 INCREASE

IN REINVESTED EARNINGS AT JANUARY 1, 2007 (SEE NOTE 6).

BASIS OF

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS

MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE) FOR WHICH DUPONT

IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

IN WHICH THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN

100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS INTERESTS ARE

SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A

CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS. THIS

INCLUDES MAJORITY-OWNED ENTITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE A MINORITY INVESTOR HOLDS SUBSTANTIVE

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE

COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY

THE COST METHOD. GAINS OR LOSSES ARISING FROM ISSUANCES BY AN

AFFILIATE OR A SUBSIDIARY OF ITS OWN STOCK ARE RECORDED AS

NONOPERATING ITEMS.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS

COMPLETE. THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE FROM THE SALE OF A

WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND

THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS RECOGNIZED UPON

DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED,

COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND PRICING IS FIXED OR

DETERMINABLE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD FOB (FREE

ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO

NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS,

AN EQUIVALENT BASIS. ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND

OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE. THE

COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN

SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS

SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING

FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY

FOR THE DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD

AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME

STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED

FROM NET SALES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH

CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT AND

RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE

PERIODS. THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE

AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE

PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE,

OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.

LICENSING AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED,

THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS

REASONABLY ASSURED.

E. I. DU PONT DE

NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS

IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST

PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF

THE SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN

SECURITIES

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND

FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF TWELVE

MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED COST.

OTHER ASSETS INCLUDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, WHICH

COMPRISE INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY

AVAILABLE (COST INVESTMENTS) AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

THAT ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE (SEE NOTE 13).

INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT

COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE

LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD; IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH VALUATIONS ARE

NOT IN EXCESS OF MARKET. SEED INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE

LOWER OF COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD, OR MARKET.

ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT

LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED

AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) IS CARRIED AT COST AND

IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PP&E PLACED

IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED UNDER THE

SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY

SIMILAR METHODS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE

DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 15 TO 25 YEARS.

CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR

INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 5 TO

7 YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR

OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND

INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS

AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED

MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANYS

FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF

AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AN

ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR

ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE

TECHNIQUES. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD

AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED AND LICENSED

TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 5 TO

20 YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE

REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE

ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO

BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING

VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE

TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH ASSET ARE

SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN

THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANYS FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET

PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS

MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD FOR USE UNTIL THEIR DISPOSAL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE

DISPOSED BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE

REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR MARKET VALUE

LESS COST TO SELL AND DEPRECIATION IS DISCONTINUED.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING

EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES

AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE

UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR

PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE,

THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE

AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS

RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED

RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS

RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE

CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED

ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE

OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO

20 YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION

MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS

OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE

PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR

REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS COMPENSATION, VEHICLE

LIABILITY AND EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL

CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF

INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS

OF RELEVANT RISKS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND

LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS

APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES

EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME

TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT

YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED

TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX

BASES OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE

ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE

ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT

WILL NOT BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES

ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT

FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY

INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED

RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN

MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND

EXPENSES-NET,

UNDER OTHER INCOME, NET. INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE

INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES FROM FUTURE COMPLETED TAX EXAMINATIONS

COULD BE SIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, HOWEVER DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF THESE AUDITS AND THE

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASE

OR DECREASE THAT MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT

BE MADE.

THE U.S. DOLLAR (USD) IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF MOST OF

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET

AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD

EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN

CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE

RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO

BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES.

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES

ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD, AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES AND THE

RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR

RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE

REMEASURED INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD

AND THE RESULTANT EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN

INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES

ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT

DURING THE PERIOD.

ENTITIES (VIES)

THE COMPANY CONSOLIDATES VIES WHERE DUPONT IS CONSIDERED THE

PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE NOT MATERIAL TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE VIES

FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.

FUTURE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THESE VIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE

COMPANY BECOMES THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE OTHER VIES ARE

IMMATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME (LOSS) OF

THESE VIES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET, IN THE CONSOLIDATED

INCOME STATEMENTS AND IS NOT MATERIAL.

HEDGING AND

TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET ON THE

INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW

HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS

CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE HEDGED

ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM

COMMITMENT OR AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO

THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES

REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION

MATURES, OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE

MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH

TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE

THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AND THE DERIVATIVE IS

RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS

A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR

TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER

LIKELY TO OCCUR.

CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EITHER

FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME

CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. CASH

FLOWS FROM ALL OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY

REPORTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 23 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

REGARDING THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR

ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, (SFAS 157) WHICH ADDRESSES HOW

COMPANIES SHOULD MEASURE FAIR VALUE WHEN REQUIRED FOR

RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES UNDER GAAP. THE

STANDARDS PROVISIONS WILL BE APPLIED TO EXISTING

ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES THAT ARE BASED

ON FAIR VALUE. SFAS 157 DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARD APPLIES A COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR

VALUE TO BE USED THROUGHOUT GAAP, WITH EMPHASIS ON FAIR VALUE AS

A MARKET-BASED MEASUREMENT VERSUS AN ENTITY-SPECIFIC

MEASUREMENT AND ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT METHODS. THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPANDED TO

INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COMPANIES USE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR

VALUE AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON EARNINGS.

SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER

NOVEMBER 15, 2007. THE NEW STANDARDS PROVISIONS

APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008. THE FASB, ON FEBRUARY 12,

2008, ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP)

FAS 157-2.

THIS FSP PERMITS A DELAY IN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS 157

TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2008, FOR

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR

ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY).

THE DELAY IS INTENDED TO ALLOW THE BOARD AND CONSTITUENTS

ADDITIONAL TIME TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS IMPLEMENTATION

ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN, OR THAT MAY ARISE, FROM THE APPLICATION

OF SFAS 157. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP

FAS 157-1

TO EXCLUDE SFAS 13, ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES, AND ITS RELATED

INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE SCOPE OF

SFAS 157. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 157 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141 (REVISED

2007) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (SFAS 141R)

WHICH REPLACES FASB STATEMENT NO. 141. SFAS 141R

ADDRESSES THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS

ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED, AND NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. SFAS 141R ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE

THAT ENABLES USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO BETTER

EVALUATE THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL EFFECT OF BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS. SFAS 141R APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS FOR WHICH THE ACQUISITION DATE IS ON OR AFTER THE

BEGINNING OF THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING ON OR

AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. SFAS 141R WILL BE ADOPTED BY

THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH

BULLETIN NO. 51 (SFAS 160) WHICH

CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS AND

FOR THE DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT

A THIRD-PARTY, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN A CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY IS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY

THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS EQUITY IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. SFAS 160 ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE THAT CLEARLY

IDENTIFIES AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF THE PARENT

AND THE INTERESTS OF THE NON-CONTROLLING OWNERS. SFAS 160

IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2008. SFAS 160 WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE

IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATES, DEDUCTIONS OR CREDITS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY UTILIZED

FOR TAX PURPOSES DURING THE CURRENT YEAR MAY BE CARRIED FORWARD

INCOME OR TAXES PAYABLE IN FUTURE OR PRIOR YEARS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH

CARRYFORWARDS/BACKS, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE APPROXIMATED

$1,415. OF THIS AMOUNT, $1,206 HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE, $20

EXPIRES AFTER 2007 BUT BEFORE THE END OF 2012 AND $189 EXPIRES

AFTER 2012.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TOTALING $9,644 WERE DEEMED TO BE

PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. NO DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY HAS BEEN

RECOGNIZED WITH REGARD TO THE REMITTANCE OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS

NOT PRACTICAL TO ESTIMATE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE

INCURRED IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE REMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES.

EACH YEAR THE COMPANY FILES HUNDREDS OF INCOME TAX RETURNS IN

THE VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXING

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE

SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND POSSIBLE CHALLENGE BY THE TAXING

AUTHORITIES. POSITIONS CHALLENGED BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES MAY

BE SETTLED OR APPEALED BY THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES (SFAS 109). IN

2006, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 48, WHICH CLARIFIES THE

APPLICATION OF SFAS 109 BY DEFINING CRITERIA THAT AN

INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX POSITION MUST MEET FOR ANY PART OF THE

BENEFIT OF THAT POSITION TO BE RECOGNIZED IN AN

ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON

MEASUREMENT, DERECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, ACCOUNTING FOR

INTEREST AND PENALTIES, ACCOUNTING IN INTERIM PERIODS,

DISCLOSURE, AND TRANSITION.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED FIN 48 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007. THIS

RESULTED IN A $116 REDUCTION IN THE PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED

LIABILITIES AND A CORRESPONDING $116 INCREASE IN REINVESTED

EARNINGS AT JANUARY 1, 2007. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

FIN 48, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $825. OF THE $825 OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, $443 RELATES TO TAX POSITIONS, WHICH

IF RECOGNIZED WOULD

WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO

TAX EXAMINATIONS BY TAX AUTHORITIES FOR YEARS BEFORE 1999. IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT, HOWEVER DUE TO

THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF AUDITS AND

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF INCREASES

HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, THE COMPANY

HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES

THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS AND

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO

ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY

INDEFINITE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY

ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST

EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW, AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED

AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE

JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED

PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS

A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE

INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE

INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE

PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS RECORDED

FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006

WAS $101 AND $105, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO

THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF

LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE

PROVISIONS EXIST.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF INVISTA, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED

THE PURCHASERS, SUBSIDIARIES OF KOCH, AGAINST CERTAIN

LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES, LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES UNDER THE

PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. KOCH HAS PRESENTED CLAIMS UNDER

THESE INDEMNITIES WHICH THE COMPANIES ARE DISCUSSING; HOWEVER,

DUPONT DISAGREES WITH KOCHS PRESENTATION. THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PURCHASE AND

SALE AGREEMENT IS $70 AND IS INCLUDED IN THE INDEMNIFICATIONS

BALANCE OF $101 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE FAIR VALUE WAS

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE EXPECTED

TO BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE THE INDEMNIFICATIONS IN A STANDALONE,

ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY AND, WHERE

APPROPRIATE, BY THE UTILIZATION OF PROBABILITY WEIGHTED

DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW MODELS. UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS TOTAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION

FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CAN NOT

EXCEED $1,400. THE OTHER INDEMNITIES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS

LIMIT.

OBLIGATIONS FOR

EQUITY AFFILIATES & OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS

UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY

AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER AFFILIATED AND

UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY

HAD DIRECTLY GUARANTEED $583 OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND $121

RELATING TO GUARANTEES OF HISTORICAL OBLIGATIONS FOR DIVESTED

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM

POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE

COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED

OPERATING LEASE PROGRAM RELATING TO SHORT-LIVED EQUIPMENT. IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS MASTER OPERATING LEASE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY

HAD RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $104 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE GUARANTEE AMOUNTS ARE TIED TO THE

UNAMORTIZED LEASE VALUES OF THE ASSETS UNDER THE PROGRAM AND ARE

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WERE NINE CASES PENDING IN

BENLATE

CAUSED CROP DAMAGE. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE COURTS 2006

DISMISSAL OF ONE OF THE NINE CASES FOR FAILURE TO PROSECUTE. TWO

OF THE NINE CASES, INVOLVING TWENTY-SEVEN COSTA RICAN FERN

GROWERS, WERE TRIED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 RESULTING

IN A $56 JUDGMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY, WHICH WAS REDUCED TO $24

ON DUPONTS MOTION. AT TRIAL, THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT DAMAGES

IN THE RANGE OF $270 TO $400. THE PLAINTIFFS AND DUPONT HAVE

APPEALED THE VERDICT. DUPONT BELIEVES THAT THE APPEAL WILL BE

RESOLVED IN ITS FAVOR AND, THEREFORE, HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A

RESERVE RELATING TO THE JUDGMENT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WAS ONE CASE PENDING IN FLORIDA

AND ONE IN HAWAII IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO REOPEN

SETTLEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY BY ALLEGING THAT IT COMMITTED FRAUD

AND MISCONDUCT, AS WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE

RACKETEERING LAWS. IN OCTOBER 2007, THE APPEALS COURT ENTERED AN

ORDER PRECLUDING THE JUDGE FROM TAKING FURTHER ACTION

EFFECTIVELY DISMISSING THE CASE PENDING IN FLORIDA. PLAINTIFFS

ARE SEEKING A DISCRETIONARY REVIEW BY THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT.

IN 2005, THE CASE PENDING IN HAWAII WAS SETTLED IN PART FOR

$1.2. IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE HAWAII SUPREME COURT AFFIRMED THE

STATE COURTS DISMISSAL OF THE REMAINDER OF THE CASE.

HOWEVER, PLAINTIFFS MAY SEEK REVIEW BY THE U.S. SUPREME

COURT. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER 2007, THE COMPANY SETTLED FIVE

CASES THAT WERE PENDING IN HAWAII FOR $8.5. DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER 2007, THE DISMISSAL OF THE SIXTEEN REOPENER CASES

PENDING IN FLORIDA WAS AFFIRMED AND THE CASES WERE CLOSED.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007, THERE WERE TWO CASES PENDING IN

DELAWARE STATE COURT, INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT

BENLATE

CAUSED BIRTH DEFECTS TO CHILDREN EXPOSED IN UTERO. IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER 2007, THE COURT APPROVED AND FINALIZED THE SETTLEMENT OF

TWENTY-SIX OTHER CLAIMANTS REPRESENTED BY THE SAME ATTORNEY.

DUPONT PAID THE SETTLEMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2007 ALTHOUGH

ONE PARENT HAS APPEALED THE COURTS ORDER APPROVING THE

SETTLEMENT IN ONE OF THE CASES. THEREFORE, AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, ONE OF THE CASES WAS STILL PENDING.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WERE TWO SHRIMP CASES IN

PFOA

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACTIONS INVOLVING THE WASHINGTON WORKS SITE AND SURROUNDING

AREA

IN NOVEMBER 2006, DUPONT ENTERED INTO AN ORDER ON CONSENT UNDER

THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA) WITH THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ESTABLISHING A

PRECAUTIONARY INTERIM SCREENING LEVEL FOR PFOA (COLLECTIVELY,

PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM

SALT) OF 0.5 PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES

IN THE AREA AROUND THE DUPONT WASHINGTON WORKS SITE LOCATED IN

PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA. AS PART OF THE ORDER ON CONSENT,

DUPONT CONDUCTED A TWO-PART SURVEY AND PERFORMED SAMPLING AND

ANALYTICAL TESTING OF CERTAIN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS

IN THE AREA. DUPONT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE AGREEMENT TO OFFER TO

INSTALL WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS OR AN EPA-APPROVED ALTERNATIVE

IF PFOA LEVELS ARE DETECTED AT OR ABOVE 0.5 PPB. PFOA WAS

DETECTED AT LEVELS ABOVE 0.5 PPB IN TWENTY-SEVEN PRIVATE WATER

WELLS, SO THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE OR TREATED WATER

TO THESE HOMES.

IN LATE 2005 DUPONT AND THE EPA ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF

UNDERSTANDING (EPA MOU) THAT REQUIRES DUPONT TO MONITOR PFOA IN

THE SOIL, AIR, WATER AND BIOTA AROUND THE WASHINGTON WORKS SITE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, DUPONT HAS ACCRUALS OF ABOUT $0.6 TO

FUND ITS ACTIVITIES UNDER THE EPA MOU AND ORDER ON CONSENT.

EPA

ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINTS

IN JULY AND DECEMBER 2004, THE EPA FILED ADMINISTRATIVE

COMPLAINTS AGAINST DUPONT ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO

COMPLY WITH THE TECHNICAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE TOXIC

SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) AND THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) REGARDING PFOA. UNDER A 2005 AGREEMENT

SETTLING THE MATTER, THE COMPANY PAID CIVIL FINES OF $10.25 AND

WILL COMPLETE TWO SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS AT A TOTAL

COST OF $6.25.

ACTIONS.

DRINKING WATER

IN AUGUST 2001, A CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED LEACH V. DUPONT, WAS

FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AGAINST DUPONT AND THE LUBECK

PUBLIC SERVICE DISTRICT. DUPONT USES PFOA AS A PROCESSING AID TO

MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AT VARIOUS

SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN

WEST VIRGINIA. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR

THE WASHINGTON WORKS FACILITY HAD SUFFERED, OR MAY SUFFER,

DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING

WATER. THE RELIEF SOUGHT INCLUDED DAMAGES FOR MEDICAL

MONITORING, DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUES AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES

PLUS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP RELEASES OF PFOA. DUPONT AND

ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN 2004

AND AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS OF $108 IN

2004. THE AGREEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE WOOD COUNTY CIRCUIT

COURT ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005 AFTER A FAIRNESS HEARING. THE

SETTLEMENT BINDS A CLASS OF APPROXIMATELY 80,000 RESIDENTS. AS

DEFINED BY THE COURT, THE CLASS INCLUDES THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

HAVE CONSUMED, FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR, WATER CONTAINING 0.05 PPB

OR GREATER OF PFOA FROM ANY OF SIX DESIGNATED PUBLIC WATER

SOURCES OR FROM SOLE SOURCE PRIVATE WELLS.

IN JULY 2005, THE COMPANY PAID THE PLAINTIFFS

ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES OF $23 AND MADE A PAYMENT OF

$70, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL HAS DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY

HEALTH PROJECT. THE COMPANY IS ALSO FUNDING A SERIES OF HEALTH

STUDIES BY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS IN THE

COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC

EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY PROBABLE LINK EXISTS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO

PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE. THE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL HEALTH

STUDIES ARE ESTIMATED TO COST APPROXIMATELY $20, OF WHICH $5 WAS

ORIGINALLY PLACED IN AN INTEREST-BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNT. AT

PRESENT, THE EXPECTED TIMEFRAME TO COMPLETE THE STUDIES IS THREE

TO FIVE YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS PROVIDING

STATE-OF-THE ART WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

LEVEL OF

F-28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS

IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

PFOA IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER DISTRICTS, INCLUDING THE LITTLE

HOCKING WATER ASSOCIATION (LHWA), UNTIL THE SCIENCE PANEL

DETERMINES THAT PFOA DOES NOT CAUSE DISEASE OR UNTIL APPLICABLE

WATER STANDARDS CAN BE MET WITHOUT SUCH TREATMENT. THE ESTIMATED

COST OF CONSTRUCTING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THESE SYSTEMS IS

ABOUT $20 OF WHICH $10 WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED IN AN

INTEREST-BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNT. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2007, THE

WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR THE LHWA WAS BROUGHT ONLINE. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE RESERVE BALANCE RELATING TO THE

FUNDING OF THE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL HEALTH STUDY AND THE

WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS WAS $21, INCLUDING $6 IN INTEREST

BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

THE SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN THE DISMISSAL OF ALL CLAIMS ASSERTED

IN THE LAWSUIT EXCEPT FOR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF THE

INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL CONCLUDES THAT NO PROBABLE LINK EXISTS

BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY DISEASES, THEN THE SETTLEMENT

WOULD ALSO RESOLVE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF IT CONCLUDES THAT

A PROBABLE LINK DOES EXIST BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY

DISEASES, THEN DUPONT WOULD ALSO FUND UP TO $235 FOR A MEDICAL

MONITORING PROGRAM TO PAY FOR SUCH MEDICAL TESTING. IN THIS

EVENT, PLAINTIFFS WOULD RETAIN THEIR RIGHT TO PURSUE PERSONAL

INJURY CLAIMS. ALL OTHER CLAIMS IN THE LAWSUIT WOULD REMAIN

DISMISSED BY THE SETTLEMENT. DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REMOTE

THAT THE PANEL WILL FIND A PROBABLE LINK. THEREFORE, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD NOT ESTABLISHED ANY

ACCRUALS RELATED TO MEDICAL MONITORING OR PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHAT THE

INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL WILL CONCLUDE.

IN JUNE 2007, THE LHWA NOTIFIED DUPONT THAT IT INTENDS TO FILE

SUIT UNDER RCRA ALLEGING IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL

ENDANGERMENT TO HEALTH AND OR THE ENVIRONMENT BASED ON

DETECTION OF PFOA IN ITS WELLS. DUPONT DENIES ANY SUCH

ENDANGERMENT EXISTS AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND ITSELF IF A

LAWSUIT IS FILED.

IN SEPTEMBER 2007, LHWA REFILED THE SUIT IT ORIGINALLY FILED IN

OHIO STATE COURT AND VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED IN 2006. THE SUIT

CLAIMS THAT PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING PFOA, ALLEGEDLY

RELEASED FROM THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT CONTAMINATED

LHWAS WELL FIELDS AND UNDERLYING AQUIFER. LHWAS

COMPLAINT SEEKS A VARIETY OF RELIEF INCLUDING COMPENSATORY AND

PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND AN INJUNCTION REQUIRING DUPONT TO PROVIDE

A NEW PRISTINE WELL FIELD AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

DELIVER IT.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2006, THREE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE

FILED ALLEGING THAT DRINKING WATER HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED BY PFOA

IN EXCESS OF 0.05 PPB DUE TO ALLEGED RELEASES FROM CERTAIN

DUPONT PLANTS. ONE OF THESE CASES WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA

STATE COURT ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS OF THE PARKERSBURG CITY WATER

DISTRICT, BUT WAS REMOVED ON DUPONTS MOTION TO THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST

VIRGINIA. THE OTHER TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED IN

NEW JERSEY. ONE WAS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT ON BEHALF OF

INDIVIDUALS WHO ALLEGEDLY DRANK WATER CONTAMINATED BY RELEASES

FROM DUPONTS CHAMBERS WORKS PLANT IN DEEPWATER, NEW

JERSEY. THE SECOND WAS FILED IN STATE COURT ON BEHALF OF

CUSTOMERS SERVICED PRIMARILY BY THE PENNSVILLE TOWNSHIP WATER

DEPARTMENT AND WAS REMOVED TO NEW JERSEY FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT

ON DUPONTS MOTION. THE NEW JERSEY CASES HAVE BEEN COMBINED

FOR PURPOSES OF DISCOVERY AND THE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN AMENDED

TO ALLEGE THAT DRINKING WATER HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED BY PFOA IN

EXCESS OF 0.04 PPB. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF

VIGOROUSLY AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGING CONTAMINATION OF

DRINKING WATER SOURCES.

WHILE DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IT

COULD INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO PFOA MATTERS IN ADDITION TO THOSE

MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR WHICH IT HAS ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS, A

RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES, IF ANY, CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT

THIS TIME.

NON-STICK COATING IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS AGAINST DUPONT. THE

ACTIONS WERE FILED ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS IN COLORADO,

CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, FLORIDA,

ILLINOIS, INDIANA, IOWA, KENTUCKY, MASSACHUSETTS, MICHIGAN,

MISSOURI, NEW JERSEY, NEW MEXICO, NEW YORK, OHIO, OKLAHOMA,

PENNSYLVANIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, TEXAS AND WEST VIRGINIA. TWO OF

THE 23 ACTIONS WERE FILED IN CALIFORNIA. BY ORDER OF THE

JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION, ALL OF THESE ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN COMBINED FOR COORDINATED AND CONSOLIDATED PRE-TRIAL

PROCEEDINGS IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

OF IOWA. UNDER THE COURTS LATEST CASE MANAGEMENT ORDER, A

RULING ON WHETHER THESE CASES CAN PROCEED AS CLASS ACTIONS IS

EXPECTED IN 2008.

THE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT DUPONT VIOLATED STATE LAWS BY ENGAGING

IN DECEPTIVE AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY FAILING TO

DISCLOSE TO CONSUMERS THAT PRODUCTS CONTAINING

TEFLON

®

WERE OR ARE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL TO CONSUMERS AND THAT

DUPONT HAS LIABILITY BASED ON STATE LAW THEORIES OF NEGLIGENCE

AND STRICT LIABILITY. THE ACTIONS ALLEGE THAT

TEFLON

®

CONTAINED OR RELEASED HARMFUL AND DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES;

INCLUDING A CHEMICAL (PFOA) ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO

BE LIKELY TO CAUSE CANCER IN HUMANS. THE ACTIONS

SEEK UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES FOR CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED

COOKING PRODUCTS CONTAINING

TEFLON

,

AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF FUNDS FOR MEDICAL MONITORING AND

INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER

RELIEF. IN DECEMBER 2005, A MOTION WAS FILED BY A SINGLE NAMED

PLAINTIFF IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC,

CANADA SEEKING AUTHORIZATION TO INSTITUTE A CLASS ACTION ON

BEHALF OF ALL QUEBEC CONSUMERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED OR USED

KITCHEN ITEMS, HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES OR FOOD-PACKAGING CONTAINING

COURT IN 2008. DAMAGES ARE NOT QUANTIFIED, BUT ARE ALLEGED TO

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE TWENTY-THREE CLASS ACTIONS AND THE

MOTION FILED IN QUEBEC ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND, THEREFORE,

BELIEVES IT IS REMOTE THAT IT WILL INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO THESE

ACTIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD NOT

ESTABLISHED ANY ACCRUALS RELATED TO THESE MATTERS.

ELASTOMERS

ANTITRUST MATTERS

SINCE 2002, THE U.S., EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND CANADIAN ANTITRUST

AUTHORITIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE SYNTHETIC RUBBER MARKETS FOR

POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDED DUPONT DOW

ELASTOMERS, LLC (DDE), AS A RESULT OF ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE

POLYCHLOROPRENE (PCP) AND ETHYLENE PROPYLENE DIENE MONOMER

(EPDM) MARKETS. DDE WAS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN THE DOW CHEMICAL

COMPANY (DOW) AND DUPONT.

IN APRIL 2004, DUPONT AND DOW ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF

AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH DUPONT OBTAINED COMPLETE CONTROL OVER

DIRECTING DDES RESPONSE TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND THE

RELATED LITIGATION AND DUPONT AGREED TO A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE

OF THE VENTURES LIABILITIES AND COSTS RELATED TO THESE

MATTERS. CONSEQUENTLY, DUPONT BEARS ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITIES

TO CONSPIRING TO FIX PRICES AND PAID A FINE OF CDN $4,

APPROXIMATELY $3.8 USD, RESOLVING ALL CRIMINAL ANTITRUST

ALLEGATIONS AGAINST IT RELATED TO PCP IN CANADA.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS THAT MAKES ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS

REGARDING THE PCP MARKET AGAINST DPE, RELATING TO THE JOINT

VENTURES ACTIVITIES, AND DUPONT, TO WHICH BOTH HAVE

DOW AND DUPONT TOTALING EURO 59.25 (APPROXIMATELY $87 USD).

THE COMPANY WILL SEEK APPELLATE REVIEW.

DDE RESOLVED ALL CRIMINAL ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS AGAINST IT

RELATED TO PCP IN THE U.S. THROUGH A PLEA AGREEMENT WITH

THE DOJ IN JANUARY 2005 WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT ON

MARCH 29, 2005. THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE SUBSIDIARY TO

PAY A FINE OF $84 WHICH, AT ITS ELECTION, IS BEING PAID IN SIX

EQUAL, ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS. THE ANNUAL INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS FOR

2005, 2006 AND 2007 HAVE BEEN MADE. THE AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES

THE SUBSIDIARY TO PROVIDE ONGOING COOPERATION WITH THE

DOJS INVESTIGATION.

AS A RESULT OF ITS APRIL 2004 AGREEMENTS WITH DOW, DUPONT

ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS IN 2004 OF $268 AND INCREASED ITS ACCRUALS

BY $65 IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2007. AS A RESULT OF THE EU DECISION

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2007, THE COMPANY REVERSED $44 OF ITS

ACCRUALS RELATED TO THIS MATTER. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE

COMPANY HAS ACCRUALS OF APPROXIMATELY $130 RELATED TO THIS

MATTER AND A RECEIVABLE OF $17 FOR THE AMOUNT IT EXPECTS TO BE

REIMBURSED BY DOW.

SPELTER, WEST

VIRGINIA

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, A WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS

ACTION AGAINST DUPONT THAT SEEKS RELIEF INCLUDING THE PROVISION

OF REMEDIATION SERVICES AND PROPERTY VALUE DIMINUTION DAMAGES

FOR 7,000 RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN THE VICINITY OF A CLOSED

ZINC SMELTER IN SPELTER, WEST VIRGINIA. THE ACTION ALSO SEEKS

MEDICAL MONITORING FOR AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN

THE CLASS AREA. THE SMELTER WAS OWNED AND OPERATED BY AT LEAST

THREE COMPANIES BETWEEN 1910 AND 2001, INCLUDING DUPONT BETWEEN

1928 AND 1950. DUPONT PERFORMED REMEDIAL MEASURES AT THE REQUEST

OF THE EPA IN THE LATE 1990S AND IN 2001 REPURCHASED THE

SITE TO FACILITATE AND COMPLETE THE REMEDIATION. THE OCTOBER

2007 TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN FOUR PHASES: LIABILITY, MEDICAL

MONITORING, PROPERTY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE JURY FOUND

AGAINST DUPONT IN ALL FOUR PHASES AWARDING $55.5 FOR PROPERTY

REMEDIATION AND $196.2 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. NO SPECIFIC AMOUNT

WAS AWARDED IN THE MEDICAL MONITORING PHASE ALTHOUGH IN POST

TRIAL MOTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ESTIMATE MEDICAL MONITORING AT $130.

ALSO, IN POST TRIAL MOTIONS, PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS SEEK

LEGAL FEES EQUIVALENT TO ONE-THIRD OF THE TOTAL AWARD PLUS $8 IN

EXPENSES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS A STRONG BASIS FOR APPEAL

AND WILL SEEK THE RIGHT TO APPEAL ALL FOUR PHASES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED ACCRUALS OF

$55, ALTHOUGH GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN LITIGATION,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE FINAL OUTCOME.

GENERAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARISING

OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THESE LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS INCLUDE ACTIONS BASED ON ALLEGED EXPOSURES TO PRODUCTS,

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND CONTRACT AND

ANTITRUST CLAIMS. MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY

SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES,

OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES.

SUCH CASES MAY ALLEGE CONTAMINATION FROM UNREGULATED SUBSTANCES

OR REMEDIATED SITES. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE

OUTCOME OF THESE VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, MANAGEMENT DOES

NOT ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT

IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO CORRECT THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR

RELEASES OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY

SET FORTH IN NOTE 1. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM

THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND

LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SUPERFUND), THE

RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE

LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN

INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY

CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE

COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES

ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE

COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF

CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST

FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS,

DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING

REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND

2006, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED A LIABILITY OF

$357 AND $349, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO THESE MATTERS AND, IN

MANAGEMENTS OPINION, IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON EXISTING

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE AVERAGE TIME FRAME, OVER WHICH THE

ACCRUED OR PRESENTLY UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS MAY BE PAID, BASED ON

PAST HISTORY, IS ESTIMATED TO BE

15-20 YEARS.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE COSTS AND,

UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY

RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS INCIDENT TO THE

ORDINARY CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH COMMITMENTS

STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A

$2 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN IN JUNE 2001. DURING 2007 AND

2006, THERE WERE NO PURCHASES OF STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 9.9 MILLION

SHARES AT A TOTAL COST OF $505. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED 20.5 MILLION SHARES AT A TOTAL

COST OF $962. MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A TIMELINE FOR THE

BUYBACK OF THE REMAINING STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN.

IN ADDITION TO THE PLAN DESCRIBED ABOVE, IN OCTOBER 2005 THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK

PLAN. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT WITH GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. (GOLDMAN SACHS)

UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 75.7 MILLION

SHARES OF DUPONTS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FROM GOLDMAN

SACHS ON OCTOBER 27, 2005 AT A PRICE OF $39.62 PER SHARE,

WITH GOLDMAN SACHS PURCHASING AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES IN

THE OPEN MARKET OVER THE FOLLOWING NINE-MONTH PERIOD.

ON JULY 27, 2006, GOLDMAN SACHS COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE OF

75.7 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONTS COMMON STOCK AT A

VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP) OF $41.99 PER SHARE. UPON

THE CONCLUSION OF THE AGREEMENT IN 2006, THE COMPANY PAID $180

IN CASH TO GOLDMAN SACHS TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT. THE FINAL

SETTLEMENT PRICE WAS BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VWAP

PER SHARE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD, WHICH ENDED JULY 27,

2006, AND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF $39.62 PER SHARE. THE AMOUNT

PAID TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO

ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL DURING THE THIRD QUARTER 2006. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF ITS SHARES

IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2006 FOR $100 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $42.27

PER SHARE.

DURING 2007, THE COMPANY PAID $1.7 BILLION TO PURCHASE AND

IMMEDIATELY RETIRE 34.7 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE

OF $48.85 PER SHARE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY

HAS COMPLETED THE $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN WITH THE

PURCHASE AND RETIREMENT OF 112.8 MILLION SHARES AT AN

AVERAGE PRICE OF $44.33 PER SHARE.

COMMON STOCK HELD IN TREASURY IS RECORDED AT COST. WHEN RETIRED,

THE EXCESS OF THE COST OF TREASURY STOCK OVER ITS PAR VALUE IS

ALLOCATED BETWEEN REINVESTED EARNINGS AND ADDITIONAL PAID-IN

CAPITAL.

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE REMEASUREMENT DATE. BETTER THAN

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE OF

6.00 PERCENT DECREASED PRETAX PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2006 BY

$72. FOR 2007, THE PLAN AMENDMENT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN

PRETAX PENSION EXPENSE OF ABOUT $40.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES PUBLISHED LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE

BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE AT MEASUREMENT DATE.

WHERE COMMONLY AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS INDICES OF

VARIOUS DURATIONS TO REFLECT THE TIMING OF FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS.

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IN THE U.S. WAS

SELECTED FROM WITHIN THE REASONABLE RANGE OF RATES DETERMINED BY

(A) HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE

ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND

(B) PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD

DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FOR

NON-U.S. PLANS,

ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH

COUNTRY.

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES

INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS

AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRUDENT EXPERT STANDARD

AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES

STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE

AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE

SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE

COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET LIABILITY STUDIES ARE

UTILIZED IN THIS PROCESS. U.S. PLAN ASSETS AND A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

NON-U.S. PLAN

ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED BY THE

COMPANY. THE REMAINING ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL

INVESTMENT FIRMS UNRELATED TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANYS

PENSION INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DISCRETION TO MANAGE THE

ASSETS WITHIN ESTABLISHED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES APPROVED BY

SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. PLANS INVEST IN SECURITIES

FROM A VARIETY OF COUNTRIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES THAT A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO PRESENTS AND TO INCREASE

PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. ADDITIONALLY, PENSION TRUST FUNDS ARE

PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS DERIVATIVES. DERIVATIVES ARE

PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS, HEDGE CURRENCY

AND ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION IN A

COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS DIRECTLY HELD $440

CONTRIBUTIONS

IN 2007, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $277 TO ITS PENSION PLANS. NO

CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED OR MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN TRUST FUND IN 2007 AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS

ARE REQUIRED OR EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO THIS PLAN IN 2008. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ASSET VALUES DURING THE YEAR.

THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (THE ACT) WAS

SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN AUGUST 2006. THE ACT

INTRODUCED NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-EMPLOYER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROVIDED GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING PENSION

PLAN ASSETS AND PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR FUNDING PURPOSES,

INTRODUCED BENEFIT LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN UNDERFUNDED PLANS AND

RAISED TAX DEDUCTION LIMITS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT

PLANS. THE NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE FOR

PLAN YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ACT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

ITS REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE

APPROXIMATELY $250 IN 2008 TO ITS PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE

PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND ALSO EXPECTS TO MAKE CASH

PAYMENTS OF $315 IN 2008 UNDER ITS OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $280 TO ITS PENSION

PLANS. NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED OR MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN TRUST FUND IN 2006. IN 2005, THE COMPANY

MADE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1,253 TO ITS PENSION PLANS, INCLUDING A

CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH

COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT IS THE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN (THE PLAN). THIS

PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

(ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP

AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS

BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY

TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX

QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR

DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY

MAY PARTICIPATE. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO

50 PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE

EMPLOYEES

CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. AS PART OF THE RETIREMENT PLAN CHANGES IN

AUGUST 2006, THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS FOR MOST

U.S. PARENT COMPANY EMPLOYEES ARE IN TRANSITION. EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2007, FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED ON THAT DATE OR

THEREAFTER AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, FOR ACTIVE

EMPLOYEES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY WILL

CONTRIBUTE 100 PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE

EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION ELECTION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTE

3 PERCENT OF EACH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION. IN

ADDITION, THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION HAS BEEN

EXPANDED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION IN THE PENSION PLAN.

THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. PARENT

COMPANYS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WERE $57, $52 AND $51

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS VEST

IMMEDIATELY UPON CONTRIBUTION. THE 3 PERCENT AUTOMATIC

COMPANY CONTRIBUTION ALSO VESTS IMMEDIATELY FOR EMPLOYEES WITH

AT LEAST THREE-YEARS OF SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE

CONTRIBUTIONS OF $42, $34 AND $30 FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, TO OTHER

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE

ABOUT $230 TO ITS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN 2008.

COMPENSATION

PLANS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

SFAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

TRANSITION METHOD. BECAUSE THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE

RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123, AS AMENDED,

PROSPECTIVELY ON JANUARY 1, 2003, THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, THE NOMINAL VESTING

APPROACH WAS FOLLOWED FOR ALL AWARDS. UPON ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN

EXPENSING NEW STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS USING A

NON-SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH, UNDER WHICH COMPENSATION COSTS ARE

RECOGNIZED OVER AT LEAST SIX MONTHS FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE AT THE DATE OF THE GRANT

OR WOULD BECOME RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD OF

THE GRANT. USING THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING APPROACH IN LIEU OF

THE NOMINAL VESTING APPROACH WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PRIOR TO THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, THE COMPANY REPORTED THE TAX BENEFIT

OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS. UPON THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM TAX

DEDUCTIONS IN EXCESS OF COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED FOR THOSE

OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE REPORTED AS FINANCING CASH

FLOWS.

THE TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS WAS $144, $140 AND $90 FOR 2007,

2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS WERE $48, $46 AND $27 FOR

2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

ON APRIL 25, 2007, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE DUPONT

EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP). THE EIP

CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS EXISTING COMPENSATION

PLANS (THE STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN, VARIABLE COMPENSATION PLAN,

AND EQUITY AWARDS OF THE STOCK ACCUMULATION AND DEFERRED

COMPENSATION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS) INTO ONE PLAN PROVIDING FOR

EQUITY-BASED AND CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES,

DIRECTORS AND CONSULTANTS. CURRENTLY, EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS CONSIST OF STOCK OPTIONS, TIME-VESTED AND

PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND STOCK APPRECIATION

RIGHTS.

UNDER THE EIP, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR THE

GRANT OR SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS IS 60 MILLION SHARES,

PROVIDED THAT EACH SHARE IN EXCESS OF 20 MILLION THAT IS

ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD THAT IS NOT AN OPTION OR STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHT WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE 60 MILLION

SHARE LIMIT AS FOUR SHARES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

APPROXIMATELY 60 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE

GRANTS UNDER THE COMPANYS EIP. AWARDS OR GRANTS MADE IN

2007, PRIOR TO SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE EIP, WERE ISSUED

UNDER THE COMPANYS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING COMPENSATION PLANS.

AWARDS OUTSTANDING UNDER EACH OF THESE PLANS HAVE NOT BEEN

TERMINATED. THESE AWARDS REMAIN OUTSTANDING AND ARE ADMINISTERED

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE EXISTING PLAN. NO FURTHER

AWARDS WILL BE MADE UNDER THE COMPANYS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING

COMPENSATION PLANS.

THE COMPANYS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, TIME-VESTED

AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND MAY AUTHORIZE

NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY BEGAN ISSUING TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS IN ADDITION TO STOCK OPTIONS. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

SERIALLY VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. A RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEE RETAINS ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE

EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING

GRANTED FROM TIME TO TIME TO KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES.

THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GENERALLY VEST OVER PERIODS RANGING

FROM TWO TO FIVE YEARS.

THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTS PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP. VESTING OCCURS UPON ATTAINMENT OF

PRE-ESTABLISHED (I) CORPORATE REVENUE GROWTH RELATIVE TO

PEER COMPANIES AND (II) RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL

OBJECTIVES RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES (FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO

2007) OR ATTAINMENT OF INTERNAL ABSOLUTE TARGETS (FOR

VARIETY OF APPROVED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE UTILIZED IN

EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS VARYING LEVELS OF

EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF

THE FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH SENIOR MANAGEMENTS FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES THROUGH A CORPORATE

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY. IN ADDITION, THE POLICY

ESTABLISHES OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES AND RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

THAT AUTHORIZE THE USE OF SPECIFIC DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

FURTHER ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION,

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL AND ROUTINE MONITORING AND

REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF

NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY MANAGES THIS

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS THROUGH THE AFOREMENTIONED CREDIT

APPROVALS, LIMITS AND MONITORING PROCEDURES AND, TO THE EXTENT

POSSIBLE, BY RESTRICTING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH UNPAID BALANCES

ARE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS AND NO

MATERIAL LOSS WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH NONPERFORMANCE. MARKET

AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS

ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY HEDGES FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN BUSINESS SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES AND CERTAIN ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE TRADED AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT INVOLVE THE

EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS WHICH

ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE

DEBT. ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF

HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO

THESE HEDGES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT

HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE EACH

PERIOD. THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED

DEBT ARE ALSO RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS NO OTHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

CASH FLOW

HEDGES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF CASH FLOW HEDGING PROGRAMS TO

REDUCE RISKS RELATED TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK. COMMODITY PRICE

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS NATURAL GAS,

ETHANE, CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL. WHILE EACH RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD, MOST

PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR PERIOD.

HEDGES OF INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF

COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES. CASH FLOW HEDGE

RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN

WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS

ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL

NOT MATERIALIZE. CASH FLOW HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS REPORTED IN

EARNINGS FOR 2007 WAS A PRETAX GAIN OF $6. DURING 2007, THERE

WERE NO PRETAX GAINS (LOSSES) EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF

DERIVATIVES

NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET

EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED

MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES

PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING. HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED

REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTS IN

A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS A FEW SMALL RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR AGRICULTURAL

COMMODITIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.

CURRENCY

RISK

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET

ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES

OTHER THAN THE DESIGNATED FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE PRIMARY

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED

POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES

RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX

EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN ANOTHER

CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN

COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A

CASE-BY-CASE

BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE

EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN

CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE FOREIGN CURRENCY

DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST RATE

RISK

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE

INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED

OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING

RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH UNDERLYING

FIXED-RATE BONDS OR NOTES TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT

INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST

RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $1,150, WHEREBY THE COMPANY, OVER THE REMAINING

TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING NOTES, WILL RECEIVE A FIXED RATE PAYMENT

EQUIVALENT TO THE FIXED INTEREST RATE OF THE UNDERLYING NOTE AND

PAY A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST THAT IS BASED ON USD LIBOR.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS OVERALL COST OF BORROWING AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND 2006. SEE NOTE 17 FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTIONS OF

INTEREST RATE SWAPS.
