TODAY, DUPONT IS CREATING HIGHER GROWTH AND HIGHER VALUE BY EXTENDING THE COMPANY’S LEADERSHIP IN AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION, STRENGTHENING AND GROWING CAPABILITIES IN ADVANCED MATERIALS AND LEVERAGING CROSS-COMPANY SKILLS TO DEVELOP A WORLD-LEADING BIO-BASED INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS. THROUGH THESE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES, DUPONT IS HELPING CUSTOMERS FIND SOLUTIONS TO CAPITALIZE ON AREAS OF GROWING GLOBAL DEMAND — ENABLING MORE, SAFER, NUTRITIOUS FOOD; CREATING HIGH-PERFORMANCE, COST-EFFECTIVE ENERGY EFFICIENT MATERIALS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES; AND INCREASINGLY DELIVERING RENEWABLY SOURCED BIO-BASED MATERIALS AND FUELS.

IN JUNE 2014, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS GLOBAL, MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO REDESIGN ITS GLOBAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATING MODEL TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND AGILITY ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS.  DUPONT COMMENCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO REALIGN AND REBALANCE STAFF FUNCTION SUPPORT, ENHANCE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND TO REDUCE RESIDUAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT.

BACKLOG

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS AGAINST A BACKLOG OF ORDERS AND DOES NOT CONSIDER BACKLOG TO BE A SIGNIFICANT INDICATOR OF THE LEVEL OF FUTURE SALES ACTIVITY.  PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF INCOMING ORDERS AS WELL AS PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE DEMAND.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BACKLOG INFORMATION IS NOT MATERIAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS OVERALL BUSINESS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

AS A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BASED COMPANY, DUPONT BELIEVES THAT SECURING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF PROTECTING ITS RESEARCH. SOME DUPONT BUSINESSES OPERATE IN ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE AVAILABILITY AND PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AFFECT COMPETITION.  (INFORMATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO PIONEER IS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 AGRICULTURE BUSINESS DISCUSSION BEGINNING ON PAGE 3 OF THIS REPORT.)

TRADE SECRETS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  MANY OF THE PROCESSES USED TO MAKE DUPONT PRODUCTS ARE KEPT AS TRADE SECRETS WHICH, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAY BE LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES.  DUPONT VIGILANTLY PROTECTS ALL OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INCLUDING ITS TRADE SECRETS.  WHEN THE COMPANY DISCOVERS THAT ITS TRADE SECRETS HAVE BEEN UNLAWFULLY TAKEN, IT REPORTS THE MATTER TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTION, AS APPROPRIATE.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT

,

WHICH MAY INCLUDE CIVIL ACTIONS SEEKING REDRESS, RESTITUTION AND/OR DAMAGES BASED ON LOSS TO THE COMPANY AND/OR UNJUST ENRICHMENT.

PATENTS & TRADEMARKS.

DUPONT

CONTINUALLY APPLIES FOR AND OBTAINS U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS AND HAS ACCESS TO A LARGE PATENT PORTFOLIO, BOTH OWNED AND LICENSED.  DUPONT’S RIGHTS UNDER THESE PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY IN THE AGGREGATE. THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THESE PATENTS VARIES BASED ON COUNTRY, SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL PATENT COVERAGE, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY.  THIS SIGNIFICANT PATENT ESTATE MAY BE LEVERAGED TO ALIGN WITH THE COMPANY’S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES WITHIN AND ACROSS SEGMENTS.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE COMPANY OWNED OVER 27,000 PATENTS WITH VARIOUS EXPIRATION DATES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. IN ADDITION TO ITS OWNED PATENTS, THE COMPANY OWNS OVER 16,500 PATENT APPLICATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS MANY TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL AND/OR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS LEVEL.  OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS ARE CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

DUPONT CONDUCTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) PROGRAMS ACROSS MULTIPLE FIELDS INCLUDING BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, ENGINEERING, AND MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES OF AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION, BIO-BASED INDUSTRIALS, AND ADVANCED MATERIALS.  DUPONT ACCELERATES MARKET INTRODUCTIONS AND INCREASES THE IMPACT OF ITS OFFERINGS THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH PARTNERS IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR (CUSTOMERS AND VALUE CHAIN PARTNERS) AND BY WORKING WITH GOVERNMENTS, ACADEMIA, AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD.  DUPONT’S R&D OBJECTIVES ARE TO LEVERAGE THE COMPANY'S UNIQUE WORLD-CLASS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES WITH ITS DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF MARKETS AND VALUE CHAINS TO DRIVE REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY THEREBY DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS - BOTH IN THE SHORT-TERM AS WELL AS IN THE LONG-TERM.  DUPONT'S R&D INVESTMENT IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING VALUE TO ITS CUSTOMERS WHILE EXTENDING ITS LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE HIGH-VALUE, SCIENCE-DRIVEN SEGMENTS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD VALUE CHAINS, STRENGTHENING ITS LEAD AS PROVIDER OF DIFFERENTIATED, HIGH-VALUE ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS, AND BUILDING TRANSFORMATIONAL NEW BIO-BASED INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES.  EACH BUSINESS IN THE COMPANY FUNDS R&D ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS MISSION, AND A CENTRAL R&D ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS CROSS-BUSINESS AND CROSS-FUNCTIONAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.  THE R&D PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED BY SENIOR BUSINESS AND R&D LEADERS TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE CORPORATE AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND TO CAPITALIZE ON THE APPLICATION OF EMERGING SCIENCE.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PROTECT ITS R&D INVESTMENT THROUGH ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STRATEGY. SEE DISCUSSION UNDER "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY".

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FILE REPORTS AND INFORMATION WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), INCLUDING REPORTS ON THE FOLLOWING FORMS: ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

THE PUBLIC MAY READ AND COPY ANY MATERIALS THE COMPANY FILES WITH THE SEC AT THE SEC'S PUBLIC REFERENCE ROOM AT 100 F STREET, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20549. THE PUBLIC MAY OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE OPERATION OF THE PUBLIC REFERENCE ROOM BY CALLING THE SEC AT 1-800-SEC-0330. THE SEC ALSO MAINTAINS AN INTERNET SITE AT HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV THAT CONTAINS REPORTS, PROXY AND INFORMATION STATEMENTS, AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING ISSUERS THAT FILE ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SEC.

THESE REPORTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE, WITHOUT CHARGE, AS SOON AS IS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COMPANY FILES OR FURNISHES THEM ELECTRONICALLY WITH THE SEC.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS INCLUDED IN ITEM 10, DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BEGINNING ON PAGE 45 OF THIS REPORT.

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND GROW EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS, AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. IN 2014, PRICE DECREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS WERE ABOUT $200 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2013.  IN 2013, PRICE INCREASES FOR ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS WERE ABOUT $500 MILLION AS COMPARED TO 2012.  LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ESTABLISHING A PRICE ON CARBON COULD CREATE INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS AND PRICE VOLATILITY.  WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES. THE COMPANY TAKES ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE INCREASES, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH PRICE INCREASES IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED BY BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS.

BUSINESS AND/OR SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, PLANT AND/OR POWER OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND/OR NETWORK DISRUPTIONS, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF SABOTAGE, EMPLOYEE ERROR OR OTHER ACTIONS, GEO-POLITICAL ACTIVITY, WEATHER EVENTS AND NATURAL DISASTERS COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT, DETECT AND RECOVER FROM SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS; VIRUSES; BREACHES DUE TO EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS; OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS COULD RESULT IN MISUSE OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS, BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, LOSS OF PROPERTY INCLUDING TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION, LEGAL CLAIMS OR PROCEEDINGS, REPORTING ERRORS, PROCESSING INEFFICIENCIES, NEGATIVE MEDIA ATTENTION, LOSS OF SALES AND INTERFERENCE WITH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.  LIKE MOST MAJOR CORPORATIONS, THE COMPANY IS THE TARGET OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE, INCLUDING CYBER-ATTACKS, FROM TIME TO TIME. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THESE ATTACKS HAVE RESULTED, AND COULD RESULT IN THE FUTURE, IN UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES GAINING ACCESS TO AT LEAST CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. HOWEVER, TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT, CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT OR BUSINESS OPERATIONS THAT IT ATTRIBUTES TO THESE ATTACKS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL LOSSES TO DATE RELATED TO SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL NOT SUFFER SUCH LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES. AS THESE THREATS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, PARTICULARLY AROUND CYBERSECURITY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENHANCE ITS CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, PROCESSES, PRACTICES AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, SUCH EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INABILITY TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND PROTECT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ENFORCE THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES, INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY AGRICULTURAL AND BIO-BASED PRODUCTS. SPEED IN DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING RELATED PRODUCTS TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OR CANDIDATE PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES. COMPETITORS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITIONS AND THE OUTCOMES CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. IF CHALLENGES ARE RESOLVED ADVERSELY, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN LICENSES ON COMPETITIVE TERMS, COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS AND GENERATE SALES FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING PATENTS, PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION, TRADE SECRETS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, TRADEMARKS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER FORMS OF TRADE DRESS, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTED.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS. FURTHER, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES MADE IN REACTION TO PRESSURE FROM  NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, COULD IMPACT THE EXTENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AFFORDED BY SUCH JURISDICTIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS, THEFT AND CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, AND OTHER SECURITY BREACHES. WHEN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE OR COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS ARE DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH SITUATIONS TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION, AS APPROPRIATE, AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT. PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED TO BIOTECHNOLOGY IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE THEFT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY CAN BE SELF-REPLICATING. ACCORDINGLY, THE IMPACT OF SUCH THEFT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT.

FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, ALLIANCES AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ACQUISITION CANDIDATES THAT MAY STRATEGICALLY FIT ITS BUSINESS AND/OR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AND DEVELOP ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS, INCLUDING ANY EXPECTED INCREASES IN REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S OBJECTIVES AND ALIGNMENT WITH ITS GROWTH STRATEGY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN SEPARATING UNDERPERFORMING OR NON-STRATEGIC ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DIVESTITURE OF, OR LOST OPERATING INCOME FROM, SUCH ASSETS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS. MOREOVER, THE COMPANY MIGHT INCUR ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES THAT REDUCE ITS EARNINGS.

THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF OF THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT IS CONTINGENT UPON THE SATISFACTION OF A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS WHICH COULD DELAY, PREVENT OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF, INCLUDING POSSIBLE ISSUES OR DELAYS IN OBTAINING THE REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS OR CLEARANCES, DISRUPTIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS OR OTHER POTENTIAL BARRIERS.

IN OCTOBER 2013, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO SEPARATE ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT THROUGH A U.S. TAX-FREE SPIN-OFF TO SHAREHOLDERS. ON DECEMBER 18, 2014, DUPONT ANNOUNCED THAT THE NAME OF THE NEW PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS COMPANY WILL BE THE CHEMOURS COMPANY (“CHEMOURS”). THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, COMPLEX IN NATURE AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY UNANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH ARE OUT OF THE COMPANY’S CONTROL. COMPLETION OF THE SPIN-OFF WILL BE CONTINGENT UPON CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING RECEIPT OF REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APPROPRIATE FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND FINAL APPROVAL OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE SPIN-OFF BY DUPONT’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

THE TAX-FREE TREATMENT OF THE SPIN-OFF IS ALSO CONTINGENT ON THE CONTINUED VALIDITY OF A RULING RECEIVED FROM THE UNITED STATES INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS RULING), AS WELL AS RECEIPT OF LEGAL OPINIONS (TAX OPINION). ALTHOUGH THE IRS RULING IS GENERALLY BINDING ON THE IRS, IT IS BASED ON CERTAIN FACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS THAT NECESSARY CONDITIONS TO OBTAIN TAX-FREE TREATMENT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED. IF ANY OF THE FACTS, REPRESENTATIONS, ASSUMPTIONS OR UNDERTAKINGS DESCRIBED OR MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE IRS RULING OR THE TAX OPINION ARE NOT CORRECT, ARE INCOMPLETE, OR HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, THE IRS RULING COULD BE REVOKED OR MODIFIED BY THE IRS AND DUPONT'S ABILITY TO RELY ON THE TAX OPINION COULD BE JEOPARDIZED. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER, THAT WOULD CAUSE THESE FACTS, REPRESENTATIONS OR ASSUMPTIONS TO BE UNTRUE OR INCOMPLETE, OR THAT WOULD CAUSE ANY OF THESE UNDERTAKINGS TO FAIL TO BE COMPLIED WITH, IN ANY MATERIAL RESPECT. IF THE SPIN-OFF DISTRIBUTION, AND/OR RELATED INTERNAL TRANSACTIONS, WERE TO BE DETERMINED TAXABLE, DUPONT OR CHEMOURS COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE SPIN-OFF WERE DEEMED TO BE TAXABLE, EACH HOLDER OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK WHO RECEIVED SHARES OF CHEMOURS WOULD GENERALLY BE TREATED AS RECEIVING A TAXABLE DISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE SHARES RECEIVED. EVEN IF THE DISTRIBUTION OTHERWISE QUALIFIES FOR TAX-FREE TREATMENT, THE DISTRIBUTION MAY RESULT IN A CORPORATE LEVEL TAXABLE GAIN TO THE COMPANY IF 50 PERCENT OR MORE, BY VOTE OR VALUE, OF DUPONT OR CHEMOURS COMMON STOCK, IS TREATED AS ACQUIRED OR ISSUED AS PART OF A PLAN OR SERIES OF RELATED TRANSACTIONS THAT INCLUDES THE DISTRIBUTION. WHILE DUPONT WOULD RECOGNIZE A TAXABLE GAIN AS DESCRIBED ABOVE,  THE DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE TAX-FREE TO DUPONT COMMON STOCKHOLDERS.

ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND TRADING PRICE.

MARKET ACCEPTANCE, GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND COMPETITION COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES SEGMENTS. THESE PRODUCTS ENABLE COST AND PROCESS BENEFITS, BETTER PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES TO A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES SUCH AS SEEDS, ANIMAL NUTRITION, DETERGENTS, FOOD MANUFACTURING, ETHANOL PRODUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS COULD BE IMPACTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF CROPS AND OTHER PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM THOSE SEEDS.

IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS RIGHT TO SELL EXISTING PRODUCTS OR TO COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS, PARTICULARLY SEED PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MUST BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS ABILITY TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATORY AGENCIES. SALES OF SEEDS WITH BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS INTO JURISDICTIONS WHERE PLANTING HAS BEEN APPROVED COULD BE AFFECTED IF KEY IMPORT MARKETS HAVE NOT APPROVED THE IMPORT OF CROPS CONTAINING SUCH BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS. IF IMPORT OCCURS IN THESE MARKETS, IT COULD LEAD TO DISRUPTION AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE COMPANY.

THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS LENGTHY AND COMPLEX WITH REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN VARY BY INDUSTRY AND BY COUNTRY. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDER REACTION TO ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED IMPACTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY ON SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRES SUBMITTING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND DATA, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. REGULATORY STANDARDS AND TRIAL PROCEDURES ARE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING. THE PACE OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE LACK OF REGULATORY HARMONY COULD RESULT IN UNINTENDED NONCOMPLIANCE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY’S COMPLIANCE COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE DETECTION OF LOW LEVEL PRESENCE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS IN CONVENTIONAL SEED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED FROM SUCH SEED. FURTHERMORE, THE DETECTION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS NOT APPROVED IN THE COUNTRY OF PLANTING MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO SUPPLY PRODUCT AND COULD AFFECT EXPORTS OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED FROM SUCH SEEDS AND EVEN RESULT IN CROP DESTRUCTION OR PRODUCT RECALLS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PROCESS SAFETY AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ISSUES.

FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY MANAGE SAFETY, HUMAN HEALTH, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITIES, STAKEHOLDERS, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD IMPACT PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE AND INFLUENCE THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO MANAGE PROCESS SAFETY RISKS, ISSUES COULD BE CREATED BY EVENTS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, ACTS OF SABOTAGE AND SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANY'S EXTERNAL PARTNERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION COSTS. THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE MATTER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NOTED A TREND IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NUISANCE SUITS BEING FILED ON BEHALF OF STATES, COUNTIES, CITIES AND UTILITIES ALLEGING HARM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED, THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NONE.

OVERVIEW

PURPOSE

DUPONT’S BUSINESSES SERVE MARKETS WHERE THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR MORE AND HEALTHIER FOOD, RENEWABLY SOURCED MATERIALS AND FUELS, AND ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS IS CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE COMBINATION OF SCIENCES, PROVEN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) ENGINE, BROAD GLOBAL REACH, AND DEEP MARKET PENETRATION ARE DISTINCTIVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT POSITION THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE CAPITALIZING ON THIS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL.

STRATEGY

POSITION DUPONT AS A HIGHER GROWTH, HIGHER VALUE COMPANY, WELL EQUIPPED TO DRIVE REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH THROUGH SCIENCE-BASED INNOVATION AND THE COMPANY’S SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES WITH THREE PRIORITIES.

•

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION - EXTEND DUPONT’S LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE HIGH-VALUE, SCIENCE-DRIVEN SEGMENTS OF THE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD VALUE CHAIN;

•

ADVANCED MATERIALS - STRENGTHEN AND GROW DUPONT'S LEADING POSITION IN DIFFERENTIATED, HIGH-VALUE MATERIALS AND LEVERAGE NEW SCIENCES;

•

BIO-BASED INDUSTRIALS - DEVELOP WORLD-LEADING INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES TO CREATE TRANSFORMATIONAL NEW BIO-BASED BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THERE IS A COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH.

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES WAS $3.6 BILLION, UP 26 PERCENT FROM $2.9 BILLION IN 2013, REFLECTING HIGHER SEGMENT PTOI, LOWER PENSION AND OPEB COSTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEPARATION TRANSACTION COSTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. NET SALES WERE $34.7 BILLION, A 3 PERCENT DECREASE FROM PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING PORTFOLIO CHANGES AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM CURRENCY. TOTAL SEGMENT PTOI WAS $6.4 BILLION, 18 PERCENT ABOVE LAST YEAR, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO GAINS ON ASSET SALES, INSURANCE RECOVERIES, LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, AND THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR-YEAR CHARGES FOR LITIGATION AND PRODUCT CLAIMS, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

REDESIGN INITIATIVE AND 2014 RESTRUCTURING PLAN

IN JUNE 2014, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS GLOBAL, MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO REDESIGN ITS GLOBAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATING MODEL TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND AGILITY ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS.  DUPONT COMMENCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO REALIGN AND REBALANCE STAFF FUNCTION SUPPORT, ENHANCE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND TO REDUCE RESIDUAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT.  AS A RESULT, DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $562 MILLION WAS RECORDED, CONSISTING OF $497 MILLION IN EMPLOYEE SEPARATION / ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET AND $65 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME, NET.  THE CHARGES CONSISTED OF $319 MILLION OF EMPLOYEE SEPARATION CHARGES, $17 MILLION OF OTHER NON-PERSONNEL CHARGES, AND $226 MILLION OF ASSET RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING $65 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS OF A JOINT VENTURE WITHIN THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT.  THE ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHARGE AND ALL RELATED PAYMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE BY MID-2016 AND WILL RESULT IN FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 OF  $268 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS.   THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL INCUR FUTURE CHARGES, WHICH IT CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME, RELATED TO THIS PLAN AS IT IMPLEMENTS ADDITIONAL ACTIONS.  PRE-TAX COST SAVINGS RELATED TO THIS CHARGE ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $500 MILLION IN 2015 AND APPROXIMATELY $625 MILLION IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THIS, COUPLED WITH FURTHER COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES AND $375 MILLION OF COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CHEMOURS TO BE ELIMINATED UPON SEPARATION, ARE EXPECTED TO YIELD SAVINGS ON A RUN-RATE BASIS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION AT THE END OF FOURTH QUARTER 2015 AND $1.3 BILLION BY 2017.  ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THIS PLAN CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SEPARATION OF PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS

IN OCTOBER 2013, DUPONT ANNOUNCED THAT IT INTENDS TO SEPARATE ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT THROUGH A U.S. TAX-FREE SPIN-OFF TO SHAREHOLDERS, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS.  IN DECEMBER 2014, THE INITIAL FORM 10 REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED TO THE SPIN-OFF WAS FILED WITH THE SEC FOR THE NEW PUBLIC COMPANY TO BE CREATED FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE PENDING SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT. THE NEW PUBLIC COMPANY WILL BE NAMED THE CHEMOURS COMPANY (CHEMOURS). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE SEPARATION ABOUT MID-2015.

AS PART OF THE SEPARATION, DUPONT INCURRED $175 MILLION IN TRANSACTION COSTS, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO THE SEPARATION IN 2015 ESTIMATED AT ABOUT $350 MILLION.  THESE TRANSACTION COSTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO PROFESSIONAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH PREPARATION OF REGULATORY FILINGS AND SEPARATION ACTIVITIES WITHIN FINANCE, LEGAL AND INFORMATION SYSTEM FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RETURN ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ONE-TIME DIVIDEND PROCEEDS FROM CHEMOURS TO DUPONT SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES WITHIN THE 12 TO18 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE SEPARATION OF CHEMOURS, WITH A PORTION RETURNED IN 2015.

AS A RESULT OF THE SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT, COUPLED WITH THE COMPANY’S REDESIGN INITIATIVE, THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AT CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN ENTITIES IS BEING RE-EVALUATED AND, IN SOME CASES, WILL RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE FOREIGN ENTITIES’ FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE RE-EVALUATION WILL NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON THE DATE OF THE CHANGE.

DIVESTITURE OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS

IN AUGUST 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH FLASH BERMUDA CO. LTD., A BERMUDA EXEMPTED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY FORMED BY AFFILIATES OF THE CARLYLE GROUP (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "CARLYLE") IN WHICH CARLYLE AGREED TO PURCHASE CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSETS COMPRISING THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS. IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE SALE WAS COMPLETED RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION ($2.0 BILLION NET OF TAX). THE GAIN WAS RECORDED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP), THE RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

NET SALES OF $34.7 BILLION WERE 3 PERCENT BELOW PRIOR YEAR INCLUDING A 2 PERCENT REDUCTION FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES, PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES WITHIN THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS AND PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENTS AND 1 PERCENT NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT.  THE NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT WAS DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MOST CURRENCIES. LOCAL PRICES WERE 1 PERCENT LOWER PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LOWER PRICES IN THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS AND ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS, THE LATTER REFLECTING LOWER METALS PRICES. AGRICULTURE LOCAL PRICES WERE UP 1 PERCENT.  SALES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS OF $11.8 BILLION WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT VERSUS PRIOR YEAR AND REPRESENT 34 PERCENT OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES VERSUS 33 PERCENT IN 2013.

NET SALES INCREASED 3 PERCENT, REFLECTING A 5 PERCENT INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE SALES VOLUME WITH GROWTH IN ALL SEGMENTS. LOCAL PRICES WERE 1 PERCENT LOWER PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A 12 PERCENT DECLINE IN PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS PRICES AND A PASS THROUGH OF LOWER PRECIOUS METALS PRICES FOR ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS. NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT REFLECTS A WEAKER BRAZILIAN REAL AND INDIAN RUPEE, PARTLY OFFSET BY A STRONGER EURO. SALES IN DEVELOPING MARKETS OF $11.9 BILLION IMPROVED 7 PERCENT ON 10 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUME, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES IN THESE MARKETS INCREASED TO 33 PERCENT FROM 32 PERCENT IN 2012.

THERE WERE ADDITIONAL NET PRE-TAX EXCHANGE GAINS OF $263 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $65 MILLION FOR CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS OF A JOINT VENTURE WITHIN THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT AND THE ABSENCE OF THE $26 MILLION RE-MEASUREMENT GAIN ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IN 2013. NET PRE-TAX EXCHANGE GAINS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014, INCLUDES $58 MILLION, $46 MILLION, AND $14 MILLION IN EXCHANGE LOSSES, ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVALUATION OF THE VENEZUELAN BOLIVAR, UKRAINIAN HRYVNIA, AND ARGENTINIAN PESO, RESPECTIVELY.  NET PRE-TAX EXCHANGE LOSS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 INCLUDES $33 MILLION EXCHANGE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVALUATION OF THE VENEZUELA BOLIVAR.

2013 VERSUS 2012

THE $88 MILLION DECREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ABSENCE OF A $122 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO THE 2012 SALE OF THE COMPANY'S INTEREST IN AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT, THE ABSENCE OF A $117 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO THE 2012 SALE OF A BUSINESS WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $87 MILLION LOWER NET PRE-TAX EXCHANGE LOSSES, $27 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME, AND A $26 MILLION RE-MEASUREMENT GAIN ON AN EQUITY INVESTMENT.

THE $497 MILLION IN CHARGES RECORDED DURING 2014 IN EMPLOYEE SEPARATION / ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET ARE RELATED TO THE 2014 RESTRUCTURING PLAN DISCUSSED BELOW.

IN JUNE 2014, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS GLOBAL, MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO REDESIGN ITS GLOBAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATING MODEL TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND AGILITY ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS.  DUPONT COMMENCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO REALIGN AND REBALANCE STAFF FUNCTION SUPPORT, ENHANCE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND TO REDUCE RESIDUAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT.  AS A RESULT, DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $562 MILLION WAS RECORDED, CONSISTING OF $497 MILLION IN EMPLOYEE SEPARATION / ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET AND $65 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME, NET.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

19.9%

IN 2014, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX PROVISION ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $1.4 BILLION, REFLECTING A $0.7 BILLION INCREASE FROM 2013, LARGELY DUE TO THE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S POLICY OF HEDGING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACT OF GAINS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER ASSETS IN THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS AND AGRICULTURE SEGMENTS. THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES ON NET MONETARY ASSETS FOR WHICH NO CORRESPONDING TAX BENEFIT IS REALIZED, IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACT OF THE VENEZUELAN BOLIVAR DEVALUATION WHICH IS ALSO NONDEDUCTIBLE.

IN 2013, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX PROVISION ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $626 MILLION, REFLECTING A MARGINAL INCREASE FROM 2012. THE DECREASE IN THE 2013 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, IN ADDITION TO BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN U.S. BUSINESS TAX PROVISIONS IN 2013.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES FOR 2014 WAS $3.6 BILLION COMPARED TO $2.9 BILLION IN 2013 AND $2.5 BILLION IN 2012.  THE CHANGES BETWEEN PERIODS WERE DUE TO THE REASONS NOTED ABOVE.

CORPORATE OUTLOOK

THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2015 NET SALES AND INCOME WILL REFLECT NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT DUE TO THE RECENT STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR.  THE CURRENCY IMPACT IS EXPECTED TO BE MOST SIGNIFICANT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR DUE TO THE SEASONALITY OF AGRICULTURE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS FROM THE OPERATIONAL REDESIGN. THE 2015 OUTLOOK DOES NOT REFLECT THE PLANNED SEPARATION OF THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT OR THE IMPACT OF THE EXPECTED RETURN OF CAPITAL RELATED TO THE SEPARATION.

2014 VERSUS 2013

FULL YEAR 2014 SEGMENT SALES OF $11.3 BILLION DECREASED $0.4 BILLION, OR 4 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CORN SEED VOLUMES IN BRAZIL AND NORTH AMERICA AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CROP PROTECTION VOLUMES AND HIGHER LOCAL CORN SEED PRICES. IN BRAZIL, CORN SEED MARKET SHARE AND PRICE WERE LOWER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF FALL ARMYWORM RESISTANCE

AND A REDUCTION IN PLANTED HECTARES OF CORN. HIGHER VOLUMES IN INSECTICIDES WERE DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN RYNAXYPYR

®

AND FROM SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES OF CYAZYPYR

®

AND NEW SEED TREATMENTS IN SEVERAL MARKETS.

2014 PTOI AND PTOI MARGIN INCREASED DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF $425 MILLION OF CHARGES INCURRED IN 2013 RELATED TO IMPRELIS

®

HERBICIDE CLAIMS, AN INCREASE OF $137 MILLION FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF COSTS RELATED TO THESE CUSTOMER CLAIMS, A GAIN OF $240 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THE COPPER FUNGICIDES AND LAND MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES, LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION AND LOWER SEED INPUT COSTS.  THIS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES,  NET CHANGE IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $135 MILLION AND IMPACTS FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES. SEE NOTES 3 AND 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S 2014 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM AND THE IMPRELIS

®

MATTER, RESPECTIVELY.

2013 VERSUS 2012

SALES GROWTH WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY HIGHER GLOBAL SEED PRICES AND VOLUMES, INCREASED GLOBAL INSECTICIDE AND FUNGICIDE VOLUMES, AND THE BENEFIT OF INCREASED OWNERSHIP IN PANNAR SEED (PTY) LTD, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY NEGATIVE CURRENCY.  GROWTH IN SEEDS REFLECTS STRONG CORN SALES IN NORTH AMERICA AND BRAZIL. INCREASED INSECTICIDE VOLUMES WERE DRIVEN BY DEMAND FOR RYNAXYPYR

®

, PARTICULARLY IN LATIN AMERICA TO COMBAT HEAVY INSECT PRESSURE, WHILE FUNGICIDE VOLUME INCREASES WERE LED BY DEMAND FOR PICOXYTSTROBIN IN NORTH AMERICA AND LATIN AMERICA.

2013 PTOI AND PTOI MARGIN INCREASED ON SALES GROWTH, LOWER CHARGES INCURRED RELATED TO IMPRELIS

®

HERBICIDE CLAIMS, AND EARLIER SEED SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SEED INPUT COSTS OF ABOUT $350 MILLION, $108 MILLION OF NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACT, AND THE ABSENCE OF A $117 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUSINESS RECORDED IN 2012. AS A RESULT OF THE EARLIER TIMING OF SEED SHIPMENTS, REPRESENTING EARLIER SEED SHIPMENTS FOR THE BRAZIL SAFRINHA CORN SEASON ENABLED BY RECENT INVESTMENTS AND EARLIER DIRECT SEED SHIPMENTS TO NORTH AMERICAN FARMERS, APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF PTOI WAS REALIZED IN 2013 VERSUS 2014.

2013 PTOI INCLUDED NET CHARGES OF $352 MILLION ($425 MILLION IN CHARGES OFFSET BY $73 MILLION OF INSURANCE RECOVERIES) RELATED TO IMPRELIS

®

HERBICIDE CLAIMS COMPARED TO CHARGES OF $575 MILLION IN 2012.  SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE IMPRELIS

®

MATTER.

OUTLOOK

FARMER NET INCOME HAS DECLINED AND GROWERS IN BRAZIL’S SAFRINHA SEASON AND IN NORTH AMERICA ARE LIKELY TO REDUCE CORN PLANTINGS AGAIN IN 2015 PUTTING PRESSURE ON VOLUMES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, CROP PROTECTION VOLUMES ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPACTED BY LOWER INSECT PRESSURE IN BRAZIL AND ELEVATED DISTRIBUTOR INVENTORIES IN THE AMERICAS.

FOR THE FIRST HALF 2015 SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS PERCENT LOWER AND PTOI IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT BELOW 2014. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PRICING GAINS TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUMES AND CONTINUED VOLATILE CURRENCIES, WHICH ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE SIGNIFICANT IN MARKETS LIKE EUROPE, BRAZIL AND CANADA WHERE THERE HAS BEEN STRONG GROWTH IN THE COMPANY'S MARKET POSITION IN RECENT YEARS.  VOLUMES WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE EXPECTED DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICA AND BRAZIL SAFRINHA CORN AREA AND THE TIMING OF SEED SHIPMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014.

FOR THE FULL YEAR WE EXPECT A DECREASE IN SALES IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS PERCENT AND A DECREASE IN PTOI IN THE HIGH-SINGLE DIGITS PERCENT AS PRICE GAINS FROM NEW SEED AND CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS ARE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CURRENCY. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY, WE WOULD EXPECT PTOI TO BE UP IN THE MID- TO HIGH-SINGLE DIGITS.

2014 PTOI AND PTOI MARGIN INCREASED DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF A $129 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCURRED IN 2013 (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION), VOLUME GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY GAINS.  THESE WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF $20 MILLION OF OLED TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT REALIZED DURING 2013 AND A NET CHANGE IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $82 MILLION (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE 2014 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM).

2013 VERSUS 2012

SALES DECLINED AS SHARE GAINS AND IMPROVING PHOTOVOLTAICS DEMAND, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER USAGE OF MATERIALS PER PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULE, WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER PRICE. THE DECLINE IN PRICE LARGELY REFLECTS PASS-THROUGH OF LOWER METALS PRICES.

2013 PTOI DECLINED AS THE ABSENCE OF A $122 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO THE SALE OF AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT RECORDED IN 2012 MORE THAN OFFSET VOLUME GAINS, IMPROVED PLANT UTILIZATION, AND $20 MILLION OF INCOME FROM AN OLED TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT REALIZED DURING 2013. IN ADDITION, 2013 PTOI INCLUDES A $129 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE COMPARED TO A $150 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN 2012 (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION).

OUTLOOK

FULL YEAR SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BE UP IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS PERCENT WITH VOLUME GAINS OFFSET BY THE PASS-THROUGH OF LOWER METALS PRICES.  PTOI IS EXPECTED TO BE UP IN THE HIGH-TEENS PERCENT DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN VOLUME, PRODUCTIVITY BENEFITS, AND THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF NEW PHOTOVOLTAIC PASTE PRODUCTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

FULL YEAR 2014 SEGMENT SALES OF $6.5 BILLION DECREASED $0.4 BILLION, OR 6 PERCENT, DUE PRIMARILY TO A PORTFOLIO CHANGE IN INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS AND LOWER PRICES PRINCIPALLY FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE, REFRIGERANTS AND FLUOROPRODUCTS. THE PORTFOLIO CHANGE INVOLVED A CUSTOMER’S ELECTION TO EXERCISE A BUY-OUT OPTION OF A SUPPLY CONTRACT AND RELATED ANILINE FACILITY AT THE END OF 2013. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECLINES WERE VOLUME INCREASES PRIMARILY FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE, REFRIGERANTS AND FLUOROPRODUCTS.

2014 PTOI DECLINED AND PTOI MARGIN WAS FLAT, DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER PRICES, THE ABOVE MENTIONED PORTFOLIO CHANGES AND AN INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $19 MILLION (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE 2014 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM). THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED VOLUMES, THE ABSENCE OF A $72 MILLION CHARGE INCURRED IN 2013 RELATED TO TITANIUM DIOXIDE ANTITRUST LITIGATION, LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION AND A $23 MILLION GAIN FROM THE SALE OF A BUSINESS.

2013 VERSUS 2012

THE CHANGE IN SALES DUE TO PRICE WAS DRIVEN PRINCIPALLY BY PRICE DECLINES FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE IN ALL REGIONS, COUPLED WITH LOWER PRICES FOR FLUOROPOLYMERS AND REFRIGERANTS. VOLUME GROWTH REFLECTS INCREASED DEMAND FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE, WHICH WAS UP 14 PERCENT FROM 2012.

2013 PTOI AND PTOI MARGIN DECREASED PRINCIPALLY ON LOWER SELLING PRICES. VOLUME GAINS WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL INVENTORY COSTS, MAINLY ORE COSTS. 2013 PTOI INCLUDES A $72 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO TITANIUM DIOXIDE ANTITRUST LITIGATION, WHILE 2012 PTOI INCLUDED A $33 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION).

OUTLOOK

FULL YEAR 2015, SEGMENT VOLUMES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW WITH GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WITH FULL YEAR SALES UP LOW-SINGLE DIGITS ON A PERCENT BASIS. FULL YEAR PTOI IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT FLAT AS HIGHER VOLUMES ARE OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY AND PORTFOLIO CHANGES.

THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DEMAND IN AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRIMARILY IN CHINA, EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA.

2014 PTOI AND PTOI MARGIN INCREASED, DUE PRIMARILY TO A $391 MILLION PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF GLS/VINYLS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF PORTFOLIO CHANGES. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $99 MILLION WERE INCURRED IN 2014 COMPARED TO $16 MILLION IN 2013 (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE 2014 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM).

2013 VERSUS 2012

SALES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT AS INCREASED DEMAND IN PACKAGING AND AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SELLING PRICES.

PURSUANT TO ITS CASH DISCIPLINE POLICY, THE COMPANY SEEKS FIRST TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND, TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST

FOR GROWTH IS COMPELLING.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL SPENDING, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, DEBT MATURITIES AND OTHER CASH NEEDS. THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES, BILATERAL CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS AND ASSET SALES. THE COMPANY'S CURRENT STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RATINGS PROVIDE EXCELLENT ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY $4.9 BILLION IN UNUSED CREDIT LINES WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO MEET SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING LETTERS OF CREDIT.  THE AMOUNT OF UNUSED CREDIT LINES INCREASED $0.5 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2013, PRIMARILY DUE TO REFINANCING OF THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY WITH AN EXPANSION TO A FIVE YEAR $4.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY DURING 2014.

THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

AND

2013

ARE $7.0 BILLION AND $9.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013

INCLUDE THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF THE PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HELD OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. OF $4.5 BILLION AND $3.9 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

AND

2013

, RESPECTIVELY, ARE

GENERALLY UTILIZED TO FUND LOCAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS AND ARE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT NON-U.S. LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THEREAFTER. THE COMPANY EXPECTS DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY NEEDS, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THEREAFTER, WILL BE MET THROUGH EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HELD IN THE U.S. AND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING CASH GENERATED FROM U.S. OPERATIONS, ASSET SALES, THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, AND THE COMPANY'S CREDIT LINES. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT SOURCES OF DOMESTIC

LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ITS ASSUMPTION THAT UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $1.7 BILLION IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 DUE TO LOWER CASH FROM EARNINGS AND HIGHER WORKING CAPITAL IN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT.  LOWER EARNINGS WERE DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF 11 MONTHS OF RESULTS FROM THE PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT.  HIGHER WORKING CAPITAL IN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT WAS A RESULT OF HIGHER TRADE RECEIVABLES DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2013 AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER CREDIT SALES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IN ADDITION THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT'S WORKING CAPITAL WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN 2013 AS A RESULT OF TIMING DIFFERENCES IN WHEN CUSTOMER PREPAYMENTS FOR THE 2012 AND 2013 GROWING SEASONS WERE COLLECTED.

THE $3.6 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2014 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BORROWINGS AND HIGHER PAYMENTS FOR THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK.

THE $1.2 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2013 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER BORROWINGS AND LOWER PAYMENTS FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO COMMON AND PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS WERE $1.7 BILLION, $1.7 BILLION, AND $1.6 BILLION IN 2014, 2013, AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.  DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK WERE $1.84, $1.78, AND $1.70 IN 2014, 2013, AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.  WITH THE FIRST QUARTER 2015 DIVIDEND, THE COMPANY HAS PAID QUARTERLY CONSECUTIVE DIVIDENDS SINCE THE COMPANY’S FIRST DIVIDEND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 1904.

IN JANUARY 2014, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN THAT REPLACED THE 2011 PLAN.  IN FEBRUARY AND AUGUST 2014, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO TWO SEPARATE ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (ASR) AGREEMENTS.  THE FEBRUARY 2014 ASR AGREEMENT WAS COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 15.1 MILLION SHARES FOR $1 BILLION.  THE AUGUST 2014 ASR AGREEMENT WAS COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 10.4 MILLION SHARES FOR $700 MILLION.  IN ADDITION TO THE ASR AGREEMENTS, IN 2014, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 4.7 MILLION SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR A TOTAL COST OF $300 MILLION.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED $2 BILLION OF REPURCHASES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.

FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT NOT RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANIES DO NOT CALCULATE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THE SAME MANNER AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S FREE CASH FLOW DEFINITION MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGIES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND THEREFORE INDICATES OPERATING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND IS AN INTEGRAL FINANCIAL MEASURE USED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ARE TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MEASURING THE COST AND BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY AS OF DECEMBER 31

ST

. THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS APPROPRIATE. AS PERMITTED BY GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PLAN'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS, THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT 79 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BENEFIT PLANS IN THE U.S.  IN THE U.S. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE, APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY, AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

WITHIN THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERAT

ION. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTION

S OF INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES OVE

R THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED R

ETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.

IN DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS RATHER THAN ITS FAIR VALUE. THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS IS CALCULATED BY AVERAGING MARKET RETURNS OVER 36 MONTHS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY BE A LAG IN RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A

RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

IN OCTOBER 2014, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RELEASED FINAL REPORTS OF NEW MORTALITY TABLES AND A MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE FOR MEASUREMENT OF RETIREMENT PROGRAM OBLIGATIONS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THESE TABLES IN MEASURING THE 2014 LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.  THIS ADOPTION HAS INCREASED THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 BY APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION. THE EFFECT OF THIS ADOPTION WILL BE AMORTIZED INTO NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST BEGINNING IN 2015 AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSES, LIABILITIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS DISCUSSED UNDER "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 39 AND IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE.  THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $478 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.  AS REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP PRECISE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.  THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO $1.1 BILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS.  THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ACCRUALS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT AND STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS, SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR MATTER.  PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES.  IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS.  THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED, INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING THE MATTER THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND THE MATTER'S CURRENT STATUS.  CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION ACCRUAL WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A COURT PROCEEDING.  IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF, BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNED ON APPEAL.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION MATTERS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING TAXES THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S TAX ASSETS AND TAX LIABILITIES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT NET REDUCTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE IN THE RANGE OF $100 MILLION TO $125 MILLION WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WITH THE MAJORITY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WITH VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, THE COMPANY HAD A DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE OF $7.5 BILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $1.8 BILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ASSETS.  SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE.

VALUATION OF ASSETS

THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE MEASURED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED, INCLUDING IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES, IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. THE DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF FAIR VALUE TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS BASED ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND VALUATION METHODOLOGIES REQUIRING CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATES BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION, CURRENT MARKET DATA AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED IN THE COMPANY'S VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES, OPERATING MARGIN ESTIMATES, ROYALTY RATES, AND DISCOUNT RATES. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATES WERE DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION, THOSE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S NORMAL ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS.  TESTING FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME.  THE DYNAMIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES OPERATE, AND KEY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTED SELLING PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS.  ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  CHANGES IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIME IN WHICH SUCH IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS TO ENSURE THEY ARE ACHIEVING THEIR GREATEST POTENTIAL AND ARE ALIGNED WITH THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY.  STRATEGIC DECISIONS INVOLVING A PARTICULAR GROUP OF ASSETS MAY TRIGGER AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE RELATED ASSETS. SUCH AN ASSESSMENT COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2014, WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE, AND THEREFORE THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS USING THE INCOME APPROACH BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  THE INCOME APPROACH HAS BEEN GENERALLY SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL MARKET TRANSACTION ANALYSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FORECASTED CASH FLOW AND REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH RATES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF THE ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UTILIZED ARE BOTH REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES (OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS). APPROXIMATELY 79 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS. PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE PENSION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.

THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE U.S. ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS, BUT RECEIVE BENEFITS IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS' ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.  NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2014 AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE LESS THAN $50 MILLION IN 2015.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS' FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $190 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2014.

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY'S REMAINING PENSION PLANS WITH NO PLAN ASSETS ARE PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY MADE BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF $121 MILLION TO ITS UNFUNDED PLANS IN 2014.

THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRE-TAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $233 MILLION, $207 MILLION AND $261 MILLION FOR 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS REFLECT THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS, DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES.

IN 2015, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT THE SAME AS 2014 FOR PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, ITS REMAINING PLANS WITH NO PLAN ASSETS AND ITS OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

THE COMPANY'S INCOME CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMPANY'S INCOME OVER EACH OF THE LAST 3 YEARS WAS AFFECTED BY PRE-TAX CHARGES RELATED TO LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

THE LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CHARGES RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE $0, $5 AND $74 FOR 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ABOVE CHARGES FOR PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR.   THE DECREASE IN LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2014 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED PENSION ASSET RETURNS.  THE DECREASE IN LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2013 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RETIREE MEDICAL AND DENTAL PLAN AMENDMENT IN 2012 AND THE PERFORMANCE COATINGS SALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DISCOUNT RATES. SEE "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" UNDER THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE 34 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

THE COMPANY'S KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND THE DISCOUNT RATE (SEE NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2015, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT $190 MILLION DUE TO LOWER DISCOUNT RATES AND THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW MORTALITY TABLES IN THE U.S. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014  (SEE NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW MORTALITY TABLES).

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, PRODUCT HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  SUCH RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY THE IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY, AND THE COMPANY MONITORS THESE CHANGES CLOSELY.  COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTS VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, MINIMIZE THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WATER USE AND DISCHARGES, INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS.  MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A GLOBAL UPWARD TREND IN THE AMOUNT AND COMPLEXITY OF PROPOSED CHEMICALS REGULATION.  THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ENVIRONMENTAL OPERATING COSTS

AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY INCURS COSTS FOR POLLUTION ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROLS AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT, EMISSIONS TESTING AND MONITORING, AND OBTAINING PERMITS. THE COMPANY ALSO INCURS COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD AND TREATMENT STUDIES AS WELL AS TOXICITY AND DEGRADATION TESTING TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PRODUCTS AND RAW MATERIALS.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA OR SUPERFUND) OR SIMILAR STATE LAWS AT ABOUT 500 SITES AROUND THE U.S., INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 100 SITES FOR WHICH DUPONT DOES NOT BELIEVE IT HAS LIABILITY BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION. ACTIVE REMEDIATION IS UNDER WAY AT APPROXIMATELY 140 OF THESE SITES.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED

ITS LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 190 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN "DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS" WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANY'S, REPRESENTED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT THREE NEW SITES DURING

2014

COMPARED WITH FIVE SIMILAR NOTICES IN BOTH

2013

AND

2012.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS, AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO $1.1 BILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014.

HOWEVER, BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY LOSS, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ACCRUED, RELATED TO REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT ANY INDIVIDUAL SITE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

IN

2014

, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $84 MILLION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BE ABOUT $75 MILLION IN

2015.

IN THE U.S., ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA).  UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

CLIMATE CHANGE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE THAT PRESENTS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES. EXPANDING UPON SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTIONS MADE IN THE PERIOD 1990-2004, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT, ACHIEVING IN 2013 REDUCTIONS OF 19 PERCENT IN GHG EMISSIONS AND 18 PERCENT IN WATER CONSUMPTION VERSUS OUR 2004 BASELINES. IN ADDITION, IN 2013 THE COMPANY ACHIEVED A 4 PERCENT REDUCTION IN ENERGY INTENSITY FROM NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES VERSUS A 2010 BASELINE. THE COMPANY CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED DEMANDS OF A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY.  ABOUT $2.5 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S 2013 REVENUE WAS GENERATED FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT HELP DIRECT AND DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND/OR REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS.

THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO DEVELOP CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC POLICIES TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AND ENCOURAGE LOWER CARBON FORMS OF ENERGY. SUCH POLICIES MAY BRING HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AS WELL AS GREATER REVENUE AND MARGIN OPPORTUNITIES. LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CONTROL OR LIMIT GHG EMISSIONS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ENERGY SOURCE AND SUPPLY CHOICES AS WELL AS INCREASE THE COST OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM FOSSIL FUELS. SUCH EFFORTS ARE ALSO ANTICIPATED TO PROVIDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THE REGULATORY FUTURE, HELP GUIDE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND DRIVE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR LOW-CARBON AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO GROW FOR PRODUCTS THAT FACILITATE ADAPTATION TO A CHANGING CLIMATE.

THERE ARE EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS GHG EMISSIONS AT THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS.  SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ARE REGULATED UNDER THE EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME.

CHINA HAS BEGUN PILOT PROGRAMS FOR CARBON TAXES AND TRADING OF GHG EMISSIONS IN SELECTED AREAS.  IN THE EU, U.S. AND JAPAN, POLICY EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH GASES USED IN REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING CREATE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER GHG SOLUTIONS.

THE CURRENT UNSETTLED POLICY ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.S., WHERE MANY COMPANY FACILITIES ARE LOCATED, ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY TO BUSINESS DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.

13

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

IN 2010, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) LAUNCHED A PHASED-IN SCHEME TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS FIRST FROM LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES UNDER THE EXISTING CAA PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO INSTALL BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY ON MAJOR NEW OR MODIFIED SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS. IN 2014, THE EPA PROPOSED REGULATIONS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM NEW ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGU'S). IN 2014, THE EPA ALSO PROPOSED NEW REGULATIONS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING AND RECONSTRUCTED/MODIFIED EGUS THAT WOULD BE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL STATE EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. WHEN FINALIZED IN 2015, THESE RULES MAY AFFECT THE LONG TERM PRICE AND SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS AND DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE PRECISE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED TO THE STATES IN DEVELOPING THEIR PROGRAMS AND ANTICIPATED LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THIS REGULATORY APPROACH. A COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL POLICY THAT ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE BY RELYING ON MARKET-BASED MECHANISMS TO DRIVE REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GASES IS LIKELY TO BE MORE ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT THAN THE FACILITY-BY-FACILITY CONTROLS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF CURRENT PROPOSED RULES UNDER EPA’S EXISTING AUTHORITIES.

AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REGIONAL OR NATIONAL APPROACHES COULD PRESENT CHALLENGES IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR COORDINATED GLOBAL POLICY ACTIONS.  AN EFFECTIVE GLOBAL CLIMATE POLICY FRAMEWORK WILL HELP DRIVE THE MARKET CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO STIMULATE AND EFFICIENTLY DEPLOY NEW INNOVATIONS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WHILE MAINTAINING OPEN AND COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETS.

PFOA

THE PERFORMANCE CH

EMICALS SEGMENT USED A FORM OF PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT) AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE SOME FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS.  THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT USED PFOA IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS FOR PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS (AND SOME FLUOROELASTOMERS).  IN THE FALL OF 2002, DUPONT BEGAN PRODUCING RATHER THAN PURCHASING PFOA TO SUPPORT THESE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.  PFOA IS NOT USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FLUOROTELOMERS; HOWEVER, IT IS AN UNINTENDED BY-PRODUCT PRESENT AT TRACE LEVELS IN SOME FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS.

PFOA IS BIO-PERSISTENT AND HAS BEEN DETECTED AT VERY LOW LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPOSURE ROUTES AND POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF PFOA.  REGULATORY AGENCIES CONTINUE TO REVIEW THESE STUDIES TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL REGULATION.

IN JANUARY 2006, DUPONT PLEDGED ITS COMMITMENT TO EPA'S 2010/15 PFOA STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM.  THE EPA PROGRAM ASKS PARTICIPANTS (1) TO COMMIT TO ACHIEVE, NO LATER THAN 2010, A 95 PERCENT REDUCTION IN BOTH FACILITY EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT CONTENT LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS AND (2) TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE ELIMINATION OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY NO LATER THAN 2015.

AS OF THE FOURTH QUARTER 2013, DUPONT HAD ALREADY CEASED THE MANUFACTURE OF PFOA AND DISCONTINUED THE USE OF PFOA FOR PRODUCTION OF FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AS WELL AS FOR RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PERFLUOROELASTOMER PARTS AND FLUOROELASTOMERS. IN ADDITION, AS OF THE FOURTH QUARTER 2014, THE COMPANY COMPLETED REPLACEMENT OF FLUOROTELOMER-BASED PRODUCTS WITH ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS.

DUPONT HAS MET ITS COMMITMENT TO THE EPA 2010/15 PFOA STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. ALSO, DUPONT HAS MET ITS 2007 COMMITMENT TO NO LONGER MAKE, USE OR BUY PFOA BY 2015.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING PFOA MATTERS, SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE DERIVATIVES AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SEE NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE USD AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS.

SINCE THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE FOR EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD BE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER.  AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE REPRESENTED MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC, INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY INDUSTRY AND REGION.

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) AND ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP. THEIR REPORT IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

I.

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

II.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

III.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITIONS, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES MAY CAUSE VARIATION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A) (2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013) ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN "MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING" APPEARING ON PAGE F-2.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

SEE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEGINNING ON PAGE F-9.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY METHOD.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS OF VIES FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING THAT ARE VIES.  THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIES DOES NOT PROVIDE IT THE POWER TO DIRECT THE VIES SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES.  FUTURE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THESE VIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE COMPANY BECOMES THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS RELATED TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES IS NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR'S DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR'S PRESENTATION.

THE COMPANY’S COST STRUCTURE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE GLOBAL, MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO REDESIGN ITS GLOBAL ORGANIZATION AND OPERATING MODEL TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND AGILITY ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES AND FUNCTIONS. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2014, IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN TO THE TRANSFORMING COMPANY’S ORGANIZATION AND RESULTING COST STRUCTURE, CERTAIN COSTS WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM OTHER OPERATING CHARGES TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. PRIOR YEAR DATA HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

IN NOVEMBER 2013, DUPONT ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL GLASS LAMINATING SOLUTIONS/VINYLS (GLS/VINYLS), A PART OF THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS SEGMENT. THE ASSETS RELATED TO GLS/VINYLS AT DECEMBER 31, 2013 ARE PRESENTED AS HELD FOR SALE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. IN JUNE 2014, THE COMPANY SOLD GLS/VINYLS TO KURARAY CO. LTD.  THE SALE OF GLS/VINYLS DOES NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, EARNINGS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS (WHICH REPRESENTED A REPORTABLE SEGMENT).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS FROM CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MAY NOT EQUAL THE TOTAL COMPANY EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS DUE TO ROUNDING.  THE CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO PERFORMANCE COATINGS HAVE NOT BEEN SEGREGATED AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. AMOUNTS RELATED TO PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED IN OR EXCLUDED FROM THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM AND PERIOD OF EACH DISCLOSURE.

SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THE ABOVE MATTERS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE FROM THE SALE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED, COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND PRICING IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE. A MAJORITY OF PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD FOB (FREE ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO NON UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.) CUSTOMERS, AN EQUIVALENT BASIS.  ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT AND RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE (CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES) OR DEBT, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE, OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.

LICENSING AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH APPROXIMATES CARRYING VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

AND

2013

, WAS DETERMINED USING LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 INPUTS WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS WERE BASED ON OBSERVED NET ASSET VALUES AND LEVEL 2 MEASUREMENTS WERE BASED ON CURRENT INTEREST RATES FOR SIMILAR INVESTMENTS WITH COMPARABLE CREDIT RISK AND TIME TO MATURITY.  THE COMPANY HELD

$1,436

AND

$5,116

OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

AND

2013

, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HELD

$3,293

AND

$2,256

OF OTHER CASH EQUIVALENTS (LEVEL 2 MEASUREMENTS) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

AND

2013

, RESPECTIVELY.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN

THREE

MONTHS AND UP TO

TWELVE

MONTHS AT TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED COST.  THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE INVESTMENTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WAS ESTABLISHED THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT'S LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FOR ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 1

–

QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2

–

SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G. QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ITEMS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ITEMS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND YIELD CURVES, AND MARKET-CORROBORATED INPUTS);

LEVEL 3

–

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

INVENTORIES

THE COMPANY'S INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.  ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

AND

2013

APPROXIMATELY

50 PERCENT

,

25 PERCENT

AND

25 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANY’S INVENTORIES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FIRST-IN FIRST OUT (FIFO), LAST-IN FIRST OUT (LIFO) AND AVERAGE COST METHODS, RESPECTIVELY. INVENTORIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FIFO METHOD ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS WITH SHORTER SHELF LIVES SUCH AS SEEDS, CERTAIN FOOD-INGREDIENTS AND ENZYMES.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS CARRIED AT COST AND IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED UNDER THE SUM-OF-THE-YEARS' DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR METHODS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM

15

TO

25

YEARS. CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

5

TO

7

YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE FUTURE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARISING FROM OTHER ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIED AND SEPARATELY RECOGNIZED. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.  IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER 2014, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING FROM SEPTEMBER 30

TH

TO JULY 1

ST

.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS TIMING IS PREFERABLE AS IT BETTER ALIGNS THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WITH ITS STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLANNING CYCLE. THIS CHANGE DID NOT RESULT IN THE DELAY, ACCELERATION OR AVOIDANCE OF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.  THE CHANGE WAS APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY, AS RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRACTICAL BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OBJECTIVELY SELECT ASSUMPTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN PREVIOUS PERIODS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT.  THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014 AND DETERMINED THAT NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE NECESSARY.

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED AND LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

20

YEARS OR AMORTIZED BASED ON UNITS OF PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET GROUP IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSETS ARE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE WHICH IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR USE UNTIL THEIR DISPOSAL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR MARKET VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. DEPRECIATION IS DISCONTINUED FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS (PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF EMPLOYEE COSTS, MATERIALS, CONTRACT SERVICES, RESEARCH AGREEMENTS, AND OTHER EXTERNAL SPEND) RELATING TO THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, ENHANCEMENT OF EXISTING PRODUCTS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE, THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

25

YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, VEHICLE LIABILITY AND EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF RELEVANT RISKS.  A RECEIVABLE FOR AN INSURANCE RECOVERY IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LOSS HAS OCCURRED AND COLLECTION IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE.

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET, WITHIN OTHER INCOME, NET. INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE U.S. DOLLAR (USD) OR LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, WHERE APPLICABLE. THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES ITS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FOREIGN ENTITIES AND GROUPS THE FOREIGN ENTITIES INTO TWO CATEGORIES: 1) EXTENSION OF THE PARENT (USD FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY) AND 2) SELF-CONTAINED (LOCAL FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY). IF A FOREIGN ENTITY DOES NOT ALIGN WITH EITHER CATEGORY, FACTORS ARE EVALUATED AND A JUDGMENT IS MADE TO DETERMINE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

FOR FOREIGN ENTITIES WHERE THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR FOREIGN ENTITIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES AND THE RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN EQUITY. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE REMEASURED INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD AND THE RESULTANT EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD.

THE COMPANY CHANGES THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF ITS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FOREIGN ENTITIES ONLY WHEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE CLEARLY THAT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY HAS CHANGED. AS A RESULT OF THE SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT, COUPLED WITH THE COMPANY’S REDESIGN INITIATIVE, THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AT CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN ENTITIES IS BEING RE-EVALUATED AND, IN SOME CASES, WILL RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE FOREIGN ENTITIES’ FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DURING 2015. THIS RE-EVALUATION WILL NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

VENEZUELAN FOREIGN CURRENCY

VENEZUELA IS CONSIDERED A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY UNDER GAAP AND THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES IN VENEZUELA.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER 2014, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT ENACTED CERTAIN CHANGES TO THE COUNTRY’S FOREIGN EXCHANGE SYSTEMS INCLUDING THE EXPANSION OF THE USE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY SYSTEM OF FOREIGN CURRENCY ACQUIREMENT (SICAD 1) AUCTION RATE AND INTRODUCTION OF THE SICAD 2 AUCTION PROCESS.  THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE CONTINUES TO BE SET THROUGH THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR FOREIGN COMMERCE (CENCOEX, PREVIOUSLY CADIVI) AT

6.3

BOLIVAR FUERTES (BSF) TO USD. BASED ON ITS EVALUATION OF THE RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS AFFECTING THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIFIC EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISMS, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE SICAD 2 AUCTION PROCESS WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY MECHANISM AVAILABLE.   AS A RESULT, EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, 2014, THE COMPANY CHANGED FROM THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE TO THE SICAD 2 EXCHANGE RATE OF

49.98

, TO REMEASURE ITS BSF DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF

$58

. THE CHARGE IS RECORDED WITHIN OTHER INCOME, NET IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE SICAD 2 EXCHANGE RATE TO REMEASURE ITS VENEZUELAN BSF DENOMINATED REVENUES, EXPENSES AND NET MONETARY ASSETS UNLESS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.

HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET IN THE INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT OR AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION MATURES, OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AND THE DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE.

CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EITHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. CASH FLOWS FROM ALL OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 19 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) AND THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB) JOINTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) NO. 2014-9, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606), WHICH CLARIFIES THE PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE AND DEVELOPS A COMMON REVENUE STANDARD FOR GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS).  THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE GUIDANCE IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016.  EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER GAAP AND RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION IS PERMITTED, BUT NOT REQUIRED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE AMENDING EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS REPORTING WILL BE LIMITED TO DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS THAT REPRESENT STRATEGIC SHIFTS HAVING A MAJOR EFFECT ON OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE ALSO ENHANCES DISCLOSURES AND REQUIRES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A DISCONTINUED OPERATION TO BE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. PUBLIC ENTITIES WILL APPLY THE AMENDED GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL DISPOSALS OCCURRING WITHIN ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2014 AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THIS STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2015.  DUE TO THE CHANGE IN REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURES OF FUTURE DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS AFTER ADOPTION MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS.

WHILE THE TAXATION OF THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED ON THE CHART ABOVE DOES NOT CORRESPOND PRECISELY TO THE JURISDICTION OF TAXATION (DUE TO TAXATION IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES, EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES, ETC.), IT REPRESENTS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES SPLIT BETWEEN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS.

EACH YEAR THE COMPANY FILES HUNDREDS OF TAX RETURNS IN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXING JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND POSSIBLE CHALLENGE BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES. POSITIONS CHALLENGED BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED OR APPEALED BY THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT NET REDUCTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE IN THE RANGE OF

®

HERBICIDE CAUSED DAMAGE TO CERTAIN TREES. SALES OF IMPRELIS

®

WERE SUSPENDED IN AUGUST 2011 AND THE PRODUCT WAS LAST APPLIED DURING THE 2011 SPRING APPLICATION SEASON. THE LAWSUITS SEEKING CLASS ACTION STATUS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION IN FEDERAL COURT IN PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA. IN FEBRUARY 2014, THE COURT ENTERED THE FINAL ORDER DISMISSING THESE LAWSUITS AS A RESULT OF THE CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT.

AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, DUPONT PAID ABOUT

$7

IN PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, DUPONT IS PROVIDING A WARRANTY AGAINST NEW DAMAGE, IF ANY, CAUSED BY THE USE OF IMPRELIS

®

ON CLASS MEMBERS' PROPERTIES THROUGH MAY 2015.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, COMM

ERCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ANTITRUST LAWSUITS.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THEIR RESOLUTION WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.  HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED.

PFOA

DUPONT USED PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT), AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE SOME FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN WEST VIRGINIA. AT

DUPONT AND ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN 2004 THAT BINDS ABOUT

80,000

, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY HEALTH PROJECT.  THE COMPANY FUNDED A SERIES OF HEALTH STUDIES WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2012 BY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS (THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL). THE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY PROBABLE LINK EXISTS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE.

THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL FOUND PROBABLE LINKS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, INCLUDING PREECLAMPSIA; KIDNEY CANCER; TESTICULAR CANCER; THYROID DISEASE; ULCERATIVE COLITIS; AND DIAGNOSED HIGH CHOLESTEROL.

IN MAY 2013, A PANEL OF THREE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL DOCTORS RELEASED ITS INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OF ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS.  IN SEPTEMBER 2014, THE MEDICAL PANEL RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING THREE YEARS AFTER INITIAL TESTING, BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RESULTS.  THE MEDICAL PANEL HAS NOT COMMUNICATED ITS ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETION OF ITS PROTOCOL.  THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO FUND UP TO

$235

FOR A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS AND, IN ADDITION, ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING CLASS COUNSEL FEES.  IN JANUARY 2012, THE COMPANY PUT

$1

IN AN ESCROW ACCOUNT TO FUND MEDICAL MONITORING AS REQUIRED BY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE COURT APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL MONITORING HAS ESTABLISHED THE PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT THE MEDICAL PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, AS WELL AS ELIGIBILITY SCREENING, IS ONGOING. DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING AND TESTING HAS BEGUN AND ASSOCIATED PAYMENTS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE BEING DISBURSED FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WATER TREATMENT DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PFOA IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER DISTRICTS, INCLUDING THE LITTLE HOCKING WATER ASSOCIATION (LHWA), AND PRIVATE WELL USERS.

CLASS MEMBERS MAY PURSUE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST DUPONT ONLY FOR THOSE HUMAN DISEASES FOR WHICH THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL DETERMINED A PROBABLE LINK EXISTS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY

2,900

LAWSUITS FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS IN OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT

2,800

OVER YEAR END

2013

.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH A STIPULATION REACHED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2014 AND OTHER COURT PROCEDURES, THESE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE SERVED AND CONSOLIDATED IN MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION IN OHIO FEDERAL COURT (“MDL”).  BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY THE MAJORITY OF THE LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND THYROID DISEASE FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER.  THERE ARE

27

LAWSUITS ALLEGING WRONGFUL DEATH.  BASED ON COMMENTS FROM ATTORNEYS FOR THE PLAINTIFFS, DUPONT EXPECTS ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS MAY BE FILED. IN 2014,

SIX

PLAINTIFFS FROM THE MDL WERE SELECTED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TRIAL.  THE FIRST TRIAL IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN SEPTEMBER 2015, AND THE SECOND IN NOVEMBER 2015. DUPONT DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS IN THESE LAWSUITS AND IS DEFENDING ITSELF VIGOROUSLY.

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS

AN OHIO ACTION BROUGHT BY THE LHWA IS ONGOING. IN ADDITION TO GENERAL CLAIMS OF PFOA CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER, THE ACTION CLAIMS “IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO HEALTH AND OR THE ENVIRONMENT” UNDER THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA). IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2014, DUPONT FILED A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT WHICH IF GRANTED, WILL BE DISPOSITIVE OF THIS MATTER.  THE LHWA HAS MOVED FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT.  DUPONT DENIES THESE CLAIMS AND IS DEFENDING ITSELF VIGOROUSLY.

WHILE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL INCUR COSTS RELATED TO FUNDING THE MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM, SUCH COSTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION BY ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS AND THE SCOPE OF TESTING.  DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO THE OTHER PFOA MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE; HOWEVER, A RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES, IF ANY, CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO CORRECT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR RELEASES OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET FORTH IN NOTE 1.  MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SUPERFUND), RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE AND GLOBAL LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE, REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED.  THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED A LIABILITY OF

$478

, RELATING TO THESE MATTERS AND, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE AVERAGE TIME FRAME, OVER WHICH THE ACCRUED OR PRESENTLY UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS MAY BE PAID, BASED ON PAST HISTORY, IS ESTIMATED TO BE

15

-

20

YEARS.  CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO

$1,100

ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014.

17.  LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY OFFERS VARIOUS LONG-TERM BENEFITS TO ITS EMPLOYEES. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE THE PLANS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS

THE COMPANY HAS BOTH FUNDED AND UNFUNDED NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING A MAJORITY OF THE U.S. EMPLOYEES. MOST EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. THE BENEFITS UNDER THESE PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. THE COMPANY'S FUNDING POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH PLANS ARE FUNDED BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH TRUSTEES, COVERED BY INSURANCE CONTRACTS, OR REMAIN UNFUNDED.

OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE PARENT COMPANY AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. THE ASSOCIATED PLANS FOR RETIREE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM COMPANY FUNDS. ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COST AND LIABILITIES FOR THESE RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. PARENT COMPANY PLANS. THE NON-MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS CONTRIBUTORY WITH PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS' CONTRIBUTIONS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY TO ACHIEVE A 50/50 TARGET SHARING OF COST INCREASES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. IN ADDITION, LIMITS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF THE RETIREE MEDICAL COST COVERAGE.  FOR MEDICARE ELIGIBLE PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES A COMPANY-FUNDED HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENT (HRA). BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015, ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE ON AND AFTER THAT DATE WILL RECEIVE THE SAME LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PAYMENT, REGARDLESS OF AGE.THE MAJORITY OF U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES DISABILITY BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE DISABILITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE INSURED IN MANY COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., SUCH PLANS ARE GENERALLY SELF-INSURED. OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSES FOR SELF-INSURED PLANS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIGURES BELOW.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLANNED SALE OF THE PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS (SEE NOTE 2), THE COMPANY UPDATED THE DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS DURING 2012.  FOR DETERMINING THE U.S. PENSION PLANS' NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS, THE WEIGHTED DISCOUNT RATE, WEIGHTED EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE WERE

4.38 PERCENT

,

8.96 PERCENT

AND

4.40 PERCENT

FOR 2012.

WITH THE CONTINUING CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY LOWERED ITS LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS DURING 2012.

IN THE U.S., THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IN THE U.S. WAS SELECTED FROM WITHIN THE REASONABLE RANGE OF RATES DETERMINED BY HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.  FOR NON-U.S. PLANS, ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY.

IN OCTOBER 2014, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RELEASED FINAL REPORTS OF NEW MORTALITY TABLES AND A MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE FOR MEASUREMENT OF RETIREMENT PROGRAM OBLIGATIONS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THESE TABLES IN MEASURING THE 2014 LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

PLAN ASSETS

ALL PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. ARE INVESTED THROUGH A SINGLE MASTER TRUST FUND. THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THIS TRUST FUND IS APPROVED BY MANAGEMENT. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GUIDING U.S. PENSION ASSET INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE THOSE EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE "PRUDENT EXPERT" STANDARD AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET LIABILITY STUDIES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCESS. U.S. PLAN ASSETS AND A PORTION OF NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. THE REMAINING ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT FIRMS UNRELATED TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S PENSION INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DISCRETION TO MANAGE THE ASSETS WITHIN ESTABLISHED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES APPROVED BY MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, PENSION TRUST FUNDS ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS "DERIVATIVES". DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS, HEDGE CURRENCY AND ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE TARGET ALLOCATION FOR PLAN ASSETS OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN (THE PLAN). THIS PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE RETIREMENT SAVINGS BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

100 PERCENT

OF THE FIRST

6 PERCENT

OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION ELECTION AND  ALSO CONTRIBUTES

3 PERCENT

OF EACH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE'S ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION.

IN APRIL 2011, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO THE DUPONT EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP). THE EIP PROVIDES FOR EQUITY-BASED AND CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AND CONSULTANTS. UNDER THE AMENDED EIP, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR THE GRANT OR SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS IS

110 MILLION

SHARES, PROVIDED THAT EACH SHARE IN EXCESS OF

30 MILLION

THAT IS ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD THAT IS NOT AN OPTION OR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE

110 MILLION

SHARE LIMIT AS FOUR AND ONE-HALF SHARES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

, APPROXIMATELY

45 MILLION

SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE COMPANY'S EIP. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (PSUS) WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK.

THE COMPANY'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, RSUS AND PSUS AND MAY AUTHORIZE NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE EXERCISE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2004 EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT; OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2008 SERIALLY VESTED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND CARRY A

SIX

-YEAR OPTION TERM. STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED BETWEEN 2009 AND

2014

EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. THE PLAN ALLOWS RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO RETAIN ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING GRANT DATE.

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AWARDS, THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE ASSUMPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN

2014

19.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS.  THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS TO BE UTILIZED FOR FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT. THESE PROGRAMS REFLECT VARYING LEVELS OF EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK.

DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS HAVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS AND ARE APPROVED BY THE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED ARE FORWARDS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES ALSO ADDRESS COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, LIMITS AND ROUTINE EXPOSURE MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES COLLATERAL SUPPORT ANNEX AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSSES. THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS AND THEREFORE NO MATERIAL LOSS IS EXPECTED.  MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.  THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR.  INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS COPPER, CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.  THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

INTEREST RATE SWAPS

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014

THE COMPANY MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME DEBT INSTRUMENTS WERE ISSUED.  ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THESE HEDGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FORWARDS AND OPTIONS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OCCASIONALLY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS, TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

WHILE EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD, MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR PERIOD.  CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE AFTER-TAX EFFECT OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ON ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ARE MINIMIZED.  THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING; HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INTENDS TO ACHIEVE A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY UTILIZED CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON LONG-TERM INTERCOMPANY LOANS. THESE SWAPS MATURED DURING 2013.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.
