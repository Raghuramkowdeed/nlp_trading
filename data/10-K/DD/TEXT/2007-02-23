BACKLOG

THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER BACKLOG TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

INDICATOR OF THE LEVEL OF FUTURE SALES ACTIVITY. IN GENERAL, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS AGAINST A BACKLOG OF

ORDERS. PRODUCTION AND INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BASED ON THE LEVEL

OF INCOMING ORDERS AS WELL AS PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE DEMAND.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BACKLOG INFORMATION IS NOT

MATERIAL TO UNDERSTANDING ITS OVERALL BUSINESS AND SHOULD NOT BE

CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

PATENTS

AND TRADEMARKS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PATENT AND TRADEMARK ESTATE

PROVIDES IT WITH AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IT HAS

ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ATTORNEYS, AS WELL AS BRANDING,

ADVERTISING AND LICENSING PROFESSIONALS, TO PROCURE, MAINTAIN,

PROTECT, ENHANCE AND GAIN VALUE FROM THIS ESTATE.

THE COMPANY OWNS AND IS LICENSED UNDER VARIOUS PATENTS, WHICH

EXPIRE FROM TIME TO TIME, COVERING MANY PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND

PRODUCT USES. THESE PATENTS PROTECT MANY ASPECTS OF THE

COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND THE GOODS AND

SERVICES IT SELLS. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THESE

PATENTS VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND DEPENDS UPON THE

SCOPE OF COVERAGE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PATENT AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH COUNTRY. THE COMPANY OWNS

APPROXIMATELY 21,000 WORLDWIDE PATENTS AND APPROXIMATELY 15,000

WORLDWIDE PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN 2006, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED

ABOUT 500 U.S. PATENTS AND ABOUT 1,900 INTERNATIONAL

PATENTS. THE COMPANYS RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND

LICENSES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE

IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, AND TO VARYING DEGREES,

IMPORTANT TO EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS TO PHARMACEUTICALS, SEE THE SEGMENT

DISCUSSION ON PAGE 37 OF THIS REPORT.

THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER AND THE REST OF THE COMPANIES

WITHIN THE SEED INDUSTRY COMPETE IS INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY NEW

PATENTS, PATENT POSITIONS, PATENT LAWSUITS AND THE STATUS OF

VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OWNERSHIP OF AND ACCESS TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO

BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GERMPLASM, ARE IMPORTANT TO PIONEER AND ITS

COMPETITORS. NO SINGLE PATENT OWNED BY PIONEER OR ITS

COMPETITORS IS ESSENTIAL TO PIONEERS ABILITY TO COMPETE.

HOWEVER, PIONEER WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS FREEDOM TO OPERATE

ISSUES BY ENFORCING ITS OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

CHALLENGING CLAIMS MADE BY OTHERS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE,

OBTAINING LICENSES TO IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS.

THE COMPANY HAS APPROXIMATELY 1,900 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR ITS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 17,000 WORLDWIDE

REGISTRATIONS AND APPLICATIONS FOR THESE TRADEMARKS. OWNERSHIP

RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS ARE

CONTINUED IN USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED. THE COMPANY HAS MANY

TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER

RETAIL LEVEL

AND/OR

BUSINESS TO BUSINESS LEVEL. SIGNIFICANT TRADEMARKS AT THE

CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL INCLUDE THE DUPONT OVAL AND

DUPONT

TM

(THE DUPONT BRAND TRADEMARKS);

PIONEER

®

BRAND SEEDS;

TEFLON

®

FLUOROPOLYMERS, FILMS, FABRIC PROTECTORS, FIBERS AND

DISPERSIONS;

CORIAN

®

SURFACES;

KEVLAR

®

HIGH STRENGTH MATERIAL; AND

TYVEK

®

PROTECTIVE MATERIAL. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY PURSUING LICENSING

OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED TRADEMARKS AT THE RETAIL LEVEL. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE DUPONT BRAND TRADEMARKS HAVE BEEN LICENSED FOR HARD

SURFACE FLOORING, AUTOMOTIVE APPEARANCE PRODUCTS, AIR

FILTRATION, WATER FILTRATION AND LUBRICANTS. IN ADDITION, THE

TEFLON

®

TRADEMARK HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH LICENSING TO PERSONAL CARE

PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE CARE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE WIPER BLADES, EYE

GLASS LENSES, HOME CARE PRODUCTS, LUBRICANTS, PAINT, PAINT

ACCESSORIES, COOKWARE AND SMALL APPLIANCES.

AS PART OF THE SALE OF INVISTA TO KOCH IN 2004, DUPONT

TRANSFERRED CERTAIN PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS

CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND THEIR RELATED REGISTRATIONS AND

APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THIS TRANSFER, KOCH AND DUPONT HAVE

ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

INCLUDING PATENT AND TRADEMARK LICENSES.

SEASONALITY

SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL PATTERNS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITIONS PERFORMANCE IS STRONGEST

IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE SEGMENT GENERALLY OPERATES AT

A LOSS DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE YEAR. AS A

RESULT OF THE SEASONAL NATURE OF ITS SEED BUSINESS,

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITIONS INVENTORY IS AT ITS

HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR AND IS SOLD DOWN

IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. TRADE RECEIVABLES IN

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ARE AT A LOW POINT AT YEAR-END

AND INCREASE THROUGH THE SELLING SEASON TO PEAK AT THE END OF

THE SECOND QUARTER.

IN GENERAL, BUSINESSES IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS ARE NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS.

MARKETING

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

PIONEER

®

BRAND SEEDS AND

SOLAE

®

SOY PROTEINS, MOST PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED PRIMARILY THROUGH

DUPONTS SALES FORCE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME REGIONS, MORE

EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

PIONEER

®

BRAND PRODUCTS ARE AGGRESSIVELY PROMOTED THROUGH MULTIPLE

MARKETING CHANNELS IN NORTH AMERICA. IN THE HIGH CORN AND

SOYBEAN CONCENTRATION MARKETS OF THE U.S. CORN BELT,

PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH A SPECIALIZED FORCE OF INDEPENDENT

SALES REPRESENTATIVES. IN MORE DIVERSE CROPPING AREAS,

PIONEER

®

PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND CROP INPUT

RETAILERS.

PIONEER

®

PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA ARE MARKETED THROUGH A NETWORK

OF SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND INDEPENDENT

PRODUCER-DISTRIBUTORS.

SOLAE

®

ISOLATED AND FUNCTIONAL SOY PROTEINS ARE MARKETED USING A

COMBINATION OF OUTSIDE DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIRECT

SALES.

MAJOR

CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANYS SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A

SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER,

COLLECTIVELY, COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES AND

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS HAVE SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY IN

THE AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) INDUSTRY.

THE COMPANY HAS LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS

AND THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE SEGMENTS

OPERATING RESULTS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY COMPETES ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE,

PRODUCT QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OR SPECIFICATIONS, CONTINUITY OF

SUPPLY, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING

ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICULAR MARKET INVOLVED AND THE

PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDED.

MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES

PRINCIPALLY BASED IN THE U.S., WESTERN EUROPE, JAPAN, CHINA AND

KOREA. IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE COMPETITORS OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF

PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL, COMMODITY AND SPECIALTY CHEMICALS TO

PLASTICS, FIBERS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS. THE COMPANY ALSO

COMPETES IN CERTAIN MARKETS WITH SMALLER, MORE SPECIALIZED FIRMS

WHO OFFER A NARROW RANGE OF PRODUCTS OR CONVERTED PRODUCTS THAT

FUNCTIONALLY COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS OFFERINGS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SELLS ADVANCED PLANT GENETICS

THROUGH PIONEER, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF CORN

AND SOYBEANS AND THUS DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH OTHER SEED AND

PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

ALSO PROVIDES FOOD SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND SOY-BASED FOOD

INGREDIENTS IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR GRAIN AND FOOD

PROCESSORS.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH IN THE U.S. AT OVER 30 SITES

IN 14 STATES AT EITHER DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR

MANUFACTURING PLANTS. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF RESEARCH IS

IN THE WILMINGTON, DELAWARE AREA AT SEVERAL LARGE RESEARCH

CENTERS. AMONG THESE, THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION LABORATORIES

FRANCE, GERMANY, JAPAN, LUXEMBOURG, MEXICO, THE NETHERLANDS,

SPAIN AND SWITZERLAND. A NEW RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITY

WAS OPENED IN TAIWAN IN 2006 TO BETTER SERVE THE INTEGRATED

CIRCUIT MARKET.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS ARE TO CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES IN RELEVANT FIELDS, AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE EXISTING

PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES. EACH SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY FUNDS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS

MISSION. IN 2006, THE COMPANY BROADENED ITS SUSTAINABILITY

COMMITMENTS BEYOND ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTION TO INCLUDE

MARKET-DRIVEN TARGETS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT.

THE COMPANY WILL EXPAND ITS OFFERINGS ADDRESSING SAFETY,

ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL

MARKETPLACE BY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING RENEWABLE,

BIO-BASED MATERIALS; ADVANCED BIOFUELS; ENERGY-EFFICIENT

TECHNOLOGIES; ENHANCED SAFETY AND PROTECTION PRODUCTS; AND

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE GOALS ARE TIED

DIRECTLY TO BUSINESS GROWTH, SPECIFICALLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

SAFER AND ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPROVED NEW PRODUCTS THAT ENHANCE THE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE OF ITS TRADITIONAL BUSINESSES FOR

DUPONTS KEY GLOBAL MARKETS, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION,

BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD AND

COMMUNICATIONS.

THE CORPORATE RESEARCH LABORATORIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

CONDUCTING RESEARCH PROGRAMS ALIGNED WITH CORPORATE STRATEGY AS

PROVIDED BY THE GROWTH PLATFORMS. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES ARE ADMINISTERED BY SENIOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RISK FACTORS

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS

RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS

BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY

FACES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW. ADDITIONAL RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO THE COMPANY OR THAT THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES TO BE IMMATERIAL ALSO COULD AFFECT

ITS BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE

INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT

BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

PRICE

INCREASES FOR ENERGY COSTS AND RAW MATERIALS COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AND

GROW EARNINGS.

THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE

SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS

BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE

COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL

AND NATURAL GAS AND RAW MATERIALS AFFECT THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WHEN POSSIBLE, THE

COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE

COMPANY HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY

AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE INCREASES,

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS

IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH PRICE INCREASES IS

LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE

COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY

AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS COULD IMPACT THE

COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON

ITS ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THIS ABILITY

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW

PRODUCTS, SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OBTAIN

RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS, OBTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS,

TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND INTENSE COMPETITION, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

DEVELOPING, OR COULD BEGIN TO DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, WILL

ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. SALES OF THE

COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS COULD REPLACE SALES OF SOME OF ITS

CURRENT PRODUCTS, OFFSETTING THE BENEFIT OF EVEN A SUCCESSFUL

PRODUCT INTRODUCTION.

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND

ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND

ANTITRUST CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY

SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES,

OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES.

VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT

ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT,

SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE

ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE

CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS

COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN

COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND

INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF

THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED,

THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND PAST

OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES,

THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND

THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF

POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST

OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY

COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS,

THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. THE COSTS

OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS

WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS

UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANYS ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS

AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON

WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS

INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATION, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE

TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT

MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF

OTHER PRPS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES FROM GENETICALLY

ENHANCED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY SEEDS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE,

GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES OR REGULATIONS AND COMPETITION.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE

PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

SEGMENT. DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS

GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE

DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY

TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF CROPS GROWN FROM THOSE SEEDS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE

STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES SUPPORTING THE USE OF

BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION MARKETS. SPEED IN

DISCOVERING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING

PRODUCTS BASED ON THEM TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS

COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANYS EXISTING OR CANDIDATE

PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES.

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND LAWS OR WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

INTERNATIONAL SALES WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF ITS TOTAL SALES AND THAT CONTINUED GROWTH AND

PROFITABILITY WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

TRADE, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF U.S. AND

NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS,

AGENCIES AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDE BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO CHANGES IN A COUNTRYS OR REGIONS

ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TRADE REGULATIONS AFFECTING

PRODUCTION, PRICING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, LOCAL LABOR

CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS, REDUCED PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES, CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY OR

LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES,

BURDENSOME TAXES AND TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE BARRIERS.

INTERNATIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING CHANGING SOCIAL

AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TERRORISM, POLITICAL

HOSTILITIES AND WAR, COULD LEAD TO REDUCED INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH SALES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

ECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING INFLATION AND FLUCTUATIONS IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES

COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY

HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, THERE ARE A LARGE

NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL

SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY

ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES

AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THESE RISKS COULD HAVE

AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT THE

COMPANYS FUTURE REVENUE AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

INCREASE COSTS AND EXPENSES.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, INCREASING

COSTS FOR ENERGY, TEMPORARY PLANT

AND/OR

POWER

OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND NETWORK

DISRUPTIONS, COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.

ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR

CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, THEY COULD RESULT IN REDUCED

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR

IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS

OR TO RECEIVE RAW MATERIALS FROM SUPPLIERS, CREATE DELAYS AND

INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND RESULT IN THE NEED TO

IMPOSE EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY

MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD CAUSE BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM BUSINESS

DISRUPTIONS REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM OR

WAR, NATURAL DISASTERS AND SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS. DESPITE THESE

EFFORTS, THE IMPACT FROM BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE

ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

INABILITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE COMPANYS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE

PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS

ARE IMPORTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN

PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL

CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND

TRADE SECRETS. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES MAY ACCESS AND USE SUCH PROPERTY. WHEN

MISAPPROPRIATION IS DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH

SITUATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR

INVESTIGATION AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL

IMPACT.

PLANTS NEW SOURCE REVIEW ENFORCEMENT ACTION

IN 2003, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND FINDING OF

VIOLATION FOR THE COMPANYS FORT HILL SULFURIC

ACID PLANT IN NORTH BEND, OHIO. THE EPA CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF

CAPITAL PROJECTS AT THE PLANT OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. BASED

ON ITS REVIEW, THE EPA BELIEVES THAT TWO OF THE PROJECTS

TRIGGERED A REQUIREMENT TO MEET THE NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE

STANDARDS FOR SULFURIC ACID PLANTS AND THAT THE COMPANY SHOULD

HAVE SOUGHT A PERMIT UNDER THE NEW SOURCE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS OF

THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA). IN JULY 2004, THE EPA ISSUED A NOTICE

OF VIOLATION FOR THE JAMES RIVER SULFURIC ACID PLANT WITH

SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS. THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE EPAS

FINDINGS BECAUSE THE EPA CONTINUES TO CHANGE ITS INTERPRETATION

OF THESE RULES AND REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE

REQUIRED PROCESS TO AMEND THEM. THE COURTS ARE SPLIT ON THESE

INTERPRETATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS A TOTAL OF FOUR SULFURIC ACID

PLANTS THAT USE SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY.

IN OCTOBER 2006, THE EPA, SEVERAL STATES AND THE COMPANY REACHED

AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO SETTLE THIS MATTER UNDER WHICH THE

COMPANY WILL PAY A TOTAL OF $4,125,000 IN CIVIL PENALTIES TO THE

U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES. DEPENDING ON WHICH

PLANTS THE COMPANY ELECTS TO RETROFIT, THE COMPANY MAY INCUR

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT $35 MILLION TO

$70 MILLION. THE AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE PARTIES

NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE WRITTEN TERMS AND TO VARIOUS

GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS.

SABINE

RIVER WORKS, ORANGE, TEXAS

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2004, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NOTICE OF

ENFORCEMENT ACTION (NOE) FROM THE TEXAS COMMISSION ON

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (TCEQ) REGARDING ITS SABINE RIVER WORKS

FACILITY LOCATED IN ORANGE, TEXAS. THE NOTICE CONTAINED 45

ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO REPORTABLE AND NON-REPORTABLE EMISSION

EVENTS FROM 2002 THROUGH 2004 AND SOUGHT AN ADMINISTRATIVE

PENALTY OF $134,852. IN ADDITION TO THIS NOE, THE COMPANY HAD

RECEIVED 6 OTHER NOES RAISING ALLEGATIONS OF AIR, WATER AND

MONITORING VIOLATIONS DATING BACK TO 2001. THE COMPANY HAS

REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE TCEQ COMBINING ALL OF THESE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND SETTLING THE ALLEGATIONS FOR A TOTAL

PENALTY OF $176,575. AS A CONDITION OF THE AGREEMENT, THE

COMPANY DID NOT AGREE TO THE ALLEGATIONS AND THE ALLEGATIONS

REMAIN IN DISPUTE. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, $88,288 WILL BE PAID AS

A PENALTY TO THE TCEQ WITH THE REMAINING BALANCE BEING PAID TO A

LOCAL SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT.

OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION REQUIREMENTS AT ITS PLANT IN GIBSON

CITY, ILLINOIS. THE SOLAE COMPANY, A MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE WITH

BUNGE LIMITED, WAS FORMED IN 2003. THE EPA HAS PROPOSED A

SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER THAT WOULD INCLUDE SITES LOCATED IN

INDIANA, OHIO, OKLAHOMA AND TENNESSEE, SOME OF WHICH ARE WHOLLY

OWNED BY DUPONT, IN ADDITION TO THE GIBSON CITY SITE. THE

EPAS PROPOSED SETTLEMENT INCLUDES A PENALTY OF $350,000

OVERVIEW

DUPONT CONTINUES TO SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOY ITS THREE GROWTH

STRATEGIES 

PUTTING SCIENCE TO WORK

,

LEVERAGING THE POWER OF ONE DUPONT

AND

GOING WHERE THE

GROWTH IS

 BY LEVERAGING RESOURCES THROUGH ITS

FIVE GROWTH PLATFORMS: AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION,

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES, ELECTRONIC &

COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, PERFORMANCE MATERIALS AND

SAFETY & PROTECTION. THE COMPANYS SIXTH

REPORTABLE SEGMENT, PHARMACEUTICALS, CONTINUES TO RECEIVE

SUBSTANTIAL INCOME FROM TWO ANTI-HYPERTENSION (AIIA) DRUGS,

COZAAR

®

AND

HYZAAR

®

,

DEVELOPED BY DUPONT AND LICENSED TO MERCK.

BY SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING ITS THREE GROWTH STRATEGIES, DUPONT

EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE OVER THE LONG TERM, ANNUAL FINANCIAL TARGETS

OF 6 PERCENT REVENUE GROWTH, 10 PERCENT EARNINGS

GROWTH IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AND 1 PERCENTAGE POINT

IMPROVEMENT IN RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC). IN 2006, SALES

INCREASED 3 PERCENT, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED

63 PERCENT AND ROIC INCREASED 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

PUTTING SCIENCE TO WORK

 SCIENCE IS THE

BASIS FOR THE CAPABILITIES, OFFERINGS AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES. THE COMPANYS RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE FOCUSED ON CREATING NEW

TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN RELEVANT

FIELDS, AS WELL AS IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES.

MARKET-DRIVEN INNOVATION, WHICH RELIES ON THE VOICE OF THE

CUSTOMER AND CONCRETE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, IS CENTRAL TO THE

COMPANYS RESEARCH EFFORTS. IN 2006 OVER 1,000 NEW PRODUCTS

WERE COMMERCIALIZED, 1,800 NEW U.S. PATENT APPLICATIONS

WERE FILED AND MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF 2006 SALES WERE DERIVED

FROM PRODUCTS INTRODUCED IN THE LAST 5 YEARS. THE COMPANY

IS FOCUSED ON PRIORITIZING DEPLOYMENT OF RESEARCH RESOURCES TO

THE MOST PROMISING OPPORTUNITIES AND IS AGGRESSIVELY FILING

PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CREATED

BY THAT RESEARCH. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED THE TOP 75

TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS EXPECTED TO GENERATE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS AND

CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE PROGRAMS FOR FASTER AND LARGER PAYOFFS.

LEVERAGING THE POWER OF ONE DUPONT

 THE

COMPANYS STRATEGY IS TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND LEVERAGE

MARKET ACCESS, CAPABILITIES AND CUSTOMERS, WITH A SINGLE FOCUS,

THEREBY CREATING WIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS BUSINESSES. IN LATE

2005, MANAGEMENT COMMITTED TO INTENSIFY COST AND CAPITAL

PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS BY ADJUSTING CAPITAL AND RESOURCES

ALLOCATION AMONG ITS BUSINESSES. BY DOING SO, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS

TO REDUCE FIXED COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES AND INCREASE

ROIC. TARGET REDUCTIONS OF $1 BILLION IN COSTS AND

$1 BILLION IN WORKING CAPITAL SAVINGS OVER A THREE YEAR

PERIOD STARTING IN 2006, WERE SET TO PARTIALLY OFFSET COST

INCREASES FROM INFLATION AND DESIRED GROWTH INVESTMENTS.

MANAGEMENT EXCEEDED ITS GOAL FOR FIXED COST SAVINGS IN 2006 BY

REDUCING FIXED COSTS BY APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION, OR

APPROXIMATELY 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO TAKE ACTIONS TO

STANDARDIZE AND SIMPLIFY ITS SUPPLY CHAINS AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS

GLOBALLY AND IMPROVE ITS SALES EFFECTIVENESS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

GOING WHERE THE GROWTH IS

 THE COMPANY

HAS ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS BY

INCREASING ITS DIRECT PRESENCE AND SALES EFFORTS INCLUDING

EXTENDING THE COMPANYS SCIENCE, PRODUCTS, BRANDS AND

MARKET POSITION INTO NEW APPLICATIONS AND USES. THE COMPANY HAS

A STRONG PRESENCE IN THE FASTEST-GROWING EMERGING MARKETS AND

CONTINUES TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES AND MARKET POSITION TO REALIZE

NEW GROWTH. SALES OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM,

GERMANY, FRANCE, ITALY AND JAPAN HAVE INCREASED TO

36 PERCENT OF TOTAL COMPANY SALES IN 2006 FROM

33 PERCENT IN 2004.

ANALYSIS

OF OPERATIONS

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED A LEADING POSITION IN

BIOTECHNOLOGY, SAFETY AND PROTECTION AND CROP YIELD IMPROVEMENT

AND CONTINUED TO EXECUTE ITS GROWTH STRATEGIES, WHILE OVERCOMING

RECORD-HIGH ENERGY COSTS. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT YEAR OVER

YEAR COST INCREASES FOR RAW MATERIALS IN 2006 EXCEEDED

$800 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING HIGHER MARKET PRICES

FOR OIL, NATURAL GAS AND HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK AND OVERALL TIGHT

SUPPLY IN CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS. THE COMPANY TOOK ACTIONS TO

INCREASE PRICING AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY TO OFFSET THESE COST

INCREASES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

AND COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES PLATFORMS WHERE THE

COMPANY INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS

AND FURTHER REDUCE FIXED COSTS. THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

HAVE COMPLETELY RECOVERED FROM HURRICANE DISRUPTIONS OF 2005.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE WAS TO THE COMPANYS DELISLE,

MISSISSIPPI, TITANIUM DIOXIDE PLANT WHICH REMAINED SHUT DOWN

FROM AUGUST 2005 UNTIL PRODUCTION BEGAN A PHASED-IN RESTART IN

JANUARY 2006. NORMAL OPERATIONS RESUMED BY THE END OF THE SECOND

QUARTER 2006. IN 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $204 MILLION IN

INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO LOSSES SUFFERED FROM HURRICANE

KATRINA AND ASBESTOS SETTLEMENTS; $128 MILLION IS RECORDED

IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES AND

$76 MILLION IS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED A DUAL APPROACH TO QUANTIFYING MATERIALITY

AND ELECTED TO REFINE THE ACCOUNTING RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING

EXISTING CUTOFF PRACTICES. FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

SALES TRANSACTIONS, OWNERSHIP TITLE TRANSFERS WHEN GOODS ARE

RECEIVED BY THE CUSTOMERS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED

THESE SALES WHEN SHIPPED AND MONITORED THE IMPACT OF THIS

DIFFERENCE. ADDITIONALLY, SOME ACCRUALS WERE HISTORICALLY

RECORDED ON A MONTH-LAG BASIS. THE IMPACTS OF THESE SALES AND

ACCRUAL CUTOFF PRACTICES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE IMMATERIAL IN

EVERY INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIOD. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2006, THE COMPANY CHOSE TO CHANGE ITS PRACTICES TO RECORD THESE

SALES WHEN RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS AND TO RECORD CERTAIN ACCRUALS

WITHOUT A LAG. AS A RESULT, SALES OF $107 MILLION WERE NOT

RECORDED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 THAT HISTORICALLY WOULD

HAVE BEEN. IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THIS NEW PRACTICE

THROUGHOUT 2006, SALES WOULD HAVE BEEN $81 MILLION HIGHER

THAN REPORTED. INCREMENTAL ACCRUALS OF $24 MILLION WERE

ALSO RECORDED AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THAT WOULD NOT HAVE

BEEN RECORDED UNDER PRIOR PRACTICES. THE AFTER-TAX IMPACT ON THE

2006 INCOME STATEMENT OF THESE CHANGES WAS $39 MILLION.

TRANSFER OF CERTAIN ELASTOMERS ASSETS IN 2005. LOCAL SELLING

PRICES INCREASED ACROSS ALL REGIONS. DURING 2006, SIGNIFICANT

VOLUME INCREASES IN KEY GROWTH REGIONS, PARTICULARLY ASIA

PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA, ALONG WITH MODEST GROWTH IN EUROPE,

MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER U.S. VOLUME. VOLUME DECLINES IN THE

U.S. ARE LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER DEMAND IN MOTOR

VEHICLE AND RESIDENTIAL HOUSING RELATED MARKETS. THESE DECLINES

MORE THAN OFFSET THE RECOVERY IN THE U.S. OF TITANIUM

DIOXIDE, INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL AND PACKAGING POLYMER SALES LOST IN

2005 DUE TO HURRICANE BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.

5 PERCENT HIGHER LOCAL SELLING PRICES AND 1 PERCENT

FAVORABLE CURRENCY EFFECT. IN 2005, GROWTH IN KEY MARKETS,

PARTICULARLY THOSE IN ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA, HELPED

OFFSET THE REDUCTION IN U.S. VOLUMES. VOLUME DECLINES IN

THE U.S. AND EUROPE WERE RELATED TO LOWER DEMAND IN MOTOR

VEHICLE AND PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE MARKETS AND THE IMPACT OF THE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

IN 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED $76 MILLION OF INSURANCE

RECOVERIES IN OTHER INCOME FROM ITS INSURANCE CARRIERS. OF THIS

AMOUNT, $61 MILLION RELATED TO COSTS, INCLUDING OUTSIDE

COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES AND SETTLEMENTS PAID OVER THE PAST

TWENTY YEARS AS PART OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION MATTERS. DURING THIS

TWENTY YEAR PERIOD, DUPONT HAS BEEN SERVED WITH THOUSANDS OF

LAWSUITS ALLEGING INJURY FROM EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS ON DUPONT

PREMISES. MOST OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF THROUGH

TRIAL, DISMISSAL OR SETTLEMENT. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS REMOTE

THAT THE OUTCOME OF REMAINING OR FUTURE ASBESTOS LITIGATION

MATTERS WILL HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY. THESE ASBESTOS

RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES ARE REFLECTED IN CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE COMPANYS STATEMENTS OF

CASH FLOWS. THE REMAINING $15 MILLION IS PART OF A TOTAL

RECOVERY OF $143 MILLION RELATING TO INSURANCE RECOVERIES

ASSOCIATED WITH DAMAGES TO THE COMPANYS FACILITIES

SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF HURRICANE KATRINA IN 2005. THE MAJORITY

OF THE HURRICANE KATRINA RECOVERY IS INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS

SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME

STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL RECOVERIES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE

MATERIAL. NO AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED FROM INSURANCE

CARRIERS FOR DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF

HURRICANE RITA.

2005 VERSUS 2004

OTHER INCOME INCREASED

$1,197 MILLION VERSUS 2004. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE

TO NET PRETAX EXCHANGE GAINS IN 2005 OF $423 MILLION

COMPARED TO LOSSES IN 2004 OF $391 MILLION (SEE

PAGE 54 FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS PROGRAM TO

MANAGE CURRENCY RISK AND NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

WAS $747 MILLION AND $675 MILLION IN 2005 AND 2004,

$150 MILLION ELASTOMERS ANTITRUST LITIGATION CHARGE IN THE

DUPONT DOW ELASTOMERS LLC (DDE) JOINT VENTURE RECORDED IN 2004

INCREASE IN COGS AS A PERCENT OF SALES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS

HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS NOT ENTIRELY COVERED BY SELLING PRICE

INCREASES AND HIGHER COSTS FOR RESTRUCTURING PLANS DISCUSSED

BELOW.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED A BENEFIT TO COGS FOR

$128 MILLION FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE

PROPERTY DAMAGE SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF HURRICANE KATRINA IN

2005. IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$160 MILLION RELATED TO THE

CLEAN-UP

AND

RESTORATION OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE

WRITE-OFF OF INVENTORY AND PLANT ASSETS THAT WERE DESTROYED BY

TWO MAJOR HURRICANES IN THE U.S. HURRICANE CHARGES REDUCED

SEGMENT EARNINGS AS FOLLOWS: COATINGS & COLOR

TECHNOLOGIES  $116 MILLION; PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS  $17 MILLION; AND SAFETY &

PROTECTION  $27 MILLION.

IN 2006, RESTRUCTURING PLANS WERE INTRODUCED WITHIN THE

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES AND THE

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENTS. THESE PROGRAMS

INCLUDE THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 3,200 POSITIONS AND

REDEPLOYMENT OF ABOUT 400 EMPLOYEES IN EXCESS POSITIONS TO THE

EXTENT POSSIBLE. THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET CHARGE OF

$326 MILLION IN 2006 RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS

AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. THIS INCLUDED $184 MILLION TO

PROVIDE SEVERANCE BENEFITS FOR APPROXIMATELY 2,800 EMPLOYEES

INVOLVED IN MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SALES, ADMINISTRATIVE

AND TECHNICAL ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A BENEFIT OF

$6 MILLION IN 2006 RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES FOR

PRIOR YEARS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS. ADDITIONAL DETAILS

RELATED TO THESE PROGRAMS ARE CONTAINED IN THE INDIVIDUAL

SEGMENT REVIEWS AND IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONTINUED

PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AS A

RESULT OF THE 2006 PLANS TOTAL ABOUT $28 MILLION DURING THE

CURRENT YEAR. THE REMAINDER WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY PAID DURING

2007. ANNUAL PRETAX COST SAVINGS OF ABOUT $135 MILLION PER

YEAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COATINGS & COLOR

TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM. APPROXIMATELY 35 PERCENT WAS REALIZED

IN 2006. AN ADDITIONAL 50 PERCENT IS EXPECTED IN 2007, WITH

THE REMAINDER EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED IN 2008. A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION PROGRAM INVOLVES

REINVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES SO COST

SAVINGS ARE LARGELY NEUTRAL UNDER THIS PLAN.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY EVALUATED CAPITAL INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS

AT ITS LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY FACILITY AND THE DECLINING DEMAND

FOR THE NEOPRENE PRODUCTS PRODUCED AT THE FACILITY. AS A RESULT,

THE COMPANY HAS MADE PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE NEOPRENE PRODUCTION AT

ITS UPGRADED FACILITY IN LAPLACE, LOUISIANA, WHICH IS NOW

EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2007. A CHARGE OF

$34 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN 2005 REFLECTING SEVERANCE AND

RELATED COSTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 275 EMPLOYEES, PRINCIPALLY AT

THE LOUISVILLE SITE. ADDITIONALLY, A BENEFIT OF $13 MILLION

WAS RECORDED IN 2005 TO REFLECT CHANGES IN ESTIMATES RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED IN EARLIER YEARS.

2005 VERSUS 2004

COGS FOR THE YEAR 2005

WAS $19.7 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $1,144 MILLION FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR. 2005 COGS INCLUDES A $160 MILLION HURRICANE

CHARGE, A $34 MILLION CHARGE AND A $13 MILLION BENEFIT

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE. 2004 COGS

INCLUDED A $108 MILLION LITIGATION CHARGE RELATED TO PFOA

AND A CHARGE OF $118 MILLION RELATED TO ELASTOMERS

ANTITRUST LITIGATION (SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). COGS ALSO INCLUDED EMPLOYEE SEPARATION

COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2004 OF $411 MILLION

AS DESCRIBED BELOW. AS A PERCENT OF SALES, COGS WAS

74 PERCENT IN 2005 VERSUS 76 PERCENT IN 2004. THE

IMPROVEMENT PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS THE CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE

SEPARATION COSTS AND THE SALE OF INVISTA, WHICH HAD HIGHER COGS

IN RELATION TO SALES THAN THE REST OF THE COMPANY, PARTLY OFFSET

BY RAW MATERIAL COSTS THAT ESCALATED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE

INCREASES IN SELLING PRICES. A MODESTLY FAVORABLE EFFECT OF

CURRENCY TRANSLATION OFFSET A SMALL DECREASE IN SALES VOLUMES.

COGS IN 2004 INCLUDES A NET CHARGE OF $411 MILLION IN 2004

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES AS A RESULT OF ACTIONS TAKEN IN THAT YEAR TO ENSURE THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AS A MORE FOCUSED,

SCIENCE-BASED COMPANY. THIS INCLUDED $302 MILLION TO

PROVIDE SEVERANCE BENEFITS FOR APPROXIMATELY 2,700 EMPLOYEES

INVOLVED IN MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SALES, ADMINISTRATIVE

AND TECHNICAL ACTIVITIES. ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THESE EMPLOYEES

WERE SEPARATED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. THESE STAFF

REDUCTIONS AFFECTED ESSENTIALLY ALL SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO

RECORDED A BENEFIT OF $12 MILLION IN 2004 RESULTING FROM

CHANGES IN ESTIMATES FOR PRIOR YEARS RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

OF $121 MILLION IN 2004 WHICH INCLUDED: $27 MILLION TO

REFLECT AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF AN

INVESTMENT SECURITY; $23 MILLION RELATED TO THE SHUTDOWN OF

U.S. MANUFACTURING ASSETS; $42 MILLION RELATED TO THE

WRITE DOWN OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN MANUFACTURING ASSETS; AND

$29 MILLION TO WRITE OFF ABANDONED TECHNOLOGY.

PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AS A

RESULT OF THE 2004 PLAN TOTAL ABOUT $300 MILLION.

APPROXIMATELY 44 PERCENT OF THESE CASH OUTLAYS WERE MADE IN

2004, 45 PERCENT WERE MADE IN 2005 AND THE REMAINDER IN

2006 AND THEREAFTER. ANNUAL PRETAX COST SAVINGS OF ABOUT

$225 MILLION PER YEAR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2004

RESTRUCTURING PLAN. ABOUT 40 PERCENT WAS REALIZED IN 2004

AND ESSENTIALLY ALL THE REMAINING SAVINGS IN PAYROLL COSTS WERE

REALIZED IN 2005. OVER 50 PERCENT OF THE SAVINGS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE STAFF REDUCTIONS ARE REFLECTED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT IN COGS

AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES AND THE BALANCE IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

ON APRIL 30, 2004, THE COMPANY SOLD A MAJORITY OF THE NET

ASSETS OF TEXTILES & INTERIORS, REFERRED TO AS INVISTA,

TO KOCH. IN JANUARY 2006, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS INTEREST IN A

TEXTILES & INTERIORS EQUITY AFFILIATE TO ITS EQUITY

PARTNER FOR PROCEEDS OF $14 MILLION THEREBY COMPLETING THE

SALE OF ALL OF THE NET ASSETS OF TEXTILES & INTERIORS.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS INVESTMENTS IN THREE

AFFILIATED COMPANIES TO KOCH AND ITS INVESTMENT IN A FOURTH

AFFILIATED COMPANY TO ITS EQUITY PARTNER. THE DIVESTITURE

ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN A NET BENEFIT OF $62 MILLION AND THE

TRANSFER OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN THE AFFILIATES TO

KOCH RESULTED IN A GAIN OF $35 MILLION. THE SALE OF TWO OF

THESE AFFILIATES HAD BEEN DELAYED UNTIL THE COMPANY RECEIVED

APPROVAL FROM ITS EQUITY PARTNERS. ALTHOUGH THE TRANSFER OF

THESE AFFILIATES COMPLETED THE SALE TO KOCH, THE COMPANY WILL

HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH INVISTA AS A RESULT

OF LONG-TERM PURCHASE AND SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND A LONG-TERM

CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT IN WHICH INVISTA WILL

MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY CERTAIN PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED KOCH AGAINST CERTAIN

LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES, LEGAL MATTERS,

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES (SEE

DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS PROVIDED THAT

REPATRIATED CASH FROM SUCH ACCUMULATED EARNINGS IS REINVESTED IN

THE U.S. PURSUANT TO A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED SIGNIFICANT TAX BENEFITS WHICH

PRINCIPALLY INCLUDED $360 MILLION ON EXCHANGE LOSSES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING

PROGRAM, $320 MILLION RELATED TO THE SEPARATION OF

TEXTILES & INTERIORS, $160 MILLION PRIMARILY

RELATED TO AGREEMENT ON CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AUDIT ISSUES

PREVIOUSLY RESERVED AND $137 MILLION RESULTING FROM

RECORDING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN TWO EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES FOR

CORPORATE

OUTLOOK

OVERALL, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LESS FAVORABLE

IN 2007 THAN IN 2006, WITH GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW IN EVERY

REGION OF THE WORLD. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH IN

DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IS FORECAST TO SLOW TO BELOW-TREND RATES,

WHILE GROWTH IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD WILL BE NEAR TREND WITH

ABOUT 5 PERCENT GROWTH IN SOUTH AMERICA TO 9 PERCENT

IN CHINA. GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, WHICH IS CONSIDERED A

RELIABLE INDICATOR OF DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, IS FORECAST TO EXPAND ABOUT 3 PERCENT IN 2007

VERSUS ABOUT 4.5 PERCENT IN 2006 AND WILL EXHIBIT A

REGIONAL TREND SIMILAR TO GDP. SALES VOLUME IS EXPECTED TO BE UP

ACROSS THE GROWTH PLATFORMS, WITH THE LARGEST INCREASES IN

ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES,

SAFETY & PROTECTION AND AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION. THE 2007 AVERAGE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IS

FORECAST TO BE SLIGHTLY WEAKER THAN THE 2006 AVERAGE. THIS

SHOULD HAVE A BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON SALES AND INCOME FROM

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND INCREASE DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS EXPORTED PRODUCTS. RAW MATERIAL COSTS ARE

EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH 2006. WHILE PRICES

FOR BOTH OIL AND NATURAL GAS MODERATED SOMEWHAT DURING THE

SECOND HALF OF 2006, FUTURES MARKETS INDICATE INCREASES IN BOTH

DURING 2007 AVERAGING SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN 2006 PRICES. FIXED

COSTS AS A PERCENT OF SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER THAN IN

2006, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUED STRONG

PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS. OTHER INCOME IS FORECAST TO BE LOWER IN

2007 REFLECTING REDUCED INCOME FROM PHARMACEUTICALS AND LOWER

LICENSING INCOME IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION. BASED ON

THESE EXPECTATIONS, MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT EARNINGS PER SHARE

WILL BE ABOUT $3.15 IN 2007, WITH NET SALES OF ABOUT

$29 BILLION.

ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN JUNE 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48),

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109 (SFAS 109),

THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND

MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION

AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN

IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE TO ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTY IN

INCOME TAXES. WHILE THE COMPANY IS STILL EVALUATING THE IMPACT

OF ADOPTION OF FIN 48 ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, IT BELIEVES THAT ADOPTION OF FIN 48 WILL

DECREASE THE LIABILITIES ACCRUED FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, BY $100 MILLION TO

$125 MILLION WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN REINVESTED

EARNINGS AT JANUARY 1, 2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157 (SFAS 157), FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS, WHICH ADDRESSES HOW COMPANIES SHOULD

MEASURE FAIR VALUE WHEN REQUIRED FOR RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE

PURPOSES UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE

U.S. (GAAP). THE STANDARDS PROVISIONS WILL BE APPLIED

TO EXISTING ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES,

THAT ARE BASED ON FAIR VALUE. SFAS 157 DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY

NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARD APPLIES A COMMON

DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE TO BE USED THROUGHOUT GAAP, WITH

EMPHASIS ON FAIR VALUE AS A MARKET-BASED MEASUREMENT

VERSUS AN ENTITY-SPECIFIC MEASUREMENT AND ESTABLISHES A

HIERARCHY OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT METHODS. THE DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH

COMPANIES USE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE METHODS AND

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON EARNINGS. SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007. THE NEW

STANDARDS PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE

APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY AND THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING

THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE

FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE

POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE

THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE

INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF

TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING RESERVES,

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER

ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY

REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS

APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS

SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS

ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS ARE TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MEASURING THE COST

AND BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE TWO KEY

ASSUMPTIONS AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE

UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND

EXPECTATIONS ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS APPROPRIATE. AS

PERMITTED BY GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE

ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE

GREATER OF THE PLAN OBLIGATIONS OR THE APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS,

THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING WORKING LIFE

OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS BENEFIT OBLIGATION

FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

BENEFIT PLANS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY UTILIZES PUBLISHED

LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT

RATE AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. WHERE COMMONLY AVAILABLE, THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS INDICES OF VARIOUS DURATIONS TO REFLECT THE

TIMING OF FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

CONTINUED

WITHIN THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET

ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR

SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT

BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN

OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND

PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY

STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON

HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES

COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION

OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO

PLAN PARTICIPANTS.

IN DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE

OF ASSETS RATHER THAN THEIR FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, THERE TENDS

TO BE A LAG IN RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A

RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT

IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS CALCULATION OF NET

PENSION COST. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES ARE

BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF

REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

OTHER PRPS AT MULTIPARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL

VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF

$349 MILLION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS

AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE

AMOUNT ACCRUED. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY

ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE

CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS.

THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN

INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES

WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO

INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH

IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED,

BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES MAY SEEK

FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF THE VARIOUS LAWS AND

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPOSE

LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY FOR CLEANING UP THE DAMAGE RESULTING

FROM COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE DISPOSAL. OVER THE NEXT TWO

DECADES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS UNDER BOTH

CERCLA AND RCRA.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST

FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS,

DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING

REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

PRPS. THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP ACCURATE ESTIMATES

OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS.

LEGAL

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY

SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT

LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND ANTITRUST

CLAIMS. THE COMPANY RECORDS RESERVES FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE

INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A

LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE

RESERVES TO REFLECT THE IMPACT AND STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS,

SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION

AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR MATTER. PREDICTING

THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS

AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE

ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES. IN MAKING

DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS,

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT

ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING

UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR

TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED,

INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING

THE MATTER THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND

THE MATTERS CURRENT STATUS. CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION

RESERVE WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY

IN A COURT PROCEEDING. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT

RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF, BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY

OVERTURNED ON APPEAL. A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT

LITIGATION MATTERS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 20 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL

COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF

UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE TAXES THE

COMPANY WILL PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN

VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION

OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX

AUDITS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANYS TAX ASSETS AND TAX LIABILITIES.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX

LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED

TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE

VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE

REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE

TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS

TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL

REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN RECORDING A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND

GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN

SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED TAX

ASSET BALANCE OF $1,778 MILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE

OF $1,259 MILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED

TO OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES

IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME

AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE

ASSETS.

VALUATION

OF ASSETS

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE

COMPANYS NORMAL ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS. TESTING FOR

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS

BEST ESTIMATES AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. THE DYNAMIC

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES

OPERATE AND KEY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT

TO PROJECTED SELLING PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES,

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS.

ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY

FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. CHANGES IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

THE EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIME

IN WHICH SUCH IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED. FUTURE CHANGES IN THE

ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE ASSETS BEING

EVALUATED COULD ALSO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

TO EXPAND ITS PRESENCE IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SPECIALTY MARKETS

AND CONTINUES TO EXPAND PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN THE PROFESSIONAL

PEST CONTROL MARKET.

ADDITIONALLY, AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION OPERATES WITHIN

THE SPECIALTY FOOD INGREDIENTS MARKET, INCLUDING SOY PROTEINS

AND LECITHINS THROUGH ITS MAJORITY-OWNED VENTURE WITH BUNGE

LIMITED, THE SOLAE COMPANY. SALES FROM THESE PRODUCTS INCREASED

IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO SLIGHTLY INCREASED VOLUME AND

INCREASED PRICES OF SOY PROTEINS AND LECITHINS.

IN 2006, THE SEGMENT LAUNCHED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO INCREASE

INVESTMENT IN PLANT GENETICS, BIOTECHNOLOGY AND OTHER GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES WHILE CONSOLIDATING MANUFACTURING ASSETS,

TECHNOLOGY CENTERS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES IN ITS NUTRITION AND

CROP PROTECTION BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENT RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$194 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FOR EMPLOYEE SEPARATIONS

AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INVESTMENT AND

STREAMLINING PLAN. THE PLAN INCLUDES THE CLOSURE OF

MANUFACTURING UNITS AND THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1,500

POSITIONS. OPERATING COSTS SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY

$100 MILLION PER YEAR WILL BE REINVESTED INTO THE SEED

BUSINESS TO INCREASE THE SPEED TO MARKET OF SEED PRODUCTS WITH

NEXT-GENERATION BIOTECH TRAITS (SEE NOTE 5 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

2006 VERSUS 2005

SALES OF

$6.3 BILLION WERE 1 PERCENT LOWER THAN LAST YEAR

REFLECTING SLIGHTLY LOWER USD SELLING PRICES AND VOLUMES. LOWER

SELLING PRICES REFLECT DECLINES IN THE CROP PROTECTION MARKET

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRICES FOR A RICHER MIX IN CORN AND SOYBEAN

SEED. VOLUME DECLINES WERE DRIVEN BY LOWER CORN SEED SALES IN

NORTH AMERICA, SPECIALTY PRODUCTS IN INDIA AND HERBICIDE SALES

IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN

THE SALE OF SOYBEANS. 2006 INCLUDES SOME EARLIER THAN

ANTICIPATED SEED SALES FOR THE 2007 PLANTING SEASON IN EUROPE.

THE SEGMENT CONTINUES TO INVEST RESOURCES IN R&D AND

INTRODUCED APPROXIMATELY 210 NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT

APPLICATIONS DURING 2006.

2006 PTOI WAS $507 MILLION VERSUS $862 MILLION, DOWN

41 PERCENT. THE DECLINE IN 2006 PTOI REFLECTS THE CHARGE OF

$194 MILLION DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, 2006 PTOI

REFLECTS THE SALES DECLINE AND HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS ACROSS

MOST OF THE SEGMENT, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY INCOME OF

$73 MILLION RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS, LICENSING

AGREEMENTS AND ASSET SALES.

2005 VERSUS 2004

SALES OF

$6.4 BILLION INCREASED 2 PERCENT REFLECTING

4 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND 2 PERCENT

LOWER VOLUMES. HIGHER SELLING PRICES REFLECT A RICHER MIX IN

CORN AND SOYBEAN SEED. VOLUME DECLINES WERE DRIVEN BY LOWER CORN

SEED SALES IN NORTH AMERICA AND SPECIALTY FOOD INGREDIENTS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE SALE OF SOYBEANS,

INSECTICIDES IN LATIN AMERICA AND HERBICIDES FOR CEREALS IN

EUROPE. DURING THE YEAR APPROXIMATELY 160 NEW PRODUCTS AND

THE KEY MARKETS IN WHICH COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES

OPERATES CONTINUED TO GROW IN 2006, WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH

IN THE LATIN AMERICA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS. A KEY DRIVER OF

THE SEGMENTS SALES GROWTH IN 2006 WAS THE COMPLETION OF

MARKETS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE.

2006 VERSUS 2005

SALES OF

$6.3 BILLION WERE UP 4 PERCENT, REFLECTING ABOUT

2 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES FOR THE SEGMENT. AN

ADDITIONAL 2 PERCENT INCREASE FROM VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY

REALIZED IN THE PIGMENTS BUSINESS, REFLECTING STRONG GLOBAL

DEMAND AS WELL AS THE FIRST QUARTER STARTUP OF THE DELISLE PLANT

FOLLOWING HURRICANE KATRINA. HIGHER SELLING PRICES REFLECT

CONCERTED EFFORTS WITHIN THE SEGMENT TO INCREASE PRICES FOR THE

MAJORITY OF ITS PRODUCTS AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO OFFSET THE

IMPACT OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND THE IMPACT OF LOWER

GLOBAL OEM AUTOMOTIVE VOLUMES. DURING THE YEAR APPROXIMATELY 390

NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT APPLICATIONS WERE INTRODUCED.

PTOI IN 2006 OF $795 MILLION INCREASED FROM

$528 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOWER FIXED COSTS IN BOTH

YEARS AND HIGHER VOLUMES IN PIGMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVED

2006 EARNINGS. PTOI IN 2006 INCLUDES A NET CHARGE OF

$132 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING AND $30 MILLION

PRIMARILY FOR ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION RELATED TO THE

TRANSFORMATION PLAN THAT WAS INITIATED IN FIRST QUARTER 2006

(SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). 2006

PTOI ALSO INCLUDES $142 MILLION IN INSURANCE PROCEEDS,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE HURRICANE DAMAGES SUFFERED IN 2005.

2005 PTOI INCLUDED CHARGES OF $116 MILLION RELATED TO THE

CLEAN-UP

RESTORATION OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE

WRITE-OFF OF INVENTORY AND PLANT ASSETS THAT WERE DESTROYED BY

HURRICANES.

2005 VERSUS 2004

SALES OF

$6.1 BILLION WERE UP 3 PERCENT, REFLECTING

6 PERCENT HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES, PARTLY OFFSET BY

3 PERCENT LOWER VOLUMES. HIGHER SELLING PRICES REFLECT

CONCERTED EFFORTS WITHIN THE SEGMENT TO INCREASE PRICES FOR THE

MAJORITY OF ITS PRODUCTS AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO OFFSET THE

IMPACT OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS. SALES VOLUMES WERE LOWER

DUE TO THE DELISLE PLANT OUTAGE AND THE IMPACT OF LOWER GLOBAL

OEM AUTOMOTIVE VOLUMES. DURING THE YEAR APPROXIMATELY 360 NEW

PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT APPLICATIONS WERE INTRODUCED.

PTOI IN 2005 OF $528 MILLION DECREASED FROM

$698 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS

AND LOWER SALES VOLUMES NEGATIVELY AFFECTED 2005 EARNINGS. PTOI

IN 2005 INCLUDES A $116 MILLION HURRICANE CHARGE WHILE 2004

INCLUDED CHARGES OF $96 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE SEPARATION

COSTS AND AN AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH LITIGATION SETTLEMENT.

OUTLOOK

THE SEGMENT EXPECTS SALES IN

2007 TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY, WHILE TAKING ACTIONS TO REDUCE COSTS

AND IMPROVE PROFITABILITY. INDUSTRY DEMAND FOR TITANIUM DIOXIDE

IS EXPECTED TO MODERATE IN 2007, IN LINE WITH MORE MODERATE

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH OF ABOUT 2 PERCENT. COMPETITIVE

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL COATINGS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO

PROVIDE A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN 2007. MODEST

GROWTH IS EXPECTED FOR REFINISH MARKETS IN MATURE ECONOMIES

WHILE STRONG GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN EMERGING MARKETS.

PROFITABILITY OF COATINGS SOLD TO AUTOMOTIVE OEM PRODUCERS IS

HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON VOLUME AT SPECIFIC PLANTS THE COMPANY

SERVICES. NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN 2007 AUTOMOTIVE BUILDS ARE

EXPECTED TO BE ESSENTIALLY FLAT WITH 2006 LEVELS, WITH MODERATE

GROWTH IN ASIA PACIFIC.

DUPONT SAFETY RESOURCES CONTINUED TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS

WORLDWIDE REDUCE WORKPLACE INJURIES AND FATALITIES WHILE GAINING

SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING COSTS, PRODUCTIVITY AND

QUALITY. DUPONT IS A LEADER IN THIS CONSULTING FIELD, SELLING

MATERIALS AND CONSULTING. IT OPERATES WITHIN A RANGE OF BUSINESS

MODELS, INCLUDING SHARING OF CLIENT GAINS DUE TO LOWER

INJURY/WORKMANS COMPENSATION CLAIMS.

INITIATED BY DUPONT IN 2005, THE WORLD SAFETY DECLARATION, THE

FIRST-EVER AGREEMENT BY INDUSTRY TO IMPROVE WORKPLACE SAFETY

GLOBALLY, CONTINUES TO ATTRACT ATTENTION AROUND THE WORLD. IN

2006, 11 CHINESE COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS MADE A PUBLIC,

GLOBAL COMMITMENT TO SAFETY BY SIGNING THE DECLARATION, BRINGING

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHARTER SIGNERS TO 45.

2006 VERSUS 2005

SALES OF

$5.6 BILLION WERE UP 7 PERCENT DUE TO 5 PERCENT

HIGHER USD PRICES AND 2 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUMES. ALL

BUSINESSES IN THE PLATFORM GREW SALES YEAR OVER YEAR WITH THE

STRONGEST GROWTH IN CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS AND ARAMIDS. SEGMENT

SALES EXPERIENCED SLOWER U.S. GROWTH AS A RESULT OF SHIFTS

IN DEMAND FOR CONSTRUCTION, BUT WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES

GROWTH IN OTHER REGIONS, ESPECIALLY EMERGING REGIONS. DURING

2006, APPROXIMATELY 170 NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT APPLICATIONS

WERE INTRODUCED.

PTOI IN 2006 WAS $1,080 MILLION, UP 10 PERCENT FROM

$982 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN PTOI

REFLECTS PRICING GAINS AND TIGHT FIXED COST CONTROL. 2006 PTOI

INCLUDES A $47 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO

AN INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL ASSET HELD FOR SALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

A $33 MILLION BENEFIT FROM INSURANCE PROCEEDS. 2005 PTOI

INCLUDES A CHARGE OF $27 MILLION RELATED TO HURRICANE COSTS

AND A $31 MILLION GAIN FROM THE SALE OF A NON-CORE ASSET.

2005 VERSUS 2004

SALES OF

$5.2 BILLION WERE UP 11 PERCENT, DUE TO 6 PERCENT

HIGHER USD SELLING PRICES AND 5 PERCENT HIGHER VOLUMES. THE

SEGMENTS ARAMIDS FIBERS AND SAFETY CONSULTING OFFERINGS

PRIMARILY DROVE REVENUE GROWTH. SEGMENT SALES WERE NEGATIVELY

AFFECTED DURING THE LAST FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR BY THE

HURRICANES, PARTICULARLY IN THE ANILINE AND ACRYLONITRILE

PRODUCT LINES. THE LATIN AMERICA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS

EXPERIENCED

HIGHER-THAN-AVERAGE

SALES GROWTH IN 2005. DURING THE YEAR, APPROXIMATELY 200 NEW

PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT APPLICATIONS WERE INTRODUCED.

PTOI IN 2005 WAS $982 MILLION, UP 17 PERCENT FROM

$837 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. 2005 INCLUDES A CHARGE OF

$27 MILLION RELATED TO HURRICANE COSTS AND A

$31 MILLION GAIN FROM THE SALE OF A NON-CORE ASSET. THIS

NET BENEFIT, ALONG WITH STRONG EARNINGS GROWTH FROM ARAMID

FIBERS AND SAFETY CONSULTING HELPED INCREASE THE SEGMENTS

PTOI. PRICING MOMENTUM CONTINUED WITHIN THE SEGMENT DURING 2005,

BUT WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS.

2004 INCLUDES CHARGES OF $70 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE

SEPARATION ACTIVITIES AND THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN EUROPEAN

MANUFACTURING ASSETS.

LIQUIDITY &

CAPITAL RESOURCES

THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY

OF INDEPENDENT SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE DEBT

SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES, BILATERAL

CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS AND ASSET SALES.

THE COMPANYS RELATIVELY LOW LONG-TERM BORROWING LEVEL,

STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION AND CREDIT RATINGS PROVIDE EXCELLENT

ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ITS STRONG LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION

AND FLEXIBILITY TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THIS ADVANTAGE IS

BASED ON STRONG BUSINESS OPERATING CASH FLOWS OVER AN ECONOMIC

CYCLE AND A COMMITMENT TO CASH DISCIPLINE REGARDING WORKING

CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS. PURSUANT TO ITS

CASH DISCIPLINE POLICY, THE COMPANY SEEKS FIRST, TO MAINTAIN A

STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND, TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO

SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH IS

COMPELLING. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT

SECURITIES BALANCES OF $1.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, PROVIDE PRIMARY LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT ALL SHORT-TERM

OBLIGATIONS. SECONDARY LIQUIDITY, SUFFICIENT TO MEET UPCOMING

DEBT MATURITIES, COMES FROM EXCELLENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS

AND STRONG CASH FLOW GENERATION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH AND ACCESS THE CAPITAL

MARKETS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH

REQUIREMENTS TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL SPENDING, DIVIDEND

PAYMENTS AND OTHER CASH NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN THE

UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS

SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS, THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO

APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION IN SAME DAY CREDIT

LINES WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE CREDIT

LINES ARE PRIMARILY MULTI-YEAR FACILITIES.

IN OCTOBER 2005, STANDARD & POORS (S&P),

MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE (MOODYS) AND FITCH RATINGS

(FITCH) DOWNGRADED THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT CREDIT

RATING FOLLOWING THE COMPANYS ANNOUNCED $5 BILLION

ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS. THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES

THE COMPANYS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME IN 2006 AND A REDUCTION IN

TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS. WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES OF

DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING AND INVENTORY DAYS SUPPLY WERE

ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN 2006 VERSUS 2005, WHILE DAYS PAYABLE

OUTSTANDING SLIGHTLY DECREASED.

THE COMPANYS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$2.5 BILLION IN 2005, A $689 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE

$3.2 BILLION GENERATED IN 2004. THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR

DECREASE PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION

PLANS, PRIMARILY A $1 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND

INVENTORIES WERE MODEST. WORKING CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES

OF DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING, INVENTORY DAYS SUPPLY AND DAYS

THE LATTER RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO THE SALE OF INVISTA (SEE

NOTES 6 AND 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

IN ADDITION, IN 2005, THE SETTLEMENT OF FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS ISSUED TO HEDGE THE COMPANYS NET EXPOSURE, BY

CURRENCY, RELATED TO MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN

THE RECEIPT OF $653 MILLION VERSUS CASH PAYMENTS OF

$509 MILLION IN 2004. THE CASH INFLOW IN 2005 WAS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE STRONGER USD WHILE THE PAYMENTS IN 2004 WERE

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WEAKER USD. THESE SETTLEMENTS WERE

LARGELY OFFSET BY REVALUATIONS OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED, WHICH

ARE REFLECTED IN THE APPROPRIATE CATEGORIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. PURCHASES OF PLANT, PROPERTY AND

EQUIPMENT IN 2005 TOTALED $1.3 BILLION, INCLUDING

REPURCHASE ACTIVITY. TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS

$7.5 BILLION, A $650 MILLION DECREASE FROM

DECEMBER 31, 2005. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS RELATED TO THE 2005 AJCA CASH

REPATRIATION PROGRAM PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ISSUANCE OF

$1 BILLION IN 10 AND 30 YEAR NOTES IN DECEMBER 2006.

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS $8.2 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $1.7 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2004,

PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW FOREIGN BORROWINGS TO SUPPORT THE AJCA CASH

REPATRIATION PROGRAM, THE $1 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE

PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND OTHER CASH NEEDS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY DOMESTIC DEBT PAY DOWNS FROM THE CASH REPATRIATED

UNDER THE AJCA PROGRAM.

DIVIDENDS PAID TO COMMON AND PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS WERE

$1.4 BILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004. DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF

COMMON STOCK WERE $1.48 IN 2006, $1.46 IN 2005 AND $1.40 IN

2004. THE COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARED IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2007 WAS

THE COMPANYS 410TH CONSECUTIVE DIVIDEND SINCE THE

COMPANYS FIRST DIVIDEND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 1904.

IN OCTOBER 2005, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A

$5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN. ON OCTOBER 27, 2005,

THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 75.7 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON

STOCK UNDER AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AND PAID

$3.0 BILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE. UPON THE CONCLUSION OF THE

AGREEMENT IN 2006, THE COMPANY PAID $180 MILLION IN CASH TO

GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO. TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY MADE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF ITS SHARES FOR

$100 MILLION BRINGING PURCHASES TO DATE UNDER THE

$5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN TO ABOUT $3.3 BILLION.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES COMPLETING THE REMAINING

MAINLY TO THE $3 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK AND DEBT PAY DOWN

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW BORROWINGS TO FUND THE REPATRIATION OF

SEVERAL REGIONS.

DEBT

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 WAS

$7.5 BILLION AND $8.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE

COMPANY DEFINES NET DEBT AS TOTAL DEBT LESS CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT NET DEBT IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THE INVESTOR

WITH A MORE HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY AND

DEBT POSITION SINCE THE COMPANYS CASH BALANCE IS AVAILABLE

TO MEET OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE

LIQUIDITY AROUND THE WORLD. NET DEBT ALSO ALLOWS THE INVESTOR TO

MORE EASILY COMPARE CASH FLOW BETWEEN PERIODS WITHOUT ADJUSTING

FOR CHANGES IN CASH AND DEBT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, NET

DEBT WAS $5.6 BILLION COMPARED TO $6.3 BILLION AND

$2.9 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE

$692 MILLION DECREASE IN NET DEBT FROM 2005 TO 2006

REFLECTS THE COMPANYS POSITIVE CASH FLOW DURING 2006. THE

$3.4 BILLION INCREASE IN NET DEBT FROM 2004 TO 2005 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $3.5 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

IN 2005.

THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS

AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW,

AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR

THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION

MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR

HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM,

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY INDETERMINABLE.

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 IS $105 MILLION AND

$103 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO

THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF

LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE

PROVISIONS EXIST.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF INVISTA, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED

KOCH AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES,

LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS OF

$70 MILLION IS INCLUDED IN THE INDEMNIFICATIONS BALANCE OF

$105 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE FAIR VALUE

WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE

EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE THE INDEMNIFICATIONS IN A

STAND-ALONE, ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION WITH AN UNRELATED

PARTY AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, BY THE UTILIZATION OF

PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW MODELS. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE INDEMNITIES WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FUTURE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY (SEE

NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

OBLIGATIONS

FOR EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS

UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO EQUITY

AFFILIATES, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER UNAFFILIATED

COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD

DIRECTLY GUARANTEED $551 MILLION OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS, PLUS

$262 MILLION RELATING TO GUARANTEES OF OBLIGATIONS FOR

DIVESTED SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. THIS REPRESENTS THE

MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT

THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. THE

COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE

EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY. NO MATERIAL LOSS IS

ANTICIPATED BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE

OBLIGATIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS AROSE AS PART OF

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS. EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR EQUITY

AFFILIATES AROSE FOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN NORMAL OPERATIONS. IN

CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY HAS RECOURSE TO ASSETS HELD AS

COLLATERAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL GUARANTEES FROM CUSTOMERS AND

SUPPLIERS.

THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES

RELATED TO DIVESTED SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDING CONOCO AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES AND CONSOLIDATION COAL SALES

COMPANY. THE RESTRUCTURING, TRANSFER AND SEPARATION AGREEMENT

BETWEEN DUPONT AND CONOCO REQUIRES CONOCO TO USE ITS BEST

EFFORTS TO HAVE CONOCO, OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, SUBSTITUTE

FOR DUPONT. CONOCO AND CONSOLIDATION COAL SALES COMPANY HAVE

INDEMNIFIED THE COMPANY FOR ANY LIABILITIES THE COMPANY MAY

INCUR PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES. NO MATERIAL LOSS IS

ANTICIPATED BY REASON OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAS NO LIABILITIES

RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS

GUARANTEES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HAD TO

MAKE SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS TO SATISFY GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO

SATISFY THESE GUARANTEES SHOULD UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE.

CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ACCELERATED SHARE

REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

(GOLDMAN SACHS) UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED

75.7 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONTS OUTSTANDING COMMON

STOCK FROM GOLDMAN SACHS ON OCTOBER 27, 2005 AT A

PRICE OF $39.62 PER SHARE, WITH GOLDMAN SACHS PURCHASING AN

EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET OVER THE

FOLLOWING NINE-MONTH PERIOD.

ON JULY 27, 2006, GOLDMAN SACHS COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE

OF 75.7 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONTS COMMON STOCK AT A

VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP) OF $41.99 PER SHARE. UPON

THE CONCLUSION OF THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MADE A SETTLEMENT

PAYMENT TO GOLDMAN SACHS OF $180 MILLION, WHICH THE COMPANY

ELECTED TO PAY IN CASH. THE FINAL SETTLEMENT PRICE WAS BASED

UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VWAP PER SHARE FOR THE

NINE-MONTH

PERIOD, WHICH ENDED JULY 27, 2006, AND THE PURCHASE

PRICE OF $39.62 PER SHARE. THE AMOUNT PAID TO SETTLE THE

CONTRACT WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN

CAPITAL DURING THE THIRD QUARTER 2006.

SYNTHETIC

LEASES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAS ONE SYNTHETIC

LEASE PROGRAM RELATING TO MISCELLANEOUS SHORT-LIVED EQUIPMENT

VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $116 MILLION. LEASE PAYMENTS FOR

THESE ASSETS TOTALED $58 MILLION IN 2006, $51 MILLION

IN 2005 AND $54 MILLION IN 2004, AND WERE REPORTED AS

OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT. THE

LEASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM ARE CONSIDERED OPERATING LEASES AND

ACCORDINGLY THE RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE NOT RECORDED

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. FURTHERMORE, THE LEASE

PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM VARY BASED ON ONE MONTH

LIBOR. THE COMPANY MAY TERMINATE THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME BY

PURCHASING THE ASSETS. SHOULD THE COMPANY DECIDE NEITHER TO

RENEW THE LEASES NOR TO EXERCISE ITS PURCHASE OPTION, IT MUST

PAY THE OWNER A RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE AMOUNT, WHICH MAY BE

RECOVERED FROM A SALE OF THE PROPERTY TO A THIRD PARTY. RESIDUAL

VALUE GUARANTEES TOTALED $101 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006.

LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND

RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN

MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE

TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND MEDICAL, DENTAL AND

LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. ABOUT

80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE BENEFIT

OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL,

DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

BENEFIT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES.

PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANYS

NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE,

THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN

THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE

EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE.

WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE

RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE

PENSION AND MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY

ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES PAY NEAR RETIREMENT.

PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED

TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED

BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN

EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND

PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS

ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE

ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. BY LAW, NO

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2007 AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED. CONTRIBUTIONS BEYOND 2007 ARE NOT

DETERMINABLE SINCE THE AMOUNT OF ANY CONTRIBUTION IS HEAVILY

DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT

RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS. U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT

EXCEED FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED

PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS

FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE

SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT

NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND

PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS

FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. IN

2006, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $280 MILLION TO ITS PENSION

PLANS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL MAKE APPROXIMATELY

$290 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2007 TO PENSION PLANS

OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (THE ACT) WAS

SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN AUGUST 2006. THE ACT

INTRODUCES NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-EMPLOYER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING PENSION

PLAN ASSETS AND PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR FUNDING PURPOSES,

INTRODUCES BENEFIT LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN UNDERFUNDED PLANS AND

RAISES TAX DEDUCTION LIMITS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT

PLANS. THE NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR PLAN

YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. ALTHOUGH

SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY GUIDANCE WILL BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO ITS

2008 EFFECTIVE DATE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE

ACT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL NEAR-TERM IMPACT ON ITS REQUIRED

CONTRIBUTIONS.

IN AUGUST 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED MAJOR CHANGES TO ITS

PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN AND PRINCIPAL SAVINGS AND

INVESTMENT PLAN. COVERED EMPLOYEES ON THE ROLLS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL PARTICIPATE IN AN ENHANCED

SAVINGS PLAN EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008 AND WILL ALSO

ACCRUE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IN THE PENSION PLAN, BUT THE ANNUAL

RATE OF PENSION ACCRUAL WILL BE ONE-THIRD OF THE CURRENT RATE.

IN ADDITION, COMPANY-PAID POSTRETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR

THESE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT CONTINUE TO GROW AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2007. COVERED EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE

U.S. AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL PARTICIPATE IN

THE ENHANCED SAVINGS PLAN, BUT NOT IN THE PENSION PLAN. ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ENHANCED SAVINGS PLAN WILL

RECEIVE A 100 PERCENT COMPANY MATCH ON THE FIRST

6 PERCENT OF THEIR SAVINGS RATE, EFFECTIVELY DOUBLING THE

CURRENT COMPANY MATCH PERCENTAGE, WHICH IS 50 PERCENT ON

THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES SAVINGS RATE. IN

ADDITION TO THE SAVINGS MATCH, THE ENHANCED SAVINGS PLAN WILL

ASSURE A 100 PERCENT EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN BY

MEANS OF A COMPANY CONTRIBUTION OF 3 PERCENT OF EACH

EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION INTO THEIR ACCOUNT.

FURTHER, THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION HAS BEEN

EXPANDED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITION OF THE ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION IN THE PENSION PLAN.

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION

PLAN, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO REMEASURE ITS PENSION EXPENSE

FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006, REFLECTING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE REMEASUREMENT DATE. BETTER THAN EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE OF

6 PERCENT DECREASED PRETAX PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2006 BY

$72 MILLION. FOR 2007, THE PLAN AMENDMENT IS EXPECTED TO

RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN PENSION EXPENSE OF ABOUT

$40 MILLION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE

CHANGES IN THE PLANS NOTED ABOVE IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 22 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

SFAS 158 AND RECORDED A $1,555 MILLION AFTER-TAX

CHARGE TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY PRIMARILY DUE TO

RECLASSIFYING UNRECOGNIZED LOSSES RELATED TO THE PENSION PLANS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF

SFAS 158 IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 2 TO THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE

COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.

PRETAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL NET CLAIMS COSTS AND

RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $322 MILLION,

$395 MILLION AND $435 MILLION FOR 2006, 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT

$340 MILLION IN 2007. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS DURING

THIS PERIOD REFLECT HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS,

DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS

AND DEDUCTIBLES.

THE COMPANYS INCOME CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY

PENSION BENEFITS AS WELL AS RETIREE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFITS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE EXTENT TO

WHICH THE COMPANYS INCOME OVER EACH OF THE LAST

3 YEARS WAS AFFECTED BY PRETAX CHARGES AND CREDITS RELATED

THE DECREASE IN PENSION EXPENSE IN 2006 REFLECTS FAVORABLE

RETURNS ON PENSION ASSETS, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN

DISCOUNT RATES. THE DECREASE IN 2006 OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT CHARGES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE MEDICAL

TRENDS IN 2005 AND REFINEMENTS IN ESTIMATES TO REFLECT THE

ANTICIPATED COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG

PROGRAM. THE DECREASE IN 2005 PENSION EXPENSE AS COMPARED TO

2004 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ABSENCE OF

$446 MILLION NET SETTLEMENT AND CURTAILMENT CHARGES

RECORDED IN 2004 IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF INVISTA. IN

ADDITION, THE LOWER EXPENSE IN 2005 REFLECTS FAVORABLE RETURNS

ON PENSION ASSETS, HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION PLANS AND

CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES. THE INCREASE IN 2005 OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS THE ABSENCE

OF $436 MILLION CURTAILMENT GAINS RECOGNIZED IN 2004 IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF INVISTA.

THE COMPANYS KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND THE DISCOUNT RATE

(SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR

2007, THE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED RETURNS ON PENSION ASSETS, THE

IMPACT OF THE U.S. PLAN AMENDMENT AND CHANGES IN

DEMOGRAPHIC AND DISCOUNT RATES IN 2006 ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN

A REDUCTION IN PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PRETAX

EXPENSES OF ABOUT $200 MILLION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS

DUPONT OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, PRODUCT

HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD

ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. COMPANY POLICY

REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED LEGAL AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, DUPONT IMPLEMENTS

VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, ELIMINATE THE

INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION

OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS. THE COSTS TO

COMPLY WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL

AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND

WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WHILE THESE COSTS MAY

INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRETAX ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS

TOTALED $521 MILLION IN 2006 COMPARED WITH

$468 MILLION IN 2005 AND $455 MILLION IN 2004. THESE

EXPENSES INCLUDE THE REMEDIATION ACCRUALS DISCUSSED BELOW;

OPERATING, MAINTENANCE AND DEPRECIATION COSTS FOR SOLID WASTE,

AIR AND WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES AND THE COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. WHILE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT

COMPONENT OF THE COMPANYS OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THESE COSTS TO BECOME PROPORTIONALLY GREATER

AS THE COMPANY INCREASES ITS PARTICIPATION IN BUSINESSES FOR

WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE REQUIRED DURING PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. THE LARGEST OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES IN 2006

WAS $109 MILLION FOR THE OPERATION OF WATER POLLUTION

CONTROL FACILITIES AND $127 MILLION FOR SOLID WASTE

MANAGEMENT. ABOUT 78 PERCENT OF TOTAL ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENSES RESULTED FROM OPERATIONS IN THE U.S.

IN 2006, DUPONT SPENT APPROXIMATELY $135 MILLION ON

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR

NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANYS INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL

GOALS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS WILL TOTAL

$143 MILLION IN 2007. IN THE U.S., SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE

FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND

HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA).

UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN,

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING FUTURE ESTIMATES

FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL CAA CAPITAL COSTS OVER THE NEXT

TWO YEARS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO RANGE FROM $40 MILLION

TO $70 MILLION.

THE GOAL OF THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) IS TO

PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISKS OF INJURY TO HEALTH OR THE

ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURE, PROCESSING,

DISTRIBUTION IN COMMERCE, USE, OR DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL

SUBSTANCES. UNDER TSCA, THE EPA HAS ESTABLISHED REPORTING,

RECORD-KEEPING, TESTING AND

CONTROL-RELATED

REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW AND EXISTING CHEMICALS. IN 1998, THE EPA

CHALLENGED THE U.S. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TO VOLUNTARILY

CONDUCT SCREENING LEVEL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING

ON NEARLY 3,000 HIGH PRODUCTION VOLUME (HPV) CHEMICALS OR TO

MAKE EQUIVALENT INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AN HPV CHEMICAL

IS A CHEMICAL LISTED ON THE 1990 INVENTORY UPDATE RULE WITH

ANNUAL U.S. CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS OF ONE

MILLION POUNDS OR MORE. THE COMPANY IS SPONSORING MORE THAN TWO

DOZEN HPV CHEMICALS UNDER THE EPAS CHALLENGE PROGRAM. AN

EXTENDED HPV PROGRAM HAS BEEN INITIATED BY THE AMERICAN

CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IN WHICH DUPONT HAS AGREED TO SPONSOR AN

ADDITIONAL ELEVEN NEW HPV CHEMICALS LISTED ON THE 2002 INVENTORY

UPDATE RULE. SINCE 2000, THE ENTIRE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY HAS SPENT

AN ESTIMATED $250 MILLION ON HPV TESTING. IN ANTICIPATION

OF THE HPV CHALLENGE PROGRAM ENDING, THE EPA ADOPTED TWO NEW

RULES UNDER TSCA THAT REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT CERTAIN

UNPUBLISHED HEALTH AND SAFETY DATA AND PRODUCTION/EXPOSURE DATA

FOR CERTAIN HPV CHEMICALS TO THE EPA.

IN DECEMBER 2006, THE EUROPEAN UNION ADOPTED A NEW REGULATORY

FRAMEWORK CONCERNING THE REGISTRATION, EVALUATION AND

AUTHORIZATION OF CHEMICALS. THIS REGULATORY FRAMEWORK KNOWN AS

REACH WILL ENTER INTO FORCE ON JUNE 1, 2007. ONE OF

ITS MAIN OBJECTIVES IS THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

ENVIRONMENT. REACH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS TO

GATHER INFORMATION ON THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR SUBSTANCES THAT

MEET CERTAIN VOLUME OR TOXICOLOGICAL CRITERIA AND REGISTER THE

INFORMATION IN A CENTRAL DATABASE TO BE MAINTAINED BY A CHEMICAL

AGENCY IN FINLAND. THE REGULATION ALSO CALLS FOR THE PROGRESSIVE

SUBSTITUTION OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CHEMICALS WHEN SUITABLE

ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. MANAGEMENT IS CURRENTLY

EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF REACH ON ITS OPERATIONS

AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION.

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

TO ESTABLISH SHORT-TERM ACTIONS UNDER THE CONVENTION. THE

PROTOCOL ENTERED INTO FORCE IN FEBRUARY 2005 IN MOST COUNTRIES

IN WHICH DUPONT OPERATES. THE U.S. HAS DECLINED TO RATIFY

THE PROTOCOL. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS ALREADY BEGUN A

PROGRAM TO REDUCE EMISSIONS THAT INCLUDES EMISSIONS TRADING

SYSTEM LINKED TO THE PROTOCOL. THE U.S. CONTINUES TO PURSUE

A LESS-RESTRICTIVE CLIMATE POLICY FRAMEWORK, EMPHASIZING

VOLUNTARY ACTION. THE PROTOCOL ESTABLISHES SIGNIFICANT EMISSION

REDUCTION TARGETS FOR SIX GASES CONSIDERED TO HAVE GLOBAL

WARMING POTENTIAL AND IS DRIVING MANDATORY REDUCTIONS IN

DEVELOPED NATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. DUPONT HAS A STAKE IN A

NUMBER OF THESE

GASES-CO

2

,

HFCS AND PFCS-AND HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY REDUCING ITS EMISSIONS OF

THESE GASES SINCE 1991. DUPONT HAS ACHIEVED REDUCTIONS THAT ARE

WELL AHEAD OF THE TARGET AND TIMETABLE OF THE PROTOCOL. HOWEVER,

THE COMPANY FACES THE POSSIBILITY OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC

RESTRICTIONS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES WHERE MAJOR REDUCTIONS HAVE

NOT YET BEEN ACHIEVED. HIGH ENERGY PRICES IN EUROPE AND THE

U.S. IN RECENT YEARS ARE ALSO DUE, AT LEAST IN PART, TO

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES IN THE U.S.

AND THE IMPACT OF EUROPEAN CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. DUPONT IS

PARTICIPATING IN EMISSIONS TRADING IN THE EU THROUGH THE

REGULATORY DRIVEN EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME AND IN THE

U.S. THROUGH THE VOLUNTARY CHICAGO CLIMATE EXCHANGE

PROGRAM. EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES WITHIN THE U.S. ARE

NOT EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ALTHOUGH CONGRESSIONAL

PROPOSALS FOR SUCH MANDATES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND A NUMBER OF

STATES ARE PURSUING

STATE-LEVEL

PROGRAMS.

DUPONT HAS DISCOVERED THAT VERY LOW LEVELS OF DIOXINS (PARTS PER

TRILLION TO LOW PARTS PER BILLION) AND RELATED COMPOUNDS ARE

INADVERTENTLY GENERATED DURING ITS TITANIUM DIOXIDE PIGMENT

PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS LAUNCHED AN EXTENSIVE

RESEARCH AND PROCESS ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY

THE CAUSE OF THE DIOXIN GENERATION AND TO IDENTIFY PROCESS

MODIFICATIONS THAT WILL ELIMINATE DIOXIN FORMATION. THE PROGRAMS

IMPLEMENTED TO DATE HAVE RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF ALMOST

50 PERCENT. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2007, DUPONT WILL

IMPLEMENT CAPITAL PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE THE AGGRESSIVE GOALS TO

REDUCE SUCH DIOXIN GENERATION BY 90 PERCENT BY YEAR END

2007. OVER 99 PERCENT OF THE DIOXIN GENERATED AT

DUPONTS PRODUCTION PLANTS BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESS

SOLID WASTES THAT ARE DISPOSED IN CONTROLLED LANDFILLS WHERE

PUBLIC EXPOSURE IS NEGLIGIBLE.

REMEDIATION

EXPENDITURES

THE RCRA EXTENSIVELY REGULATES AND REQUIRES PERMITS FOR THE

TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. RCRA

REQUIRES THAT PERMITTED FACILITIES UNDERTAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT THE FACILITY. IF CONDITIONS

WARRANT, COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION

CAUSED BY PRIOR OPERATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO CERCLA, THE COSTS OF

THE RCRA CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY BORNE SOLELY BY

THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT SIGNIFICANT ONGOING

EXPENDITURES FOR RCRA REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES MAY BE REQUIRED

OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEAR

TERM, HOWEVER, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE

RANGE OF SUCH EXPENDITURES EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE

UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANYS

EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION

ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $44 MILLION IN 2006,

$49 MILLION IN 2005, AND $43 MILLION IN 2004.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

OR NOTICES OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM THE EPA AND STATE

ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY IS A PRP UNDER

CERCLA OR SIMILAR STATE STATUTES. CERCLA IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS

THE SUPERFUND AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN

INVESTIGATIVE AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE IT CONDUCTS

OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR WHERE COMPANY GENERATED WASTE

HAS BEEN DISPOSED. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO, ON OCCASION, BEEN

ENGAGED IN COST RECOVERY LITIGATION INITIATED BY THOSE AGENCIES

OR BY PRIVATE PARTIES. THESE REQUESTS, NOTICES AND LAWSUITS

ASSERT POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT VARIOUS

SITES THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT COMPANY OWNED, BUT ALLEGEDLY

CONTAIN WASTES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS PAST

OPERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED

OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA OR STATE LAWS AT 390 SITES

IN DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE,

LIKE THE COMPANYS, REPRESENTED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF

THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE

OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT SIX NEW SITES DURING 2006 COMPARED

WITH EIGHT SIMILAR NOTICES IN 2005 AND FOUR IN 2004. THE

COMPANYS EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH CERCLA AND SIMILAR

STATE REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION

IN 2006, $27 MILLION IN 2005, AND $27 MILLION IN 2004.

FOR NEARLY ALL SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL

LIABILITY WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TOTAL SITE

REMEDIATION COSTS BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF WASTE ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE COMPANY VERSUS THAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALL OTHER PRPS IS

RELATIVELY LOW. OTHER PRPS AT SITES, WHERE THE COMPANY IS A

PARTY, TYPICALLY HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO MEET THEIR

OBLIGATIONS AND, WHERE THEY DO NOT, OR WHERE PRPS CANNOT BE

LOCATED, THE COMPANYS OWN SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS NOT

MATERIALLY INCREASED. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW SITES WHERE THE

COMPANY IS A MAJOR PARTICIPANT AND THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF

REMEDIATION AT THOSE SITES AND AT ALL CERCLA SITES IN THE

AGGREGATE, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANY.

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES

UNDER CERCLA, RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS WERE $64 MILLION

IN 2006, $79 MILLION IN 2005, AND $74 MILLION IN 2004.

ACCRUALS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL

LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. OF THE $349 MILLION

ACCRUED LIABILITY, APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT WAS RESERVED

FOR

NON-U.S. FACILITIES.

APPROXIMATELY 65 PERCENT OF THE RESERVE BALANCE WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION LIABILITIES, WHILE

ABOUT 25 PERCENT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERCLA LIABILITIES.

REMEDIATION ACCRUALS OF $71 MILLION, $64 MILLION AND

$58 MILLION WERE ADDED TO THE RESERVE IN 2006, 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY.

DUPONT MANUFACTURES FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AS WELL

AS FLUOROTELOMERS, MARKETING MANY OF THEM UNDER THE

TEFLON

®

AND

ZONYL

®

BRANDS. THE FLUOROPOLYMER RESIN AND DISPERSION BUSINESSES ARE

PART OF THE ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES

SEGMENT; THE FLUOROTELOMERS BUSINESS IS PART OF THE

SAFETY & PROTECTION SEGMENT.

FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS ARE HIGH-PERFORMANCE

MATERIALS WITH MANY END USES INCLUDING ARCHITECTURAL FABRICS,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONIC WIRING INSULATION, AUTOMOTIVE

FUEL SYSTEMS, COMPUTER CHIP PROCESSING EQUIPMENT,

WEATHER-RESISTANT/BREATHABLE APPAREL AND NONSTICK COOKWARE.

FLUOROTELOMERS ARE USED TO MAKE SOIL, STAIN AND GREASE

REPELLANTS FOR PAPER, APPAREL, UPHOLSTERY AND CARPETS AS WELL AS

FIREFIGHTING FOAMS AND COATINGS.

A FORM OF PFOA (PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING

THE AMMONIUM SALT) IS USED AS A PROCESSING AGENT TO MANUFACTURE

FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS. FOR OVER 50 YEARS,

DUPONT PURCHASED PFOA FROM A THIRD PARTY, BUT BEGINNING IN THE

FALL OF 2002, IT BEGAN PRODUCING PFOA TO SUPPORT THE MANUFACTURE

OF FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS. PFOA IS NOT USED IN THE

MANUFACTURING OF FLUOROTELOMERS; HOWEVER, IT IS AN UNINTENDED

BY-PRODUCT PRESENT AT TRACE LEVELS IN SOME FLUOROTELOMER-BASED

PRODUCTS.

DUPONT PERFORMANCE ELASTOMERS, LLC (DPE) USES PFOA IN ITS

MANUFACTURE OF

KALREZ

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

PFOA IS BIO-PERSISTENT AND HAS BEEN DETECTED AT VERY LOW LEVELS

IN THE BLOOD OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. AS A RESULT, THE EPA

INITIATED A PROCESS TO ENHANCE ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOURCES

OF PFOA IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH HUMAN

EXPOSURE TO PFOA OCCURS. IN 2003, THE EPA ISSUED A PRELIMINARY

RISK ASSESSMENT ON PFOA THAT FOCUSES ON THE EXPOSURE OF THE

U.S. GENERAL POPULATION TO PFOA AND POSSIBLE HEALTH

EFFECTS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY CONCERNS. ON

JANUARY 12, 2005, THE EPA ISSUED A DRAFT RISK

ASSESSMENT ON PFOA. THE DRAFT STATED THAT CANCER DATA FOR PFOA

MAY BE BEST DESCRIBED AS SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE OF

CARCINOGENICITY, BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO ASSESS HUMAN CARCINOGENIC

POTENTIAL UNDER THE EPAS GUIDELINES FOR CARCINOGEN

RISK ASSESSMENT. UNDER THE GUIDELINES, THE DESCRIPTOR

SUGGESTIVE IS TYPICALLY APPLIED TO AGENTS IF ANIMAL

TESTING FINDS ANY EVIDENCE THAT EXPOSURE CAUSES TUMORS IN ONE

SPECIES OF ANIMAL.

THE EPA REQUESTED THAT THE SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD (SAB) REVIEW

AND COMMENT ON THE SCIENTIFIC SOUNDNESS OF THIS ASSESSMENT. ON

MAY 31, 2006, THE SAB RELEASED ITS REPORT SETTING

FORTH THE VIEW, BASED ON LABORATORY STUDIES IN RATS, THAT THE

HUMAN CARCINOGENIC POTENTIAL OF PFOA IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE

EPAS DESCRIPTOR OF LIKELY TO BE CARCINOGENIC

AS DEFINED IN THE GUIDELINES FOR CARCINOGEN RISK ASSESSMENT.

HOWEVER, IN ITS REPORT THE SAB INDICATED THAT ADDITIONAL DATA

SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE THE EPA FINALIZES ITS RISK

ASSESSMENT OF PFOA. UNDER THE GUIDELINES THE LIKELY

DESCRIPTOR IS TYPICALLY APPLIED TO AGENTS THAT HAVE TESTED

POSITIVE IN MORE THAN ONE SPECIES, SEX, STRAIN, SITE OR EXPOSURE

ROUTE WITH OR WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF CARCINOGENICITY IN HUMANS. THE

EPA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WILL CONSIDER ADDITIONAL DATA AND

HAS INDICATED THAT ANOTHER SAB REVIEW WILL BE SOUGHT AFTER THE

EPA MAKES ITS RISK ASSESSMENT. DUPONT DISPUTES THE CANCER

CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDED IN THE SAB REPORT BECAUSE IT IS BASED

ON ANIMAL STUDIES AND DOES NOT ADEQUATELY REFLECT HUMAN HEALTH

DATA WHICH TO DATE DEMONSTRATES NO INCREASE IN CANCER RATES

KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, A COALITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR GROUPS

SUBMITTED A PETITION TO ACCELERATE THE CONSIDERATION OF PFOA

UNDER CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION 65 WHICH REQUIRES THE STATE TO

PUBLISH A LIST OF CHEMICALS KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS

OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. THE PETITION WAS DENIED DURING

FOURTH QUARTER 2006.

THE EPA HAS STATED THAT THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PFOA. THE

EPA HAS ALSO STATED THAT IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY

REASON FOR CONSUMERS TO STOP USING ANY PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF

CONCERNS ABOUT PFOA. IN NOVEMBER 2006, DUPONT ENTERED INTO AN

ORDER ON CONSENT UNDER THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA) WITH

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ESTABLISHING A

PRECAUTIONARY INTERIM SCREENING LEVEL FOR PFOA OF 0.5 PART PER

BILLION (PPB) IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE AREA AROUND THE

WASHINGTON WORKS SITE LOCATED IN PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA. AS

PART OF THE ORDER ON CONSENT, DUPONT WILL CONDUCT A SURVEY AND

PERFORM SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL TESTING OF CERTAIN PUBLIC AND

PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS IN THE AREA. DUPONT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE

AGREEMENT TO INSTALL WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS IF PFOA LEVELS AT

OR ABOVE 0.5 PPB ARE DETECTED.

CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO REGULATORY ACTIONS PENDING THAT WOULD

PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION OR USE OF PFOA. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE EPA OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY ENTITY WILL NOT

CHOOSE TO REGULATE OR PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION OR USE OF PFOA IN

THE FUTURE. PRODUCTS CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY

REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF 2006 REVENUES

COULD BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH REGULATION OR PROHIBITION.

DUPONT RESPECTS THE EPAS POSITION RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT

EXPOSURE ROUTES AND THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF PFOA AND DUPONT

AND OTHER COMPANIES HAVE OUTLINED PLANS TO CONTINUE RESEARCH,

EMISSION REDUCTION AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES TO HELP

ADDRESS THE EPAS QUESTIONS. IN JANUARY 2006, DUPONT

PLEDGED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE EPAS 2010/15 PFOA

STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. THE EPA PROGRAM ASKS PARTICIPANTS

(1) TO COMMIT TO ACHIEVE, NO LATER THAN 2010, A

95 PERCENT REDUCTION IN BOTH FACILITY EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT

CONTENT LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER

HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS AND (2) TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE

ELIMINATION OF PFOA, PFOA PRECURSORS AND RELATED HIGHER

HOMOLOGUE CHEMICALS FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY NO LATER THAN

2015.

DUPONT SUBMITTED ITS BASELINE REPORTING DATA TO THE EPA ON

OCTOBER 31, 2006. THE COMPANY HAS REFINED ITS PROGRAM

COMMITMENTS BASED ON A CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE DATA, THE EPA

PROGRAM GUIDELINES AND THE STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. KEY ELEMENTS

OF THE DUPONT COMMITMENT TO EPA INCLUDE REDUCING GLOBAL

EMISSIONS FROM MANUFACTURING FACILITIES BY 97 PERCENT BY

2007 (WHICH INCORPORATES THE SUBSTANTIAL ACHIEVEMENT OF

94 PERCENT REDUCTION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006

ALREADY REALIZED THROUGH DUPONTS ONGOING REDUCTION

PROGRAM); REDUCING PFOA CONTENT IN FLUOROPOLYMER DISPERSIONS

FASTER AND FURTHER THAN THE GOALS SET BY THE PROGRAM; AND, BY

2010, REDUCING PFOA CONTENT AND ANY RESIDUAL IMPURITIES IN

FLUOROTELOMER PRODUCTS THAT COULD BREAK DOWN TO PFOA. DUPONT

WILL WORK INDIVIDUALLY AND WITH OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY TO INFORM

EPAS REGULATORY COUNTERPARTS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION,

CANADA, CHINA AND JAPAN ABOUT THESE ACTIVITIES AND PFOA IN

GENERAL, INCLUDING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM DUPONTS

FACILITIES, REFORMULATION OF THE COMPANYS FLUOROPOLYMER

DISPERSIONS AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES FOR FLUOROTELOMERS

PRODUCTS.

DUPONT HAS DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN REDUCE THE PFOA CONTENT

IN FLUOROPOLYMER DISPERSIONS BY 97 PERCENT AND IS IN THE

PROCESS OF LAUNCHING LOW PFOA DISPERSION PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY STARTED UP A NEW PROCESS AT ITS PASCAGOULA,

MISSISSIPPI MANUFACTURING SITE THAT WILL REDUCE PFOA TRACE

LEVELS IN FLUOROTELOMER PRODUCTS EVEN FURTHER AND BEGAN TO

INTRODUCE PRODUCTS BASED ON THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY IN LATE 2006.

RECENTLY, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATE THE

NEED TO MAKE, BUY OR USE PFOA BY 2015. THIS PLAN CREATES AN

OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMPANY TO LEVERAGE ITS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT STRENGTHS TO DEVELOP NEW SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES

AND PRODUCTS.

BASED ON HEALTH AND TOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES, DUPONT BELIEVES THE

WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT PFOA EXPOSURE DOES NOT POSE A

HEALTH RISK TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. TO DATE NO HUMAN HEALTH

EFFECTS ARE KNOWN TO BE CAUSED BY PFOA, EVEN IN WORKERS WHO HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EXPOSURE LEVELS THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION

ALTHOUGH STUDY OF THE CHEMICAL CONTINUES. DUPONT CONDUCTED A

TWO-PHASE EMPLOYEE HEALTH STUDY ON PFOA AT ITS WASHINGTON WORKS

SITE. RESULTS FROM THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS STUDY FOR MORE THAN

1,000 WORKERS INDICATE NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA

AND MOST OF THE HEALTH PARAMETERS THAT WERE MEASURED. THE ONLY

POTENTIALLY RELEVANT ASSOCIATION IS A MODEST INCREASE IN SOME,

BUT NOT ALL, LIPID FRACTIONS, E.G. CHOLESTEROL, IN SOME OF THE

HIGHEST EXPOSED WORKERS. THE SECOND PHASE WAS A MORTALITY STUDY

THAT INVOLVES THE EXAMINATION OF ALL CAUSES OF DEATH IN MORE

THAN 6,000 EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED AT THE WASHINGTON WORKS SITE

DURING ITS MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF OPERATION. BASED ON THE

OBSERVATION OF A MODEST INCREASE IN SOME LIPID FRACTIONS IN THE

STUDYS FIRST PHASE, THE SECOND PHASE INCLUDED A MORE

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF HEART DISEASE. NO OVERALL INCREASE IN

DEATHS RELATED TO HEART DISEASE WAS FOUND.

DUPONT HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN PFOA

ENVIRONMENTAL AND LITIGATION MATTERS (SEE NOTE 20 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE TRADED AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY

DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE EXPOSURES RELEVANT TO AGRICULTURAL

FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES.

CONCENTRATION

OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF

CASH, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DERIVATIVES.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT

CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF

THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS

ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS ON A DAILY BASIS. THE

COMPANY HAS NOT SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT- AND

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY

DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR

AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANYS SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A

SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE

REPRESENTS MORE THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL

OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS

RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC,

INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING

AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT

CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY

INDUSTRY AND REGION.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW

VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT

CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET

ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS

OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING

PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING

FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE

MINIMIZED.

REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON

A

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO MANAGE

NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE

FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE

MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING

RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT

INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON THREE- OR SIX-MONTH USD LIBOR.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE

OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY

PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED

DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES.

A PORTION OF ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES ARE HEDGED TO REDUCE

PRICE VOLATILITY USING FIXED PRICE SWAPS AND OPTIONS. HEDGED

FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES INCLUDE NATURAL GAS AND ETHANE.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS TO PRODUCE

FINISHED SEED INVENTORY. UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, GROWERS ARE

COMPENSATED WITH BUSHEL EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE MARKETED TO THE

COMPANY FOR THE MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

FOLLOWING HARVEST. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMODITY

FUTURES THAT HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING

COMMODITY, ARE USED TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK INVOLVED

IN COMPENSATING GROWERS.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY FUTURES TO MANAGE

THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF SOYBEAN MEAL. THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY

EXPOSURE AND ARE DEEMED EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING SOYBEAN MEAL

FEEDSTOCK PRICE RISK.

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA (GAAP) AND ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT

FAIRLY THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME

AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE

COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM,

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS

TO EXPRESS AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THEIR

REPORT IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN

ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

DEFINED IN

RULES 13A-15(F)

AND

15D-15(F)

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED

TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

I.

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE

DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

II.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND

THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND

DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

III.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITIONS, USE OR DISPOSITION OF

THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS CERTAIN INHERENT

LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES MAY CAUSE

VARIATION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK.

BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT AND THOSE

CRITERIA, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT PRESENTED ON THE

FOLLOWING PAGE.

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS

AND COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN

THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(1) PRESENT FAIRLY, IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT

DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND

THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF

THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER

ITEM 15(A) (2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN

AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST

BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED

AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATING THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS DURING 2006 AND

FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES DURING 2004.

INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING ON

PAGE F-2,

THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY

STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING

THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS

FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

(DOLLARS

SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DUPONT FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT

FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES

AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

ACCOUNTING

CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123

(REVISED 2004), SHARE BASED PAYMENTS

(SFAS 123R) USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

TRANSITION METHOD AND BEGAN EXPENSING NEW STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARDS USING A NON-SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH WHEREBY

COMPENSATION COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER AT LEAST SIX MONTHS FOR

AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES WHO ARE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE AT THE

DATE OF GRANT OR WOULD BECOME RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE DURING THE

VESTING PERIOD OF THE GRANT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY BEGAN

REPORTING TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM TAX DEDUCTIONS IN EXCESS

OF THE COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS AS FINANCING CASH FLOWS. FOR YEARS PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF

SFAS 123R, THE COMPANY USED THE NOMINAL VESTING APPROACH

FOR ALL AWARDS AND REPORTED THE TAX BENEFIT OF OPTION EXERCISES

AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS. ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R DID NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (SEE NOTE 23).

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY PROSPECTIVELY

ADOPTED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING

FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF SFAS 87, 88, 106 AND 132R

(SFAS 158). UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED IN ITS

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION THE FUNDED STATUS OF ITS DEFINED

BENEFIT POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AND INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS, NET OF TAX, THE PRETAX GAINS AND LOSSES AND

PRIOR SERVICE COSTS AND CREDITS THAT, PURSUANT TO

SFAS NO. 87 AND 106 PRIOR TO AMENDMENT BY

SFAS 158, HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

REPORTED FOR THESE PLANS. ADOPTION OF SFAS 158 WILL NOT

AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE COSTS FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS NOR THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE

FOR THESE PLAN (SEE NOTE 22).

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2006, THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED FASB STAFF

POSITION NO. AUG AIR-1

(FSP AUG AIR-1),

ACCOUNTING FOR PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES,

WHICH LIMITS THE ACCOUNTING METHODS THAT MAY BE USED FOR PLANNED

MAJOR MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF FSP AUG

AIR-1, THE COMPANY HAD PRINCIPALLY USED THE

ACCRUE-IN-ADVANCE

METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. THIS

METHOD IS NOT PERMITTED BY FSP AUG AIR-1. ADOPTION OF FSP AUG

AIR-1 WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE

DEFER-AND-AMORTIZE

METHOD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2005 AND RESULTED IN A $30

DECREASE IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, A $49 INCREASE IN OTHER

ASSETS, A $10 DECREASE IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, A $17 INCREASE IN

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND $52 INCREASE IN REINVESTED EARNINGS AT

JANUARY 1, 2005. THE EFFECTS OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE

ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2005 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2005 WAS

IMPRACTICABLE DUE TO THE 2004 SALE OF TEXTILES AND INTERIORS

ASSETS (SEE NOTE 6).

IN 2004, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 46, CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (REVISED DECEMBER 2003). THE

COMPANY HAS ENTITIES IDENTIFIED AND CONSOLIDATED AS VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES WHERE DUPONT IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES ARE IMMATERIAL TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

F-8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

BASIS OF

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS

MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE) FOR WHICH DUPONT

IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

IN WHICH THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN

100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS INTERESTS ARE

SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A

CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS. THIS

INCLUDES MAJORITY-OWNED ENTITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE A MINORITY INVESTOR HOLDS SUBSTANTIVE

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE

COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY

THE COST METHOD.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS

COMPLETE. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS REVENUES ARE FROM

THE SALE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF

CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS

RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN

TRANSFERRED, COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND PRICING IS

FIXED OR DETERMINABLE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD

FOB (FREE ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO

NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS,

AN EQUIVALENT BASIS. ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND

OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE. THE

COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN

SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS

SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE

INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING

FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY

FOR THE DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD

AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME

STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED

FROM NET SALES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH

CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT AND

RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE

PERIODS. THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE

AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE

PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE,

OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.

LICENSING AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED,

THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS

REASONABLY ASSURED.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED A DUAL APPROACH TO QUANTIFYING MATERIALITY

AND ELECTED TO REFINE THE ACCOUNTING RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING

EXISTING CUTOFF PRACTICES. FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

SALES TRANSACTIONS, OWNERSHIP TITLE TRANSFERS WHEN GOODS ARE

RECEIVED BY THE CUSTOMERS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED

THESE SALES WHEN SHIPPED AND MONITORED THE IMPACT OF THIS

DIFFERENCE. ADDITIONALLY, SOME ACCRUALS WERE HISTORICALLY

RECORDED ON A MONTH-LAG BASIS. THE IMPACTS OF THESE SALES AND

ACCRUAL CUTOFF PRACTICES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE IMMATERIAL IN

EVERY INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIOD. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2006, THE COMPANY CHOSE TO CHANGE ITS PRACTICES TO RECORD THESE

SALES WHEN RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS AND TO RECORD CERTAIN ACCRUALS

WITHOUT A LAG. AS A RESULT, SALES OF $107 WERE NOT RECORDED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 THAT HISTORICALLY WOULD HAVE

BEEN. IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THIS NEW PRACTICE THROUGHOUT

2006, SALES WOULD HAVE BEEN $81 HIGHER THAN REPORTED.

INCREMENTAL ACCRUALS OF $24 WERE ALSO RECORDED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RECORDED

UNDER PRIOR PRACTICES. THE AFTER-TAX IMPACT ON THE 2006 INCOME

STATEMENT OF THESE CHANGES WAS $39.

AFFILIATE

AND SUBSIDIARY STOCK TRANSACTIONS

GAINS OR LOSSES ARISING FROM ISSUANCES BY AN AFFILIATE OR A

SUBSIDIARY OF ITS OWN STOCK ARE RECORDED AS NONOPERATING ITEMS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST

PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF

THE SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS

IN SECURITIES

MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND

FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF TWELVE

MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY

AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED COST.

OTHER ASSETS INCLUDE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, WHICH

COMPRISE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET

PRICES AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A

COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY UNTIL SOLD. AT THE TIME OF SALE, ANY

GAINS OR LOSSES CALCULATED BY THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD

ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME. LOSSES ARE ALSO RECOGNIZED IN

INCOME WHEN A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY. OTHER SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET

VALUES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE ARE CARRIED AT COST (SEE

NOTE 14).

INVENTORIES

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT

COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE

LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD; IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH VALUATIONS ARE

NOT IN EXCESS OF MARKET. PIONEER INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE

LOWER OF COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD, OR MARKET.

ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT

LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED

AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) IS CARRIED AT COST AND

IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PP&E PLACED

IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED UNDER THE

SUM-OF-THE-YEARS

DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR METHODS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER

USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM 15 TO 25 YEARS. CAPITALIZABLE

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 5 TO 7 YEARS. WHEN

ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF,

THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION

ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN

OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS

AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED

MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANYS

FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF

AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AN

ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR

ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE

TECHNIQUES. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME FROM

OPERATIONS.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED TECHNOLOGY,

PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 5 TO

20 YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE

REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE

ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IMPAIRMENT

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO

BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING

VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE

TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH ASSET ARE

SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN

THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANYS FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS

BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, IF AVAILABLE. IF QUOTED MARKET

PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE IS

MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. LOSSES ON

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF ARE DETERMINED IN A SIMILAR

MANNER, EXCEPT THAT FAIR MARKET VALUES ARE REDUCED FOR DISPOSAL

COSTS.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING

EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES

AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE

UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR

PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE,

THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE

AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS

RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED

RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS

RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE

CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED

ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE

OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO

20 YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION

MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS

OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE

PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR

REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS COMPENSATION, VEHICLE

LIABILITY AND EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL

CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF

INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS

OF RELEVANT RISKS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND

LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS

APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES

EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME

TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT

YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED

TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX

BASES OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE

ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE

ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT

WILL NOT BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES

ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT

FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY

INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED

RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST

INCOME, NET OF MISCELLANEOUS INTEREST EXPENSE, UNDER OTHER

INCOME, NET. INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR (USD) IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF MOST OF

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSET

AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE REMEASURED INTO USD AT

END-OF-PERIOD

EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN

CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE

RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO

BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES.

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM REMEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES

ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD, AT

END-OF-PERIOD

EXCHANGE RATES AND THE RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN

OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE REMEASURED INTO THE LOCAL

CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD AND THE RESULTANT

EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT

ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN JUNE 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 48 ACCOUNTING

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 109 ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE

FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX

POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN.

FIN 48 WILL BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY ON

JANUARY 1, 2007. WHILE THE COMPANY IS STILL EVALUATING

THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF FIN 48 ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT BELIEVES THAT ADOPTION OF FIN 48

WILL DECREASE THE LIABILITIES ACCRUED FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 BY $100 TO $125 WITH A

CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN REINVESTED EARNINGS AT

JANUARY 1, 2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157,

(SFAS 157) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, WHICH

ADDRESSES HOW COMPANIES SHOULD MEASURE FAIR VALUE WHEN REQUIRED

FOR RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE U.S. (GAAP). THE

STANDARDS PROVISIONS WILL BE APPLIED TO EXISTING

ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES THAT ARE BASED

ON FAIR VALUE. SFAS 157 DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE STANDARD APPLIES A COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR

VALUE TO BE USED THROUGHOUT GAAP, WITH EMPHASIS ON FAIR VALUE AS

A MARKET-BASED MEASUREMENT VERSUS AN ENTITY-SPECIFIC

MEASUREMENT AND ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT METHODS. THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE EXPANDED TO

INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COMPANIES USE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR

VALUE AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON EARNINGS.

SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER

NOVEMBER 15, 2007. THE NEW STANDARDS PROVISIONS

APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY WILL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY AND THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION ON ITS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

REMAINING MATURITIES, WAS $6,000 AND $6,900 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE

IN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN 2006 WAS DUE TO A DECREASE IN

LONG-TERM DEBT, PRIMARILY SUBSIDIARY BORROWINGS PARTLY OFFSET BY

THE DECEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE OF A TOTAL OF $1,000 IN 10 AND

SUCH PRODUCTS IF THEY FAIL DUE TO A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. THE

TERM OF THESE WARRANTIES VARIES (30 DAYS TO 10 YEARS)

BY PRODUCT. THE COMPANYS ESTIMATED PRODUCT WARRANTY

LIABILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 IS $17. THE COMPANY

HAS RECOURSE PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT WOULD ENABLE

RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTIES FOR AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE

WARRANTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES WHEN,

BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION, IT IS PROBABLE THAT CUSTOMERS

WILL MAKE CLAIMS UNDER WARRANTIES RELATING TO PRODUCTS THAT HAVE

BEEN SOLD AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS (BASED ON

HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE RELATIVE TO SALES) CAN BE MADE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, THE COMPANY

HAS INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE PARTIES AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES

THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS AND

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO

ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY

INDEFINITE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIES ITS DULY

ELECTED OR APPOINTED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS TO THE FULLEST

EXTENT PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW, AGAINST LIABILITIES INCURRED

AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY, SUCH AS ADVERSE

JUDGMENTS RELATING TO LITIGATION MATTERS. IF THE INDEMNIFIED

PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A LIABILITY INCREASE AS

A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE

INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE

INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE

PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS RECORDED

FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005 IS $105 AND $103, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS ACCRUED, DUE TO

THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF

LOSS. NO ASSETS ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE

PROVISIONS EXIST.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF INVISTA, THE COMPANY INDEMNIFIED

KOCH AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAXES,

LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND

WARRANTIES. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS OF $70

IS INCLUDED IN THE INDEMNIFICATIONS BALANCE OF $105 AT

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE EXPECTED TO BE

REQUIRED TO ISSUE THE INDEMNIFICATIONS IN A STANDALONE,

ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY AND, WHERE

APPROPRIATE, BY THE UTILIZATION OF PROBABILITY WEIGHTED

DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW MODELS.

PFOA

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACTIONS INVOLVING THE WASHINGTON WORKS SITE AND SURROUNDING

AREA

IN NOVEMBER 2006, DUPONT ENTERED INTO AN ORDER ON CONSENT UNDER

THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (SDWA) WITH U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ESTABLISHING A PRECAUTIONARY INTERIM

SCREENING LEVEL FOR PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS

AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT) OF 0.5 PARTS PER

BILLION (PPB) IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE AREA AROUND THE

DUPONT WASHINGTON WORKS SITE LOCATED IN PARKERSBURG, WEST

VIRGINIA. AS PART OF THE ORDER ON CONSENT, DUPONT WILL CONDUCT A

SURVEY AND PERFORM SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL TESTING OF CERTAIN

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS IN THE AREA. DUPONT IS REQUIRED

UNDER THE AGREEMENT TO INSTALL WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS IF PFOA

LEVELS AT OR ABOVE 0.5 PPB ARE DETECTED.

IN 2001, DUPONT AND THE WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (WVDEP) SIGNED A MULTIMEDIA CONSENT

ORDER (THE WV ORDER) THAT REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING AND

ANALYSES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCREENING LEVELS FOR PFOA THAT

IS USED OR MANAGED BY THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT. AS A RESULT,

IN 2002, THE WVDEP ESTABLISHED A SCREENING LEVEL OF 150

MICROGRAMS PFOA PER LITER SCREENING LEVEL FOR DRINKING WATER, A

SOIL SCREENING LEVEL OF 240 PARTS PER MILLION, A SCREENING LEVEL

OF 1 MICROGRAM PER CUBIC METER FOR AIR AND A SCREENING LEVEL OF

1360 PPB FOR AQUATIC LIFE. UNDER THE WV ORDER, SANCTIONS

COULD BE IMPOSED IF ANY OF THE SCREENING LEVELS WERE EXCEEDED.

BASED ON SAMPLING THROUGH 2006 AND AIR DISPERSION MODELING,

DUPONT HAS NOT EXCEEDED THESE SCREENING LEVELS. THE COMPANY HAS

AGREED TO CONDUCT ANNUAL SAMPLING IN 2007 FOR THE CITY OF

PARKERSBURG. IN ADDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING OF THE PFOA

LEVELS IN THE GROUNDWATER AND DRINKING WATER HAS BEEN CONDUCTED

ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER PURSUANT TO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

AMONG DUPONT, THE OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, THE

WVDEP AND THE DIVISION OF HEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES, (THE OHIO

MOU). ADDITIONAL MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED IN OHIO THROUGH 2006.

IN LATE 2005 DUPONT AND EPA ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF

UNDERSTANDING (EPA MOU) THAT REQUIRES DUPONT TO MONITOR PFOA IN

THE SOIL, AIR, WATER AND BIOTA AROUND THE WASHINGTON WORKS SITE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, DUPONT HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES

OF ABOUT $1 TO FUND ITS ACTIVITIES UNDER THE WV ORDER, EPA MOU

AND ORDER ON CONSENT.

ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINTS

IN JULY AND DECEMBER 2004, THE EPA FILED ADMINISTRATIVE

COMPLAINTS AGAINST DUPONT ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO

COMPLY WITH THE TECHNICAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE TOXIC

SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) AND THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) REGARDING PFOA. THE FIRST COMPLAINT RELATED

TO INFORMATION ABOUT PFOA FOR A PERIOD BEGINNING IN JUNE 1981

THROUGH MARCH 2001; THE SECOND RELATED TO INFORMATION ABOUT PFOA

FOR A PERIOD BEGINNING IN LATE JULY 2004 TO

MID-OCTOBER 2004. IN DECEMBER 2005, THE PARTIES

ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE THE ORIGINAL

COUNTS SET FORTH IN THE COMPLAINTS AND THE ADDITIONAL COUNTS

RAISED BY THE EPA IN 2005. AS A RESULT IN 2005, THE COMPANY

ESTABLISHED RESERVES OF $16.5 TO FUND ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PAY

CIVIL FINES OF $10.25 AND FUND TWO SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL

PROJECTS AT A TOTAL COST OF $6.25. THE COMPANY PAID THE CIVIL

FINES OF $10.25 IN JANUARY 2006 AND EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE

PROJECTS BY DECEMBER 27, 2008.

DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE: GRAND JURY SUBPOENA

ON MAY 17, 2005, DUPONT WAS SERVED WITH A GRAND JURY

SUBPOENA FROM THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA. THE SUBPOENA, WHICH WAS SERVED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL

CRIMES SECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION

OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ), RELATES TO PFOA, AMMONIUM

PERFLUOROOCTANOATE (APFO),

C-8

AND

FC-143.

THE

SUBPOENA CALLS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS PREVIOUSLY

PRODUCED TO THE EPA AND OTHER DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THOSE

CHEMICALS. DUPONT HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FULLY

RESPONSIVE TO THE DOJ IN THIS MATTER AND HAS BEGUN THE

PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE COLLECTION,

REVIEW AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS WILL CONTINUE INTO 2007.

SEVERAL FORMER DUPONT EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY

BEFORE THE GRAND JURY.

CLASS ACTIONS.

DRINKING WATER

IN AUGUST 2001, A CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED LEACH V. DUPONT,

WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AGAINST DUPONT AND THE

LUBECK PUBLIC SERVICE DISTRICT. DUPONT USES PFOA AS A PROCESSING

AID TO MANUFACTURE FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AND DISPERSIONS AT

VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS

PLANT IN WEST VIRGINIA. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT RESIDENTS

LIVING NEAR THE WASHINGTON WORKS FACILITY HAD SUFFERED, OR MAY

SUFFER, DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN

DRINKING WATER. THE RELIEF SOUGHT INCLUDED DAMAGES FOR MEDICAL

MONITORING, DIMINUTION OF PROPERTY VALUES AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES

PLUS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP RELEASES OF PFOA. DUPONT AND

ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN 2004

AND AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED RESERVES OF $108 IN

2004. THE AGREEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE WOOD COUNTY CIRCUIT

COURT ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005 AFTER A FAIRNESS HEARING.

THE SETTLEMENT BINDS A CLASS OF APPROXIMATELY 80,000 RESIDENTS.

AS DEFINED BY THE COURT, THE CLASS INCLUDES THOSE INDIVIDUALS

WHO HAVE CONSUMED, FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR, WATER CONTAINING 0.05

PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) OR GREATER OF PFOA FROM ANY OF SIX

DESIGNATED PUBLIC WATER SOURCES OR FROM SOLE SOURCE PRIVATE

WELLS.

IN JULY 2005, THE COMPANY PAID THE PLAINTIFFS

ATTORNEYS FEES AND EXPENSES OF $23 AND MADE A PAYMENT OF

$70, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL HAS DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY

HEALTH PROJECT. THE COMPANY ALSO IS FUNDING A HEALTH STUDY BY AN

INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS IN THE COMMUNITIES EXPOSED

TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY

PROBABLE LINK EXISTS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE.

THE INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL HEALTH STUDY IS ESTIMATED TO COST

$15, OF WHICH $5 WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED IN AN INTEREST-BEARING

ESCROW ACCOUNT. AS OF 2006, THE EXPECTED TIMEFRAME TO COMPLETE

THE STUDY IS FOUR TO SIX YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

PROVIDING

STATE-OF-THE

ART WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PFOA

IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER DISTRICTS UNTIL THE SCIENCE PANEL

DETERMINES THAT PFOA DOES NOT CAUSE DISEASE OR APPLICABLE WATER

STANDARDS CAN BE MET WITHOUT SUCH TREATMENT. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE ESTIMATED COST OF CONSTRUCTING,

OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THESE SYSTEMS IS $19 OF WHICH $10 WAS

ORIGINALLY PLACED IN AN INTEREST-BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNT. ALSO,

THE COMPANY IS FUNDING A BOTTLED WATER PROGRAM (ESTIMATED

F-34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

TO COST ABOUT $3) FOR RESIDENTS IN ONE WATER DISTRICT ON AN

INTERIM BASIS UNTIL THE INSTALLATION OF THE WATER TREATMENT

SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF PAYMENTS AND ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN

RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DURING THE PERIOD, THE

RESERVE BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS $26, INCLUDING $7

IN INTEREST BEARING ESCROW ACCOUNTS.

THE SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN THE DISMISSAL OF ALL CLAIMS ASSERTED

IN THE LAWSUIT EXCEPT FOR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF THE

INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL CONCLUDES THAT NO PROBABLE LINK EXISTS

BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY DISEASES, THEN THE SETTLEMENT

WOULD ALSO RESOLVE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS. IF IT CONCLUDES THAT

A PROBABLE LINK DOES EXIST BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND ANY

DISEASES, THEN DUPONT WOULD ALSO FUND UP TO $235 FOR A MEDICAL

MONITORING PROGRAM TO PAY FOR SUCH MEDICAL TESTING. IN THIS

EVENT, PLAINTIFFS WOULD RETAIN THEIR RIGHT TO PURSUE PERSONAL

INJURY CLAIMS. ALL OTHER CLAIMS IN THE LAWSUIT WOULD REMAIN

DISMISSED BY THE SETTLEMENT. DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REMOTE

THAT THE PANEL WILL FIND A PROBABLE LINK. THEREFORE, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD NOT ESTABLISHED ANY

RESERVES RELATED TO MEDICAL MONITORING OR PERSONAL INJURY

CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHAT THE

INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL WILL CONCLUDE.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006, THREE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS

WERE FILED ALLEGING THAT DRINKING WATER HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED BY

PFOA IN EXCESS OF 0.05 PPB DUE TO ALLEGED RELEASES FROM CERTAIN

DUPONT PLANTS. ONE OF THESE CASES WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA

STATE COURT ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS OF THE PARKERSBURG CITY WATER

DISTRICT, BUT WAS REMOVED ON DUPONTS MOTION TO THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST

VIRGINIA. THE OTHER TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS WERE FILED IN

NEW JERSEY. ONE WAS FILED IN FEDERAL COURT ON BEHALF OF

INDIVIDUALS WHO ALLEGEDLY DRANK WATER CONTAMINATED BY RELEASES

FROM DUPONTS CHAMBERS WORKS PLANT IN DEEPWATER, NEW

JERSEY. THE SECOND WAS FILED IN STATE COURT ON BEHALF OF

CUSTOMERS SERVICED PRIMARILY BY THE PENNSVILLE TOWNSHIP WATER

DEPARTMENT AND WAS REMOVED TO NEW JERSEY FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT

ON DUPONTS MOTION. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DEFEND ITSELF

VIGOROUSLY AGAINST THESE LAWSUITS ALLEGING CONTAMINATION OF

DRINKING WATER SOURCES. WHILE DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO PFOA, A

RANGE OF SUCH LOSS, IF ANY, CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT

THIS TIME.

ALL CANADIAN CONSUMERS, NOT JUST QUEBEC RESIDENTS, OF THESE

PRODUCTS AS PART OF THE CLASS. DAMAGES ARE NOT QUANTIFIED, BUT

ARE ALLEGED TO INCLUDE THE COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AS WELL

AS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CLASS MEMBER AS EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE 22 CLASS ACTIONS AND THE MOTION

FILED IN QUEBEC ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND, THEREFORE, BELIEVES IT IS

REMOTE THAT IT WILL INCUR LOSSES RELATED TO THESE ACTIONS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD NOT ESTABLISHED ANY

ELASTOMERS

ANTITRUST MATTERS

SINCE 2002, THE U.S., EUROPEAN UNION AND CANADIAN ANTITRUST

AUTHORITIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE SYNTHETIC RUBBER MARKETS FOR

POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDED DDE AS A

RESULT OF ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE POLYCHLOROPRENE (PCP) AND

ETHYLENE PROPYLENE DIENE MONOMER (EPDM) MARKETS. DDE WAS A JOINT

VENTURE BETWEEN THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY (DOW) AND DUPONT. DDE

AND DUPONT WERE NAMED IN RELATED CIVIL LITIGATION.

IN APRIL OF 2004, DUPONT AND DOW ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF

AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH DUPONT OBTAINED COMPLETE CONTROL OVER

DIRECTING DDES RESPONSE TO THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND THE

RELATED LITIGATION AND DUPONT AGREED TO A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE

OF THE VENTURES LIABILITIES AND COSTS RELATED TO THESE

MATTERS. CONSEQUENTLY, DUPONT BEARS ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITIES

AND COSTS UP TO THE INITIAL $150. DOW IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY

DUPONT FOR UP TO $72.5 BY PAYING 15 TO 30 PERCENT TOWARD

LIABILITIES AND COSTS IN EXCESS OF $150. ON

JUNE 30, 2005, DDE BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

DUPONT AND WAS RENAMED DUPONT PERFORMANCE ELASTOMERS LLC (DPE).

DDE RESOLVED ALL CRIMINAL ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS AGAINST IT

RELATED TO PCP IN THE U.S. THROUGH A PLEA AGREEMENT WITH

THE DOJ IN JANUARY 2005 WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE COURT ON

MARCH 29, 2005. THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE SUBSIDIARY

TO PAY A FINE OF $84 WHICH, AT ITS ELECTION, MAY BE PAID IN SIX

EQUAL, ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS. THE ANNUAL INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS FOR

2005 AND 2006 HAVE BEEN MADE. THE AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE

SUBSIDIARY TO PROVIDE ONGOING COOPERATION WITH THE DOJS

INVESTIGATION. DDE RESPONDED TO INVESTIGATIONS BY EUROPEAN UNION

AND CANADIAN ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES AND DPE CONTINUES TO

COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES.

IN NOVEMBER OF 2004, THE COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT REACHED

BY DDE AND ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS, OF FEDERAL ANTITRUST

LITIGATION RELATED TO PCP FOR $42, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS

FEES AND COSTS. DDE ALSO REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH ATTORNEYS FOR

THE CLASS, OF FEDERAL ANTITRUST LITIGATION RELATED TO EPDM FOR

$24.6, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. THE COURT

APPROVED THE EPDM SETTLEMENT IN MAY 2005. DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2006, THE COURT-APPOINTED FUND ADMINISTRATORS

RETURNED A PORTION OF THE CLASS SETTLEMENT PAID IN CONNECTION

WITH THE PCP CLASS ACTION RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS THAT

OPTED OUT OF THE CLASS. INCLUDING THE PCP AND EPDM CLASS

SETTLEMENTS, NET OF THE PCP CLASS ACTION FUNDS RETURNED TO THE

COMPANY, RELATED TO CIVIL LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ALLEGING ANTITRUST

VIOLATIONS IN CERTAIN SYNTHETIC RUBBER MARKETS, THE COMPANY HAS

PAID $106 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2006. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 THERE ARE NO PENDING CIVIL LAWSUITS

OR CLAIMS.

AS A RESULT OF ITS APRIL 2004 AGREEMENTS WITH DOW, DUPONT

ESTABLISHED RESERVES IN 2004 OF $268, OF WHICH $18 WILL BE

REIMBURSED BY DOW TO REFLECT ITS SHARE OF ANTICIPATED LOSSES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE BALANCE OF THE RESERVES IS

$126, WHICH REFLECTS NET ADJUSTMENTS MADE FOR CLAIMANTS WHO

OPTED OUT OF THE PCP SETTLEMENT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER 2006

AND INCLUDES $56 FOR THE REMAINING FOUR INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS TO

BE MADE UNDER THE PLEA AGREEMENT WITH THE DOJ. GIVEN THE

MATTERS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE CLAIMS IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ACTUAL LOSSES MAY EXCEED THE AMOUNT

ACCRUED. HOWEVER, A RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

GENERAL

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARISING

OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. THESE LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS INCLUDE ACTIONS BASED ON ALLEGED EXPOSURES TO PRODUCTS,

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND CONTRACT AND

ANTITRUST CLAIMS. MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY

SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES,

OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED

ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES.

SUCH CASES MAY ALLEGE CONTAMINATION FROM UNREGULATED SUBSTANCES

OR REMEDIATED SITES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SEPTEMBER 2006, A WEST

VIRGINIA STATE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS ACTION AGAINST DUPONT

SEEKING DAMAGES SIMILAR TO THOSE LISTED ABOVE ALLEGEDLY RELATED

TO A CLOSED ZINC SMELTER. THE SMELTER WAS OWNED AND OPERATED BY

AT LEAST THREE COMPANIES BETWEEN 1910 AND 2001, INCLUDING DUPONT

BETWEEN 1928 AND 1950. DUPONT PERFORMED REMEDIAL MEASURES AT THE

REQUEST OF THE EPA IN THE LATE 1990S AND IN 2001

REPURCHASED THE SITE TO FACILITATE AND COMPLETE THE REMEDIATION.

THE COMPANY CONTESTS THE MERITS OF THIS CASE AND PLANS TO DEFEND

ITSELF VIGOROUSLY AGAINST THIS AND SIMILAR CASES, IF ANY, IN THE

FUTURE. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

THESE VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT

IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO CORRECT THE

EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR

RELEASES OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR

OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET FORTH IN NOTE 1.

MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA,

OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE

THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL

ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED

OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS

DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A

NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS

PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT

WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST

FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS,

DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING

REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND

ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

AND 2005, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDES A LIABILITY OF

$349 AND $343, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO THESE MATTERS AND, IN

MANAGEMENTS OPINION, IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON EXISTING

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE AVERAGE TIME FRAME, OVER WHICH THE

ACCRUED OR PRESENTLY UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS MAY BE PAID, BASED ON

PAST HISTORY, IS ESTIMATED TO BE

15-20 YEARS.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE COSTS AND,

UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY

RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006.

OTHER

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS INCIDENT TO THE

ORDINARY CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. IN THE AGGREGATE, SUCH COMMITMENTS

ARE NOT AT PRICES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT MARKET.

STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A

$2 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN IN JUNE 2001. DURING 2005,

THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 9.9 MILLION SHARES AT A

TOTAL COST OF $505. DURING 2006, THERE WERE NO PURCHASES OF

STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND

2005, THE COMPANY HAS PURCHASED 20.5 MILLION SHARES AT A

TOTAL COST OF $962. MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A TIMELINE

FOR THE BUYBACK OF THE REMAINING STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN.

IN ADDITION TO THE PLAN DESCRIBED ABOVE, IN OCTOBER 2005 THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK

PLAN. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE

AGREEMENT WITH GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. (GOLDMAN SACHS)

UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 75.7 MILLION

SHARES OF DUPONTS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FROM GOLDMAN

SACHS ON OCTOBER 27, 2005 AT A PRICE OF

$39.62 PER SHARE, WITH GOLDMAN SACHS PURCHASING AN

EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET OVER THE

FOLLOWING NINE-MONTH PERIOD.

ON JULY 27, 2006, GOLDMAN SACHS COMPLETED ITS PURCHASE

OF 75.7 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONTS COMMON STOCK AT A

VOLUME WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP) OF $41.99 PER SHARE. UPON

THE CONCLUSION OF THE AGREEMENT IN 2006, THE COMPANY PAID $180

IN CASH TO GOLDMAN SACHS TO SETTLE THE AGREEMENT. THE FINAL

SETTLEMENT PRICE WAS BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VWAP

PER SHARE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD, WHICH ENDED

JULY 27, 2006, AND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF $39.62 PER

SHARE. THE AMOUNT PAID TO SETTLE THE CONTRACT WAS RECORDED AS A

REDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL DURING THE THIRD QUARTER

2006. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF ITS

SHARES IN THE THIRD QUARTER FOR $100 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF

$42.27 PER SHARE, BRINGING PURCHASES TO DATE UNDER THE

$5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN TO $3.3 BILLION.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES COMPLETING THE REMAINING

$1.7 BILLION OF THE PROGRAM, CONSISTENT WITH ITS FINANCIAL

DISCIPLINE PRINCIPLES, BY THE END OF 2007.

PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN. COVERED EMPLOYEES ON THE ROLLS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE

BENEFITS IN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, BUT AT A

REDUCED RATE OF ONE-THIRD OF ITS CURRENT LEVEL EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2008. IN ADDITION, COMPANY-PAID

POSTRETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFITS FOR THESE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT

CONTINUE TO GROW AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. COVERED

EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2006 WILL NOT

PARTICIPATE IN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN. AS A RESULT

OF THIS PLAN AMENDMENT, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO REMEASURE

ITS PENSION EXPENSE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006, REFLECTING PLAN

ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF THE REMEASUREMENT DATE.

BETTER THAN EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND A HIGHER DISCOUNT

RATE OF 6 PERCENT DECREASED PRETAX PENSION EXPENSE FOR 2006

BY $72.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES PUBLISHED LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE

BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE AT MEASUREMENT DATE.

WHERE COMMONLY AVAILABLE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS INDICES OF

VARIOUS DURATIONS TO REFLECT THE TIMING OF FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS.

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IN THE U.S. WAS

SELECTED FROM WITHIN THE REASONABLE RANGE OF RATES DETERMINED BY

(A) HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE

ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND

(B) PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD

DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FOR

NON-U.S. PLANS,

ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH

COUNTRY.

ESSENTIALLY ALL PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. ARE

INVESTED THROUGH A SINGLE MASTER TRUST FUND. THE STRATEGIC ASSET

ALLOCATION FOR THIS TRUST FUND IS SELECTED BY MANAGEMENT,

REFLECTING THE RESULTS OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSET LIABILITY

MODELING. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GUIDING INVESTMENT OF

U.S. PENSION ASSETS ARE THOSE EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES

INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS

AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRUDENT EXPERT STANDARD

AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES

STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE

BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF

ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC

ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE

THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS DIRECTLY HELD $486

CONTRIBUTIONS

IN 2006, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $280 TO ITS PENSION PLANS. NO

CONTRIBUTIONS WERE REQUIRED OR MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN TRUST FUND IN 2006 AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS

ARE REQUIRED OR EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO THIS PLAN IN 2007. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ASSET VALUES DURING THE YEAR.

THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (THE ACT) WAS

SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN AUGUST 2006. THE ACT

INTRODUCES NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-EMPLOYER DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING PENSION

PLAN ASSETS AND PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR FUNDING PURPOSES,

INTRODUCES BENEFIT LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN UNDERFUNDED PLANS AND

RAISES TAX DEDUCTION LIMITS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT

PLANS. THE NEW FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR PLAN

YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2007. ALTHOUGH

SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY GUIDANCE WILL BE REQUIRED PRIOR TO THE

ACTS EFFECTIVE DATE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT

THE ACT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL NEAR-TERM IMPACT ON ITS REQUIRED

CONTRIBUTIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY

$290 IN 2007 TO ITS PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL

U.S. PENSION PLAN AND ALSO EXPECTS TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS OF

$338 IN 2007 UNDER ITS OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1,253 TO ITS PENSION

PLANS, INCLUDING A $1,000 CONTRIBUTION TO ITS PRINCIPAL

DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH

COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT IS THE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN (THE PLAN). THIS

PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

(ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP

AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE

PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS

BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY

TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX

QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR

DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY

MAY PARTICIPATE. UNDER THE PLAN, THE COMPANY WILL CONTRIBUTE AN

AMOUNT EQUAL TO 50 PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF

THE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. THE COMPANYS

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN WERE $52, $51 AND $53 FOR YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE

COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS VEST IMMEDIATELY UPON CONTRIBUTION

TO THE PLAN. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $34,

$30 AND $29 FOR YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY, TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTIONS PLANS OTHER THAN

THE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, FOR COVERED EMPLOYEES HIRED ON

THAT DATE OR THEREAFTER AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, FOR

COVERED EMPLOYEES ON THE ROLLS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE

COMPANY WILL CONTRIBUTE 100 PERCENT OF THE FIRST

6 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTION ELECTION AND

ALSO CONTRIBUTE 3 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION. IN ADDITION, THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE

DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION IN THE PENSION PLAN. THIS

ENHANCED SAVINGS PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CHANGES

TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN DISCUSSED ABOVE.

COMPENSATION

PLANS

THE DUPONT STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN PROVIDES FOR LONG-TERM

INCENTIVE GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO KEY

EMPLOYEES.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

SFAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

TRANSITION METHOD. BECAUSE THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE

RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123R PROSPECTIVELY ON

JANUARY 1, 2003, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R,

THE NOMINAL VESTING APPROACH WAS FOLLOWED FOR ALL AWARDS. UPON

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY

BEGAN EXPENSING NEW STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS USING A

NON-SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH, UNDER WHICH COMPENSATION COSTS ARE

RECOGNIZED OVER AT LEAST SIX MONTHS FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO

EMPLOYEES WHO ARE RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE AT THE DATE OF THE GRANT

OR WOULD BECOME RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE DURING THE VESTING PERIOD OF

THE GRANT. USING THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING APPROACH IN LIEU OF

THE NOMINAL VESTING APPROACH WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PRIOR TO THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, THE COMPANY REPORTED THE TAX BENEFIT

OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS. UPON THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R, TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM TAX

DEDUCTIONS IN EXCESS OF COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED FOR THOSE

OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE REPORTED AS FINANCING CASH

FLOWS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS FOR ANY CONSECUTIVE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS

72 MILLION SHARES. OF THE 72 MILLION SHARES,

12 MILLION MAY BE TIME-VESTED

AND/OR

PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2006, APPROXIMATELY 44 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR

FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE COMPANYS PLAN. THE COMPANYS

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX,

INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, TIME-VESTED AND PERFORMANCE-BASED

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND MAY AUTHORIZE NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

STOCK

OPTIONS

THE COMPANY GRANTS STOCK OPTION AWARDS UNDER THE DUPONT STOCK

PERFORMANCE PLAN. THE PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION

IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK ON THE

DATE OF GRANT. PRIOR TO 2004, OPTIONS EXPIRED 10 YEARS FROM

DATE OF GRANT; HOWEVER, BEGINNING IN 2004, OPTIONS SERIALLY VEST

OVER A

THREE-YEAR

PERIOD AND CARRY A SIX-YEAR OPTION TERM. THE PLAN ALLOWS

RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO RETAIN ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON

RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX

MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING GRANT DATE.

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS

AWARDS, THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL

AND THE ASSUMPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE

25. DERIVATIVES

AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES

AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

UNDER PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST

RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. THE FRAMEWORK HAS ESTABLISHED A

VARIETY OF APPROVED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE UTILIZED IN

EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS VARYING LEVELS OF

EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO EACH HEDGING PROGRAM. DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS UTILIZED DURING THE PERIOD INCLUDE FORWARDS,

OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY

NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

THE FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH SENIOR MANAGEMENTS FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES THROUGH A CORPORATE

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY. IN ADDITION, THE POLICY

ESTABLISHES OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES AND RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

THAT AUTHORIZE THE USE OF SPECIFIC DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

FURTHER ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION,

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL AND ROUTINE MONITORING AND

REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF

NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY MANAGES THIS

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS THROUGH THE AFOREMENTIONED CREDIT

APPROVALS, LIMITS AND MONITORING PROCEDURES AND, TO THE EXTENT

POSSIBLE, BY RESTRICTING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH UNPAID BALANCES

ARE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS AND NO

MATERIAL LOSS WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH NONPERFORMANCE. MARKET

AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS

ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY HEDGES FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN BUSINESS SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES AND CERTAIN ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE TRADED AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY

DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE EXPOSURES RELEVANT TO AGRICULTURAL

FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES.

FAIR

VALUE HEDGES

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAS

MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT INVOLVE THE

EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS WHICH

ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE

DEBT. ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF

HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO

THESE HEDGES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT

HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE EACH

PERIOD. THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED

DEBT ARE ALSO RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS NO OTHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

CASH FLOW

HEDGES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF CASH FLOW HEDGING PROGRAMS TO

REDUCE RISKS RELATED TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK. COMMODITY PRICE

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS NATURAL GAS,

ETHANE, CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL. WHILE EACH RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD, MOST

PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR PERIOD.

HEDGES OF INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF

COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING

THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS.

RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A

FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE. CASH FLOW HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR 2006 IS A PRETAX GAIN

OF $1. DURING 2006, THERE WERE NO PRETAX GAINS (LOSSES) EXCLUDED

HEDGES OF

NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY DID

NOT MAINTAIN ANY HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION.

DERIVATIVES

NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET

EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED

MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES

PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING. HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED

REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTS IN

A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS A FEW SMALL RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR AGRICULTURAL

COMMODITIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.

CURRENCY

RISK

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET

ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES

OTHER THAN THE DESIGNATED FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE PRIMARY

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED

POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES

RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX

EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN ANOTHER

CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING

WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A

CASE-BY-CASE

BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE

EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN

CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE FOREIGN CURRENCY

DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST

RATE RISK

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE

INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED

OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING

RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH UNDERLYING

FIXED-RATE BONDS OR NOTES TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT

INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON THREE- OR

SIX-MONTH

USD LIBOR.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST

RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $1,800, WHEREBY THE COMPANY, OVER THE REMAINING

TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING NOTES, WILL RECEIVE A FIXED RATE PAYMENT

EQUIVALENT TO THE FIXED INTEREST RATE OF THE UNDERLYING NOTE AND

PAY A FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST THAT IS BASED ON THREE- OR

SIX-MONTH

USD LIBOR.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS OVERALL COST OF BORROWING AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005. SEE NOTE 18 FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTIONS OF

INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

COMMODITY

PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

OVER-THE-COUNTER

AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE

THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY FEEDSTOCK AND

AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXPOSURES.
