PART I

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS REPORT, INCLUDING "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" IN ITEM 7,

CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR USE OF

WORDS LIKE "PLANS," "EXPECTS," "WILL," "ANTICIPATES," "INTENDS," "PROJECTS,"

"ESTIMATES" OR OTHER WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING. ALL STATEMENTS THAT ADDRESS

EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE, INCLUDING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE

COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR GROWTH, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET POSITION,

EXPENDITURES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

FUTURE EVENTS. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND

EXPECTATIONS ARE ACCURATE OR WILL BE REALIZED. IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING ARE

SOME OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

O THE COMPANY OPERATES IN APPROXIMATELY 75 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE AND DERIVES

ABOUT HALF OF ITS REVENUES FROM SALES INSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND ABOUT

HALF FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE, GOVERNMENTAL AND

QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR POLICIES OF

ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS AND PROFITABILITY IN THAT COUNTRY. ALSO, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS

AND PROFITABILITY IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY COULD BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL OR

ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS ON A DOMESTIC, COUNTRY SPECIFIC OR GLOBAL LEVEL FROM

ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR (WHETHER OR NOT DECLARED) AND THE RESPONSE TO SUCH

ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC FACTORS (INCLUDING A DECLINE IN U.S. OR

EUROPEAN SALES FROM SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THOSE REGIONS, INFLATION OR

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES) AND

COMPETITIVE FACTORS (SUCH AS GREATER PRICE COMPETITION OR EXPIRATION OF

PATENT PROTECTION) IN THOSE COUNTRIES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S REVENUES,

EXPENSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

O THE COMPANY'S GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO

RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO MARKET. THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO.

IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS; SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT; OBTAIN RELEVANT REGULATORY APPROVALS; OBTAIN ADEQUATE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

O THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GROW EARNINGS WILL BE AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN THE

COST OF RAW MATERIALS, PARTICULARLY OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PRODUCTS DERIVED

FROM OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE

EFFECTS OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES OR

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

O AS PART OF ITS STRATEGY FOR GROWTH, THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE

TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES AND FORM STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE WILL BE COMPLETED OR BENEFICIAL TO THE

COMPANY.

O TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE, RESULTS IN THE COMPANY'S AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

SEGMENT REFLECT CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WEATHER AND

GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THESE RESULTS ALSO REFLECT THE SEASONALITY OF SALES OF

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS; HIGHEST SALES IN THE UNITED STATES OCCUR IN THE

FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN THESE

SEGMENTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF GENETICALLY ENHANCED

PRODUCTS.

O THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE PRODUCTIVITY

INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURINGS AND SIX SIGMA

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS, TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND GENERATE COST

SAVINGS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE WILL BE COMPLETED OR

BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY. ALSO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY

ESTIMATED COST SAVINGS FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES WILL BE REALIZED.

O THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND

WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS

FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE SINCE THE ESTIMATES ON

WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE

NATURE OF THE ALLEGATION, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, THE NATURE OF THE

REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS)

3

PART I

AT MULTIPARTY SITES, AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

O THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT

LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS,

PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS.

THE FOREGOING LIST OF IMPORTANT FACTORS IS NOT ALL INCLUSIVE, OR NECESSARILY IN

ORDER OF IMPORTANCE.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

DUPONT WAS FOUNDED IN 1802 AND WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1915. DUPONT IS A

WORLD LEADER IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING

HIGH-PERFORMANCE MATERIALS, SYNTHETIC FIBERS, ELECTRONICS, SPECIALTY CHEMICALS,

AGRICULTURE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBALLY, MANUFACTURING A

WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS FOR DISTRIBUTION AND SALE TO MANY DIFFERENT MARKETS,

INCLUDING THE TRANSPORTATION, TEXTILE, CONSTRUCTION, MOTOR VEHICLE,

AGRICULTURAL, HOME FURNISHINGS, MEDICAL, PACKAGING, ELECTRONICS, AND THE

NUTRITION AND HEALTH MARKETS. TOTAL WORLDWIDE EMPLOYMENT AT YEAR-END 2002 WAS

ABOUT 79,000 PEOPLE.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY STRATEGICALLY REALIGNED ITS BUSINESSES INTO FIVE MARKET-

AND TECHNOLOGY-FOCUSED GROWTH PLATFORMS AND CREATED DUPONT TEXTILES & INTERIORS

(DTI), WITH THE INTENT TO SEPARATE DTI FROM THE COMPANY BY YEAR-END 2003, MARKET

CONDITIONS PERMITTING. THE GROWTH PLATFORMS ARE: AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION;

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES; ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES;

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS; AND SAFETY & PROTECTION. THESE GROWTH PLATFORMS ARE

DESIGNED TO ADDRESS LARGE, ATTRACTIVE MARKET SPACES THAT ALLOW THE COMPANY TO

LEVERAGE ITS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS AND BRANDS, MARKET ACCESS, AND

GLOBAL REACH TO BRING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SPECIFIC ARENAS. THE GROWTH

PLATFORMS, TOGETHER WITH TEXTILES & INTERIORS AND PHARMACEUTICALS, COMPRISE THE

COMPANY'S SEVEN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY'S NONALIGNED AND EMBRYONIC

BUSINESSES ARE GROUPED UNDER OTHER.

ON OCTOBER 1, 2001, DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS WAS SOLD TO THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB

COMPANY. DUPONT RETAINED ITS INTEREST IN COZAAR(R) (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM) AND

HYZAAR(R) (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) BRANDS. THESE

ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS WERE DISCOVERED BY DUPONT AND DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION

WITH MERCK & CO. DUPONT HAS EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED MARKETING RIGHTS FOR COZAAR(R)

AND HYZAAR(R) TO MERCK. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS,

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CONTINUES TO MANUFACTURE COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) FOR

DUPONT. EFFECTIVE WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2001 RESULTS, THE PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT

REFLECTS ONLY DUPONT'S SHARE OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THIS ONGOING

COLLABORATION.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBING THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY CAN BE FOUND ON

THE INDICATED PAGES OF THIS REPORT.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE OPERATIONS IN ABOUT 75 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE

AND, AS A RESULT, ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES ARE MADE TO

CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES OF DUPONT

CONDUCT MANUFACTURING, SEED PRODUCTION, OR SELLING ACTIVITIES, AND SOME ARE

DISTRIBUTORS OF PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY.

SOURCES OF SUPPLY

THE COMPANY UTILIZES NUMEROUS FIRMS AS WELL AS INTERNAL SOURCES TO SUPPLY A WIDE

RANGE OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY, SUPPLIES, SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT. TO ASSURE

AVAILABILITY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR FUELS AND MOST RAW

MATERIALS, INCLUDING HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS. LARGE VOLUME PURCHASES ARE

GENERALLY PROCURED UNDER COMPETITIVELY PRICED SUPPLY CONTRACTS.

EXCLUDING PIONEER HI-BRED INTERNATIONAL INC. AND THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH

BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE PART OF THE AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SEGMENT, A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF THE PRODUCTION AND SALES IN THE SEGMENTS' BUSINESSES IS DEPENDENT

UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCKS. CURRENT HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK

REQUIREMENTS ARE MET BY PURCHASES FROM MAJOR PETROCHEMICAL COMPANIES. DUPONT

PARTICIPATES IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH EQUISTAR CHEMICALS, LP, WHICH MANUFACTURES

AND SUPPLIES A

PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS--CONTINUED

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR ETHYLENE GLYCOL, A

HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK.

PIONEER, WHICH IS IN THE HYBRID SEED INDUSTRY, HAS SEED PRODUCTION FACILITIES

LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, IN BOTH THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES. IN

THE PRODUCTION OF ITS PARENT AND COMMERCIAL SEED, PIONEER GENERALLY PROVIDES THE

SEED STOCK, DETASSELING AND ROGUING LABOR, AND CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTION INPUTS.

THE BALANCE OF THE LABOR, EQUIPMENT, AND INPUTS ARE SUPPLIED BY INDEPENDENT

GROWERS. PIONEER BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF GROWERS, PARENT SEED STOCK, AND

OTHER INPUTS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE ITS COMMERCIAL SEED IS ADEQUATE FOR PLANNED

PRODUCTION LEVELS. THE PRINCIPAL RISK IN THE PRODUCTION OF SEED IS THE

ENVIRONMENT, WITH WEATHER BEING THE SINGLE LARGEST VARIANT. PIONEER LESSENS THIS

RISK BY DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTION ACROSS MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. DUE TO

ITS GLOBAL PRESENCE, THE COMPANY CAN ENGAGE IN SEED PRODUCTION YEAR-ROUND.

PRODUCTION IN THE NUTRITION AND HEALTH BUSINESSES IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT UPON

THE AVAILABILITY OF SOY FLAKE, WHICH IS READILY AVAILABLE FROM MANY SOURCES.

THE MAJOR PURCHASED COMMODITIES, RAW MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES FOR THE COMPANY'S

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IN 2002 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION.

ACETALDOXIME; CARBAMIC ACID RELATED INTERMEDIATES; POLYETHYLENE; SOY FLAKE;

5-CHOROINDANONE, METHYLESTER

COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES.

BUTYL ACETATE; CHLORINE; COKE; HDI BASED POLY ALAPHATIC ISOCYANATES;

ACETYLENE; ADIPIC ACID; AMMONIA; BUTADIENE; CYCLOHEXANE; NATURAL GAS;

PARAXYLENE; TEREPHTHALIC ACID

IN ADDITION, DURING 2002, THE COMPANY CONSUMED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF

ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR ENERGY.

DUPONT HAS CONTRACTED WITH COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION (CSC) AND ACCENTURE LLP

TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY. CSC OPERATES A MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANY'S GLOBAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURES AND PROVIDES

SELECTED APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE SERVICES. ACCENTURE LLP PROVIDES ENTERPRISE

RESOURCE PLANNING SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING,

MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PATENT AND TRADEMARK ESTATE PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND HAS ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL NETWORK OF ATTORNEYS AND

LICENSING PROFESSIONALS TO PROCURE, MAINTAIN AND PROTECT ITS ESTATE.

THE COMPANY OWNS AND IS LICENSED UNDER VARIOUS PATENTS, WHICH EXPIRE FROM TIME

TO TIME, COVERING MANY PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USES. THESE PATENTS

PROTECT MANY ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH PROGRAM AND THE

PROPRIETARY GOODS AND SERVICES IT SELLS. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THESE

PATENTS VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND DEPENDS UPON THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE OF

EACH INDIVIDUAL PATENT AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN EACH

COUNTRY. THE COMPANY OWNS APPROXIMATELY 21,000 WORLDWIDE PATENTS AND

APPROXIMATELY 14,000 WORLDWIDE PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN 2002, THE COMPANY WAS

GRANTED ALMOST 400 U.S. PATENTS AND ABOUT 2,000 INTERNATIONAL PATENTS. THE

COMPANY'S RIGHTS UNDER ITS PATENTS AND LICENSES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS MADE

AND SOLD UNDER THEM, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE AND, TO VARYING

DEGREES, IMPORTANT TO EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

FOR DISCUSSION RELATED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS TO PHARMACEUTICALS, SEE THE

SEGMENT REVIEW ON PAGE 28 OF THIS REPORT.

THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PIONEER AND THE REST OF THE COMPANIES WITHIN THE SEED

INDUSTRY COMPETE IS INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY NEW PATENTS, PATENT POSITIONS,

PATENT LAWSUITS AND THE STATUS OF

5

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS--CONTINUED

VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OWNERSHIP OF AND ACCESS TO INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO BIOTECHNOLOGY, ARE IMPORTANT TO

THE PIONEER BUSINESS AND ITS COMPETITORS. NO SINGLE PATENT OWNED BY PIONEER OR

ITS COMPETITORS IS ESSENTIAL TO PIONEER'S ABILITY TO COMPETE. HOWEVER, PIONEER

WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS FREEDOM TO OPERATE ISSUES BY ENFORCING ITS OWN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CHALLENGING CLAIMS MADE BY OTHERS, AND WHERE

APPROPRIATE, OBTAINING LICENSES TO IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS.

THE COMPANY HAS OVER 2,000 UNIQUE TRADEMARKS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

HAS OVER 22,000 WORLDWIDE REGISTRATIONS AND APPLICATIONS FOR THESE TRADEMARKS.

OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN TRADEMARKS DO NOT EXPIRE IF THE TRADEMARKS ARE CONTINUED IN

USE AND PROPERLY PROTECTED. THE COMPANY HAS A NUMBER OF TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE

SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION AT THE CONSUMER RETAIL LEVEL, INCLUDING DUPONT(TM) AND

THE DUPONT OVAL; LYCRA(R) BRAND PREMIUM STRETCH FIBERS; STAINMASTER(R) CARPETS;

TEFLON(R) FLUOROPOLYMERS, FILMS, FABRIC PROTECTORS, FIBERS, AND DISPERSIONS;

CORIAN(R) SURFACES; CORDURA(R) NYLON; COOLMAX(R) FIBERS; TACTEL(R) NYLON;

TYVEK(R) AND KEVLAR(R) BRANDS PROTECTIVE MATERIAL; AND PIONEER(R) BRAND SEEDS.

THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY PURSUING LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELECTED

TRADEMARKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TEFLON(R) TRADEMARK HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH BRAND

LICENSING TO PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE CAR CARE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE

WIPER BLADES, EYE GLASS LENSES AND HOME CARE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, SELECTED

LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES ARE BEING PURSUED FOR THE DUPONT(TM) BRAND.

SEASONALITY

SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION, AND TO A CERTAIN

EXTENT, COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES AND TEXTILES & INTERIORS, ARE AFFECTED BY

SEASONALITY. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION'S PERFORMANCE IS STRONGEST IN THE FIRST

HALF OF THE YEAR. PIONEER GENERALLY OPERATES AT A LOSS DURING THE THIRD AND

FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, AND DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE SEED

BUSINESS, PIONEER'S INVENTORY IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR

YEAR AND IS SOLD DOWN IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. TRADE RECEIVABLES IN

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ARE AT A LOW POINT AT YEAR-END AND INCREASE THROUGH THE

SELLING SEASON TO PEAK AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER. COATINGS & COLOR

TECHNOLOGIES' SALES REFLECT SEASONAL PATTERNS RELATED TO MOTOR VEHICLE BUILDS

AND AFTER-MARKET REFINISHING. TEXTILES & INTERIORS' FLOORING BUSINESSES ARE

SOMEWHAT AFFECTED BY THE SEASONALITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, WHICH

EXPERIENCES ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF ACTIVITY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.

IN GENERAL, BUSINESSES IN THE REMAINING SEGMENTS ARE NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY

SEASONAL FACTORS.

MARKETING

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PIONEER BUSINESS, MOST PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED PRIMARILY

THROUGH DUPONT'S SALES FORCE, ALTHOUGH IN SOME REGIONS, MORE EMPHASIS IS PLACED

ON SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. IN NORTH AMERICA, THE MAJORITY OF PIONEER(R)

BRAND SEED IS MARKETED THROUGH INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES. IN AREAS

OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL CORN BELT, SEED PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN MARKETED THROUGH

DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO HANDLE OTHER AGRICULTURAL SUPPLIES. PIONEER

PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA THROUGH A NETWORK OF SUBSIDIARIES,

JOINT VENTURES, AND INDEPENDENT PRODUCER-DISTRIBUTORS.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER OR SMALL

GROUP OF CUSTOMERS. TEXTILES & INTERIORS AND COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES,

HOWEVER, HAVE SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

IMPORTANT TO THESE SEGMENTS' OPERATING RESULTS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES COMPETE ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS PRICE, PRODUCT

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OR SPECIFICATIONS, CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY, CUSTOMER

SERVICE AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT LINE, DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

PARTICULAR MARKET INVOLVED AND THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDED.

PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE MAJOR CHEMICAL COMPANIES BASED IN THE UNITED

STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA, PRINCIPALLY JAPAN, CHINA AND KOREA. IN THE AGGREGATE,

COMPETITORS OFFER A COMPARABLE RANGE OF PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL, COMMODITY

AND SPECIALTY CHEMICALS TO PLASTICS AND FIBERS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ALSO

COMPETES IN CERTAIN PRODUCT MARKETS WITH SMALLER, MORE SPECIALIZED FIRMS, AS

WELL AS THOSE WITH PARTIALLY OR FULLY INTEGRATED PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS, AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ALSO

SELLS HYBRID SEEDS THROUGH PIONEER, PRINCIPALLY FOR THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF

CORN AND SOYBEANS, AND THUS DIRECTLY COMPETES WITH OTHER HYBRID SEED SUPPLIERS.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ALSO PROVIDES FOOD SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND SOY-BASED

ITEM 1. BUSINESS--CONTINUED

FOOD INGREDIENTS IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR GRAIN AND FOOD PROCESSORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES AT OVER 40 SITES IN 19 STATES

AT EITHER DEDICATED RESEARCH FACILITIES OR MANUFACTURING PLANTS. THE HIGHEST

CONCENTRATION OF RESEARCH IS CENTRALIZED IN THE WILMINGTON, DELAWARE REGION AT

SEVERAL LARGE RESEARCH CENTERS. AMONG THESE, THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION

LABORATORIES ENGAGE IN INVESTIGATIVE AND APPLIED RESEARCH, THE CHESTNUT RUN

LABORATORIES FOCUS ON APPLICATIONS RESEARCH, AND THE STINE-HASKELL RESEARCH

CENTER CONDUCTS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH AND TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH TO

ASSURE THE SAFE MANUFACTURE AND USE OF PRODUCTS.

WITHIN AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION, PIONEER, WHICH HAS ITS LARGEST CENTER IN

JOHNSTON, IOWA CARRIES OUT RESEARCH TO DEVELOP HYBRIDS OF CORN, CANOLA, SORGHUM

AND SUNFLOWER, AND VARIETIES OF SOYBEAN, ALFALFA, WHEAT, AND CANOLA FOR

WORLDWIDE MARKETS. HYBRIDS AND VARIETIES ARE DEVELOPED AT PRIMARY RESEARCH

LOCATIONS AND TESTED AT MANY OTHER LOCATIONS. ALSO INCLUDED IN AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION IS DUPONT PROTEIN TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH HAS ITS LARGEST RESEARCH CENTER

IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI. HEALTH BENEFITS STUDIES ARE ADVANCED IN COOPERATION WITH

SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE GLOBE, AND PRODUCT AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

IS MANAGED IN TECHNICAL CENTERS LOCATED IN ENGLAND AND RUSSIA.

DUPONT, REFLECTING THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL INTERESTS, OPERATES A NUMBER OF

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH FACILITIES AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN

COUNTRIES SUCH AS BELGIUM, CANADA, FRANCE, GERMANY, JAPAN, LUXEMBOURG, MEXICO,

THE NETHERLANDS, SPAIN, AND SWITZERLAND.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE TO CREATE

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN RELEVANT FIELDS, AS

WELL AS TO IMPROVE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES. EACH SEGMENT OF THE COMPANY

FUNDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS MISSION. THE

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

LITIGATION

BENLATE(R)

IN 1991, DUPONT BEGAN RECEIVING CLAIMS BY GROWERS THAT USE OF BENLATE(R) 50 DF

FUNGICIDE HAD CAUSED CROP DAMAGE. AS INDICATED IN THE TABLE BELOW, DUPONT HAS

SINCE BEEN SERVED WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED LAWSUITS, MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

DISPOSED OF THROUGH TRIAL, DISMISSAL OR SETTLEMENT.

================================================================================

TWENTY OF THE 104 CASES PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WERE

FILED BY GROWERS WHO ALLEGE PLANT DAMAGE FROM USING BENLATE(R) 50 DF AND, IN

SOME CASES, BENLATE(R) WP. FIFTY OF THE PENDING CASES SEEK TO REOPEN SETTLEMENTS

WITH THE COMPANY BY ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY COMMITTED FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT, AS

WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE RACKETEERING LAWS. FIVE OF THE PENDING

CASES INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES ARISING FROM EXPOSURE TO

BENLATE(R) 50 DF AND/OR BENLATE(R) WP. TWENTY-EIGHT OF THE PENDING CASES INCLUDE

CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED DAMAGE TO SHRIMPING OPERATIONS FROM BENLATE(R) OD. FINALLY,

ONE OF THE CASES PENDING IS A SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION.

IN AUGUST 2001, A FLORIDA JURY FOUND DUPONT LIABLE UNDER FLORIDA'S RACKETEERING

STATUTE AND FOR PRODUCT DEFECT INVOLVING ALLEGED CROP DAMAGE. IN MARCH 2002,

PURSUANT TO DUPONT'S MOTION, THE JUDGE WITHDREW THE JURY'S FINDING OF LIABILITY

UNDER THE RACKETEERING STATUTE AND ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

APPROXIMATE AMOUNT OF $29 MILLION. THE JUDGMENT WAS LATER REDUCED TO $26

MILLION; DUPONT HAS APPEALED. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NOT PROBABLE

THAT THE ADVERSE JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE WILL ULTIMATELY BE UPHELD; THEREFORE,

DUPONT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR THIS MATTER. THE REMAINING CROP CASES

ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, PRINCIPALLY IN TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS

IN FLORIDA.

CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO PREVIOUSLY SETTLED WITH THE COMPANY SEEK TO REOPEN THEIR

SETTLEMENTS THROUGH CASES ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER MISCONDUCT RELATING TO THE

LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT OF THEIR BENLATE(R) 50 DF CLAIMS. IN JANUARY 2003, THE

COMPANY SETTLED NINE CASES, INVOLVING TWENTY PLAINTIFFS, THAT HAD BEEN PENDING

IN STATE COURT IN FLORIDA (THE TABLE ABOVE DOES NOT

PART I

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS--CONTINUED

REFLECT THESE SETTLEMENTS). THESE CASES ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL

HAD COMMITTED FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THESE

PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS IN 1996. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BY SETTLING THESE

LAWSUITS, IT HAS RESOLVED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE REOPENER CASES THAT WOULD

HAVE INVOLVED CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN THE REOPENER CASES STILL PENDING

AFTER JANUARY 2003, THE FLORIDA FEDERAL COURT DISMISSED THE LEAD CASE OF THE

TWENTY-EIGHT REOPENER CASES PENDING BEFORE IT. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED. THE

OTHER THIRTEEN REOPENER CASES ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT IN TRIAL AND

APPELLATE COURTS IN FLORIDA AND HAWAII.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY FIVE CASES INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT BENLATE(R) CAUSED

BIRTH DEFECTS TO CHILDREN EXPOSED IN UTERO. ONE CASE WAS TRIED IN FLORIDA, WHICH

RESULTED IN A $4 MILLION VERDICT AGAINST DUPONT. THE VERDICT WAS REVERSED AT THE

INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE LEVEL BECAUSE THE PLAINTIFFS' SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR

CAUSATION WAS INSUFFICIENT. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED TO THE FLORIDA SUPREME

COURT. THE FEDERAL COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA DISMISSED ANOTHER CASE ON THE SAME

GROUNDS OF INSUFFICIENT SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR CAUSATION. IT HAS BEEN APPEALED

TO THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. SIX OF THE EIGHT PLAINTIFFS IN THE

REMAINING THREE CASES WERE DISMISSED AS THEIR CASES WERE NOT TIMELY FILED. TWO

OF THESE CASES HAVE BEEN APPEALED TO THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT. THE REMAINING

CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN DELAWARE IN JUNE 2003.

THE TWENTY-EIGHT CASES INVOLVING DAMAGE TO SHRIMP ARE PENDING AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE COURT IN BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA. THESE CASES WERE BROUGHT BY

ECUADORIAN SHRIMP FARMERS WHO ALLEGE THAT BENLATE(R) OD THAT WAS APPLIED TO

BANANA PLANTATIONS IN ECUADOR RAN-OFF AND WAS DEPOSITED IN THE PLAINTIFFS'

SHRIMP FARMS, CAUSING MASSIVE NUMBERS OF SHRIMP TO DIE. TWO CASES WERE TRIED IN

THE FALL OF 2000 AND IN EARLY 2001, WHICH RESULTED IN ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION IN EACH CASE. DUPONT CONTENDS THAT THE INJURIES

ALLEGED ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A VIRUS, TAURA SYNDROME VIRUS, AND IN NO WAY INVOLVE

BENLATE(R) OD. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED BOTH CASES. DUPONT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED

AN ACCRUAL FOR EITHER CASE BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NOT

PROBABLE THAT THE ADVERSE JUDGMENTS ULTIMATELY WILL BE UPHELD. THE TWENTY-SIX

UNTRIED CASES ARE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL OF THE CASE TRIED

IN THE FALL OF 2000. ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THIS APPEAL TOOK PLACE AT THE

INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT IN OCTOBER 2002.

A SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION WAS FILED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY A SHAREHOLDER IN

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN FLORIDA AGAINST THE COMPANY AND THE THEN-CHAIRMAN.

THIS ACTION IS STILL PENDING. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE ALLEGE THAT DUPONT

MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS ABOUT BENLATE(R) 50 DF, WITH

THE ALLEGED EFFECT OF INFLATING THE PRICE OF DUPONT'S STOCK BETWEEN JUNE 19,

1993, AND JANUARY 27, 1995. THE DISTRICT COURT HAS CERTIFIED THE CASE AS A CLASS

ACTION. DISCOVERY HAS CONCLUDED. TRIAL IS SET FOR JUNE 2003.

DUPONT BELIEVES THAT BENLATE(R) DID NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGES ALLEGED IN THESE CASES

AND DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT. DUPONT CONTINUES TO DEFEND

ITSELF IN ONGOING MATTERS. TO DATE, DUPONT HAS INCURRED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MATTERS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY

$200 MILLION HAS BEEN RECOVERED THROUGH INSURANCE. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

RESERVES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO COVER ESTIMATED FUTURE COSTS. DURING

FOURTH QUARTER 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $80 MILLION TO INCREASE

ITS LITIGATION RESERVES FOR BENLATE(R). WHILE MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES MAY BE INCURRED, A RANGE OF SUCH

LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

HYDROGEN FLUORIDE RELEASE

ON MAY 19, 1997, APPROXIMATELY 11,500 POUNDS OF A HYDROGEN FLUORIDE (HF)/TAR

MIXTURE WAS RELEASED FROM DUPONT'S LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY FLUOROPRODUCTS FACILITY.

THIS RELEASE LASTED ABOUT FORTY MINUTES. THERE WERE NO ON-SITE INJURIES, AND

ONLY ONE PERSON OFF-SITE REPORTED ANY EXPOSURE. NO TOXIC TORT SUITS WERE FILED

AS A RESULT OF THIS RELEASE. DUPONT'S INCIDENT INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT AN

INADEQUATE VALVE STEM DESIGN WAS A KEY FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE RELEASE (THE

VALVE STEM TWISTED AND THE VALVE INDICATED IT WAS IN A CLOSED POSITION, WHEN IT

WAS ACTUALLY OPEN). DUPONT'S PROCESS ISOLATION PROCEDURES WERE ALSO REVIEWED AND

MODIFIED AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) PROPOSED

A SETTLEMENT PRIOR TO FILING ITS ACTION FOR $1,700,000. SUBSEQUENTLY, BY LETTER

DATED JULY 13, 1999, THE DOJ PROVIDED FORMAL NOTICE TO DUPONT, THAT DUE TO THE

MAY 1997 HF RELEASE, THE DOJ INTENDED TO BRING A FEDERAL COURT ACTION AGAINST

DUPONT UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT SECTION 112(R) - GENERAL DUTY CLAUSE. DUPONT

CONTESTED THE PROPOSED $1,700,000 FINE AS EXCESSIVE AND UNREASONABLE BECAUSE

THERE WAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL HARM OR HUMAN HEALTH

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS--CONTINUED

IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAY 1997 INCIDENT. DUPONT PRESENTED A SETTLEMENT

OFFER TO THE DOJ AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) IN DECEMBER 2000.

DUPONT HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH DOJ AND EPA TO SETTLE THIS MATTER FOR

$1,102,000. THIS SETTLEMENT CONSISTS OF $552,000 IN SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL

PROJECTS SUPPORTING LOCAL LOUISVILLE GOVERNMENTAL AND NONGOVERNMENTAL

ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES AND $550,000 AS A CASH PENALTY. THE DOJ HAS PREPARED A

CONSENT DECREE AND COMPLAINT THAT DUPONT IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING. SETTLEMENT IS

EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED SOMETIME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003.

GRAND CAL/INDIANA HARBOR SYSTEM

THE INDIANA DEPARTMENTS OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND

THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A

NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT OF THE GRAND CALUMET RIVER AND THE INDIANA

HARBOR CANAL SYSTEM UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION

AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA) AND THE OIL POLLUTION ACT. THE COMPANY'S PLANT IN

EAST CHICAGO, INDIANA, WHICH DISCHARGES INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER INTO THESE

WATERWAYS, WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF SEVENTEEN POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES

(PRPS) FOR THE COST OF THE ASSESSMENT AND ANY DETERMINED NATURAL RESOURCE

DAMAGES. THE TRUSTEES RECENTLY INDICATED THAT THEIR PREFERRED REMEDY IS TO

DREDGE THE ENTIRE GRAND CAL/ INDIANA HARBOR SYSTEM. DUPONT HAS JOINED WITH EIGHT

OTHER PRPS TO CONTEST THE REMEDY. A SETTLEMENT OFFER HAS BEEN TENDERED TO THE

TRUSTEES AND NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING.

AMMONIUM PERFLUOROOCTANATE (APFO)

THE WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (WVDEP) AND DUPONT

SIGNED A MULTIMEDIA ORDER IN NOVEMBER OF 2001 THAT REQUIRED SAMPLING, ANALYSES

AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCREENING LEVELS FOR THE SURFACTANT AMMONIUM

PERFLUOROOCTANOATE, OR APFO, USED BY DUPONT'S WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN WOOD

COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. THE ORDER REQUIRED THAT DUPONT INVESTIGATE THE LEVELS OF

APFO IN THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND DRINKING WATER AND FUND A STUDY BY

TOXICOLOGISTS, SUPERVISED BY THE WVDEP, TO DETERMINE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF APFO

IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND DRINKING WATER. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, A SCREENING LEVEL

OF 150 MICROGRAMS OF APFO PER LITER OF DRINKING WATER WAS ESTABLISHED IN MAY

2002. NONE OF THE LOCAL SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER HAS TESTED NEAR THE SCREENING

LEVEL.

IN AUGUST 2002, THE WVDEP ISSUED THE FINAL AMMONIUM PERFLUOROOCTANOATE

ASSESSMENT OF TOXICITY TEAM REPORT. IT AFFIRMED THE 150 MICROGRAMS SCREENING

LEVEL FOR DRINKING WATER AND A SOIL SCREENING LEVEL OF 240 PARTS PER MILLION. IT

FURTHER PROVIDED A SCREENING LEVEL OF 1 MICROGRAM PER CUBIC METER FOR AIR, AS

BASED UPON THE INHALATION REFERENCE CONCENTRATION. THE WVDEP IS EXPECTED TO

ISSUE GUIDANCE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AIR SCREENING LEVEL. UNLESS DUPONT

VIOLATES ITS TERMS, THE MULTIMEDIA ORDER DOES NOT CALL FOR SANCTIONS. THE COST

OF THE DUPONT ACTIVITIES PURSUANT TO THE ORDER IS LIKELY TO EXCEED $3 MILLION.

DUPONT HAS COMPLETED MORE THAN 75 PERCENT OF THE WORK REQUIRED BY THE ORDER.

SAMPLING ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER HAS DISCLOSED APFO LEVELS IN GROUNDWATER AND

DRINKING WATER IN OHIO, AND THESE RESULTS WERE SHARED WITH THE OHIO EPA.

ALTHOUGH THE MULTIMEDIA ORDER DOES NOT APPLY IN OHIO, DUPONT IS FUNDING

INVESTIGATIONS OF GROUND AND DRINKING WATER IN THAT STATE COMPARABLE TO THE

STUDIES IN WEST VIRGINIA. IN ADDITION, DUPONT SIGNED A SAFE DRINKING WATER

CONSENT (SDWC) ORDER WITH THE U. S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IN MARCH OF

2002 TO ASSURE PROVISION OF ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER IF SUPPLIES ARE FOUND TO

EXCEED THE SCREENING LEVELS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE MULTIMEDIA ORDER. SINCE THE

SCREENING LEVEL HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT DUPONT WILL BE

REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER TO ANYONE UNDER THE SDWC ORDER

SINCE THE LEVELS OF APFO IN DRINKING WATER TESTED TO DATE ARE WELL BELOW THE

SCREENING LEVEL. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE U.S. EPA ANNOUNCED THAT

IT WOULD CONDUCT A HAZARD ASSESSMENT OF APFO.

A CLASS ACTION HAS BEEN FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT AGAINST DUPONT AND

THE LUBECK PUBLIC SERVICE DISTRICT. THE ACTION ALLEGES THAT THE CLASS HAS, OR

MAY SUFFER, DELETERIOUS HEALTH AFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO APFO IN DRINKING WATER.

THE CLASS HAS BEEN DEFINED AS ANYONE WHO HAS CONSUMED DRINKING WATER AFFECTED BY

APFO FROM OPERATION OF THE WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT, WHICH COULD INCLUDE TENS OF

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. DUPONT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT CONSUMPTION OF DRINKING WATER

WITH LOW LEVELS OF APFO HAS CAUSED, OR WILL CAUSE, DELETERIOUS HEALTH AFFECTS.

TRIAL HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003; DUPONT INTENDS TO DEFEND

ITSELF VIGOROUSLY.

AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH

THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT HAS RECENTLY FILED

A COMPLAINT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE COUNTY OF FRESNO. THE COMPLAINT

ALLEGES THAT DUPONT DIS-

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS--CONTINUED

TRIBUTED NON-COMPLIANT AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH COATINGS FOR SALE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

OF 1999 IN VIOLATION OF DISTRICT RULE 4602. THE DISTRICT IS SEEKING A PERMANENT

INJUNCTION AGAINST FUTURE SALES AND CIVIL PENALTIES OF $75,000 PER DAY. DISTRICT

RULE 4602 PERMITS THE SALE OF "NON-COMPLIANT" COATINGS WITHIN THE DISTRICT AS

LONG AS THE COATINGS ARE CLEARLY LABELED AS NON-COMPLIANT AND ARE USED ONLY IN

DISTRICTS IN WHICH THE COATINGS WOULD BE DEEMED COMPLIANT. DUPONT LABELED ITS

COATINGS IN COMPLIANCE WITH DISTRICT RULE 4602 AND PROVIDED EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL

ABOUT THE DISTRICT RULE TO COATINGS USERS. DUPONT INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND

ITSELF IN THIS ACTION.

NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR 2001 WAS $4,339 MILLION COMPARED WITH $2,314 MILLION IN

2000. NET INCOME FOR 2001 INCLUDES AN $11 MILLION BENEFIT FROM THE ADOPTION OF A

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD GOVERNING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WAS $4,328

MILLION IN 2001 VERSUS $2,314 MILLION IN 2000. 2001 INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES INCLUDES A NET AFTER-TAX BENEFIT OF

$3,077 MILLION FOR SPECIAL ITEMS, AND THE YEAR 2000 INCLUDES A NET AFTER-TAX

CHARGE OF $564 MILLION RELATED TO SPECIAL ITEMS. SUCH SPECIAL ITEMS FOR EACH

YEAR ARE DETAILED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 15.

IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SPECIAL

ITEMS IN BOTH YEARS, THE YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGE IN INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

OPERATING INCOME PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUMES AND SELLING PRICES

RESULTING FROM A SEVERE GLOBAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AS WELL AS FROM SECULAR

WEAKNESSES FOR NYLON AND POLYESTER IN THE APPAREL AND TEXTILE INDUSTRIES.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ON A DILUTED BASIS WERE $4.16 IN 2001 VERSUS $2.19 IN 2000.

INCOME TAXES

THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS UTILIZED TO DETERMINE THE

APPROPRIATE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

FURTHERMORE, WITH TAX RETURNS BEING FILED AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE FINANCIAL

YEAR-END, INEVITABLY ACTUAL RESULTS WILL DIFFER TO SOME EXTENT FROM THE

ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED. IN ADDITION,

ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO AUDIT RESOLUTIONS IN MULTIPLE TAXING

JURISDICTIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED.

2002, 2001, AND 2000 INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES (EITR)

WERE AS FOLLOWS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)                  2002            2001            2000

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INCOME TAX EXPENSE                      $185          $2,467          $1,072

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE                8.7%           36.0%           31.1%

================================================================================

THE 2002 EITR OF 8.7 PERCENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE 2001 EITR OF 36

PERCENT. THERE ARE FOUR KEY FACTORS DRIVING THE REDUCTION IN THE RATE: 1) A

GREATER PORTION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS BEING GENERATED IN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER

TAX RATES, 2) AN INCREASED UTILIZATION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, 3) TAX BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH LOSSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, AND 4) THE TAX IMPACT OF

THE SPECIAL ITEMS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 15. ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF THE DECREASE IN THE

EITR RELATES TO THE FIRST TWO ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, ANOTHER 30 PERCENT RELATES

TO THE TAX BENEFIT ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND THE BALANCE RELATES TO THE

TAX IMPACT OF SPECIAL ITEMS. THE PRIMARY SPECIAL ITEMS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE

LOWER EITR ARE THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS, EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS AND

WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS AND AGREEMENT ON CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AUDIT ISSUES.

THE 2001 EITR OF 36 PERCENT IS HIGHER THAN THE 2000 EITR OF 31.1 PERCENT. THIS

INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX IMPACT OF THE SALE OF DUPONT

PHARMACEUTICALS.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY HAS BROAD AND DEEP SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES AND ITS

OBJECTIVE IS TO CONNECT THESE CAPABILITIES TO EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS. THE

COMPANY'S GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE ONE-THIRD OF TOTAL COMPANY REVENUES FROM NEW

PRODUCTS INTRODUCED WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BY 2005.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $1,264 MILLION, $1,588 MILLION AND $1,776

MILLION IN 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

COMPANY'S DIVESTITURE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS, ITS RESEARCH INTENSIVE

PHARMACEUTICALS SUBSIDIARY, ON OCTOBER 1, 2001. EXCLUDING PHARMACEUTICALS,

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2002 INCREASED 8 PERCENT OVER 2001.

2002 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENT OF

SALES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A STRONG COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT AS A SOURCE OF SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND EXPECTS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FUNDING TO REMAIN AT ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL IN 2003. BECAUSE OF ITS

BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF ANY SINGLE

RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS INSTITUTED IN 2002 AND 2001 FURTHER ALIGNED RESOURCES

CONSISTENT WITH THE SPECIFIC MISSIONS OF THE SEGMENTS, THEREBY IMPROVING

COMPETITIVENESS, ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARD SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND ADDRESSING

WEAKENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. ADDITIONAL

DETAILS ARE CONTAINED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

2002-COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES

A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WAS INSTITUTED WITHIN COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. UNDER THE PROGRAM, COSTS TO TERMINATE APPROXIMATELY

775 EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN TECHNICAL, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

ACTIVITIES REDUCED 2002 NET INCOME $69 MILLION BEFORE TAXES. ABOUT 175 EMPLOYEES

HAVE BEEN TERMINATED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND THE REMAINING EMPLOYEES WILL

CEASE WORKING BY DECEMBER 31, 2003. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL SHUT DOWN

OPERATING FACILITIES DURING 2003 DUE TO TRANSFERRING PRODUCTION TO MORE COST

EFFECTIVE FACILITIES.

IN THE AGGREGATE, PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AND

TO THIRD PARTIES, PRINCIPALLY FOR DISMANTLEMENT AND REMOVAL ACTIVITIES, ARE

EXPECTED TO TOTAL ABOUT $80 MILLION. ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THESE CASH OUTLAYS ARE

EXPECTED TO BE MADE IN 2003 AND MOST OF THE REMAINING PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE IN

2004. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS ANNUAL PRETAX COST

SAVINGS OF ABOUT $55 MILLION PER YEAR WHEN COMPLETED WITH ABOUT 60 PERCENT BEING

REALIZED IN 2003 AND ESSENTIALLY ALL THE REMAINING SAVINGS EXPECTED TO BE

REALIZED IN 2004. THE SAVINGS IN 2003 WILL BE ESSENTIALLY OFFSET BY ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION AND DISMANTLEMENT CHARGES ON THE FACILITIES THAT WILL BE SHUT DOWN.

ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THESE SAVINGS WILL RESULT IN REDUCED COST OF GOODS SOLD AND

OTHER OPERATING CHARGES, WITH THE REMAINING 30 PERCENT EXPECTED TO BE DIVIDED

ABOUT EVENLY BETWEEN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

2002-TEXTILES & INTERIORS

A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WAS INSTITUTED WITHIN TEXTILES & INTERIORS IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2002. UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COST TO TERMINATE APPROXIMATELY 2,000

EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN TECHNICAL, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

ACTIVITIES AND TO SHUT DOWN OPERATING FACILITIES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO

TRANSFERRING PRODUCTION TO MORE COST EFFECTIVE FACILITIES, REDUCED 2002 NET

INCOME $208 MILLION BEFORE TAXES. ABOUT 1,425 EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TERMINATED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND THE ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS WILL BE COMPLETED

BEFORE JULY 2003.

IN THE AGGREGATE, PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AND

TO THIRD PARTIES FOR DISMANTLEMENT AND REMOVAL ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL

ABOUT $165 MILLION. ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF THE CASH OUTLAYS WERE MADE IN 2002, AND

50 AND 10 PERCENT ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN 2003 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, WITH

THE REMAINDER EXPECTED TO BE PAID STARTING IN 2005. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ANNUAL

PRETAX COST SAVINGS OF ABOUT $120 MILLION PER YEAR FROM THIS RESTRUCTURING

PROGRAM WHEN COMPLETED. ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF THESE SAVINGS WERE REALIZED IN 2002

AND ESSENTIALLY ALL THE REMAINING SAVINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED IN 2003.

ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THESE SAVINGS WILL RESULT IN REDUCED COST OF GOODS SOLD AND

OTHER OPERATING CHARGES, WITH THE REMAINING 20 PERCENT EXPECTED TO BE DIVIDED

EVENLY BETWEEN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

2001-RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS INSTITUTED IN 2001 IMPACTED ESSENTIALLY ALL SEGMENTS.

UNDER THE PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY TERMINATED APPROXIMATELY 5,500 EMPLOYEES

INVOLVED IN TECHNICAL, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES,

REDUCED THE CONTRACTOR WORKFORCE BY ABOUT 1,300 AND SHUT DOWN OPERATING

FACILITIES PRINCIPALLY DUE TO TRANSFERRING PRODUCTION TO MORE COST COMPETITIVE

FACILITIES.

IN THE AGGREGATE, PAYMENTS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO TERMINATED EMPLOYEES AND

TO THIRD PARTIES FOR DISMANTLEMENT AND REMOVAL ACTIVITIES, AND FOR CONTRACT

CANCELLATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL ABOUT $380 MILLION. ABOUT $150 MILLION OF

THESE CASH OUTLAYS WERE MADE IN 2001, ABOUT $182 MILLION WERE MADE IN 2002, AND

MOST OF THE REMAINING PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE IN 2003. THE 2002 BENEFIT TO

EARNINGS WAS APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION BEFORE TAXES WITH ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF

THESE SAVINGS RESULTING IN REDUCED COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING

CHARGES, ABOUT 30 PERCENT RESULTING IN REDUCED SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE BALANCE RESULTING IN REDUCED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. FACILITY SHUTDOWN AND CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS RESULTING IN

LOWER DEPRECIATION AND LEASE EXPENSE CONTRIBUTED ABOUT $35 MILLION OF THE TOTAL

COST SAVINGS.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 143, "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS." SFAS NO. 143 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2002. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 143

ON JANUARY 1, 2003. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 143 REQUIRE COMPANIES TO RECORD

AN ASSET AND RELATED LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A

LONG-LIVED TANGIBLE ASSET IF A LEGAL LIABILITY TO RETIRE THE ASSET EXISTS. BASED

ON THE COMPANY'S EVALUATION TO DATE, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 IS EXPECTED TO

RESULT IN A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $.03 PER SHARE THAT WILL BE REPORTED AS THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE.

IN 2002, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 45, "GUARANTOR'S ACCOUNTING

AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF

INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS." THE INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF

FIN NO. 45 APPLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2002. AS REQUIRED, THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERPRETATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 (SEE NOTE 23). THE

COMPANY WILL APPLY THE INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. THE INTERPRETATION MODIFIES

EXISTING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST GUARANTEES AND REQUIRES THAT AT THE

TIME A COMPANY ISSUES A GUARANTEE, THE COMPANY MUST RECOGNIZE AN INITIAL

LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION IT ASSUMES UNDER THAT GUARANTEE.

THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

PROVISIONS OF THE INTERPRETATION AND ABSENT ANY UNFORESEEN EVENTS, MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THESE PROVISIONS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 148, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION-TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE, AN AMENDMENT OF SFAS NO. 123." THE

COMPANY PLANS TO BEGIN EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2003, USING THE PROSPECTIVE METHOD AS SET FORTH IN THE GUIDELINES OF

THIS STATEMENT AS AMENDED. UNDER HISTORICAL GRANT LEVELS AND CURRENT VALUATION

ASSUMPTIONS, THE RESULTING INCREASE IN NONCASH EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE

COMPANY'S EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $.02 IN 2003. THIS IMPACT IS

EXPECTED TO GROW TO ABOUT $.06 PER SHARE BY 2005 AND THEN STABILIZE, AS MOST

STOCK OPTIONS VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN NO. 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES" (VIES), WHICH IS AN INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH

BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 51, "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS." FIN NO. 46 ADDRESSES

THE APPLICATION OF ARB NO. 51 TO VIES, AND GENERALLY WOULD REQUIRE THAT ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, AND RESULTS OF THE ACTIVITY OF A VIE BE CONSOLIDATED INTO THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE THAT IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THREE VIES WITHIN THE

FINANCING STRUCTURES OF ITS SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS. (SEE OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS BEGINNING ON PAGE 35). THESE ENTITIES SERVE AS THE OWNER/LESSORS

AND DEBT HOLDERS OF THE ASSETS IN THE PROGRAMS. THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF

THESE ENTITIES ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS UNDER THESE

PROGRAMS WERE APPROXIMATELY $330 MILLION AND THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSOCIATED

LIABILITIES AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $331 MILLION.

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

UNDER THESE PROGRAMS WERE $277 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE COMPANY IS IN

THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE PROVISIONS OF FIN NO. 46. IN RESPONSE TO THIS

INTERPRETATION, THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL OPTIONS, INCLUDING: (1)

CONSOLIDATING THE VIES INTO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, (2)

PURCHASING SELECTED ASSETS FROM THE VIES, OR (3) FINDING ALTERNATIVE FINANCING

SOURCES. NONE OF THESE OPTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO

PROVIDE THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE

INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES.

JUDGMENTS AND ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES ARE REQUIRED IN APPLYING THE

COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN MANY AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, KEY ASSUMPTIONS ARE

PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S PROJECTED LIABILITIES FOR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES, TOGETHER

WITH THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS IS DISCUSSED UNDER LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS BEGINNING ON PAGE 38.

OTHER AREAS IN WHICH SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES EXIST INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, PROJECTED COSTS TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND

TAX MATTERS AND THE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION. A DISCUSSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS, INCLUDING INFORMATION AS TO THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING

REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS IS INCLUDED UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS BEGINNING ON PAGE 39. INFORMATION ON SOME OF THE KEY

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL PROVISION FOR INCOME

TAXES IS BASED MAY BE FOUND UNDER INCOME TAXES ON PAGE 16. THERE IS ALSO

SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING LEGAL LIABILITIES. FACTORS

WHICH ARE CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE NATURE OF THE SPECIFIC CLAIM, THE COMPANY'S

EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS

FILED AND THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE MATTER.

ACTUAL RESULTS WILL INEVITABLY DIFFER TO SOME EXTENT FROM THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED AT ANY GIVEN POINT

IN TIME. DESPITE THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND AUDITED CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AND FAIR PERSPECTIVE ON THE COMPANY.

CORPORATE OUTLOOK

THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2003 EARNINGS PER SHARE TO REFLECT INCREASED SALES VOLUMES,

BARRING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIGNIFICANT WORLD EVENTS OR ECONOMIC DISRUPTION. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BENEFIT FROM CONTINUED EFFORTS TO CONTROL

COSTS.

SALES VOLUMES IN 2003 WILL REFLECT, IN PART, THE WORLDWIDE GDP GROWTH, WHICH THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ABOUT 2 PERCENT FOR 2003. SALES FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS

MOST CLOSELY TRACK THE WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING SECTOR, WHICH HAS BEEN LAGGING

THE OVERALL RECOVERY OF THE ECONOMY FROM THE LAST RECESSION. IN THE UNITED

STATES, HOUSING AND MOTOR VEHICLE PRODUCTION ARE BOTH IMPORTANT MARKETS TO THE

COMPANY; IN 2003, HOUSING SALES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT THEIR RECORD LEVELS

OF 2002 AND MOTOR VEHICLE PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY BELOW ITS RECORD

LEVELS OF 2002. THE U.S. PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS

ALSO IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY, IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE FAVORABLE IN

2003. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE U.S. MANUFACTURING SECTOR'S VERY LOW CAPACITY

UTILIZATION, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES IN THE FACE OF HIGHER ENERGY

AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS MAY BE LIMITED.

IN ADDITION TO THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR 2003.

1)   THE COMBINED IMPACT OF PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES IS

EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT 2003 EARNINGS PER SHARE BY $0.34 TO

$0.39, VERSUS PRIOR YEAR.

2)   THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN 2003 TO BE MORE

IN LINE WITH HISTORICAL RATES, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE 2002 RATE

OF 8.7 PERCENT.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-CONTINUED

3)   TWO NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT 2003

EARNINGS PER SHARE BY ABOUT $0.05 - SFAS NO. 143 FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS AND SFAS NO. 123, AS AMENDED, FOR STOCK OPTIONS.

PROSPECTS FOR LONGER TERM GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE FOLLOWING

FACTORS: 1) GROWTH IN GLOBAL ECONOMIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN NORTH AMERICA,

EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS; 2) IMPROVING MARKET CONDITIONS INCLUDING DEMAND

FROM THE U.S. MANUFACTURING SECTOR AND PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE; 3) SUCCESSFUL

COMMERCIALIZATION OF NEW PRODUCTS ARISING FROM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; 4)

STRONGER WORLDWIDE DEMAND AND STRONG PRICING FOR COMMODITY CHEMICALS AND POLYMER

PRODUCTS; 5) RECOVERY OF THE DEPRESSED ELECTRONICS AND HIGH-TECHNOLOGY MARKETS;

AND 6) THE SUCCESSFUL SEPARATION OF THE TEXTILES & INTERIORS SEGMENT.

SEGMENT REVIEWS

SEGMENT SALES DISCUSSED BELOW INCLUDE TRANSFERS AND PRO RATA EQUITY AFFILIATE

SALES. SEGMENT AFTER-TAX OPERATING INCOME (ATOI) DOES NOT INCLUDE CORPORATE

EXPENSES, INTEREST, EXCHANGE GAINS (LOSSES) AND CORPORATE MINORITY INTERESTS.

IN 2002 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE REALIGNMENT OF ITS BUSINESSES INTO FIVE

MARKET- AND TECHNOLOGY-FOCUSED GROWTH PLATFORMS AND THE CREATION OF A DUPONT

TEXTILES & INTERIORS SUBSIDIARY. THE DISCLOSURES CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT

REFLECT THIS NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. PRIOR YEARS' DATA HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT THE 2002 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION'S MISSION IS TO LEVERAGE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD VALUE

CHAIN KNOWLEDGE TO INCREASE THE QUALITY, QUANTITY AND SAFETY OF THE GLOBAL FOOD

SUPPLY. THE SEGMENT COMPRISES A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND STRONG

GLOBAL BRANDS SUCH AS PIONEER(R) BRAND SEED PRODUCTS AND DUPONT(TM) SOLAE(TM)

SOY PROTEIN. IT ALSO HAS WELL-ESTABLISHED BRANDS OF INSECTICIDES, FUNGICIDES AND

HIGH-VALUE, LOW-USE-RATE HERBICIDES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOCUS ON

INCREASING GROWER PRODUCTIVITY, IMPROVING SAFE HANDLING AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

OF PEST CONTROL PRODUCTS, AND USING TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF GRAINS

USED IN FEED AND FOOD.

DURING 2002, THE COMMERCIAL SEED INDUSTRY FOR MAJOR CROPS REMAINED FAIRLY STABLE

IN TERMS OF AREA PLANTED. VALUE GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE ACHIEVED BY IMPROVING

CROP YIELDS AND BY INCORPORATING GENETIC TRAITS THAT CONFER INSECT PROTECTION

AND HERBICIDE TOLERANCE. IN 2002, THE CROP PROTECTION INDUSTRY CONTINUED A

GRADUAL DECLINE FROM ITS PEAK IN 1996. THIS DECLINE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY LOW

COMMODITY PRICES, GENERIC COMPETITION AND A TECHNOLOGY SHIFT TO GENETIC INSECT

CONTROL AND HERBICIDE TOLERANCE TRAITS. THE MARKETS FOR SOY PROTEIN AND

MICROBIAL TESTING CONTINUED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY AS CONSUMERS INCREASE THEIR

DEMAND FOR SAFE AND HEALTHY FOOD.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION PARTICIPATES IN THE PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE MARKET

THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARY, PIONEER, THE WORLD'S LARGEST COMMERCIAL SEED PRODUCER,

AND ITS CROP PROTECTION PRODUCT OFFERINGS. THE SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDES SOY-BASED

FOOD INGREDIENTS, DIAGNOSTIC TESTING EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, AND LIQUID FOOD

PACKAGING SYSTEMS THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, DUPONT PROTEIN TECHNOLOGIES (DPT),

QUALICON, AND LIQUI-BOX, RESPECTIVELY.

PIONEER'S PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS ARE HYBRID SEED CORN, SOYBEAN SEED, AND OTHER CROP

SEED LINES SOLD TO CUSTOMERS IN KEY MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. PIONEER IS

ALSO FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING PRODUCTS USED TO PRODUCE GRAIN FOR HUMAN FOOD AND

INDUSTRIAL USES, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING GRAIN IDENTITY PRESERVATION SYSTEMS WITH

ENTITIES THROUGHOUT THE CROP VALUE CHAIN. PIONEER SALES INCREASED OVER 5 PERCENT

DURING 2002. IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET, PIONEER(R) BRAND SOYBEAN VARIETIES

GAINED MARKET SHARE, WHILE CORN SEED MARKET SHARE DECLINED SLIGHTLY.

INTERNATIONALLY, STRONG PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER SALES OF CORN WITH INSECT

PROTECTION TRAITS LED TO CORN MARKET SHARE GAINS IN LATIN AMERICA. CORN MARKET

SHARE GREW SLIGHTLY IN EUROPE. DURING 2002, PIONEER(R) BRAND CORN HYBRIDS

OUTPERFORMED COMPETITIVE HYBRIDS IN NORTH AMERICA BY AN AVERAGE YIELD OF 6.8

BUSHELS PER ACRE BASED ON 184,000 SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISONS. FARMERS GROWING

PIONEER(R) BRAND CORN HYBRIDS WON 23 OF 27 CATEGORIES IN THE 2002 NATIONAL CORN

GROWERS ASSOCIATION CORN YIELD CONTEST, INCLUDING A SIX-TIME WINNER WHO PRODUCED

A RECORD BREAKING 442 BUSHELS PER ACRE.

AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION SERVES THE GLOBAL PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WITH

CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS FOR THE GRAIN AND SPECIALTY CROP SECTORS AS WELL AS

FORESTRY AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. THE CROP PROTECTION PRODUCT OFFERINGS

INCLUDE HERBICIDE, FUNGICIDE, AND INSECTICIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DURING

2002, SALES OF CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS DECLINED 1 PERCENT IN AN INDUSTRY THAT

DECLINED OVER 2 PERCENT. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION CONTINUES TO INCREASE ITS FOCUS

ON CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS SERVING

ACCURATE AND RAPID DETECTION OF HARMFUL MICROORGANISMS, AND THE RIBOPRINTER(R)

MICROBIAL CHARACTERIZATION SYSTEM, THE WORLD'S ONLY AUTOMATED INSTRUMENT FOR

FINGERPRINTING THE DNA OF BACTERIA. DURING 2002, DPT AND QUALICON SALES

EXPERIENCED DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH.

ON MAY 31, 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF LIQUI-BOX CORPORATION

FOR $272 MILLION. THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS GENERATES ANNUAL SALES OF APPROXIMATELY

$150 MILLION WITH OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA. THIS BUSINESS

WAS COMBINED WITH DUPONT CANADA'S ENHANCED PACKAGING SYSTEMS BUSINESS AND

OPERATES AS LIQUI-BOX. THE NEW ENTITY OFFERS COMPLETE TURNKEY SYSTEMS FOR THE

ASEPTIC AND REFRIGERATED LIQUID PACKAGING OF BEVERAGES, DAIRY PRODUCTS AND

PUMPABLE FOODS IN RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL APPLICATIONS GLOBALLY.

FULL YEAR OF SALES.

O PIONEER RECEIVED KEY JAPANESE REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR THE HERCULEX(R)(1) I

INSECT PROTECTION TRAIT, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN A RESEARCH COLLABORATION

BETWEEN PIONEER AND DOW AGROSCIENCES. COMBINED WITH PREVIOUS U.S.

APPROVALS, PIONEER PLANS TO OFFER NEW CORN HYBRIDS IN NORTH AMERICA WITH

THE HERCULEX(R) I TRAIT AT INTRODUCTORY LEVELS IN 2003. THE TRAIT WILL GIVE

CORN GROWERS PROTECTION AGAINST MORE PESTS THAN OTHER IN-PLANT INSECT

PROTECTION PRODUCTS.

O THE SEGMENT'S NEWEST INSECTICIDES, DUPONT(TM) STEWARD(R) AND DUPONT(TM)

AVAUNT(TM), GREW AT DOUBLE-DIGIT RATES, PRINCIPALLY IN ASIA-PACIFIC AND

NORTH AMERICA. DUPONT(TM) STEADFAST(TM) HERBICIDE ALSO EXPERIENCED

SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE GROWTH, AIDED BY A UNIQUE BULK DELIVERY SYSTEM.

O STEPS WERE TAKEN TO INCREASE THE SEGMENT'S PRESENCE IN CHINA BY (1) SIGNING

AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN DPT AND LUOHE SHINEWAY INDUSTRY GROUP COMPANY, LTD. TO

ESTABLISH A JOINT VENTURE TO PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY SOY PROTEIN TO MEET THE

GROWING DEMAND FOR HEALTHY FOOD IN CHINA, AND (2) FORMING A JOINT VENTURE

BETWEEN PIONEER AND DENGHAI SEED GROUP, ONE OF CHINA'S LARGEST SEED

COMPANIES, TO DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE HIGH-YIELDING CORN HYBRIDS FOR THE

SUMMER CORN MARKET, WHICH REPRESENTS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL CORN

MARKET IN CHINA.

O A CORN HERBICIDE MARKETING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT WAS EXECUTED WITH SYNGENTA

TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH EXPANDED CHOICES AND GREATER VALUE. SYNGENTA WILL

PROMOTE DUPONT(TM) ACCENT(R) AND DUPONT(TM) STEADFAST(TM) HERBICIDES, WHILE

DUPONT WILL PROMOTE SYNGENTA'S CALISTO(TM)(2) HERBICIDE.

O THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE'S FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE

ANNOUNCED ADOPTION OF THE BAX(R) INSTRUMENT TO SCREEN MEAT AND POULTRY

SAMPLES FOR LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES. THE SYSTEM IS EMERGING AS A CRITICAL

TOOL TO ADDRESS GLOBAL HEALTH PROBLEMS RELATED TO FOOD BORNE DISEASE,

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE AND PHARMACEUTICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDED.

O A BROAD-REACHING BUSINESS AGREEMENT WAS FINALIZED BETWEEN DUPONT, PIONEER

PANIES HAVE RESOLVED ALL ISSUES RELATED TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CONTESTED

GERMPLASM. PIONEER PLANS TO OFFER NEW CORN HYBRIDS IN NORTH AMERICA WITH

THE ROUNDUP READY(R) GENE AT INTRODUCTORY LEVELS IN 2003.

O AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $2,866 MILLION WAS RECORDED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT

OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE TO WRITE OFF GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF PIONEER. THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT RESULTED IN

THE IMPAIRMENT WERE THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE

SECTOR, SLOWER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO BIOTECHNOLOGY

TRAITS, AND A SLOWER THAN EXPECTED RATE OF ACCEPTANCE BY THE PUBLIC,

ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, OF NEW AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.

THE EFFECT OF THESE FACTORS IS REFLECTED IN REPORTED RESULTS AND

DETERIORATION FROM THESE LEVELS IS NOT EXPECTED.

IN JANUARY 2003, DUPONT AND BUNGE LIMITED ANNOUNCED THAT THEY INTEND TO FORM AN

ALLIANCE TO SIGNIFICANTLY GROW THEIR AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION BUSINESSES. THE

PHARMACEUTICALS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON OCTOBER 1, 2001, DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS WAS SOLD TO THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB

COMPANY. DUPONT RETAINED ITS INTEREST IN COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R). THESE

ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS WERE DISCOVERED BY DUPONT AND DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION

WITH MERCK & CO. DUPONT HAS EXCLUSIVELY LICENSED WORLDWIDE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR

COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) TO MERCK. THE U.S. PATENTS COVERING THE COMPOUNDS,

PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION AND USE FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION, INCLUDING

APPROVAL FOR PEDIATRIC USE, WILL EXPIRE IN 2010. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALE OF

DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS, BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CONTINUES TO MANUFACTURE THE

PRODUCTS FOR DUPONT AT THE FORMER DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS MANUFACTURING SITE AT

GARDEN CITY, NEW YORK.

IN SEPTEMBER 2002, THE U.S FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVED COZAAR(R) TO

REDUCE THE RATE OF PROGRESSION OF NEPHROPATHY (KIDNEY DISEASE) IN TYPE 2

DIABETIC PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND NEPHROPATHY. APPROVALS HAVE BEEN GRANTED

IN MORE THAN 20 COUNTRIES, WITH ADDITIONAL APPROVALS PENDING IN CANADA AND

CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE.

IN MARCH 2002, AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY, THE

LOSARTAN INTERVENTION FOR ENDPOINT REDUCTION IN HYPERTENSION STUDY (LIFE)

RESULTS WERE REPORTED AND PUBLISHED. THE STUDY FOUND THAT USE OF COZAAR(R)

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE COMBINED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH, HEART ATTACK

AND STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY

COMPARED TO THE BETA-BLOCKER ATENOLOL. MERCK HAS SUBMITTED RESULTS OF THE LIFE

STUDY TO THE FDA FOR INCLUSION IN THE PRESCRIBING INFORMATION FOR COZAAR(R).

2002 VERSUS 2001 WORLDWIDE MARKETING AND SALES OF COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) ARE

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MERCK. THE PHARMACEUTICALS SEGMENT RECEIVES ROYALTIES AND

NET PROCEEDS AS OUTLINED BY THE LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE 2002 ATOI WAS $329

MILLION, INCLUDING $39 MILLION OF BENEFITS RESULTING FROM ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO

THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS. THE 2001 ATOI WAS $3,924 MILLION, INCLUDING

A $3,866 MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS ON

OCTOBER 1, 2001.

2001 VERSUS 2000 SALES OF $0.9 BILLION WERE 39 PERCENT LOWER PRINCIPALLY DUE TO

THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS. ATOI WAS $3,924 MILLION, INCLUDING A $3,866

MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE, COMPARED WITH $89 MILLION. THE LATTER

INCLUDED A $44 MILLION CHARGE TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION RESERVE.

OUTLOOK MERCK HAS IDENTIFIED COZAAR(R)/HYZAAR(R) AS ONE OF THEIR FIVE KEY GROWTH

DRIVERS. THEY ARE THE FIRST OF A NEW CLASS OF WELL-TOLERATED BLOOD PRESSURE

LOWERING MEDICATIONS CALLED ANGIOTENSION II ANTAGONISTS AND REMAIN THE WORLD'S

MOST WIDELY PRESCRIBED DRUGS IN THEIR CLASS.

DUPONT AND MERCK CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) WITH

ADDITIONAL CLINICAL STUDIES DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS

FOR PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND CO-MORBID CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE

ONGOING COZAAR(R) AND HYZAAR(R) COLLABORATION TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS

FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

SAFETY & PROTECTION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAFETY & PROTECTION'S MISSION IS TO EXTEND THE COMPANY'S KNOWLEDGE, TECHNOLOGY

AND EXPERIENCE TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT PEOPLE, PROPERTY, OPERATIONS AND

THE ENVIRONMENT WORLDWIDE BY BUILDING ON THE 200-YEAR RECORD OF DUPONT AS ONE OF

THE SAFEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. SAFETY & PROTECTION SERVICES A BROAD AND

DIVERSE SET OF END USER MARKETS. KEY GROWTH INITIATIVES FOCUSED THE BUSINESSES

ON SEVERAL STRATEGIC TARGET MARKETS, INCLUDING DURABLE STRUCTURES, PERSONAL

PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS, CLEAN AND DISINFECT SOLUTIONS, GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS,

ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS, SURFACE PROTECTION, CONSUMER SAFETY AND SAFETY

SERVICES. HIGHLY RECOGNIZED CONSUMER BRANDS INCLUDE DUPONT(TM) TYVEK(R),

DUPONT(TM) CORIAN(R), DUPONT(TM) KEVLAR(R) AND DUPONT(TM) ZODIAQ(R). OTHER

INDUSTRIAL BRANDS INCLUDE DUPONT(TM) TYCHEM(R), DUPONT(TM) TYPAR(R), DUPONT(TM)

SONTARA(R), DUPONT(TM) NOMEX(R), DUPONT(TM) SAFERETURNS(TM), DUPONT(TM)

FORAFAC(R), DUPONT(TM) FORAPERLE(R), DUPONT(TM) KRYTOX(R), DUPONT(TM) OXONE(R),

DUPONT(TM) GLYCLEAN(R), DUPONT(TM) TYZOR(R), DUPONT(TM) ANTHIUM(R), AND

DUPONT(TM) VAZO(R).

SAFETY & PROTECTION'S PRINCIPAL OFFERINGS INCLUDE ARAMID PRODUCTS; NONWOVEN

SHEET STRUCTURES; A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIALTY AND INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS; SOLID

SURFACE MATERIALS; AND SAFETY CONSULTING SERVICES.

2002 DEVELOPMENTS

KEY GROWTH INITIATIVES AND OTHER IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES IN SAFETY & PROTECTION

INCLUDED.

O THE DURABLE STRUCTURES ENTERPRISE WAS CREATED TO LEVERAGE BRANDS (TYVEK(R),

KEVLAR(R), AND SENTRYGLAS(R)), PRODUCTS, DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICES IN

BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT MARKETS. KEY NEW DURABLE STRUCTURE

PRODUCTS INTRODUCED DURING THE YEAR INCLUDED TYVEK(R) RADIANT BARRIER(TM)

WEATHERIZATION SYSTEMS AND DUPONT(TM) STRAIGHTFLASH(TM), WHICH WAS

INTRODUCED AS A COMPANION PRODUCT TO DUPONT(TM) FLEXWRAP(TM).

O THE PERSONAL PROTECTION ENTERPRISE WAS ALSO CREATED TO LEVERAGE THE

SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL PROTECTION BRANDS (TYCHEM(R), TYVEK(R), KEVLAR(R),

NOMEX(R)), PRODUCTS AND SERVICES GLOBALLY IN THE GROWING INDUSTRIAL AND

EMERGENCY RESPONSE MARKETS. THE PRINCIPAL OFFERINGS COVER THREATS FROM

CHEMICAL, THERMAL, BALLISTIC, DRY PARTICULATE AND CUT HAZARDS. THE SEGMENT

ALSO OFFERS SAFETY MANAGEMENT SERVICES. NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED INCLUDE

KEVLAR(R) GLOVE OFFERINGS TARGETED AT THE HIGH DEXTERITY AND HIGH CUT

RESISTANCE MARKETS, TYCHEM(R) F PROTECTIVE GARMENTS WITH LAMINATED CHEMICAL

BARRIER FILM, AND NOMEX(R) NONWOVEN SUBSTRATE MOISTURE BARRIER FOR

PROTECTIVE APPAREL.

O IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS MARKET, THE COMPANY WAS AWARDED A CONTRACT

WITH BECHTEL NATIONAL INC. TO HANDLE THE TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF A

GOVERNMENT CHEMICAL STOCKPILE. THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT

WITH MOTIVA ENTERPRISES, LLC TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE A SULFUR RECOVERY

UNIT AT MOTIVA'S DELAWARE CITY, DELAWARE FACILITY.

O GROWTH PROSPECTS IN THE SURFACE PROTECTION MARKETS WERE STRENGTHENED

THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF ATOFINA'S SURFACE PROTECTION BUSINESS WHICH

PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN MARKET.

O THE CHEMFIRST ACQUISITION EXPANDED THE SEGMENT'S PRESENCE IN THE

POLYURETHANES INDUSTRY THROUGH THE ADDITION OF THE CHEMFIRST ANILINE

BUSINESS. THE ACQUISITION ALSO PROVIDED CHEMICAL INTERMEDIATES OFFERINGS

INTO THE HERBICIDES, PIGMENTS, AND PHOTOGRAPHIC CHEMICALS MARKETS. THESE

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION

IN ANNUAL SALES.

O SAFETY & PROTECTION CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS PORTFOLIO OF OFFERINGS BY

INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS SUCH AS SONTARA(R) SPUNLACE PRODUCTS PRESATURATED

WITH KRYTOX(R) LUBRICANTS FOR CAR POLISH WIPES, H-1 CERTIFIED KRYTOX(R) FG

OILS AND GREASES FOR FOOD PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, AND DUPONT(TM) ZONYL(R)

9464 FLUOROPROTECTANTS TO REPEL GREASE STAINS ON FOOD CONTACT PAPER.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $3.5 BILLION WERE 3 PERCENT LOWER REFLECTING 3 PERCENT

LOWER VOLUME. ATOI WAS $490 MILLION COMPARED WITH $451 MILLION. 2001 INCLUDED

$34 MILLION IN CHARGES FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS AND FACILITY SHUTDOWNS. 2002

EARNINGS REFLECT IMPROVED RESULTS IN NONWOVEN PRODUCTS, SOLID SURFACE MATERIALS,

AND SAFETY CONSULTING, MORE THAN OFFSETTING DECLINES IN INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS AND

ARAMID PRODUCTS.

2001 VERSUS 2000 SALES OF $3.6 BILLION WERE DOWN 3 PERCENT, AS 6 PERCENT LOWER

VOLUME WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY 3 PERCENT HIGHER PRICES. ATOI WAS $451 MILLION

COMPARED WITH $576 MILLION, PRINCI-

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

PALLY REFLECTING LOWER SALES. WHILE SALES AND EARNINGS FROM ARAMIDS AND OTHER

ADVANCED FIBER PRODUCTS IMPROVED REFLECTING INCREASED DEMAND FOR MILITARY

PROTECTIVE PRODUCTS, EARNINGS DECLINED FOR NONWOVEN PRODUCTS REFLECTING LOWER

MARGINS.

OUTLOOK THE OUTLOOK FOR SAFETY & PROTECTION FOR 2003 IS POSITIVE BASED ON

EXPECTED RECOVERY IN GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND INCREASED CORPORATE

SPENDING POSITIVELY IMPACTING THE INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS, ELECTRICAL INSULATION,

AND INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE MATERIALS MARKETS. GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED AS A

RESULT OF THE INTEGRATION OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND EXPANSION OF OFFERINGS IN,

AND SHARE OF, THE PERSONAL PROTECTION, SURFACE PROTECTION, CLEANING,

DISINFECTION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS MARKETS. FURTHER NEW OFFERINGS AND

EXPANDED PROGRAMS IN THE SURFACES CATEGORY (CORIAN(R) AND ZODIAQ(R)) ARE

EXPECTED TO GENERATE GROWTH. GROWTH EXPANSION IS ALSO EXPECTED IN THE

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET AUGMENTED BY NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND IN SAFETY

SERVICES FROM CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS GLOBAL CLIENT BASE. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THESE ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE SOME EXPECTED SOFTENING IN THE

NORTH AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE MARKET, WEAKER COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BUILDS, CONTINUED

WEAKNESS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY, AND CONTINUED PRESSURE FROM ASIAN

COMPETITION IN SEVERAL MARKETS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEXTILES & INTERIORS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEXTILES & INTERIORS, THE WORLD'S LARGEST INTEGRATED FIBERS ENTERPRISE, FOCUSES

ON THREE MAJOR FIBER INDUSTRY MARKETS: APPAREL; CARPET, INTERIOR AND INDUSTRIAL

USES; AND NYLON, POLYESTER AND ELASTANE INTERMEDIATES AND RELATED SPECIALTIES.

THE BRAND PORTFOLIO INCLUDES POWERFUL WORLDWIDE CONSUMER BRANDS AND A NUMBER OF

GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED INDUSTRIAL BRANDS. TOGETHER, THESE BRANDS CREATE MARKET

AWARENESS AND PULL-THROUGH PRODUCT DEMAND THAT IS UNEQUALLED IN THE INDUSTRY.

TEXTILES & INTERIORS' MISSION IS TO BUILD ON ITS INDUSTRY-LEADING COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE BY COMBINING ITS BRAND AWARENESS WITH TECHNOLOGICAL STRENGTH IN

TEXTILES AND SOFT FLOOR COVERING FIBERS, A LEADING INTERMEDIATES POSITION, AND

SUPERIOR OPERATIONAL SCALE AND SCOPE.

OVERALL, THE GLOBAL MARKETS FOR TEXTILES & INTERIORS' PRODUCTS RECOVERED

MODESTLY IN 2002 FROM THE RECESSION OF 2001. UNITED STATES AND MOST ASIAN

MARKETS SHOWED STRONG GROWTH EARLY IN THE YEAR AS INVENTORIES WERE REPLENISHED,

WHILE JAPAN AND EUROPE LAGGED. ELASTANE AND POLYESTER FIBERS AND INTERMEDIATES

EXPERIENCED STRONG VOLUME GROWTH. NYLON FIBER GROWTH WAS MODEST BECAUSE OF

COMPETITION FROM POLYESTER, BUT NYLON INTERMEDIATES GROWTH WAS STRONGER, DRIVEN

BY DEMAND FOR ENGINEERING POLYMERS AND NON-FIBER APPLICATIONS. THE MIGRATION OF

THE APPAREL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY TO LESS-EXPENSIVE ASIAN PRODUCTION,

PARTICULARLY CHINA, CONTINUED AS DID THE CONSOLIDATION OF APPAREL MILL CAPACITY

IN THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE. IN THE UNITED STATES, RESIDENTIAL

CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY INCREASED SHARPLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2002, ENCOURAGED BY

VERY LOW INTEREST RATES. AS A RESULT, RESIDENTIAL CARPET AND INTERIOR MARKETS

SHOWED STRONG VOLUME GROWTH. NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED TO BE WEAK

DUE TO EXCESS CAPACITY IN THE OFFICE AND HOSPITALITY SEGMENTS. THIS RESULTED IN

WEAK FIBER DEMAND FROM THIS MARKET. FIBER DEMAND FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY WAS

HEALTHY, AS NEW VEHICLE PRODUCTION REMAINED STRONG, BUOYED BY LOW INTEREST RATES

AND MANUFACTURER INCENTIVES. OVERALL, U.S. MILL CONSUMPTION FOR FIBERS REBOUNDED

MODESTLY FROM 2001 BUT EXCESS FIBER CAPACITY GLOBALLY CONTINUED TO CONSTRAIN

PRICES. MARGINS WERE REDUCED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AS RAW MATERIAL

COSTS WERE DRIVEN UP BY OIL PRICES WHILE PRODUCERS CONTINUED TO HAVE DIFFICULTY

PASSING ON COST INCREASES.

TEXTILES & INTERIORS IS THE LARGEST ELASTANE FIBER MANUFACTURER WORLDWIDE AND

CONTINUES TO BE THE BRAND LEADER IN THE HIGH-GROWTH STRETCH AND RECOVERY APPAREL

MARKET BY FULLY UTILIZING ITS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING,

SALES AND MARKETING RESOURCES. BRANDED AND UNBRANDED PRODUCTS INCLUDE DUPONT(TM)

LYCRA(R) ELASTANE, DUPONT(TM) TACTEL(R) NYLON AND DUPONT(TM) SUPPLEX(R) NYLON,

DUPONT(TM) COOLMAX(R) PERFORMANCE FABRICS, DUPONT(TM) THERMOLITE(R) INSULATION

FIBERS, AND GENERIC ELASTANE, NYLON AND POLYESTER THAT ARE SOLD INTO THE APPAREL

VALUE CHAIN. OTHER READY-TO-WEAR FIBER AND FABRIC OFFERINGS EMPHASIZE ADDITIONAL

CONSUMER BENEFITS INCORPORATED IN PERFORMANCE FABRICS AND INSULATION FIBERS.

RECENTLY, THE DUPONT(TM) TEFLON(R) BRAND WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE PORTFOLIO TO

SATISFY HIGH CONSUMER VALUE FOR "EASY CARE" BRANDS IN APPAREL FOR THE

READY-TO-WEAR AND HOME MARKETS.

THE SEGMENT IS ALSO THE GLOBAL LEADER IN SALES AND MANUFACTURING OF NYLON FIBER.

IT MARKETS BRANDED AND UNBRANDED CARPET FIBERS AND COMMERCIAL INTERIORS SERVICES

ALONG WITH INDUSTRIAL NYLON AND POLYESTER YARNS AND IS AMONG THE LARGEST

RECLAIMERS OF NYLON. SPECIFIC MARKETS SERVED INCLUDE THE GLOBAL SOFT FLOOR

COVERING MARKET AND THE FOOTWEAR, PACKS AND BAGS, COMMERCIAL GLOVES, FIBERFILL,

AIRBAGS AND ELASTANE PERSONAL CARE MARKETS. THE SOFT FLOOR COVERING MARKET

INCLUDES RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL,

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

TRANSPORTATION AND RUGS MARKET SEGMENTS. TEXTILES & INTERIORS PROVIDES PRODUCT

SALES, INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE AND RECLAMATION SERVICES IN THE COMMERCIAL

CARPET MARKET SPACE. MAJOR BRANDS THAT ARE MARKETED TO FLOORING, INTERIOR AND

INDUSTRIAL FIBER MARKETS INCLUDE DUPONT(TM) STAINMASTER(R), DUPONT(TM)

ANTRON(R), LYCRA(R) AND DUPONT(TM) CORDURA(R). INDUSTRY LEADING STAINMASTER(R)

AND ANTRON(R) CARPET BRANDS OFFER A PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS, INNOVATION AND

STYLE TO RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE. LEADING POLYESTER

BRANDS INCLUDE DUPONT(TM) COOLMAX(R) PERFORMANCE FABRICS, DUPONT(TM) COMFOREL(R)

SLEEP PRODUCTS AND DUPONT(TM) THERMOLITE(R) INSULATION FIBERS. THE SEGMENT IS

EXPANDING THE ELASTIC FIBER STRETCH CONCEPT TO NONTRADITIONAL AND NONAPPAREL

END-USES.

TEXTILES & INTERIORS ALSO PRODUCES NYLON AND POLYESTER INTERMEDIATES, CHEMICAL

SPECIALTIES, NYLON SALT AND POLYMERS, ELASTANE INTERMEDIATES, AND ENGAGES IN

POLYESTER TECHNOLOGY LICENSING. WITH WELL ESTABLISHED INDUSTRIAL BRANDS LIKE

DBE(TM), DUPONT(TM) CORFREE(R), DUPONT(TM) DYTEK(R), DUPONT(TM) ADI-PURE(R), AND

DUPONT(TM) TERATHANE(R), THE SEGMENT SERVICES THE ADHESIVES, COATINGS AND

SEALANT MARKETS, AS WELL AS FOOTWEAR, LUBRICANTS, SOLVENTS, SPORTING GOODS, AND

THE NYLON FIBERS AND RESINS MARKETS. THIS PART OF THE SEGMENT ALSO SERVES THE

POLYESTER FIBERS AND RESINS AND POLYURETHANES MARKETS. POLYESTER INTERMEDIATES

HAVE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE FORCES IMPACTING THE BUSINESS DUE TO EXCESS

CAPACITY, WHICH IS RESULTING IN LOWER PRICES. NYLON INTERMEDIATES HAVE

EXPERIENCED STEADY GROWTH RESULTING IN CAPACITY EXPANSION AT THE COMPANY'S

WILTON, ENGLAND, SITE AND AT ITS JOINT VENTURE IN CHALAMPE, FRANCE. IN ADDITION,

TEXTILES & INTERIORS INCLUDES THREE MAJOR VENTURES AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

O DUPONT FAR EASTERN PETROCHEMICAL IS A 70 PERCENT OWNED VENTURE WITH FAR

EASTERN PETROCHEMICALS, WHICH HAS A MAJOR MANUFACTURING OPERATION IN KUAN

YIN, TAIWAN. THIS VENTURE WAS FORMED TO MANUFACTURE PTA (PURIFIED

TEREPHTHALIC ACID), A KEY POLYESTER INTERMEDIATE. THIS BUSINESS REPRESENTS

TEXTILES & INTERIORS' LARGEST MANUFACTURING PRESENCE IN ASIA WITH ANNUAL

REVENUE IN EXCESS OF $400 MILLION.

O DUPONT SABANCI POLYESTER EUROPE B. V. (DUPONTSA), HEADQUARTERED IN THE

NETHERLANDS, IS A 50 PERCENT OWNED JOINT VENTURE FORMED FOR THE

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND SALE OF POLYESTER FIBERS, CONTAINER RESINS, AND

THE INTERMEDIATES PTA AND DMT (DIMETHYL TEREPHTHALATE), FOR MARKETS

THROUGHOUT EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE VENTURE IS THE LARGEST

POLYESTER COMPANY IN THE REGION WITH ANNUAL REVENUES OF ABOUT $750 MILLION.

O DUPONT-SABANCI INTERNATIONAL, LLC (DUSA) IS A 50 PERCENT OWNED JOINT

VENTURE AND THE LEADING GLOBAL SUPPLIER OF NYLON INDUSTRIAL YARN, FABRICS

AND SINGLE-END CORD SERVING THE TIRE, MECHANICAL RUBBER GOODS, WEBBING,

ROPES AND CORDAGE MARKETS WITH ANNUAL SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION.

2002 DEVELOPMENTS

AS PART OF ITS KEY GROWTH INITIATIVES, TEXTILES & INTERIORS.

O RECEIVED U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION APPROVAL OF A NEW GENERIC FIBER

SUBCLASS, ELLASTERELL-P, IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNIQUE QUALITIES OF THE

T-400 FIBER INNOVATION. T-400 BRINGS A NEW LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE AND

AESTHETICS TO KNITS AND HAS BEEN COMMERCIALIZED UNDER THE LYCRA(R) BRAND

WITH SELECTED MILLS AND GARMENT BRANDS.

O ESTABLISHED A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE WITH SHINKONG SYNTHETIC FIBERS

CORPORATION IN TAIWAN TO MANUFACTURE THE NEW ELASTIC FIBER T-400.

O COMPLETED MAJOR EXPANSIONS IN BRAZIL, SINGAPORE AND CHINA TO INCREASE

ELASTANE CAPACITY IN SUPPORT OF MARKET GROWTH.

O INTRODUCED "BUILDER ADVANTAGE PROGRAM" TO OFFER HOMEBUYERS A "ONE-STOP"

SHOPPING SOLUTION WITH STAINMASTER(R) CARPET TO BETTER INTEGRATE THE

BUILDER AND HOMEBUYER CARPET SELECTION PROCESS.

O EXPANDED SALES OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR SOFTER FLOOR COVERING UNDER THE

DUPONT(TM) TACTESSE(R) BRAND THAT CREATED A NEW TREND AND SIGNIFICANT

VOLUME GROWTH FOR FIBER IN RESIDENTIAL SOFT FLOOR COVERING MARKETS.

O LAUNCHED ITS FIRST AUTOMOTIVE BRANDED CARPET, DUPONT(TM) ALTARA(TM), TO

PROVIDE A SYSTEM OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO ENHANCE AUTOMOTIVE INTERIORS.

O INTRODUCED AN ENHANCED VERSION OF CORFREE(R) M1(TM) USED IN LUBRICANTS,

METAL WORKING FLUIDS AND CORROSION INHIBITORS. THIS NEW ADDITION TO THE

INDUSTRY LEADING CORFREE(R) PRODUCT LINE HAS IMPROVED ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

AND VERY LOW LEVELS OF UNDESIRABLE NITROGEN COMPOUNDS CONTENT.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

O FURTHER STRENGTHENED ADI-PURE(R), THE MOST RECOGNIZED ADIPIC ACID BRAND IN

THE WORLD, IN BOTH EUROPE AND ASIA BY EXTENSIVE MARKETING AND UPGRADING THE

WILTON, ENGLAND PRODUCTION PROCESS. ADI-PURE(R) WAS DIVERSIFIED INTO

SEVERAL DIFFERENT END-USE MARKETS INCLUDING FOOD-GRADE APPLICATIONS.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDED.

O AS PART OF TEXTILES & INTERIORS' DRIVE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE STRENGTH OF ITS

NEWLY COMBINED BUSINESSES AND BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE IN RESPONSE TO

RAPIDLY ACCELERATING INDUSTRY STRUCTURAL CHANGES, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED

MORE THAN 2,000 EMPLOYEE POSITIONS WORLDWIDE, OR 10 PERCENT OF ITS GLOBAL

WORKFORCE. MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF THE REDUCTIONS ARE IN MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES AND OFFICES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH MOST OF THE BALANCE IN

EUROPE. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY SHUT DOWN ITS TERATHANE(R)

ELASTANE INTERMEDIATE MANUFACTURING UNIT IN NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK, AND

LESS COMPETITIVE PORTIONS OF THE ELASTANE OPERATIONS IN WAYNESBORO,

VIRGINIA.

O TEXTILES & INTERIORS' ANTRON(R) CARPET FIBER RECEIVED THE SCIENTIFIC

CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS CERTIFICATION.

THE SEGMENT'S COMMERCIAL FLOORING BUSINESS IS THE FIRST AND ONLY CARPET

FIBER MANUFACTURER TO ACHIEVE THIS CERTIFICATION WHICH WAS GRANTED AS A

RESULT OF DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE WITH LESS ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH

IMPACT VERSUS COMPETING PRODUCTS.

O AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $78 MILLION WAS RECORDED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE TO WRITE OFF GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMMERCIAL FLOORING BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH THE STRATEGIC INTENT OF THE BUSINESS

HAS NOT CHANGED, THE REALIZATION OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THE BUSINESS

HAS BEEN LIMITED BY POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE

COMMERCIAL OFFICE SECTOR, AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED MARGINS IN THE

COMPETITIVE DISTRIBUTION MARKET.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $6.3 BILLION WERE 3 PERCENT LOWER REFLECTING 5 PERCENT

HIGHER VOLUME, MORE THAN OFFSET BY 6 PERCENT LOWER PRICES AND A 2 PERCENT

DECLINE DUE TO DIVESTITURES. INTERMEDIATE AND APPAREL PRODUCTS BOTH EXPERIENCED

LOWER SALES. SALES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT FOR SEGMENT PRODUCTS SOLD INTO THE

CARPET, INTERIORS AND INDUSTRIAL FIBER MARKETS AS HIGHER VOLUMES OFFSET LOWER

PRICES. ATOI IN 2002 WAS $72 MILLION EXCLUDING A CHARGE OF $78 MILLION

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE. 2002 INCLUDES A $115 MILLION NET CHARGE RELATED TO EMPLOYEE

SEPARATION COSTS AND ASSETS WRITE-DOWNS. IN 2001, ATOI WAS A LOSS OF $340

MILLION AND INCLUDED $410 MILLION FOR NET CHARGES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION

COSTS AND ASSET WRITE-DOWNS. WHILE SEGMENT SALES DECLINED, EARNINGS BENEFITED

FROM REDUCED FIXED COSTS REFLECTING RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS IN BOTH YEARS, LOWER

ENERGY-BASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS, AND A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

2001 VERSUS 2000 SALES OF $6.5 BILLION WERE 16 PERCENT LOWER REFLECTING 11

PERCENT LOWER VOLUME AND 5 PERCENT LOWER PRICES. ATOI WAS A LOSS OF $340 MILLION

VERSUS EARNINGS OF $740 MILLION. THE SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS DECLINE REFLECTED A

COMBINATION OF NEGATIVE FACTORS INCLUDING VERY WEAK U.S. APPAREL AND TEXTILE

MARKETS, HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS, LOWER U.S. DOLLAR PRICES, AND VERY WEAK

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR CARPET IN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL MARKETS. IN ADDITION,

2001 INCLUDES $410 MILLION IN NET CHARGES RESULTING FROM EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS,

FACILITY SHUTDOWNS, AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AS AGGRESSIVE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

WERE TAKEN DURING THE YEAR TO ADDRESS MARKET CONDITIONS.

OUTLOOK AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCER AND MARKETER OF PREMIUM FIBERS, WITH

MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING PRESENCE IN EVERY MAJOR MARKET, TEXTILES & INTERIORS

IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL

TEXTILE AND SOFT FLOOR COVERINGS INDUSTRIES. TEXTILES & INTERIORS WILL CONTINUE

TO EXPERIENCE THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND A SHIFT IN

MANUFACTURING TO ASIA, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN THE GLOBAL TEXTILE

MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN NORTH AMERICA. AS A CONSEQUENCE, TEXTILES & INTERIORS

WILL FOCUS ON REDUCING COSTS AND EVOLVING ITS BUSINESS MODEL TO BECOME MORE

COMPETITIVE. TEXTILES & INTERIORS WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS VARIOUS FIBER

BUSINESS INVESTMENTS IN CHANGING MARKET ENVIRONMENTS AND EXPLORE STRATEGIES TO

OPTIMIZE THESE INVESTMENTS. PETROLEUM-BASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE SEGMENT'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

APPAREL GROWTH FROM ELASTANE SALES (BRANDED AND GENERIC) IS ANTICIPATED IN 2003,

AS THE DEMAND FOR APPAREL WITH THE COMFORT DELIVERED THROUGH STRETCH AND

RECOVERY CONTINUES TO GROW BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND ACROSS GARMENT CATEGORIES.

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR LYCRA(R) PREMIUM STRETCH FIBER - PARTICULARLY SHOES, HOME

TEXTILES, DUPONT(TM) LEATHER WITH LYCRA(R) AND STRETCH NONWOVENS -

32

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

ARE POISED FOR GROWTH. NYLON TEXTILE INDUSTRY CAPACITY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN

SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE DEMAND, PRESSURING PRICES IN THAT SECTOR.

NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN ECONOMIES ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE IN 2003, RESULTING

IN INCREASED DEMAND FOR CARPET FIBER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. HOWEVER, DEMAND FOR

COMMERCIAL CARPET FIBER IS NOT EXPECTED TO FULLY RECOVER UNTIL 2004 WHEN

IMPROVED CORPORATE PROFITS ARE EXPECTED TO DRIVE HIGHER CONSTRUCTION SPENDING.

AUTO BUILDS AND SIDE AIRBAG PENETRATION WILL ALSO BE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE

RATE OF ANTICIPATED GROWTH OF SEGMENT PRODUCTS.

THE GLOBAL INTERMEDIATES MARKET IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

SEVERAL FACTORS CONTINUE TO IMPACT SALES, INCLUDING WEAK POLYESTER FIBER MARKET

CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, EXCESS GLOBAL CAPACITY, AND

POTENTIAL INCREASES IN PARAXYLENE AND ETHYLENE GLYCOL PRICING. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS STRONG DEMAND FOR PTA IN ASIA AND CONTINUES TO ASSESS ALTERNATIVE

STRATEGIES TO OPTIMIZE ITS POLYESTER INVESTMENTS. SPECIALTY CHEMICAL MARKETS

SUCH AS COATINGS, ADHESIVES, LUBRICANTS AND SOLVENTS, ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE

SOLID GROWTH.

IN FEBRUARY 2002, DUPONT ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO SEPARATE TEXTILES & INTERIORS. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO CONSIDER AND EVALUATE A COMPLETE RANGE OF SEPARATION

OPTIONS FOR TEXTILES & INTERIORS, INCLUDING AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, WITH

SEPARATION EXPECTED TO OCCUR BY YEAR-END 2003, MARKET CONDITIONS PERMITTING.

OTHER

THE COMPANY COMBINES THE RESULTS OF ITS NONALIGNED AND EMBRYONIC BUSINESSES

UNDER OTHER. THESE BUSINESSES INCLUDE BIO-BASED MATERIALS AND GROWTH

INITIATIVES. RESULTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED BENLATE(R) FUNGICIDE

BUSINESS ARE ALSO INCLUDED (SEE BENLATE(R) DISCUSSION UNDER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ON

PAGE 8 OF THIS REPORT). IN THE AGGREGATE, SALES FROM THESE BUSINESSES REPRESENT

LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF TOTAL SEGMENT SALES.

2002 VERSUS 2001 SALES OF $22 MILLION WERE DOWN 85 PERCENT, PRINCIPALLY

REFLECTING THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BENLATE(R) FUNGICIDE BUSINESS IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER 2001. ATOI WAS A LOSS OF $164 MILLION AND INCLUDES CHARGES OF $50

MILLION TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S RESERVE FOR BENLATE(R) LITIGATION AND $31

MILLION TO ESTABLISH A RESERVE RELATED TO VITAMINS LITIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH A

PREVIOUSLY DIVESTED JOINT VENTURE. A 2001 ATOI LOSS OF $95 MILLION INCLUDED A

NET CHARGE OF $37 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS.

2001 VERSUS 2000 SALES WERE $148 MILLION IN 2001, AS COMPARED TO $141 MILLION IN

2000. ATOI WAS A LOSS OF $95 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $93 MILLION. ATOI

IN 2000 INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $62 MILLION TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S RESERVE FOR

BENLATE(R) LITIGATION.

LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO

BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS OF AA- AND AA3 FROM

STANDARD & POOR'S (S&P;) AND MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, AND ITS

COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS OF A-L+ BY S&P; AND PRIME 1 BY MOODY'S ARE EVIDENCE OF

THAT STRENGTH. THIS ADVANTAGE IS BASED ON STRONG BUSINESS OPERATING CASH FLOWS

OVER AN ECONOMIC CYCLE, A COMMITMENT TO CASH DISCIPLINE REGARDING WORKING

CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND THE INTENT TO PURSUE A FISCALLY

RESPONSIBLE POLICY OF ACCRETIVE ACQUISITIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSIONS OF THE

COMPANY'S SEGMENTS.

SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY

THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT

SOURCES, INCLUDING: CASH FROM OPERATIONS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES,

BILATERAL CREDIT LINES, EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS, AND ASSET SALES.

THE COMPANY'S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $2.1 BILLION IN 2002, A $.3

BILLION REDUCTION FROM THE $2.4 BILLION GENERATED IN 2001. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

REDUCTION REFLECTS INCREASED TAX PAYMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE GAIN ON THE

SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS, AND REDUCED REVENUES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

OPERATING COSTS. IN 2001 THE COMPANY'S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $2.7

BILLION LESS THAN THE $5.1 BILLION GENERATED IN 2000, PRIMARILY DUE TO RECESSION

RELATED EARNINGS DECLINES AND THE STRONG U.S. DOLLAR. IN ADDITION, THE 2000 CASH

PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF $610 MILLION FROM THE

SECURITIZATION OF TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND A TRANSFER FROM THE PENSION

TRUST FUND OF $300 MILLION TO PAY RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS. NO TRANSFERS WERE

MADE FROM THE PENSION TRUST FUND TO PAY RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS IN 2002 OR

2001.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES TOTALED $4.1 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, REFLECTING A $1.7 BILLION DECREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2001.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTION

33

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX PAYMENTS IN 2002 ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2001 GAIN ON

THE SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS.

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET IS A SOURCE OF "SAME DAY" CASH FOR THE COMPANY. THE

COMPANY CAN ACCESS THIS MARKET AT PREFERRED RATES GIVEN ITS STRONG CREDIT

RATING. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BEFORE TAXES ON COMMERCIAL PAPER FOR

2002, 2001 AND 2000, WERE 1.7 PERCENT, 4.1 PERCENT AND 6.5 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, DUPONT'S COMMERCIAL PAPER BALANCE WAS $668

MILLION, A $593 MILLION INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2001.

IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY NEEDS, THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION IN "SAME

DAY" CREDIT LINES WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE CREDIT LINES

ARE SPLIT ABOUT EQUALLY BETWEEN 364-DAY AND MULTI-YEAR FACILITIES.

DUPONT ALSO HAS ACCESS TO EQUITY MARKETS AND TO LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS.

THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RELATIVELY LOW LONG-TERM BORROWING LEVEL, STRONG FINANCIAL

POSITION AND CREDIT RATING PROVIDE ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS.

PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS WERE $196 MILLION FOR 2002, PRIMARILY REFLECTING

$143 MILLION RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF THE CLYSAR(R) SHRINK FILM BUSINESS. IN

2002, THERE WERE ALSO $122 MILLION OF SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS TO BRISTOL-MYERS

SQUIBB RELATING TO THE 2001 SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS. IN 2001 PROCEEDS

FROM SALES OF ASSETS TOTALED $8.1 BILLION, OF WHICH $7.8 BILLION RELATED TO THE

SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS. PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS WERE $703 MILLION

IN 2000. ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S SALES OF ASSETS ARE

PROVIDED IN NOTE 26 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

USES OF CASH

PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES WERE

$1.4 BILLION IN 2002 COMPARED WITH $1.6 BILLION IN 2001 AND $2.0 BILLION IN

2000. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN 2003 TO

BE ABOUT $1.6 BILLION EXCLUDING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, FROM THE ADOPTION OF FIN NO.

46.

PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2002 TOTALED $697 MILLION PRIMARILY

CONSISTING OF TWO ACQUISITIONS. IN MAY 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE

OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF LIQUI-BOX CORPORATION FOR $272 MILLION, NET OF CASH

ACQUIRED. IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CHEMFIRST, INC. FOR $357

MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS FOR BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED IN 2001 AND 2000. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SEEK ACCRETIVE ACQUISITIONS

RELATED TO EXISTING LINES OF BUSINESS TO STRENGTHEN ITS CURRENT PORTFOLIO.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITIONS ARE PROVIDED IN NOTE 26 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAS PAID A QUARTERLY COMMON DIVIDEND SINCE ITS FIRST DIVIDEND IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 1904. DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK WERE $1.40 IN 2002,

2001 AND 2000.

IN 1998 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A PROGRAM TO PURCHASE AND

RETIRE UP TO 20 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK TO OFFSET DILUTION FROM

SHARES ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN JULY 2000 THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF

DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON

STOCK REMAINING TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE 1998 PROGRAM FROM ABOUT 16 MILLION

SHARES TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES THAT COULD BE PURCHASED FOR $2.5 BILLION.

THESE PURCHASES WERE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE NEEDED TO OFFSET DILUTION FROM SHARES

ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE 1998

PROGRAM BY PURCHASING 10.8 MILLION SHARES FOR $470 MILLION. IN ADDITION, 43

MILLION SHARES WERE PURCHASED FOR $1.8 BILLION IN 2001 AND 9.5 MILLION SHARES

FOR $462 MILLION IN 2000. OF THE $462 MILLION PURCHASED IN 2000, $212 MILLION

APPLIES TO THE $2.5 BILLION UPDATED PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $2 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN

IN JUNE 2001. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, NO SHARES WERE PURCHASED UNDER THIS

PROGRAM.

NET DEBT INCREASED $1.7 BILLION IN 2002. CASH PROVIDED BY CONTINUING OPERATIONS

IN 2002 REFLECTS TAX PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2001 SALE OF DUPONT

PHARMACEUTICALS. THE MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURES AND THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

SECURITIZATION AND SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS AS DESCRIBED BELOW ALSO CONTRIBUTED

TO REDUCED DEBT LEVELS OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

THE COMPANY RESTRUCTURED ITS DEBT PORTFOLIO IN 2002 TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

FAVORABLE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. HIGHER-RATE DEBT OF $1.3 BILLION WAS

REPLACED WITH LOWER-RATE COMMERCIAL PAPER. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ISSUED TWO

NOTES VALUED AT $400 MILLION EACH FOR FIVE AND TEN YEAR TERMS. THE EFFECT OF THE

RESTRUCTURING REDUCED YEAR-END AVERAGE INTEREST RATES FROM 6.1 PERCENT TO 5.0

PERCENT. SEE NOTES 18 AND 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

YEAR-END DEBT BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES.

TO BROADEN SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND IMPROVE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, IN 2002 THE

COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT PROGRAM TO REDUCE THE FINANCING

COSTS OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS,

WHICH WERE BOTH INITIATED IN 2000. THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION

PROGRAM PROVIDES ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY AT COMPETITIVE RATES. THE SYNTHETIC LEASE

PROGRAM IMPROVES THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S LEASING

ACTIVITIES. IN 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO TWO MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURES.

THE MINORITY INTEREST TRANSACTIONS PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A NEW SOURCE OF

FUNDING AT A COST ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO DEBT.

MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURES

IN 2001 THE COMPANY RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $2 BILLION FROM ENTERING INTO TWO

MINORITY INTEREST TRANSACTIONS. COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

TRANSACTIONS TOTALED $42 MILLION AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD TO MINORITY INTEREST IN EARNINGS OF CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT. THE PROCEEDS WERE USED TO

REDUCE DEBT AND ARE REPORTED AS MINORITY INTERESTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT PROCEEDS

UTILIZING THESE STRUCTURES.

THE MINORITY INVESTORS EARN A PREFERRED, CUMULATIVE ADJUSTABLE RETURN ON THEIR

INVESTMENT. THE AFTER-TAX DISTRIBUTION REFLECTED IN MINORITY INTERESTS IN

EARNINGS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES FOR 2002 AND 2001 WAS $36 MILLION AND $14

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING A PREFERRED RETURN OF 1.8 PERCENT AND 2.9

PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, AMORTIZED COSTS (NET OF TAXES) OF $5 MILLION AND $2 MILLION IN 2002

AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY WERE REPORTED IN MINORITY INTERESTS IN EARNINGS OF

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES. ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE MINORITY INTEREST

STRUCTURES ARE PROVIDED IN NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

COMMERCIAL PAPER FACILITY

IN 2002 THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT PROGRAM TO REDUCE THE

FINANCING COSTS OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND

SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS BY GAINING DIRECT ACCESS TO THE ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL

PAPER MARKET. THE CONDUIT ISSUES NOTES TO THIRD PARTIES SECURED BY THE

RECEIVABLE INTERESTS AND THE EQUIPMENT AND REAL ESTATE UNDER SYNTHETIC LEASES.

IN ADDITION, THE NOTES ARE BACKED BY LIQUIDITY SUPPORT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANY WAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE UP TO $278 MILLION OF SUCH SUPPORT. THE

LEGAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT INCLUDES NONCONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY THROUGH OWNERSHIP INTERESTS.

NO DIRECTOR, OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY IS A DIRECTOR, OFFICER OR

EMPLOYEE OF ANY OF THESE ENTITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

RECEIVABLES AND SYNTHETIC LEASE ASSETS IN THE PROGRAM WAS $590 MILLION (EXCLUDES

ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION OF $103 MILLION.) COSTS OF $2 MILLION TO ESTABLISH THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT WERE EXPENSED IN 2002.

THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM WAS INITIATED IN 2000 TO SELL AN

INTEREST IN A REVOLVING POOL OF TRADE ACCOUNTS

35

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

RECEIVABLE. AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED, THE COMPANY SELLS CERTAIN TRADE RECEIVABLES

ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO A CONSOLIDATED COMPANY, WHICH IN TURN SELLS AN

INTEREST IN THOSE RECEIVABLES TO A QUALIFIED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (QSPE). THE

QSPE THEN SELLS THE INTEREST IT PURCHASED IN THOSE RECEIVABLES TO THE COMMERCIAL

PAPER CONDUIT. PROCEEDS RECEIVED IN 2000 FROM THE SALE OF THE INTEREST WERE $610

MILLION AND WERE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION IN TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2000 THE INTEREST WAS $610 MILLION AND WAS REDUCED TO $468 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND $445 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2002 MISCELLANEOUS RECEIVABLES INCLUDE AN OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OF $214 MILLION

AS SECURITY FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM IS COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER

SOURCES OF FINANCING, AND CASH PROCEEDS WERE USED TO REDUCE DEBT. EXPENSES IN

CONNECTION WITH THIS PROGRAM WERE $10 MILLION, $27 MILLION AND $16 MILLION IN

2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY MAY TERMINATE THE PROGRAM AT ANY

TIME BY STOPPING THE SALE OF RECEIVABLES. IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT THE INTEREST SOLD IN THE REVOLVING POOL OF RECEIVABLES TO EXCEED $500

MILLION.

A SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 2000 AS AN ALTERNATIVE FINANCING

SOURCE FOR SELECTED ASSETS AT COMPETITIVE RATES. THIS PROGRAM HAS VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) THAT SERVE AS THE OWNER/LESSOR AND DEBT HOLDER OF THESE

ASSETS. THE PROGRAM IS USED FOR THE SALE AND LEASEBACK OF CORPORATE AIRCRAFT,

RAIL CARS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO

AGREEMENTS TO LEASE, UPON COMPLETION, MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING FACILITIES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS UNDER THESE LEASES WERE

APPROXIMATELY $248 MILLION AND THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES AND

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $249 MILLION. THE LEASE TERMS RANGE

FROM ONE TO SEVEN YEARS. LEASE PAYMENTS TOTALED $5 MILLION IN 2002, $9 MILLION

IN 2001, AND LESS THAN $1 MILLION IN 2000 AND WERE REPORTED AS OPERATING EXPENSE

IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT.

THERE ARE TWO OTHER SYNTHETIC LEASES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE COMMERCIAL

PAPER CONDUIT FINANCING PROGRAM, ONE OF WHICH IS A VIE THAT SERVES AS THE

OWNER/LESSOR OF A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SINGAPORE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS ASSET WAS APPROXIMATELY $82 MILLION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $82

MILLION. THE SECOND SYNTHETIC LEASE IS FOR OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EQUIPMENT VALUED

AT APPROXIMATELY $66 MILLION. LEASE TERMS RANGE FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS. LEASE

PAYMENTS FOR THESE ASSETS TOTALED $26 MILLION IN 2002, $12 MILLION IN 2001, AND

LESS THAN $1 MILLION IN 2000 AND WERE REPORTED AS OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT.

ALL SYNTHETIC LEASES ARE CONSIDERED OPERATING LEASES AND ACCORDINGLY THE RELATED

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET. FURTHERMORE, THE LEASE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS VARY BASED

ON NINETY-DAY LIBOR. THE COMPANY MAY TERMINATE THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME BY

PURCHASING THE ASSETS. SHOULD THE COMPANY DECIDE NEITHER TO RENEW THE LEASES NOR

TO EXERCISE ITS PURCHASE OPTION, IT MUST PAY THE OWNER A RESIDUAL VALUE

GUARANTEE AMOUNT, WHICH MAY BE RECOVERED FROM A SALE OF THE PROPERTY TO A THIRD

PARTY. RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES TOTALED $335 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. IN

JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN NO. 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES." THIS INTERPRETATION MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S TREATMENT OF

ITS VIES. (SEE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED BEGINNING ON PAGE

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

THESE WARRANTIES VARIES BY PRODUCT. THE ESTIMATED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY FOR

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS $22 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS

RECOURSE PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT WOULD ENABLE RECOVERY FROM THIRD

PARTIES FOR AMOUNTS PAID UNDER THE WARRANTY.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF COMPANY ASSETS AND BUSINESSES THE COMPANY HAS

INDEMNIFIED RESPECTIVE BUYERS AGAINST CERTAIN LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE IN

CONNECTION WITH THE SALES TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIOR TO THE

ULTIMATE CLOSING OF THE SALE. THE TERM OF THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, WHICH

TYPICALLY PERTAIN TO ENVIRONMENTAL, TAX, AND PRODUCT LIABILITIES, IS GENERALLY

INDEFINITE. IF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY WERE TO INCUR A LIABILITY OR HAVE A

LIABILITY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF

THE INDEMNIFICATION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE BUYER. THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS IS GENERALLY UNLIMITED. THE CARRYING AMOUNT

RECORDED FOR ALL INDEMNIFICATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 IS $31 MILLION.

ALTHOUGH IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE PAYMENTS MAY EXCEED AMOUNTS

ACCRUED, DUE TO THE NATURE OF INDEMNIFIED ITEMS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS. NO ASSETS

ARE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND NO SPECIFIC RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST.

OBLIGATIONS FOR SUBSIDIARIES, EQUITY AFFILIATES AND OTHERS

THE COMPANY HAS DIRECTLY GUARANTEED VARIOUS DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS

WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO SUBSIDIARIES, EQUITY AFFILIATES, AND OTHER

UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD DIRECTLY

GUARANTEED $1,772 MILLION OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $250

MILLION OF SUBSIDIARY BANK BORROWINGS WHICH ARE RECORDED AS DEBT IN THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THIS REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM

POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE (UNDISCOUNTED) PAYMENTS THAT THE COMPANY COULD BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THE GUARANTEES. NO MATERIAL LOSS IS ANTICIPATED BY REASON

OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAS NO

LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS OTHER THAN SUBSIDIARY BANK BORROWINGS

OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS DEBT IN THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS AROSE AS PART OF CONTRACTUAL SALES

AGREEMENTS. EXISTING GUARANTEES FOR SUBSIDIARIES AND EQUITY AFFILIATES AROSE FOR

LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN NORMAL OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM

ON THESE GUARANTEES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE GUARANTEED PARTY. IN CERTAIN

CASES, THE COMPANY HAS RECOURSE TO ASSETS HELD AS COLLATERAL AS WELL AS PERSONAL

GUARANTEES FROM EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AND

LIABILITIES OF CONOCO INC., ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, WHICH TOTALED $251

MILLION, PLUS INTEREST, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. CONOCO HAS INDEMNIFIED THE COMPANY

FOR ANY LIABILITIES THE COMPANY MAY INCUR PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES. THE

RESTRUCTURING, TRANSFER AND SEPARATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN DUPONT AND CONOCO

REQUIRES CONOCO TO USE ITS BEST EFFORTS TO HAVE CONOCO, OR ANY OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES, SUBSTITUTE FOR DUPONT. NO MATERIAL LOSS IS ANTICIPATED BY REASON

OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAS NO

LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS.

IN SUMMARY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MEET ITS $7.2 BILLION CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THROUGH ITS NORMAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND DOES NOT EXPECT TO FINANCE ANY OF

ITS $2.6 BILLION OF GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND STRONG BALANCE SHEET COULD BE USED

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A

LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EXPENSES AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE

TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AND MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S

WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS, AND 99 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S

WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR RETIREE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFITS, ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BENEFIT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO

CHANGE , MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE PENSION AND MEDICAL,

DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF

SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. IN THE U.S., PENSION BENEFITS ARE

PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF

FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURES UTILIZED

ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS. BECAUSE

PLAN ASSETS EXCEEDED THE FUNDING LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, NO CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN WERE MADE IN

2002 AND NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE MADE IN 2003.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN TRUST FUND BEYOND 2003 ARE NOT

DETERMINABLE SINCE THE AMOUNT OF ANY CONTRIBUTION IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE

FUTURE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PENSION TRUST ASSETS.

PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE

UNFUNDED PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM

OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE,

THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE SOVEREIGN COUNTRY

IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION

BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, REDUCED ASSET

VALUATIONS TEND TO RESULT IN HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION PLANS. IN 2002, THE

COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $172 MILLION TO PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S.

PENSION PLAN DISCUSSED ABOVE. OVERALL, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES CONTRIBUTIONS IN

2003 TO THESE PENSION PLANS TO BE HIGHER; HOWEVER, THE IMPACT IS NOT EXPECTED TO

BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE AN ADJUSTMENT TO STOCKHOLDERS'

EQUITY WHENEVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF YEAR-END PENSION ASSETS ARE LESS THAN

THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, EACH OF THE COMPANY'S

PENSION PLANS MUST BE TESTED INDIVIDUALLY. AT YEAR-END 2002, A NON-CASH

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $2.5 BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY WAS RECORDED IN

RESPONSE TO LOWER ASSET VALUATIONS AND SOMEWHAT HIGHER BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF

THAT DATE. MOST OF THIS ADJUSTMENT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION

PLAN. IF PENSION PLAN ASSET VALUES RECOVER ADEQUATELY, THIS ADJUSTMENT WILL BE

REVERSED.

MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS ARE UNFUNDED AND APPROVED CLAIMS ARE

PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRETAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL NET

CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $400 MILLION, $423

MILLION, AND $381 MILLION, FOR 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT

IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $430 MILLION IN 2003. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS

DURING THIS PERIOD REFLECT HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS, DEMOGRAPHIC

CHANGES, AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES.

THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PENSION BENEFITS AS WELL

AS EXPENSES FOR RETIREE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME OVER

EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS WAS FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY PRETAX PENSION CREDITS

AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PRETAX OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT CHARGES.

================================================================================

THE DECREASE IN PENSION CREDITS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VALUES FOR PENSION

PLAN ASSETS RESULTING FROM THE DECLINE IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. THE INCREASE IN

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO RAPIDLY INCREASING

MEDICAL COSTS.

THE COMPANY'S KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION

INCREASES, AND THE DISCOUNT RATE. IN 2002, THE COMPANY LOWERED ITS ASSUMED RATE

OF COMPENSATION INCREASE FROM 5.0 PERCENT TO 4.5 PERCENT TO REFLECT A CHANGE IN

THE COMPANY'S OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE INFLATION. THE DISCOUNT RATE

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

USED IN THESE CALCULATIONS WAS DETERMINED TO BE 6.75 PERCENT IN 2002 BASED ON

HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND RATES. THE COMPANY HAS LOWERED ITS LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS FROM 9.5 PERCENT TO 9.0

PERCENT IN 2003. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE EFFECT OF ACTUAL INVESTMENT RESULTS

DURING 2002, COUPLED WITH THE CHANGES OUTLINED ABOVE, WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT

2003 EARNINGS PER SHARE BY $0.40 TO $0.45.

WITH RESPECT TO OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, IN OCTOBER 2002, THE COMPANY

ANNOUNCED THAT IT REDESIGNED ITS U.S. HEALTH CARE PLAN TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO

CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A FULLY COMPETITIVE BENEFIT OFFERING TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND

RETIREES. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO RETIREES

AND SURVIVORS BUT ESTABLISHED LIMITS ON THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF THE COST OF

COVERAGE. THESE LIMITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE REACHED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. FOR

MEDICAL, THE LIMIT WILL APPLY NO SOONER THAN JANUARY 1, 2007. FOR DENTAL, THE

CHANGES IN PREMIUM STRUCTURE WILL TAKE EFFECT IN 2005. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THESE

CHANGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS, WILL POSITIVELY

IMPACT 2003 EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.06.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, PRODUCT-HANDLING AND

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR

EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, DUPONT IMPLEMENTS

VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, ELIMINATE THE GENERATION OF

HAZARDOUS WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, INCREASE THE

EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF PERSISTENT,

BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC (PBT) MATERIALS. THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND

GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

EVEN THOUGH THESE COSTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE OR FINANCIAL POSITION,

LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN 2002 DUPONT SPENT ABOUT $79 MILLION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER

REQUIRED BY LAW OR NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL

PROJECTS WILL TOTAL $84 MILLION IN 2003. IN THE U.S., SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE FOR TREATMENT,

STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE

WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA). UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE

ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING FUTURE

ESTIMATES FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL CAA CAPITAL COSTS OVER THE NEXT TWO

YEARS ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO RANGE FROM $10 MILLION TO $20 MILLION.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) CHALLENGED THE U.S. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY

TO VOLUNTARILY CONDUCT SCREENING LEVEL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING

ON NEARLY 3,000 HIGH PRODUCTION VOLUME (HPV) CHEMICALS OR TO MAKE EQUIVALENT

INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AN HPV CHEMICAL IS A CHEMICAL LISTED ON THE 1990

INVENTORY UPDATE RULE WITH ANNUAL U.S. CUMULATIVE PRODUCTION AND IMPORTS OF ONE

MILLION POUNDS OR MORE. THE COST TO DUPONT OF TESTING FOR HPV CHEMICALS IT MAKES

IS ESTIMATED TO BE A TOTAL OF $8 TO $10 MILLION FROM 2000-2004; FOR THE ENTIRE

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY, THE COST OF TESTING IS ESTIMATED TO BE $500 MILLION.

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE

CHANGE ADOPTED IN 1992. THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, ADOPTED IN DECEMBER 1997, IS AN

EFFORT TO ESTABLISH SHORT-TERM ACTIONS UNDER THE CONVENTION. IT IS EXPECTED THAT

2003 WILL MARK RATIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL BY ENOUGH COUNTRIES THAT IT WILL

ENTER INTO FORCE. THE UNITED STATES IS UNLIKELY TO RATIFY THE PROTOCOL AND HAS

ANNOUNCED A LESS-RESTRICTIVE CLIMATE POLICY FRAMEWORK, EMPHASIZING VOLUNTARY

ACTION. THE KYOTO PROTOCOL WOULD ESTABLISH SIGNIFICANT EMISSION REDUCTION

TARGETS FOR SIX GASES CONSIDERED TO HAVE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND WOULD

DRIVE MANDATORY REDUCTIONS IN DEVELOPED NATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

DUPONT HAS A STAKE IN A NUMBER OF THESE GASES - CO2, N2O, HFCS AND PFCS - AND

HAS BEEN REDUCING ITS EMISSIONS OF THESE GASES SINCE 1991. THE COMPANY IS WELL

AHEAD OF THE TARGET/TIMETABLE CONTEMPLATED BY THE PROTOCOL. HOWEVER, ON A GLOBAL

BASIS, THE COMPANY FACES PROSPECTS OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS WHERE MAJOR

REDUCTIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACHIEVED. DUPONT IS WORKING TO ENABLE SUCCESS OF

EMISSIONS TRADING MECHANISMS UNDER THE PROTOCOL THAT COULD AID IN SATISFYING

SUCH COUNTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. EMISSION REDUCTION MANDATES WITHIN THE

UNITED STATES ARE NOT EXPECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THOUGH CONGRESSIONAL

PROPOSALS FOR SUCH MANDATES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED.

DUPONT HAS RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT VERY LOW LEVELS OF DIOXINS (PARTS PER

TRILLION TO LOW PARTS PER BILLION) AND RELATED COMPOUNDS ARE INADVERTENTLY

GENERATED DURING ITS TITANIUM DIOXIDE PIGMENT PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE COMPANY

HAS LAUNCHED AN EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND PROCESS ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

TO

39

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE DIOXIN GENERATION AND TO IDENTIFY PROCESS

MODIFICATIONS THAT WILL ELIMINATE DIOXIN FORMATION. DUPONT HAS AGGRESSIVE GOALS

TO REDUCE SUCH DIOXIN GENERATION BY 90 PERCENT BY 2007. OVER 99 PERCENT OF THE

DIOXIN GENERATED AT DUPONT'S PRODUCTION PLANTS BECOMES ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESS

SOLID WASTES THAT ARE DISPOSED IN CONTROLLED LANDFILLS WHERE PUBLIC EXPOSURE IS

NEGLIGIBLE.

PRETAX ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS TOTALED ABOUT $480

MILLION IN 2002 COMPARED WITH $550 MILLION IN BOTH 2001 AND 2000. THESE EXPENSES

INCLUDE THE REMEDIATION ACCRUALS DISCUSSED BELOW; OPERATING, MAINTENANCE AND

DEPRECIATION COSTS FOR SOLID WASTE, AIR AND WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES;

AND THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. WHILE EXPENSES RELATED TO

THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT

OF THE COMPANY'S OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THESE COSTS

TO BECOME PROPORTIONALLY GREATER AS THE COMPANY INCREASES ITS PARTICIPATION IN

BUSINESSES FOR WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE REQUIRED DURING PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. THE LARGEST OF THESE EXPENSES IN 2002 RESULTED FROM THE OPERATION

OF WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES AND SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES FOR

ABOUT $134 MILLION AND $127 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ABOUT 79 PERCENT OF TOTAL

ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES RESULTED FROM THE OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.

REMEDIATION ACCRUALS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY

HAS BEEN INCURRED AND REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE. THESE

ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERFUND), THE

RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS. THESE LAWS

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES

AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES

WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER

OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA,

RCRA OR STATE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES THE COMPANY MAY

INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS UNDER BOTH CERCLA AND RCRA.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO

SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE

SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS). THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP

REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED AN ACCRUED LIABILITY OF $371

MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $385 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2001. CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY

EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES

THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. OF THE $371 MILLION ACCRUED

LIABILITY, APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT IS FOR NON-U.S. FACILITIES. APPROXIMATELY 73

PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION LIABILITIES, WHILE 27 PERCENT WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERCLA LIABILITIES. DURING 2002, REMEDIATION ACCRUALS OF $48

MILLION WERE ADDED TO THE RESERVE COMPARED WITH $43 MILLION IN 2001.

REMEDIATION EXPENDITURES

RCRA EXTENSIVELY REGULATES AND REQUIRES PERMITS FOR THE TREATMENT, STORAGE AND

DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. RCRA REQUIRES THAT PERMITTED FACILITIES UNDERTAKE

AN ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT THE FACILITY. IF CONDITIONS

WARRANT, COMPANIES MAY BE REQUIRED TO REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY PRIOR

OPERATIONS. AS CONTRASTED BY CERCLA, THE COSTS OF THE RCRA CORRECTIVE ACTION

PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY BORNE SOLELY BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT

SIGNIFICANT ONGOING EXPENDITURES FOR RCRA REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES MAY BE REQUIRED

OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEAR TERM, HOWEVER, ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RANGE OF SUCH EXPENDITURES

EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COMPANY'S

EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RCRA AND SIMILAR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE

APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION IN 2002, $49 MILLION IN 2001 AND $53 MILLION IN 2000.

THE COMPANY, FROM TIME TO TIME, RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION OR NOTICES OF

POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM THE EPA AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES ALLEGING THAT

THE COMPANY IS A PRP UNDER CERCLA OR SIMILAR STATE STATUTE. THE COMPANY HAS

ALSO, ON OCCASION, BEEN ENGAGED IN COST RECOVERY LITIGATION INITIATED BY THOSE

AGENCIES OR BY PRIVATE PARTIES. THESE REQUESTS, NOTICES AND LAWSUITS ASSERT

POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR REMEDIATION COSTS AT VARIOUS

40

PART II

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--CONTINUED

SITES THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT COMPANY OWNED, BUT ALLEGEDLY CONTAIN WASTES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S PAST OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

COMPANY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER CERCLA OR STATE LAWS AT

367 SITES AROUND THE UNITED STATES, WITH ACTIVE REMEDIATION UNDER WAY AT 133 OF

THESE SITES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED ITS LIABILITY AT 136 SITES,

EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN "DE

MINIMIS BUYOUTS" WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANY'S, REPRESENTED

ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED

NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT 8 NEW SITES DURING 2002 COMPARED WITH 11

SIMILAR NOTICES IN 2001 AND 13 IN 2000. IN 2002, 2 SITES WERE SETTLED BY THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH CERCLA AND SIMILAR STATE

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION IN 2002, $17 MILLION IN

2001 AND $12 MILLION IN 2000.

FOR NEARLY ALL SUPERFUND SITES, THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY WILL BE

SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TOTAL SITE REMEDIATION COSTS BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE

OF WASTE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY VERSUS THAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALL OTHER PRPS

IS RELATIVELY LOW. OTHER PRPS AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TYPICALLY

HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND, WHERE THEY DO NOT, OR

WHERE PRPS CANNOT BE LOCATED, THE COMPANY'S OWN SHARE OF LIABILITY HAS NOT

MATERIALLY INCREASED. THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW SITES WHERE THE COMPANY IS A

MAJOR PARTICIPANT, AND THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF REMEDIATION AT THOSE SITES,

AND AT ALL CERCLA SITES IN THE AGGREGATE, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE OR FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES UNDER CERCLA,

RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS WERE $62 MILLION IN 2002, $66 MILLION IN 2001 AND

$65 MILLION IN 2000.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

UNDER PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

(DERIVATIVES) IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO

THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR

PETROCHEMICAL AND PETROLEUM COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT

LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES, THIS EXPOSURE IS

MANAGED THROUGH CREDIT APPROVALS, LIMITS AND MONITORING PROCEDURES AND, TO THE

EXTENT POSSIBLE, BY RESTRICTING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH UNPAID BALANCES ARE

ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY

COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS, AND NO MATERIAL LOSS WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM

ANY SUCH NONPERFORMANCE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS

TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE

IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE ITS NET

EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY- DENOMINATED MONETARY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS

HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE

CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED. IN ADDITION, OPTION AND

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF ANTICIPATED FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN

THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO

ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS

DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A

GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE

AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS.

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED FROM TIME TO TIME TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS INTO CURRENCIES OFFERING FAVORABLE RETURNS.

41

PART II

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK--CONTINUED

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE

SWAPS AND STRUCTURED MEDIUM-TERM FINANCINGS, AS PART OF ITS PROGRAM TO MANAGE

THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST

PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON

LIBOR OR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO

MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

STRUCTURED MEDIUM-TERM FINANCINGS CONSIST OF A STRUCTURED MEDIUM-TERM NOTE AND A

CONCURRENTLY EXECUTED STRUCTURED MEDIUM-TERM SWAP WHICH, FOR ANY AND ALL

CALCULATIONS OF THE NOTE'S INTEREST AND/OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OVER THE TERM OF

THE NOTE, PROVIDE A FULLY HEDGED TRANSACTION SUCH THAT THE NOTE IS EFFECTIVELY

CONVERTED TO A U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED FIXED OR FLOATING INTEREST RATE PAYMENT.

STRUCTURED MEDIUM-TERM SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BE FULLY HEDGED AGAINST

FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES AND TO ACHIEVE U.S. DOLLAR

FIXED OR FLOATING INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS BELOW THE MARKET INTEREST RATE, AT THE

DATE OF ISSUANCE, FOR BORROWINGS OF COMPARABLE MATURITY.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW

MATERIAL PURCHASES.

A PORTION OF ENERGY FEEDSTOCK PURCHASES IS HEDGED TO REDUCE PRICE VOLATILITY

USING VARIOUS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. HEDGED COMMODITY PURCHASES INCLUDE

NATURAL GAS, ETHANE AND CYCLOHEXANE. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SALES OF ETHYLENE ARE

ALSO HEDGED.

PIONEER CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT GROWERS TO PRODUCE FINISHED SEED INVENTORY.

UNDER THESE CONTRACTS, PIONEER COMPENSATES GROWERS WITH BUSHEL EQUIVALENTS THAT

ARE MARKETED TO PIONEER FOR THE MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

FOLLOWING HARVEST. PIONEER USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS COMMODITY FUTURES

THAT HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION TO THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY

PRICE RISK INVOLVED IN COMPENSATING GROWERS.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THESE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SET FORTH IN

NOTE 28 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VALUE AT RISK

A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) ANALYSIS PROVIDES A FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE OF THE

MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE FOR A DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME ASSUMING

NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE COMPANY'S RISK

MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS WHICH PROVIDE

PROTECTION FROM VOLATILITY IN THE AREAS OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY,

AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES, AND ENERGY FEEDSTOCK COMMODITIES. THE VALUATIONS AND

RISK CALCULATIONS FOR THE VAR ANALYSIS WERE CONDUCTED USING THE COMPANY'S RISK

MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIOS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001. THE VAR ANALYSIS USED A

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TYPE MODEL WITH AN EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED COVARIANCE

MATRIX, AND EMPLOYED 3,000 PSEUDO-RANDOM MARKET PATHS INCLUDING ALL RISK FACTORS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIOS. THE CALCULATIONS WERE CONDUCTED OVER A 20 BUSINESS DAY PERIOD AT A

95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE DETAILS THE RESULTS OF THE VAR ANALYSIS FOR EACH SIGNIFICANT

RISK MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO AT THE END OF BOTH 2002 AND 2001.

================================================================================

THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE VAR MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSS WHEN EACH RISK

MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO IS VALUED INDIVIDUALLY. VAR FOR THE ENTIRE RISK MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO IS A LOSS OF $80 MILLION FOR 2002 AND A LOSS OF $41 MILLION FOR 2001;

THESE VALUES REFLECT THE DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS AND COVARIANCE CORRELATION OF

THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO. CHANGE IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY VAR IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001

REFLECTS HIGHER VOLATILITIES AND A LARGER PORTFOLIO. THE VAR MODEL RESULTS ARE

ONLY AN ESTIMATE AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO FORECAST ACTUAL LOSSES THAT MAY BE

INCURRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

SINCE THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, THE POTENTIAL

LOSS IN VALUE FOR EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD BE

LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ARE CONSIDERED BY

MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS THAT

ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE AS TO THE PROTECTION OF ASSETS AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR

DISPOSITION, AND THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL RECORDS FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS

ETHICS POLICY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM. THIS POLICY

SETS FORTH MANAGEMENT'S COMMITMENT TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WORLDWIDE WITH THE

HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS AND IN CONFORMITY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. THE BUSINESS

ETHICS POLICY ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE DOCUMENTS SUPPORTING ALL TRANSACTIONS

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THEIR TRUE NATURE AND THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS BE PROPERLY

REPORTED AND CLASSIFIED IN THE FINANCIAL RECORDS. THE SYSTEM IS MONITORED BY AN

EXTENSIVE PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDIT, AND MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROLS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, MEETS THE OBJECTIVES NOTED ABOVE.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT

ACCOUNTANTS, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO

INDEPENDENTLY AFFIRM THE FAIRNESS OF MANAGEMENT'S REPORTING OF FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. TO EXPRESS THE OPINION SET FORTH

IN THEIR REPORT, THEY STUDY AND EVALUATE THE INTERNAL CONTROLS TO THE EXTENT

THEY DEEM NECESSARY. THEIR REPORT IS SHOWN ON THIS PAGE. THE ADEQUACY OF THE

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROLS AND THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES EMPLOYED IN FINANCIAL

REPORTING ARE UNDER THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS. THIS COMMITTEE ALSO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYING THE INDEPENDENT

ACCOUNTANTS, SUBJECT TO STOCKHOLDER RATIFICATION. NO MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE

MAY BE AN OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY OR AFFILIATED

COMPANY. THE INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE DIRECT

ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, AND THEY MEET WITH THE COMMITTEE FROM TIME TO

TIME, WITH AND WITHOUT MANAGEMENT PRESENT, TO DISCUSS ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS.

INDEX PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I.

DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001, AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT; OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON

OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DUPONT FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT FOLLOW,

ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED NOT YET ADOPTED

IN 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 143, "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS." SFAS NO. 143 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2002. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 143

ON JANUARY 1, 2003. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 143 REQUIRE COMPANIES TO RECORD

AN ASSET AND RELATED LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A

LONG-LIVED TANGIBLE ASSET IF A LEGAL LIABILITY TO RETIRE THE ASSET EXISTS. BASED

ON THE COMPANY'S EVALUATION TO DATE, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 IS EXPECTED TO

RESULT IN A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $.03 PER SHARE THAT WILL BE REPORTED AS THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE.

IN 2002, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION (FIN) NO. 45, "GUARANTOR'S ACCOUNTING

AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF

INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS." THE INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF

FIN NO. 45 APPLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2002. AS REQUIRED, THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERPRETATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 (SEE NOTE 23). THE

COMPANY WILL APPLY THE INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. THE INTERPRETATION MODIFIES

EXISTING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST GUARANTEES AND REQUIRES THAT AT THE

TIME A COMPANY ISSUES A GUARANTEE, THE COMPANY MUST RECOGNIZE AN INITIAL

LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION IT ASSUMES UNDER THAT GUARANTEE.

THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

PROVISIONS OF THE INTERPRETATION AND ABSENT ANY UNFORESEEN EVENTS, MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THESE PROVISIONS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN NO. 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES" (VIES), WHICH IS AN INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH

BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 51, "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS." FIN NO. 46 ADDRESSES

THE APPLICATION OF ARB NO. 51 TO VIES, AND GENERALLY WOULD REQUIRE THAT ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, AND RESULTS OF THE ACTIVITY OF A VIE BE CONSOLIDATED INTO THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE THAT IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THREE VIES WITHIN THE

FINANCING STRUCTURES FOR ITS SYNTHETIC LEASE PROGRAMS. THESE ENTITIES SERVE AS

THE OWNER/LESSORS AND DEBT HOLDERS OF THE ASSETS IN THE PROGRAMS. THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS

UNDER THESE PROGRAMS WERE APPROXIMATELY $330 AND THE FAIR VALUES OF THE

ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES AND NONCONTOLLING INTERESTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $331.

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES UNDER THESE PROGRAMS WERE $277 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE PROVISIONS OF FIN NO. 46. IN

RESPONSE TO THIS INTERPRETATION, THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL OPTIONS

INCLUDING: (1) CONSOLIDATING THE VIES INTO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

(2) PURCHASING SELECTED ASSETS FROM THE VIES, OR (3) FINDING ALTERNATIVE

FINANCING SOURCES. NONE OF THESE OPTIONS IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND

ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED. FOR THOSE

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100

PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS MINORITY INTERESTS.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT

NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY BASIS. THIS INCLUDES

MAJORITY-OWNED ENTITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSOLIDATE BECAUSE A

MINORITY INVESTOR HOLDS SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. INVESTMENTS IN

AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COST METHOD.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THIS

GENERALLY OCCURS WHEN PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER IN ACCORDANCE WITH

TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED,

COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, AND PRICING IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE.

ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S

EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN

SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS SOLD AT THE TIME

REVENUE IS RECORDED. ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON

TERMS,

F-6

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE,

AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

AFFILIATE AND SUBSIDIARY STOCK TRANSACTIONS

GAINS OR LOSSES ARISING FROM ISSUANCES BY AN AFFILIATE OR A SUBSIDIARY OF ITS

OWN STOCK ARE RECORDED AS NONOPERATING ITEMS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS

FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH

APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES

MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES REPRESENTS INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND FLOATING RATE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF

PURCHASE. THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND RECORDED AT AMORTIZED

COST.

OTHER ASSETS INCLUDES LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES, WHICH COMPRISES

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH

MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED

ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY UNTIL

SOLD. AT THE TIME OF SALE, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES CALCULATED BY THE SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION METHOD ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME. LOSSES ARE ALSO RECOGNIZED

IN INCOME WHEN A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY.

OTHER SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET VALUES ARE NOT READILY

AVAILABLE ARE CARRIED AT COST. SEE NOTE 16.

INVENTORIES

EXCEPT FOR PIONEER INVENTORIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT

COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD; IN THE AGGREGATE,

SUCH VALUATIONS ARE NOT IN EXCESS OF MARKET. FOR PIONEER, INVENTORIES ARE VALUED

AT THE LOWER OF COST, AS DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD, OR

MARKET.

ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT LABOR, AND

MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR MARKET,

WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E;) IS CARRIED AT COST AND IS DEPRECIATED USING

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PP&E; PLACED IN SERVICE PRIOR TO 1995 IS DEPRECIATED

UNDER THE SUM-OF-THE-YEARS' DIGITS METHOD OR OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

METHODS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL

LIVES RANGING FROM 15 TO 25 YEARS. CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER

SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 5 TO 7

YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF,

THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED

FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS

ARE CAPITALIZED. IN SITUATIONS WHERE MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNED AT

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, THE COMPANY ACCRUES IN ADVANCE THE COSTS EXPECTED TO

BE INCURRED. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS FOR MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES

HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ON JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS." THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED. IN ADDITION, GOODWILL AND

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

THESE TESTS WILL BE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY IF THERE ARE TRIGGERING EVENTS.

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AFTER INITIAL ADOPTION WILL BE RECORDED AS A PART OF INCOME

FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS, AND

TRADEMARKS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR

PERIODS RANGING FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE

REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND

USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT

BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED

WHEN THE TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH ASSET ARE SEPARATELY

IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED

F-7

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

ASSET. FAIR MARKET VALUE IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS

DISCOUNTED AT A RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK INVOLVED. LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF ARE DETERMINED IN A SIMILAR MANNER, EXCEPT THAT FAIR

MARKET VALUES ARE REDUCED FOR DISPOSAL COSTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN

BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD

PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE

OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN

WHICH CASE, THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMISSABLE BY LAW OR REGULATION,

INCLUDING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, VEHICLE LIABILITY, AND EMPLOYEE RELATED

BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY

CONSIDERING HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, AND OTHER

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF

INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF RELEVANT

RISKS.

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY

APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES

REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED

AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR PLUS

THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED TAXES RESULT FROM

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES

ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES

AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE

PERMANENTLY INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD).

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF MOST OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE

OPERATIONS. FOR SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY,

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123, AS AMENDED, PROSPECTIVELY FOR ALL NEW AWARDS GRANTED

TO EMPLOYEES AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003.

HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUES.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET ON THE INCOME

STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE

IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS CLEARED

TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS.

THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT OR AN

ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED

TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED

IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION MATURES,

OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE

DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DERIVATIVE THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, AND THE DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED AS FOR

TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER LIKELY TO OCCUR.

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS, THE COMPANY REPORTS THE CASH FLOWS

RESULTING FROM ITS HEDGING ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE RELATED ITEM

THAT IS BEING HEDGED.

SEE NOTE 28 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES AND

STRATEGIES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEARS' DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO 2002

CLASSIFICATIONS.

THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE FACILITIES OF $15 AND ESTIMATED DISMANTLEMENT AND

REMOVAL COSTS LESS ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT AND SCRAP OF

$9. THE EFFECT OF THIS SHUTDOWN ON OPERATING RESULTS WAS NOT MATERIAL. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2001, ABOUT $9 HAD BEEN SETTLED AND CHARGED AGAINST THE LIABILITY

FOR DISMANTLEMENT AND REMOVAL, THEREBY COMPLETING THESE ACTIVITIES. THE

REMAINING RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $4 RELATES TO EMPLOYEE TERMINATION PAYMENTS TO

BE SETTLED OVER TIME FOR APPROXIMATELY 65 EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN MANUFACTURING

AND TECHNICAL ACTIVITIES. AS OF MARCH 31, 2001, ESSENTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES HAD

BEEN TERMINATED, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, ABOUT $4 IN EMPLOYEE TERMINATION

PAYMENTS HAD BEEN SETTLED AND CHARGED AGAINST THE RELATED LIABILITY, THEREBY

COMPLETING THE PROGRAM.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

DURING 1999 AND 1998, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED ACTIVITIES INVOLVING EMPLOYEE

TERMINATIONS AND WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS. FOR THE 1999 ACTIVITIES, A NET BENEFIT OF

$11 WAS RECORDED IN 2000 AND AN ADDITIONAL NET BENEFIT OF $7 WAS RECORDED IN

AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN IN 2001 OF

$6,136 ($3,866 AFTER-TAX), WHICH INCLUDED CHARGES THAT WERE A DIRECT RESULT OF

CASH PROCEEDS OF $104. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN DUPONT PHOTOMASKS WAS REDUCED FROM APPROXIMATELY 38.5 PERCENT TO

35.3 PERCENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $29 THAT REPRESENTS THE

INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN DUPONT PHOTOMASKS WHICH RESULTED

FROM THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK AT A PRICE IN EXCESS OF BOOK VALUE. THE COMPANY

PROVIDED FOR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION. DURING 2001,

THE COMPANY FURTHER REDUCED ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN DUPONT PHOTOMASKS TO ABOUT

20 PERCENT.

UNDER THE TAX LAWS OF VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES,

DEDUCTIONS OR CREDITS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY UTILIZED FOR TAX PURPOSES DURING THE

CURRENT YEAR MAY BE CARRIED FORWARD, SUBJECT TO STATUTORY LIMITATIONS, TO REDUCE

TAXABLE INCOME OR TAXES PAYABLE IN A FUTURE YEAR. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE TAX

EXPIRATION DATE, $14 EXPIRES AFTER 2002 BUT BEFORE THE END OF 2007, AND $221

EXPIRES AFTER 2007.

9.   CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

ON JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS," WHICH REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED. IN ADDITION, AN INITIAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, NEEDED TO

BE PERFORMED. THEREAFTER, IMPAIRMENT TESTS MUST BE PERFORMED ANNUALLY OR MORE

FREQUENTLY IF THERE ARE TRIGGERING EVENTS. IF THE INITIAL TEST RESULTED IN

IMPAIRMENT, AN ADJUSTMENT WAS TO BE RECORDED IN NET INCOME AS A CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE (NET OF TAX). IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AFTER

THE INITIAL ADOPTION IMPAIRMENT ARE TO BE RECORDED AS PART OF INCOME FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS INITIAL REVIEW OF

GOODWILL AND RECORDED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

CHARGE OF $2,944, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

GOODWILL. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION ACCOUNTS FOR $2,866 OF THIS NONCASH IMPAIRMENT

LOSS, AND TEXTILES & INTERIORS ACCOUNTS FOR THE REMAINING $78. AS THERE IS NO

TAX BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHARGE (GOODWILL AROSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ACQUISITION OF STOCK VERSUS A PURCHASE OF ASSETS), BOTH THE PRETAX AND AFTER-TAX

AMOUNTS ARE THE SAME.

F-15

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

A VARIETY OF FAIR VALUATION METHODS WERE USED IN MEASURING FOR IMPAIRMENT,

INCLUDING DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW AND COMPARABLE COMPANY MULTIPLES OF REVENUES

AND EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION). THE

PRIMARY FACTORS THAT RESULTED IN THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN AGRICULTURE &

NUTRITION WERE THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR,

SLOWER THAN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT OF AND ACCESS TO TRAITS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY,

AND A SLOWER THAN EXPECTED RATE OF ACCEPTANCE BY THE PUBLIC OF NEW AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY. WHILE THE ORIGINAL STRATEGIC INTENT OF THE

TEXTILES & INTERIORS COMMERCIAL FLOORING BUSINESS HAS NOT CHANGED, THE

REALIZATION OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN LIMITED BY POOR

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE SECTOR, AND LOWER

THAN EXPECTED MARGINS IN THE COMPETITIVE DISTRIBUTION MARKET. THESE FACTORS

CONTRIBUTED TO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN THIS SEGMENT. NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS

APPROPRIATE FOR EITHER OF THESE BUSINESSES UNDER THE FASB'S PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT

STANDARD, WHICH WAS BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2001, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS AMENDED. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133

RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE BENEFIT OF

$19 ($11 AFTER-TAX). THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF THIS GAIN IS RELATED TO THE

COMPANY'S POSITION IN CERTAIN STOCK WARRANTS, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED

FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE HAD BEEN

REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). THE COMPANY ALSO

RECORDED A PRETAX INCREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) OF

$10 ($6 AFTER-TAX). THE INCREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS) IS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNREALIZED GAINS IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY HEDGING

PROGRAMS.

10.  EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON

STOCKHOLDERS (THE NUMERATOR) BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

(THE DENOMINATOR) FOR THE PERIOD. NET INCOME (LOSS) IS ADJUSTED BY PREFERRED

DIVIDENDS OF $10 IN 2002, 2001, AND 2000 IN REACHING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON

STOCKHOLDERS. FOR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, THE NUMERATOR IS ADJUSTED TO

RECOGNIZE REDUCED SHARE OF EARNINGS ASSUMING OPTIONS IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANY STOCK

ARE EXERCISED, IF THE EFFECT OF THIS ADJUSTMENT IS DILUTIVE. THE DENOMINATOR IS

BASED ON THE FOLLOWING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES AND INCLUDES THE

ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF POTENTIALLY

DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES HAD BEEN ISSUED.

================================================================================

AVERAGE STOCK OPTIONS OF 53,988,901, 41,302,525 AND 29,814,855 ARE ANTIDILUTIVE

AS THE EXERCISE PRICE IS GREATER THAN THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE FOR THE PERIOD

AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION

FOR THE YEARS 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

TREASURY STOCK AND SHARES HELD BY THE FLEXITRUST ARE NOT CONSIDERED AS

OUTSTANDING IN COMPUTING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES. DURING

2001, SHARES IN THE FLEXITRUST WERE DEPLETED AND THE TRUST ARRANGEMENT WAS

TERMINATED.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IN 2002, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT

FINANCING PROGRAM TO REDUCE THE FINANCING COSTS OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

SECURITIZATION PROGRAM BY GAINING DIRECT ACCESS TO THE ASSET BACKED COMMERCIAL

PAPER MARKET. AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED, THE COMPANY SELLS CERTAIN TRADE

RECEIVABLES ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO A CONSOLIDATED COMPANY, WHICH IN TURN

SELLS AN INTEREST IN THOSE RECEIVABLES TO A QUALIFIED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY.

THIS ENTITY THEN SELLS THE INTEREST IT PURCHASED IN THOSE RECEIVABLES TO THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT. THE REVOLVING BALANCE UNDER THIS PROGRAM TOTALED $445

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND $468 AT DECEMBER 31, 2001. EXPENSES INCURRED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM TOTALED $10, $27

AND $16 IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.

MISCELLANEOUS RECEIVABLES INCLUDE AN OVERCOLLATERALIZATION OF $214 AND $130 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, PROVIDED FOR UNDER TERMS OF THE

PROGRAM.

2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, AND $211 FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS,

AND ARE NOT REDUCED BY NONCANCELABLE MINIMUM SUBLEASE RENTALS DUE IN THE FUTURE

IN THE AMOUNT OF $19. NET RENTAL EXPENSE UNDER OPERATING LEASES WAS $247 IN

2002, $233 IN 2001, AND $221 IN 2000.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 11)

IN 2000, THE COMPANY INITIATED AN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM TO

SELL AN INTEREST IN A REVOLVING POOL OF TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IN 2002, THE

COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT FINANCING PROGRAM TO REDUCE THE

FINANCING COSTS OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION

PROGRAM BY GAINING DIRECT ACCESS TO THE ASSET BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. AS

CURRENTLY STRUCTURED, THE COMPANY SELLS CERTAIN TRADE RECEIVABLES ON A

NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO A CONSOLIDATED COMPANY, WHICH IN TURN SELLS AN INTEREST IN

THOSE RECEIVABLES TO A QUALIFIED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (QSPE). THE QSPE THEN

SELLS THE INTEREST IT PURCHASED IN THOSE RECEIVABLES TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

CONDUIT. THE CONDUIT ISSUES NOTES SECURED BY THAT INTEREST TO THIRD PARTY

INVESTORS. THESE NOTES ARE BACKED BY A 364-DAY LIQUIDITY SUPPORT AGREEMENT. THE

COMPANY WAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE UP TO 25 PERCENT OR $128 OF THIS LIQUIDITY

SUPPORT AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD NO

LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL

COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS INCLUDE ACTIONS BASED ON ALLEGED

EXPOSURES TO PRODUCTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS; AND

CONTRACT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS. THE ULTIMATE EFFECT ON FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS

IS

F-23

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

NOT SUBJECT TO REASONABLE ESTIMATION BECAUSE CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AS

TO THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS IN THE OPINION OF COMPANY

COUNSEL. HOWEVER, WHILE THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.

BENLATE(R)

IN 1991, DUPONT BEGAN RECEIVING CLAIMS BY GROWERS THAT USE OF BENLATE(R) 50 DF

FUNGICIDE HAD CAUSED CROP DAMAGE. AS INDICATED IN THE TABLE BELOW, DUPONT HAS

SINCE BEEN SERVED WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED LAWSUITS, MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

DISPOSED OF THROUGH TRIAL, DISMISSAL OR SETTLEMENT.

================================================================================

TWENTY OF THE 104 CASES PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WERE

FILED BY GROWERS WHO ALLEGE PLANT DAMAGE FROM USING BENLATE(R) 50 DF AND, IN

SOME CASES, BENLATE(R) WP. FIFTY OF THE PENDING CASES SEEK TO REOPEN SETTLEMENTS

WITH THE COMPANY BY ALLEGING THAT THE COMPANY COMMITTED FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT, AS

WELL AS VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE RACKETEERING LAWS. FIVE OF THE PENDING

CASES INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES ARISING FROM EXPOSURE TO

BENLATE(R) 50 DF AND/OR BENLATE(R) WP. TWENTY-EIGHT OF THE PENDING CASES INCLUDE

CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED DAMAGE TO SHRIMPING OPERATIONS FROM BENLATE(R) OD. FINALLY,

ONE OF THE CASES PENDING IS A SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION.

IN AUGUST 2001, A FLORIDA JURY FOUND DUPONT LIABLE UNDER FLORIDA'S RACKETEERING

STATUTE AND FOR PRODUCT DEFECT INVOLVING ALLEGED CROP DAMAGE. IN MARCH 2002,

PURSUANT TO DUPONT'S MOTION, THE JUDGE WITHDREW THE JURY'S FINDING OF LIABILITY

UNDER THE RACKETEERING STATUTE AND ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

APPROXIMATE AMOUNT OF $29. THE JUDGMENT WAS LATER REDUCED TO $26; DUPONT HAS

APPEALED. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE ADVERSE

JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE WILL ULTIMATELY BE UPHELD; THEREFORE, DUPONT HAS NOT

ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR THIS MATTER. THE REMAINING CROP CASES ARE IN VARIOUS

STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, PRINCIPALLY IN TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS IN FLORIDA.

CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS WHO PREVIOUSLY SETTLED WITH THE COMPANY SEEK TO REOPEN THEIR

SETTLEMENTS THROUGH CASES ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER MISCONDUCT RELATING TO THE

LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT OF THEIR BENLATE(R) 50 DF CLAIMS. IN JANUARY 2003, THE

COMPANY SETTLED NINE CASES, INVOLVING TWENTY PLAINTIFFS, THAT HAD BEEN PENDING

IN STATE COURT IN FLORIDA (THE TABLE ABOVE DOES NOT REFLECT THESE SETTLEMENTS).

THESE CASES ALLEGED THAT THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL HAD COMMITTED FRAUD AND

MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THESE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS IN

1996. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BY SETTLING THESE LAWSUITS, IT HAS RESOLVED THE

MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE REOPENER CASES THAT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED CLAIMS FOR

PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN THE REOPENER CASES STILL PENDING AFTER JANUARY 2003, THE

FLORIDA FEDERAL COURT DISMISSED THE LEAD CASE OF THE TWENTY-EIGHT REOPENER CASES

PENDING BEFORE IT. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED. THIRTEEN OTHER REOPENER CASES ARE

IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT IN TRIAL AND APPELLATE COURTS IN FLORIDA AND

HAWAII.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY FIVE CASES INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS THAT BENLATE(R) CAUSED

BIRTH DEFECTS TO CHILDREN EXPOSED IN UTERO. ONE CASE WAS TRIED IN FLORIDA, WHICH

RESULTED IN A VERDICT OF $4 AGAINST DUPONT. THE VERDICT WAS REVERSED AT THE

INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE LEVEL BECAUSE THE PLAINTIFFS' SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR

CAUSATION WAS INSUFFICIENT. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED TO THE FLORIDA SUPREME

COURT. THE FEDERAL COURT IN WEST VIRGINIA DISMISSED ANOTHER CASE ON THE SAME

GROUNDS OF INSUFFICIENT SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR CAUSATION. IT HAS BEEN APPEALED

TO THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. SIX OF THE EIGHT PLAINTIFFS IN THE

REMAINING THREE CASES WERE DISMISSED AS THEIR CASES WERE NOT TIMELY FILED. TWO

OF THESE CASES HAVE BEEN APPEALED TO THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT. THE REMAINING

CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN DELAWARE IN JUNE 2003.

THE TWENTY-EIGHT CASES INVOLVING DAMAGE TO SHRIMP ARE PENDING AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN STATE COURT IN BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA. THESE CASES WERE BROUGHT BY

ECUADORIAN SHRIMP FARMERS WHO ALLEGE THAT BENLATE(R) OD THAT WAS APPLIED TO

BANANA PLANTATIONS IN ECUADOR RAN-OFF AND WAS DEPOSITED IN THE PLAINTIFFS'

SHRIMP FARMS, CAUSING MASSIVE NUMBERS OF SHRIMP TO DIE. TWO CASES WERE TRIED IN

THE FALL OF 2000 AND IN EARLY 2001, WHICH RESULTED IN ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $14 IN EACH CASE. DUPONT CONTENDS THAT THE INJURIES ALLEGED ARE

ATTRIBUTABLE TO A VIRUS, TAURA SYNDROME VIRUS, AND IN NO WAY INVOLVE BENLATE(R)

OD. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED BOTH CASES. DUPONT HAS NOT ESTABLISHED AN ACCRUAL

FOR EITHER CASE BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT

THE ADVERSE JUDGMENTS ULTIMATELY WILL

F-24

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

BE UPHELD. THE TWENTY-SIX UNTRIED CASES ARE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF

THE APPEAL OF THE CASE TRIED IN THE FALL OF 2000. ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THIS APPEAL

TOOK PLACE AT THE INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT IN OCTOBER 2002.

A SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION WAS FILED IN SEPTEMBER 1995 BY A SHAREHOLDER IN

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN FLORIDA AGAINST THE COMPANY AND THE THEN-CHAIRMAN.

THIS ACTION IS STILL PENDING. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE ALLEGE THAT DUPONT

MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS ABOUT BENLATE(R) 50 DF, WITH

THE ALLEGED EFFECT OF INFLATING THE PRICE OF DUPONT'S STOCK BETWEEN JUNE 19,

1993, AND JANUARY 27, 1995. THE DISTRICT COURT HAS CERTIFIED THE CASE AS A CLASS

ACTION. DISCOVERY HAS CONCLUDED. TRIAL IS SET FOR JUNE 2003.

DUPONT BELIEVES THAT BENLATE(R) DID NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGES ALLEGED IN THESE CASES

AND DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD AND MISCONDUCT. DUPONT CONTINUES TO DEFEND

ITSELF IN ONGOING MATTERS. TO DATE, DUPONT HAS INCURRED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF

APPROXIMATELY $1,700 ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MATTERS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $200

HAS BEEN RECOVERED THROUGH INSURANCE. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED RESERVES IN

ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO COVER ESTIMATED FUTURE COSTS. DURING FOURTH QUARTER

2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $80 TO INCREASE ITS LITIGATION RESERVES

FOR BENLATE(R). WHILE MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT

ADDITIONAL LOSSES MAY BE INCURRED, A RANGE OF SUCH LOSSES CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO

CORRECT THE EFFECTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR RELEASES

OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY

ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET

FORTH IN NOTE 1. MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED

TO AS SUPERFUND), THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA), AND SIMILAR

STATE LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE

AND REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED

OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED. THE ACCRUAL

ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE

COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE

REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF CERCLA, RCRA OR STATE

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO

SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE

SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY

AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED AN ACCRUED LIABILITY OF $371 RELATING TO

THESE MATTERS AND, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, WAS APPROPRIATE BASED ON EXISTING

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE

COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE

UP TO TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE AVERAGE TIME FRAME OVER WHICH THE ACCRUED OR PRESENTLY UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS

MAY BE PAID OUT, BASED ON PAST HISTORY, IS ESTIMATED TO BE 15-20 YEARS.

OTHER

IN JUNE, 1997, DUPONT ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS WITH COMPUTER SCIENCES CORPORATION

(CSC) AND ACCENTURE LLP. CSC OPERATES A MAJORITY OF DUPONT'S GLOBAL INFORMATION

SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDES SELECTED APPLICATIONS AND

SOFTWARE SERVICES. ACCENTURE PROVIDES ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SOLUTIONS

DESIGNED TO ENHANCE DUPONT'S MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER

SERVICE. THE TOTAL DOLLAR VALUE REMAINING UNDER THE CONTRACTS IS $613. MINIMUM

PAYMENTS DUE UNDER THE CONTRACTS ARE: $145, $141, $137, $134 AND $56 FOR THE

YEARS 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS FOR MATERIALS, SUPPLIES, AND ITEMS

OF PERMANENT INVESTMENT INCIDENT TO THE ORDINARY CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. IN THE

AGGREGATE, SUCH COMMITMENTS ARE NOT AT PRICES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT MARKET.

24.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

IN 1998, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A PROGRAM TO PURCHASE AND

RETIRE UP TO 20 MILLION SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK TO OFFSET DILUTION FROM

SHARES ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN JULY 2000, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES REMAINING TO BE PURCHASED

UNDER THE 1998 PROGRAM FROM ABOUT 16 MILLION SHARES TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK THAT COULD

F-25

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

BE PURCHASED FOR $2,500. THESE PURCHASES WERE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE NEEDED TO

OFFSET DILUTION FROM SHARES ISSUED UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. IN 2002, THE

COMPANY COMPLETED THE 1998 PROGRAM, PURCHASING 10.8 MILLION SHARES FOR $470. IN

ADDITION, 43 MILLION SHARES WERE PURCHASED FOR $1,818 IN 2001 AND 9.5 MILLION

SHARES FOR $462 IN 2000. OF THE $462 PURCHASED IN 2000, $212 APPLIES TO THE

$2,500 UPDATED PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $2,000 SHARE BUYBACK PLAN IN

JUNE 2001. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, NO SHARES WERE PURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL INCLUDES $61 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RELATED TO AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR VARIABLE OPTIONS. SHARES HELD BY THE FLEXITRUST

WERE USED TO SATISFY EXISTING EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS. DURING

2001, SHARES IN THE FLEXITRUST WERE DEPLETED AND THE TRUST ARRANGEMENT WAS

TERMINATED.

SET FORTH BELOW IS A RECONCILIATION OF COMMON STOCK SHARE ACTIVITY FOR THE THREE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002.

25.  COMPENSATION PLANS

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE ADOPTION OF WORLDWIDE

CORPORATE SHARING PROGRAMS. UNDER THESE PROGRAMS, ESSENTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES HAVE

RECEIVED A ONE-TIME GRANT TO ACQUIRE SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK AT

F-26

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

DECEMBER 31, 2002

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTION TERMS ARE "FIXED" AND OPTIONS ARE

GENERALLY EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR AFTER DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE

OF GRANT. IN JANUARY 2002, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A 2002 BICENTENNIAL

CORPORATE SHARING PROGRAM AND AWARDED, TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, A ONE-TIME

"FIXED AND DETERMINABLE" GRANT TO ACQUIRE 200 SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK AT

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT ($44.50 PER SHARE). DURING ALL BUT

THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF THE TEN-YEAR OPTION TERM, THESE OPTIONS CANNOT BE

EXERCISED UNTIL A MARKET PRICE OF $53.40 PER SHARE OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK IS

ACHIEVED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL

SHARES THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO OPTION UNDER EXISTING PROGRAMS.

STOCK OPTION AWARDS UNDER THE DUPONT STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN MAY BE GRANTED TO

KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND MAY BE "FIXED" AND/OR "VARIABLE." THE PURCHASE

PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF THE MARKET PRICE

OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONEES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RELOAD

OPTIONS UPON THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS WITH THE CONDITION THAT SHARES

RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE ARE HELD FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. A RELOAD OPTION IS

GRANTED AT THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAS A TERM EQUAL TO THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE ORIGINAL OPTION. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RELOAD OPTIONS

GRANTED IS LIMITED TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IN THE ORIGINAL

OPTION TIMES THE ORIGINAL OPTION PRICE DIVIDED BY THE OPTION PRICE OF THE RELOAD

OPTION. GENERALLY, FIXED OPTIONS ARE FULLY EXERCISABLE FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS

AFTER DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING IN 1998,

SHARES OTHERWISE RECEIVABLE FROM THE EXERCISE OF NONQUALIFIED OPTIONS CAN BE

DEFERRED AS STOCK UNITS FOR A DESIGNATED FUTURE DELIVERY.

VARIABLE STOCK OPTION GRANTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CERTAIN MEMBERS OF SENIOR

MANAGEMENT. THESE OPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IF, WITHIN FIVE YEARS FROM

THE DATE OF GRANT, THE MARKET PRICE OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK DOES NOT ACHIEVE A

PRICE OF $75 PER SHARE FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE OPTIONS AND $90 PER SHARE FOR THE

REMAINING 50 PERCENT. THIS CONDITION WAS MET IN 1998 FOR OPTIONS WITH A $75 PER

SHARE HURDLE PRICE AND, AS A RESULT, THESE OPTIONS BECAME "FIXED" AND

EXERCISABLE. THIS CONDITION WAS NEVER MET FOR THE OPTIONS WITH A $90 PER SHARE

HURDLE PRICE AND, AS A RESULT, THESE OPTIONS WERE FORFEITED IN JANUARY 2002.

THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO OPTION FOR ANY CONSECUTIVE

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD IS 72 MILLION SHARES. SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT, ADDITIONAL SHARES

THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE SUBJECT TO OPTIONS WERE 31,243,286 FOR 2002, 40,458,505

FOR 2001 AND 45,583,953 FOR 2000.

UNDER THE DUPONT STOCK PERFORMANCE PLAN, AWARDS GRANTED TO KEY EMPLOYEES IN 2003

CONSISTED OF 10,285,250 FIXED OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE DUPONT COMMON STOCK AT THE

MARKET PRICE ($37.75 PER SHARE) ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THESE OPTIONS VEST OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND, EXCEPT FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF THE 10-YEAR OPTION

TERM, ARE EXERCISABLE WHEN THE MARKET PRICE OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK EXCEEDS THE

OPTION GRANT PRICE BY 20 PERCENT.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH COVER

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE SAVINGS AND

INVESTMENT PLAN (THE PLAN). THIS PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP,

AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN

IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT SAVINGS BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO

PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN

IS A TAX QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF

THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 50

PERCENT OF THE FIRST 6 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION ELECTION. THE

COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN WERE $58, $61 AND $61 FOR YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTIONS VEST

100 PERCENT UPON CONTRIBUTION.

28.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

UNDER PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

(DERIVATIVES) IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. THE FRAMEWORK HAS

ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF APPROVED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE UTILIZED IN EACH

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS VARYING LEVELS OF EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME

HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS RELATED TO EACH HEDGING PROGRAM.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UTILIZED DURING THE PERIOD INCLUDE FORWARDS, OPTIONS,

FUTURES AND SWAPS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS.

F-31

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

THE FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH SENIOR MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES THROUGH A CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY.

IN ADDITION, IT ESTABLISHES OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES AND RISK MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

THAT AUTHORIZE THE USE OF SPECIFIC DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FURTHER

ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL,

AND ROUTINE MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR PETROCHEMICAL AND

PETROLEUM COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF

NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY MANAGES THIS EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT LOSS THROUGH THE AFOREMENTIONED CREDIT APPROVALS, LIMITS, AND MONITORING

PROCEDURES AND, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, BY RESTRICTING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH

UNPAID BALANCES ARE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS, AND NO MATERIAL LOSS WOULD

BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH NONPERFORMANCE. MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF

INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE

INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ALLOW THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING

RATE DEBT. ALL INTEREST RATE SWAPS QUALIFY FOR THE SHORTCUT METHOD OF HEDGE

ACCOUNTING, THUS THERE IS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THESE HEDGES. CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK ARE RECORDED IN

INTEREST EXPENSE EACH PERIOD. THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE

RELATED DEBT ARE ALSO RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NO

OTHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NUMBER OF CASH FLOW HEDGING PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RISKS

RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAMS

INVOLVE HEDGING A PORTION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES AND MAJOR RAW

MATERIAL PURCHASES FROM VENDORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. COMMODITY PRICE

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON

PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS NATURAL GAS, ETHANE, ETHYLENE, CORN, CYCLOHEXANE,

SOYBEANS, AND SOYBEAN MEAL. WHILE EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT

TIME HORIZON, MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR

PERIOD. ONE EXCEPTION IS AN INVENTORY PURCHASE PROGRAM WITH CURRENCY RISK, WHICH

HAS BEEN PARTIALLY HEDGED THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006.

HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES ARE REPORTED ON THE NET SALES

LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT, AND THE EFFECTS OF HEDGES OF

INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER

OPERATING CHARGES.

CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN

WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER

IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT MATERIALIZE. CASH FLOW

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR 2002 IS A PRETAX GAIN OF $1.

DURING 2002, THERE WERE NO PRETAX GAINS (LOSSES) EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF

HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS. THE AMOUNT RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS FOR FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS THAT DID NOT OCCUR WAS NOT MATERIAL. ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ACTIVITY DURING 2002 CONSISTS OF A BEGINNING BALANCE

OF $(26). REVALUATION OF CASH FLOW HEDGES OF $(14), AND CLEARANCE OF CASH FLOW

HEDGE RESULTS TO EARNINGS OF $7 DURING THE PERIOD YIELDED AN ENDING BALANCE OF

$(33). THE PORTION OF THE ENDING BALANCE OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT 12

MONTHS IS $(27).

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAS NOT MAINTAINED ANY

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY

CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE

ACCOUNTING. HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE

ASSOCIATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTS

IN A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES. SEVERAL SMALL EQUITY AFFILIATES HAVE

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, MAINLY IN THE AREA OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, FOR

WHICH THEY HAVE ELECTED NOT TO PURSUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING. IN ADDITION, PIONEER

MAINTAINS SMALL RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR COMMODITIES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR

HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALSO, THE COMPANY OWNS STOCK WARRANTS IN A FEW

COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES.

CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE ITS NET

EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS

OPERATIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE DESIGNATED

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS

TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED

TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.

OPTION AND FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ROUTINELY USED TO OFFSET A PORTION OF

THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE OBJECTIVE

OF THIS HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO

CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH

WITH CERTAINTY THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS

DENOMINATED IN ANOTHER CURRENCY. DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A

GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE

AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY, AND ECONOMIC TRENDS.

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED FROM TIME TO TIME TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO PLACE FOREIGN CURRENCY DEPOSITS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS INTO CURRENCIES OFFERING FAVORABLE RETURNS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS PART OF ITS PROGRAM TO MANAGE

THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF

BORROWING.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST

PAYMENTS THAT ARE FULLY INTEGRATED WITH UNDERLYING FIXED-RATE BONDS OR NOTES TO

EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON LIBOR OR

COMMERCIAL PAPER RATES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

WITH TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $1,871, WHEREBY THE COMPANY, OVER THE REMAINING

TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING NOTES, WILL RECEIVE A FIXED RATE PAYMENT EQUIVALENT TO

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE OF THE UNDERLYING NOTE AND PAY A FLOATING RATE OF

INTEREST THAT IS BASED ON THREE- OR SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR OR COMMERCIAL

PAPER RATES.

INTEREST RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL COST OF BORROWING AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001.

SEE NOTES 18 AND 20 FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTIONS OF INTEREST RATE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE-TRADED AND OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW

MATERIAL PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, PIONEER ENTERS INTO EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

COMPENSATING GROWERS.
