INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

AS A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BASED COMPANY, DUPONT BELIEVES THAT SECURING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF PROTECTING ITS RESEARCH. SOME DUPONT BUSINESSES OPERATE IN ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE AVAILABILITY AND PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AFFECT COMPETITION.  (INFORMATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO PIONEER IS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 AGRICULTURE BUSINESS DISCUSSION BEGINNING ON PAGE 4 OF THIS REPORT.)

TRADE SECRETS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  MANY OF THE PROCESSES USED TO MAKE DUPONT PRODUCTS ARE KEPT AS TRADE SECRETS WHICH, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAY BE LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES.  DUPONT VIGILANTLY PROTECTS ALL OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INCLUDING ITS TRADE SECRETS.  WHEN THE COMPANY DISCOVERS THAT ITS TRADE SECRETS HAVE BEEN UNLAWFULLY TAKEN, IT REPORTS THE MATTER TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTION, AS APPROPRIATE.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGERS

AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1, PART 1  BUSINESS, ON DECEMBER 11, 2015, DUPONT AND THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY (DOW) AGREED, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, TO EFFECT A STRATEGIC COMBINATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES BY: (I) FORMING DIAMOND-ORION HOLDCO, INC., A CORPORATION, ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND JOINTLY OWNED BY DUPONT AND DOW (HOLDCO), (II) DOW MERGING WITH A NEWLY FORMED, WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF HOLDCO, WITH DOW SURVIVING SUCH MERGER AS A DIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF HOLDCO (THE DOW MERGER), AND (III) DUPONT MERGING WITH A NEWLY FORMED, WHOLLY OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF HOLDCO, WITH DUPONT SURVIVING SUCH MERGER AS A DIRECT, WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF HOLDCO (THE DUPONT MERGER AND, TOGETHER WITH THE DOW MERGER, THE MERGERS).  FOLLOWING THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS, DUPONT AND DOW INTEND TO PURSUE, SUBJECT TO THE RECEIPT OF APPROVAL BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF HOLDCO, THE SEPARATION OF THE COMBINED COMPANY’S AGRICULTURE BUSINESS, SPECIALTY PRODUCTS BUSINESS AND MATERIAL SCIENCE BUSINESS THROUGH A SERIES OF ONE OR MORE TAX-EFFICIENT TRANSACTIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE BUSINESS SEPARATIONS).

THE RISK FACTORS BELOW SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS SET FORTH BELOW AND OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. HOLDCO WILL FILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-4 WITH THE SEC THAT WILL INCLUDE A JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS RELATING TO THE MERGERS. DUPONT URGES YOU TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-4 ONCE IT BECOMES AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGERS, INCLUDING RELEVANT RISK FACTORS.

THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS IS CONTINGENT UPON THE SATISFACTION OF A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS, INCLUDING STOCKHOLDER AND REGULATORY APPROVALS, THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF DUPONT’S AND/OR DOW’S CONTROL AND THAT DUPONT AND/OR DOW MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN. THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS COULD PREVENT, OR SUBSTANTIALLY DELAY, THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS AND DUPONT CANNOT PREDICT IF REGULATORS WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS ON HOLDCO THAT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMBINED COMPANY’S BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, ONE OR MORE CONDITIONS TO CLOSING OF THE MERGERS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND THE MERGERS MAY NOT BE COMPLETED.

THE ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE THE  MERGERS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS THAT THE CONDITIONS TO THE MERGERS ARE NOT SATISFIED, OR IF POSSIBLE, WAIVED INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS (I) THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT BY THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMMON STOCK OF EACH OF DUPONT AND DOW;  (II) THE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN APPROVALS UNDER COMPETITION LAWS; (III) DUPONT AND DOW REASONABLY DETERMINING THAT THE DUPONT MERGER AND THE DOW MERGER DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN ACQUISITION OF A 50% OR GREATER INTEREST IN DUPONT AND DOW, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF SECTION 355(E) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE; AND (IV) THE ABSENCE OF GOVERNMENTAL RESTRAINTS OR PROHIBITIONS PREVENTING THE CONSUMMATION OF EITHER OF THE MERGERS.  THE OBLIGATION OF EACH OF DUPONT AND DOW TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGERS IS ALSO CONDITIONED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RECEIPT OF A TAX OPINION FROM THE TAX COUNSEL AS TO THE TAX-FREE NATURE OF EACH OF THE MERGERS. DUPONT CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE MERGERS WILL BE COMPLETED OR THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A DELAY IN THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGERS. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED, DUPONT MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE TRANSACTION AND DUPONT WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGERS. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES MAY REFUSE TO PERMIT THE MERGERS OR MAY IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS OR CONDITIONS ON THE MERGERS THAT MAY HARM THE COMBINED COMPANY IF THE MERGERS ARE COMPLETED. FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGERS SUBSTANTIALLY AS CONTEMPLATED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT ON OR BEFORE MARCH 15, 2017 OR IF CERTAIN ANTITRUST-RELATED CONDITIONS TO THE CLOSING HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED AND THE PARTIES THEREFORE ELECT TO EXTEND, JUNE 15, 2017, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S STOCK PRICE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE MERGERS, INCLUDING THE BUSINESS SEPARATIONS, WILL OCCUR OR BE FULLY OR TIMELY REALIZED.

THE SUCCESS OF THE MERGERS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE COMBINED COMPANY’S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE THE BUSINESSES OF DUPONT AND DOW. IF THE COMBINED COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE THE BUSINESSES OF DUPONT AND DOW IN AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER, INCLUDING IF THE INTENDED BUSINESS SEPARATIONS ARE DELAYED OR ULTIMATELY NOT CONSUMMATED, THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, SYNERGIES OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND COST SAVINGS MAY NOT BE REALIZED FULLY OR AT ALL, OR MAY TAKE LONGER TO REALIZE THAN EXPECTED, AND THE VALUE OF COMMON STOCK, THE REVENUES, LEVELS OF EXPENSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMBINATION OF TWO INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES IS A COMPLEX, COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING PROCESS, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING SUCH INTEGRATION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION.

•

THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT’S ATTENTION FROM ONGOING BUSINESS CONCERNS AND PERFORMANCE SHORTFALLS AT ONE OR BOTH OF THE COMPANIES AS A RESULT OF THE DEVOTION OF MANAGEMENT’S ATTENTION TO THE MERGERS;

•

ONGOING DIVERSION OF THE ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM THE OPERATION OF THE COMBINED COMPANY’S BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF THE INTENDED BUSINESS SEPARATIONS;

•

DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING ANTICIPATED COST SAVINGS, SYNERGIES, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND GROWTH PROSPECTS;

•

CHALLENGES OF MANAGING A LARGER COMBINED COMPANY ADDRESSING DIFFERENCES IN BUSINESS CULTURE AND RETAINING KEY PERSONNEL;

•

THE POSSIBILITY OF FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE INTENDED BUSINESS SEPARATIONS;

•

UNANTICIPATED ISSUES IN INTEGRATING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS, FINANCIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS, AND OTHER SYSTEMS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES;

•

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS;

•

MANAGING TAX COSTS OR INEFFICIENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY AND THE INTENDED BUSINESS SEPARATIONS;

•

COORDINATING GEOGRAPHICALLY SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS; AND

•

UNFORESEEN EXPENSES OR DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGERS.

SOME OF THESE FACTORS WILL BE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF MANAGEMENT AND ANY ONE OF THEM COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT’S TIME AND ENERGY, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF EXPECTED REVENUES WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DIFFICULTIES IN THE INTEGRATION PROCESS AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS RESULTING FROM THE MERGERS, COULD  ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMBINED COMPANY’S RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSORS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND COULD HARM THE REPUTATIONS OF DUPONT, DOW AND THE COMBINED COMPANY.

IF THE COMBINED COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS INTEGRATION CHALLENGES, THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY DUPONT’S AND DOW’S OPERATIONS, EFFECT THE INTENDED BUSINESS SEPARATIONS OR TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE ACTUAL INTEGRATION MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL AND UNFORESEEN EXPENSES, AND THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE INTEGRATION PLAN MAY NOT BE REALIZED. ACTUAL GROWTH AND COST SAVINGS, IF ACHIEVED, MAY BE LOWER AND MAY TAKE LONGER TO ACHIEVE THAN ANTICIPATED.

DUPONT WILL BE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS UNTIL THE MERGERS ARE CONSUMMATED.

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE MERGERS ON EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSORS AND LICENSEES AS WELL AS REGULATORY PERMITS, LICENSES, CONTRACTS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY FOR WHICH  THE MERGERS COULD BE DEEMED A “CHANGE-IN-CONTROL” UNDER THE APPLICABLE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON DUPONT, DOW AND CONSEQUENTLY ON THE COMBINED COMPANY.  CHANGES TO EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT EACH OF DUPONT’S AND/OR DOW'S REVENUES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW, AS WELL AS THE MARKET PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK.  THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY IMPAIR EACH PARTY’S ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY PERSONNEL UNTIL THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS, AND COULD CAUSE SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS AND OTHERS THAT DEAL WITH THE PARTIES TO SEEK TO CHANGE EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES COULD BE CHALLENGING DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE MERGERS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR FUTURE ROLES. IF KEY EMPLOYEES DEPART BECAUSE OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE UNCERTAINTY AND DIFFICULTY OF INTEGRATION OR A DESIRE NOT TO REMAIN WITH THE BUSINESSES, THE COMBINED COMPANY’S BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  FURTHER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES OF DUPONT AND DOW TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT DUPONT AND DOW HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES.

11

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

IN ADDITION, THE MERGER AGREEMENT RESTRICTS EACH OF DUPONT AND DOW, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER PARTY, FROM MAKING CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, ENTERING INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTS, INCURRING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS AND EXPENDITURES, PAYING DIVIDENDS IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN THRESHOLDS, REPURCHASING OR ISSUING SECURITIES OUTSIDE OF EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE AND EQUITY AWARD PROGRAMS, AND TAKING OTHER SPECIFIED ACTIONS UNTIL THE EARLIER OF THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGERS OR THE TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY PREVENT OR DELAY PURSUIT OF STRATEGIC CORPORATE OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS. ADVERSE EFFECTS ARISING DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE MERGERS COULD BE EXACERBATED BY ANY DELAYS IN CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGERS OR TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

DUPONT EXPECTS TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL TRANSACTION-RELATED COSTS IN THE CONNECTION WITH THE MERGERS.

DUPONT EXPECTS TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS, EXPENSES AND FEES FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND OTHER TRANSACTION COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE COSTS WILL BE NON-RECURRING EXPENSES RELATING TO THE MERGERS AND THE INTENDED BUSINESS SEPARATIONS, INCLUDING COSTS RELATING TO INTEGRATION AND SEPARATION PLANNING.  THESE COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION OF DUPONT PRIOR TO THE MERGERS AND OF THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING THE MERGERS.

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ITS BUSINESSES. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND RESTRICTIONS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY VALUES AND FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS; CHANGES IN LOCAL POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; IMPORT AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS; IMPORT OR EXPORT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND TRADE POLICY AND OTHER POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL PRACTICES OR POLICIES AFFECTING U.S. COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS ABROAD. ALTHOUGH DUPONT HAS OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2015 WERE PRINCIPALLY TO CUSTOMERS IN EUROZONE COUNTRIES, CHINA, BRAZIL, AND JAPAN. FURTHER, THE COMPANY’S LARGEST CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE THE EUROPEAN EURO, BRAZILIAN REAL, THE CHINESE YUAN, AND THE JAPANESE YEN.  MARKET UNCERTAINTY OR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THESE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN DECREASED SALES VOLUME, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON DUPONT’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NET MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS, COMMITTED CURRENCY PURCHASES AND SALES, FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

VOLATILITY IN ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COSTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S SALES AND EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING PROCESSES CONSUME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS, THE COSTS OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO WORLDWIDE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE COST OF ENERGY, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECT MARKET PRICES FOR OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND RAW MATERIALS AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ESTABLISHING A PRICE ON CARBON COULD CREATE INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS AND PRICE VOLATILITY.

WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS THROUGH NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES. THE COMPANY TAKES ACTIONS TO OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS THROUGH SELLING PRICE INCREASES, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS. SUCCESS IN OFFSETTING HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH PRICE INCREASES IS LARGELY INFLUENCED BY COMPETITIVE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE MARKET SERVED. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER ENERGY AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

12

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED BY BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS.

BUSINESS AND/OR SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, PLANT AND/OR POWER OUTAGES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AND/OR NETWORK DISRUPTIONS, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE INCLUDING ACTS OF SABOTAGE, EMPLOYEE ERROR OR OTHER ACTIONS, GEO-POLITICAL ACTIVITY, WEATHER EVENTS AND NATURAL DISASTERS COULD SERIOUSLY HARM THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT, DETECT AND RECOVER FROM SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE BY HACKERS; VIRUSES; BREACHES DUE TO EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS; OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS COULD RESULT IN MISUSE OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS, BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS, LOSS OF PROPERTY INCLUDING TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION, LEGAL CLAIMS OR PROCEEDINGS, REPORTING ERRORS, PROCESSING INEFFICIENCIES, NEGATIVE MEDIA ATTENTION, LOSS OF SALES AND INTERFERENCE WITH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.  LIKE MOST MAJOR CORPORATIONS, THE COMPANY IS THE TARGET OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE, INCLUDING CYBER-ATTACKS, FROM TIME TO TIME. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THESE ATTACKS HAVE RESULTED, AND COULD RESULT IN THE FUTURE, IN UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES GAINING ACCESS TO AT LEAST CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. HOWEVER, TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT, CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT OR BUSINESS OPERATIONS THAT IT ATTRIBUTES TO THESE ATTACKS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL LOSSES TO DATE RELATED TO SECURITY BREACHES, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL NOT SUFFER SUCH LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MANAGES THE RISKS WITHIN ITS CONTROL THAT COULD LEAD TO BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS AND SECURITY BREACHES. AS THESE THREATS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, PARTICULARLY AROUND CYBERSECURITY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENHANCE ITS CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, PROCESSES, PRACTICES AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, SUCH EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNPREDICTABLE SEASONAL AND WEATHER FACTORS COULD IMPACT SALES AND EARNINGS FROM THE COMPANY’S AGRICULTURE SEGMENT.

THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO SEASONAL AND WEATHER FACTORS, WHICH CAN VARY UNPREDICTABLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WEATHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE PRESENCE OF DISEASE AND PESTS ON A REGIONAL BASIS AND, ACCORDINGLY, CAN POSITIVELY OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR CROP PROTECTION PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE MIX OF PRODUCTS USED. THE WEATHER ALSO CAN AFFECT THE QUALITY, VOLUME AND COST OF SEEDS PRODUCED FOR SALE AS WELL AS DEMAND AND PRODUCT MIX. SEED YIELDS CAN BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN PLANNED, WHICH COULD LEAD TO HIGHER INVENTORY AND RELATED-WRITE-OFFS AND AFFECT ABILITY TO SUPPLY.

INABILITY TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND PROTECT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ENFORCE THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH MAJOR GLOBAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATES, INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY AGRICULTURAL AND BIO-BASED PRODUCTS. SPEED IN DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND PROTECTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BRINGING RELATED PRODUCTS TO MARKET IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FAILURE TO PREDICT AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO THIS COMPETITION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OR CANDIDATE PRODUCTS TO BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING SALES. COMPETITORS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITIONS AND THE OUTCOMES CAN BE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. IF CHALLENGES ARE RESOLVED ADVERSELY, IT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN LICENSES ON COMPETITIVE TERMS, COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS AND GENERATE SALES FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING PATENTS, PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION, TRADE SECRETS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, TRADEMARKS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER FORMS OF TRADE DRESS, ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. THE COMPANY ENDEAVORS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR USED AND IN JURISDICTIONS INTO WHICH ITS PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTED.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN PROTECTION FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN KEY JURISDICTIONS. FURTHER, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES MADE IN REACTION TO PRESSURE FROM  NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, COULD IMPACT THE EXTENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AFFORDED BY SUCH JURISDICTIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO AND DISTRIBUTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. DESPITE THESE PRECAUTIONS, THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH EMPLOYEE ERROR OR ACTIONS, THEFT AND CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS, AND OTHER SECURITY BREACHES. WHEN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE OR COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS ARE DISCOVERED, THE COMPANY REPORTS SUCH SITUATIONS TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FOR INVESTIGATION, AS APPROPRIATE, AND TAKES MEASURES TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT. PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED TO BIOTECHNOLOGY IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE THEFT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY CAN BE SELF-REPLICATING. ACCORDINGLY, THE IMPACT OF SUCH THEFT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. SEE PART I, ITEM 1 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

MARKET ACCEPTANCE, GOVERNMENT POLICIES, RULES, REGULATIONS AND COMPETITION COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY IN CERTAIN MARKETS TO GENERATE  AND SUSTAIN SALES OR AFFECT PROFITABILITY FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON BIOTECHNOLOGY.

THE COMPANY IS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY IS ALSO USING BIOTECHNOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND PRE-COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS IN OTHER.  THESE PRODUCTS ENABLE COST AND PROCESS BENEFITS, BETTER PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTIONALITY, AND IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES IN A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES SUCH AS SEEDS, ENZYMES, ANIMAL NUTRITION, DETERGENTS, FOOD INGREDIENTS, ETHANOL PRODUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO GENERATE AND SUSTAIN SALES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS COULD BE IMPACTED BY MARKET ACCEPTANCE, INCLUDING PERCEPTION OF BENEFITS AND COSTS RELATIVE TO PRODUCTS BASED ON CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY THE TESTING AND PLANTING OF SEEDS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS AND THE IMPORT OF GRAINS, FOOD AND FOOD INGREDIENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM THOSE SEEDS.

IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS RIGHT TO PRODUCE OR SELL EXISTING PRODUCTS OR TO COMMERCIALIZE NEW PRODUCTS CONTAINING BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS, PARTICULARLY SEED PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MUST BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS ABILITY TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATORY AGENCIES. SALES INTO AND USE OF SEEDS WITH BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE CULTIVATION HAS BEEN APPROVED COULD BE AFFECTED IF KEY IMPORT MARKETS HAVE NOT APPROVED THE IMPORT OF GRAINS, FOOD AND FOOD INGREDIENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM THOSE SEEDS. IF IMPORT OF GRAINS, FOOD AND FOOD INGREDIENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM THOSE SEEDS CONTAINING SUCH BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS OCCURS IN THESE MARKETS, IT COULD LEAD TO DISRUPTION IN TRADE AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY’S REGULATORY COMPLIANCE COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE DETECTION OF LOW LEVEL PRESENCE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS IN CONVENTIONAL SEED OR PRODUCTS PRODUCED FROM SUCH SEED. FURTHERMORE, THE DETECTION OF BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAITS NOT APPROVED IN THE COUNTRY OF CULTIVATION MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO SUPPLY PRODUCT AND COULD AFFECT EXPORTS OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED FROM SUCH SEEDS AND EVEN RESULT IN CROP DESTRUCTION OR PRODUCT RECALLS.

DUPONT’S ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR SOME OF ITS  PRODUCTS IN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT COULD LIMIT SALES OR AFFECT PROFITABILITY IN CERTAIN MARKETS.

IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE COMPANY MUST TEST THE SAFETY, EFFICACY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ITS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS TO SATISFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND OBTAIN THE NECESSARY APPROVALS. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS THE COMPANY MUST PERIODICALLY RENEW ITS APPROVALS WHICH MAY REQUIRE IT TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH THEN-CURRENT STANDARDS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS LENGTHY,  COMPLEX AND IN SOME MARKETS UNPREDICTABLE,  WITH REQUIREMENTS THAT CAN VARY BY PRODUCT, TECHNOLOGY, INDUSTRY AND COUNTRY. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDER REACTION TO ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED IMPACTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES ON SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRES SUBMITTING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND DATA, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PARTICIPATION FROM TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS. REGULATORY STANDARDS AND TRIAL PROCEDURES ARE CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING. THE PACE OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE LACK OF REGULATORY HARMONY COULD RESULT IN UNINTENDED NONCOMPLIANCE.

RESPONDING TO THESE CHANGES AND MEETING EXISTING AND NEW REQUIREMENTS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCED PROFITABILITY.  THE FAILURE TO RECEIVE NECESSARY PERMITS OR APPROVALS COULD HAVE NEAR- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON THE COMPANY’S  ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND SELL SOME CURRENT AND FUTURE PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY MIGHT NOT REALIZE ALL OF THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM COST AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES TO THE EXTENT AND AS ANTICIPATED.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ONGOING REVIEW OF COSTS, WORKING CAPITAL PERFORMANCE AND CAPITAL SPENDING, IN DECEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A GLOBAL COST SAVINGS AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN DESIGNED TO REDUCE COSTS IN 2016 BY $730 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH 2015. ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH THIS REVIEW, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO DEFER CERTAIN PROJECTS INCLUDING THE DESIGN, TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT OF A MULTI-YEAR, PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM TO INTEGRATE, SIMPLIFY AND STANDARDIZE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, SOURCING AND FINANCE FUNCTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS NO CURRENT INTENTION TO ABANDON THE ERP IMPLEMENTATION.  HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE DEFERMENT AND FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, THE COMPANY’S CURRENT INVESTMENT COULD BECOME IMPAIRED AND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT COULD BE REQUIRED. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT COST AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE 2016 GLOBAL COST SAVINGS AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN AS PLANNED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, ALLIANCES AND OTHER PORTFOLIO ACTIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ACQUISITION CANDIDATES THAT MAY STRATEGICALLY FIT ITS BUSINESS AND/OR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AND DEVELOP ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD FAIL TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS, INCLUDING ANY EXPECTED INCREASES IN REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S OBJECTIVES AND ALIGNMENT WITH ITS GROWTH STRATEGY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN SEPARATING UNDERPERFORMING OR NON-STRATEGIC ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DIVESTITURE OF, OR LOST OPERATING INCOME FROM, SUCH ASSETS MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS. MOREOVER, THE COMPANY MIGHT INCUR ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES THAT REDUCE ITS EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PROCESS SAFETY AND PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ISSUES.

FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY MANAGE SAFETY, HUMAN HEALTH, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITIES, STAKEHOLDERS, THE ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES COULD IMPACT PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE AND INFLUENCE THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO MANAGE PROCESS SAFETY RISKS, ISSUES COULD BE CREATED BY EVENTS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, ACTS OF SABOTAGE AND SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPANY'S EXTERNAL PARTNERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OPERATIONS RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD GOVERNING THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS AND THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS PAST OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION COSTS. THE COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ULTIMATE COSTS UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THE TIMING OF THESE COSTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THE COMPANY'S ACCRUALS FOR SUCH COSTS AND LIABILITIES MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES ON WHICH THE ACCRUALS ARE BASED DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NATURE OF THE MATTER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITE, SITE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD RECOGNIZED A LIABILITY OF $492 MILLION RELATED TO THE MATTERS. SINCE CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO $1.0 BILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DUPONT AND CHEMOURS ENTERED A SEPARATION AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPIN-OFF OF CHEMOURS ON JULY 1, 2015.  PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED BY CHEMOURS FOR CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT HAVE AN ESTIMATED LIABILITY OF $291 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND A POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT RANGES UP TO APPROXIMATELY $610 MILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN INDEMNIFICATION ASSET OF $291 MILLION CORRESPONDING TO THE COMPANY’S ACCRUAL BALANCE RELATED TO THESE MATTERS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015. IF BASED ON THE ACTIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEMOURS, IT WERE NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE CHEMOURS’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE SATISFIED, THEN THE COMPANY COULD NOT CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATED INDEMNIFICATION ASSET ADVERSELY IMPACTING DUPONT’S FINANCIAL POSITION.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE COMPANY’S RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES CAN BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1, PART II, ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ON PAGE 46 OF THIS REPORT AND NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

15

PART I

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS,

CONTINUED

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION AND OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY FACES RISKS ARISING FROM VARIOUS UNASSERTED AND ASSERTED LITIGATION MATTERS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCT LIABILITY, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOTED A NATIONWIDE TREND IN PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY SEEKING RELIEF SUCH AS MEDICAL MONITORING, PROPERTY DAMAGES, OFF-SITE REMEDIATION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS WITHOUT CLAIMING PRESENT PERSONAL INJURIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NOTED A TREND IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NUISANCE SUITS BEING FILED ON BEHALF OF STATES, COUNTIES, CITIES AND UTILITIES ALLEGING HARM TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES SUCH AS A FINAL ADVERSE JUDGMENT, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE CERTAIN COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES RELATING TO CURRENT AND PAST OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES AND ISSUE GUARANTEES OF THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS. IF THE COMPANY WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS AS A RESULT, THEY COULD EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED, THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT, CHEMOURS INDEMNIFIES DUPONT AGAINST CERTAIN LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND OTHER LIABILITIES THAT AROSE PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION. THE TERM OF THIS INDEMNIFICATION IS INDEFINITE AND INCLUDES DEFENSE COSTS AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS MONETARY AND NON-MONETARY SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS. IF BASED ON THE ACTIONS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION OF CHEMOURS, IT WERE NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE CHEMOURS’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE SATISFIED, THEN THE COMPANY COULD NOT CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATED INDEMNIFICATION ASSET ADVERSELY IMPACTING DUPONT’S FINANCIAL POSITION.

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

IN JANUARY 2014, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN. THERE IS NO REQUIRED COMPLETION DATE FOR PURCHASES UNDER THIS PLAN.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2015, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO BUY BACK SHARES OF ABOUT $4 BILLION USING THE DISTRIBUTION PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM CHEMOURS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE SPIN-OFF OF CHEMOURS, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE USE OF THE DISTRIBUTION PROCEEDS TO BUY BACK SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AS FOLLOWS: $2 BILLION TO BE PURCHASED AND RETIRED BY DECEMBER 31, 2015 WITH THE REMAINDER TO BE PURCHASED AND RETIRED BY DECEMBER 31, 2016 . IN AUGUST 2015, THE COMPANY  ENTERED  AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (ASR) AGREEMENT.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ASR AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY PAID $2 BILLION TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND RECEIVED AND RETIRED 35 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $57.16 PER SHARE.

DUPONT’S OBJECTIVE CONTINUES TO BE TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING $2 BILLION STOCK BUYBACK BY YEAR END DECEMBER 31, 2016. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THE PLANNED MERGER OF EQUALS WITH DOW, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL HAVE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO ENTER THE MARKET PRIOR TO THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON THE MERGER.  AFTER THE VOTE, THE COMPANY PLANS TO MAKE REPURCHASES.

DUPONT’S BUSINESSES SERVE MARKETS WHERE THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR MORE AND HEALTHIER FOOD, RENEWABLY SOURCED MATERIALS AND FUELS, AND ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS IS CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY’S UNIQUE COMBINATION OF SCIENCES, PROVEN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) ENGINE, BROAD GLOBAL REACH, AND DEEP MARKET PENETRATION ARE DISTINCTIVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT POSITION THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE CAPITALIZING ON THIS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL.

STRATEGY

DUPONT’S NEAR TERM FOCUS IS TO DELIVER EARNINGS GROWTH WHILE POSITIONING THE BUSINESSES TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY OVER THE LONG TERM; CONTINUE TO IMPROVE CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND WORKING CAPITAL PERFORMANCE; AND COMPLETE THE PROPOSED MERGER OF EQUALS WITH DOW.

DUPONT HAS DRAMATICALLY REFINED ITS PORTFOLIO TO FOCUS INVESTMENT IN AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY AND SECULAR GROWTH; ENHANCED ITS INNOVATION PLATFORM TO DELIVER SUBSTANTIAL REVENUES FROM NEW PRODUCTS; INCREASED FOCUS ON EFFICIENCY, COST DISCIPLINE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY; AND EXPANDED MARKETS GEOGRAPHICALLY. THE COMPANY IS BETTER CONNECTING ITS LABORATORIES AND THE MARKETPLACE, AND STRIVING FOR FASTER, MORE EFFECTIVE EXECUTION IN DELIVERING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS.

THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE AGILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO MARKET CONDITIONS, A NECESSITY TO WIN IN A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND DRIVE GROWTH ACROSS THREE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES: EXTENDING LEADERSHIP IN AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITION, STRENGTHENING AND GROWING ADVANCED MATERIALS CAPABILITIES, AND LEVERAGING SCIENCE TO DEVELOP A WORLD LEADING BIO-BASED INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THERE IS A COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH.

RESULTS

NET SALES OF $25.1 BILLION, WERE DOWN 12 PERCENT VERSUS PRIOR YEAR, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING 7 PERCENT NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM CURRENCY, 3 PERCENT LOWER VOLUME AND 2 PERCENT NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM PORTFOLIO CHANGES. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES DECLINED FROM $3.1 BILLION TO $1.9 BILLION, REFLECTING LOWER SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS, THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR YEAR GAINS ON BUSINESSES AND OTHER ASSETS, AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COSTS SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2014 REDESIGN INITIATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN. TOTAL PRE-TAX SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS OF $4.2 BILLION, WERE 16 PERCENT BELOW LAST YEAR, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY OF ABOUT $785 MILLION AND LOWER VOLUMES DRIVEN BY WEAKNESS IN AGRICULTURE MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COSTS SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2014 OPERATIONAL REDESIGN INITIATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN.

ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

2016 GLOBAL COST SAVINGS AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN

ON DECEMBER 11, 2015, DUPONT ANNOUNCED A 2016 GLOBAL COST SAVINGS AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN DESIGNED TO REDUCE $730 MILLION IN COSTS IN 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015, WHICH REPRESENTS A REDUCTION OF OPERATING COSTS ON A RUN-RATE BASIS OF ABOUT $1.0 BILLION BY END OF 2016.  AS PART OF THE PLAN, THE COMPANY COMMITTED TO TAKE STRUCTURAL ACTIONS ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES AND STAFF FUNCTIONS GLOBALLY TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY BY FURTHER CONSOLIDATING BUSINESSES AND ALIGNING STAFF FUNCTIONS MORE CLOSELY WITH THEM.   IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRE-TAX CHARGE TO EARNINGS OF $798 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2015, COMPRISED OF $656 MILLION OF SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFIT COSTS, $109 MILLION OF ASSET RELATED CHARGES, AND $33 MILLION OF CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS.  FUTURE CASH EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THIS CHARGE ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $680 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PAYMENT OF SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS.  THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHARGE ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF DUPONT’S WORKFORCE AND TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE IN 2016.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES ADDITIONAL CHARGES COULD OCCUR IN RELATION TO THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WHICH IT CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME.

IN 2015, THE COMPANY RECORDED A TAX PROVISION ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $0.7 BILLION, REFLECTING A $0.5 BILLION DECREASE FROM 2014. THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S POLICY OF HEDGING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE ABSENCE OF 2014 GAINS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER ASSETS IN THE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS AND AGRICULTURE SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS INCREASED TAX BENEFITS ON EMPLOYEE SEPARATION/ASSET RELATED CHARGES.

CORPORATE OUTLOOK

CURRENT DIFFICULT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN AGRICULTURE AND SLOWER GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE CHALLENGING THE COMPANY’S SALES GROWTH IN 2016. THE COMPANY EXPECTS HEADWINDS FROM CURRENCY DUE TO THE CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE MOST SIGNIFICANT IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2016. GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS IS EXPECTED TO SLOW, LEADING TO A SHIFT IN THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS MIX TO HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2016 WILL BENEFIT FROM $730 MILLION REDUCTION IN COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE 2016 GLOBAL COST SAVINGS AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN.  THESE COST REDUCTIONS WILL BE WEIGHTED TOWARD THE SECOND HALF OF 2016 REFLECTING IMPLEMENTATION OF SPECIFIC ACTIONS DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPECTS INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2016 TO BE IMPACTED BY TRANSACTION RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH DOW.

FULL YEAR 2015 SEGMENT NET SALES OF $9.8 BILLION DECREASED $1.5 BILLION, OR 13 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY AND LOWER SEED AND CROP PROTECTION VOLUMES, PRIMARILY IN BRAZIL AND NORTH AMERICA, WHICH WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

LOCAL CORN SEED PRICES.

IN BRAZIL, LOWER CORN SEED VOLUME REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF A REDUCTION IN SUMMER PLANTED HECTARES OF CORN AND FALL ARMYWORM RESISTANCE IMPACTING PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN CORN HYBRIDS.

IN NORTH AMERICA, LOWER SOYBEAN VOLUME REFLECTS BETWEEN 1 AND 2 POINTS OF SHARE LOSS AND LOWER SOYBEAN PLANTED AREA; LOWER CORN PLANTED AREA WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LOCAL CORN SEED PRICES. LOWER CROP PROTECTION VOLUME IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOW EXPECTED INSECT PRESSURE, THE ADOPTION OF INSECT PROTECTED SOYBEAN VARIETIES, HIGHER INVENTORIES, AND A CHALLENGING MACRO ENVIRONMENT. INSECT CONTROL VOLUMES WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE SHUTDOWN OF THE LAPORTE MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN TEXAS.

2015 OPERATING EARNINGS AND OPERATING EARNINGS MARGIN DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY OF $538 MILLION,   LOWER SALES, AND AN APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE SHUTDOWN OF THE LAPORTE MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF PRIOR YEAR IMPACTS FROM PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST REDUCTIONS AND CONTINUED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

2014 VERSUS 2013

FULL YEAR 2014 SEGMENT NET SALES OF $11.3 BILLION DECREASED $0.4 BILLION, OR 4 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CORN SEED VOLUMES IN BRAZIL AND NORTH AMERICA AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY, WHICH WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CROP PROTECTION VOLUMES AND HIGHER LOCAL CORN SEED PRICES. IN BRAZIL, CORN SEED MARKET SHARE AND PRICE WERE LOWER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF FALL ARMYWORM RESISTANCE

AND A REDUCTION IN PLANTED HECTARES OF CORN. HIGHER VOLUMES IN INSECTICIDES WERE DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN RYNAXYPYR

®

INSECTICIDE AND FROM SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES OF CYAZYPYR

®

INSECTICIDE AND NEW SEED TREATMENTS IN SEVERAL MARKETS.

2014 OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CORN SEED VOLUMES AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CROP PROTECTION VOLUMES, LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION, HIGHER LOCAL SEED PRICES AND LOWER SEED INPUT COSTS. OPERATING EARNINGS MARGIN WAS ABOUT THE SAME IN EACH PERIOD.

OUTLOOK

FARMER NET RETURNS FOR ROW CROPS CONTINUE TO TREND DOWN AS LAND AND RENT PRICES HAVE LAGGED THE TRANSITION ON LOWER COMMODITY PRICES AS GRAIN STOCKS REMAIN AT ELEVATED LEVELS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR TO REMAIN CHALLENGED WITH CORN AND SOYBEAN COMMODITY PRICES AT THE LOW END OF NORMAL UNTIL DEMAND ACCELERATES OR THERE IS A DISRUPTION IN GLOBAL PRODUCTION. VOLATILE CURRENCY MARKETS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO PRESENT HEADWINDS GIVEN THE SIZE OF DUPONT AGRICULTURE'S BUSINESSES IN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA.  AS FARMERS LOOK TO RELATIVE ECONOMICS BETWEEN CROP ALTERNATIVES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SLIGHT YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN BRAZIL SAFRINHA AND NORTH AMERICA CORN AREA, PROVIDED WEATHER COOPERATES DURING PLANTING.  PIONEER'S ORDER BOOK IN NORTH AMERICA SUGGESTS A MODEST IMPROVEMENT IN CORN DEMAND AT THE EXPENSE OF SOYBEANS IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SEED MARKET.  IN CROP PROTECTION, CONTINUED WEAK DEMAND FOR FOLIAR-APPLIED INSECTICIDES IN BRAZIL AND ELEVATED DISTRIBUTOR INVENTORIES WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT CHALLENGES.

FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2016, WHICH REFLECTS THE MAJORITY OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SEASON, THE COMPANY EXPECTS AGRICULTURE SALES  TO BE MID-SINGLE DIGITS PERCENT LOWER WITH OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE LOW-TEENS PERCENT BELOW 2015 AS LOCAL PRICE GAINS AND THE BENEFIT OF COST ACTIONS ARE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER INSECTICIDE AND SOYBEAN VOLUMES AND CURRENCY. CROP PROTECTION'S VOLUME FORECAST ASSUMES A CONTINUED IMPACT FROM THE SHUTDOWN OF THE LAPORTE MANUFACTURING FACILITY.  VOLUMES WILL BE MORE CHALLENGED IN THE FIRST QUARTER, DUE TO THE STRONG START IN NORTH AMERICA CORN SEED WHICH BENEFITED THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015, AND DUE TO CROP PROTECTION IN BRAZIL.

FULL YEAR 2016 SEGMENT NET SALES ARE EXPECTED TO BE DOWN MID-SINGLE DIGITS PERCENT AND FULL YEAR OPERATING EARNINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT FLAT AS LOCAL PRICE GAINS AND COST ACTIONS ARE OFFSET BY CURRENCY HEADWINDS AND LOWER VOLUMES.

PURSUANT TO ITS CASH DISCIPLINE POLICY, THE COMPANY SEEKS FIRST TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND SECOND, TO RETURN EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST FOR GROWTH IS COMPELLING.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND DEBT PORTFOLIO AND OCCASIONALLY MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO ONE OR BOTH TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND AN OPTIMUM DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE.

THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS IMPACT ITS ACCESS TO THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS AND COST OF CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION AND STRONG INVESTMENT-GRADE RATING.  THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

WHILE THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT CAPACITY FOR ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER COULD BE REDUCED AS A RESULT OF ITS CURRENT SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS, THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS CAN CONTINUE TO BE MET THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, SYNDICATED CREDIT LINES, BILATERAL CREDIT LINES, LONG-TERM DEBT MARKETS, BANK FINANCING, COMMITTED RECEIVABLE REPURCHASE FACILITIES AND ASSET SALES.

THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY $4.9 BILLION IN UNUSED CREDIT LINES, WHICH INCLUDES A $4 BILLION REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY TO SUPPORT ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WITH SEVERAL MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE UNUSED CREDIT LINES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO MEET SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING LETTERS OF CREDIT.

IN FEBRUARY 2016, IN LINE WITH SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COMMITTED RECEIVABLE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT OF UP TO $1 BILLION (THE REPURCHASE FACILITY) THAT EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 30, 2016.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2015, DUPONT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO BUY BACK SHARES OF ABOUT $4 BILLION USING THE DISTRIBUTION PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM CHEMOURS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE SPIN-OFF OF CHEMOURS, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE USE OF THE DISTRIBUTION PROCEEDS TO BUY BACK SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AS FOLLOWS: $2 BILLION TO BE PURCHASED AND RETIRED BY DECEMBER 31, 2015 WITH THE REMAINDER TO BE PURCHASED AND RETIRED BY DECEMBER 31, 2016. IN AUGUST 2015, THE COMPANY ENTERED AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (ASR) AGREEMENT.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AUGUST 2015 ASR AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY PAID $2 BILLION TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND RECEIVED AND RETIRED 35 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $57.16 PER SHARE.  SEE PART I, ITEM 5

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

AND NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

DUPONT’S OBJECTIVE CONTINUES TO BE TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING $2 BILLION STOCK BUYBACK BY YEAR END DECEMBER 31, 2016. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THE PLANNED MERGER OF EQUALS WITH DOW, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL HAVE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO ENTER THE MARKET PRIOR TO THE SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON THE MERGER.  AFTER THE VOTE, THE COMPANY PLANS TO MAKE REPURCHASES.

IN JANUARY 2014, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN.  IN FEBRUARY AND AUGUST 2014, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO TWO SEPARATE ASR AGREEMENTS.  THE FEBRUARY 2014 ASR AGREEMENT WAS COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 15.1 MILLION SHARES FOR $1 BILLION.  THE AUGUST 2014 ASR AGREEMENT WAS COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASED AND RETIRED 10.4 MILLION SHARES FOR $700 MILLION.  IN ADDITION TO THE ASR AGREEMENTS, IN 2014, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 4.7 MILLION SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR A TOTAL COST OF $300 MILLION.  IN 2015, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 4.6 MILLION SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR A TOTAL COST OF $353 MILLION.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED $2.4 BILLION OF REPURCHASES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. THE REMAINDER OF THE $5 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK WILL BE PURCHASED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS THERE IS NO REQUIRED COMPLETION DATE FOR PURCHASES UNDER THE 2014 PLAN.

IN DECEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A $1 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK PLAN. IN 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN ASR AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY USED $1 BILLION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS FOR THE PURCHASE AND RETIREMENT 20.4 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.

FREE CASH FLOW IS A MEASUREMENT NOT RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANIES DO NOT CALCULATE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THE SAME MANNER AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S FREE CASH FLOW DEFINITION MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGIES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND THEREFORE INDICATES OPERATING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND IS AN INTEGRAL FINANCIAL MEASURE USED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE THE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY VALUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE MATTERS AND REFLECTS CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AS APPROPRIATE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL JUDGMENT AREAS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS INVOLVES NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES. DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ARE TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MEASURING THE COST AND BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY AS OF DECEMBER 31

ST

. THESE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS ON A PLAN SPECIFIC BASIS AS APPROPRIATE. AS PERMITTED BY GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A PLAN BY PLAN BASIS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF THE PLAN'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS, THE EXCESS IS AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES.

ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BENEFIT PLANS IN THE U.S.  IN THE U.S. THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE, APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY, AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

WITHIN THE U.S., THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES ARE ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERAT

ION. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. IS BASED UPON HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTION

S OF INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES OVE

R THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED R

ETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.

IN DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY USES A MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS RATHER THAN ITS FAIR VALUE. THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS IS CALCULATED BY AVERAGING MARKET RETURNS OVER 36 MONTHS. ACCORDINGLY, THERE MAY BE A LAG IN RECOGNITION OF CHANGES IN MARKET VALUATION. AS A

RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE COMPANY CHANGED THE METHOD IT USED TO ESTIMATE THE 2016 SERVICE COST AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST FOR THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS.  FOR THESE PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY ESTIMATED THESE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS UTILIZING A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE AND CASH FLOW FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD.  THE COMPANY WILL UTILIZE A FULL YIELD CURVE APPROACH IN THE ESTIMATION OF THESE 2016 COMPONENTS BY APPLYING THE SPECIFIC SPOT RATES ALONG THE YIELD CURVE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION TO THE RELEVANT PROJECTED CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY MADE THIS CHANGE AS IT BELIEVES IT IS A MORE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS BY IMPROVING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PROJECTED BENEFIT CASH FLOWS TO THE CORRESPONDING SPOT YIELD CURVE RATES. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THIS A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE, AND, ACCORDINGLY, WILL ACCOUNT FOR IT PROSPECTIVELY STARTING IN 2016.  THIS CHANGE DOES NOT AFFECT THE MEASURE OF THE TOTAL BENEFIT OBLIGATION.  SEE INFORMATION WITH THE RESPECT TO THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN METHOD ON 2016 PENSION EXPENSE UNDER "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 45.

IN OCTOBER 2014, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RELEASED FINAL REPORTS OF NEW MORTALITY TABLES AND A MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE FOR MEASUREMENT OF RETIREMENT PROGRAM OBLIGATIONS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THESE TABLES IN MEASURING THE 2014 LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.  THIS ADOPTION INCREASED THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014 BY APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION.  THE EFFECT OF THIS ADOPTION WAS AMORTIZED INTO NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST BEGINNING IN 2015.  IN OCTOBER 2015, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RELEASED AN UPDATED MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE REFLECTING A DECLINE IN LONGEVITY PROJECTION  FROM THE OCTOBER 2014 RELEASE.  THIS RELEASE WAS ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY IN MEASURING THE 2015 LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN THE U.S.  THIS ADOPTION DECREASED THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 BY APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION. THE EFFECT OF THIS ADOPTION WILL BE AMORTIZED INTO NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST BEGINNING IN 2016.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSES, LIABILITIES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS DISCUSSED UNDER "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 45 AND IN NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DUPONT ACCRUES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE MADE.  THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $492 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

; THESE ACCRUED LIABILITIES EXCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.  AS REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP PRECISE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE SITE REMEDIATION COSTS. THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GEOLOGY, THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE TYPE OF REMEDY, THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (PRPS) AT MULTI-PARTY SITES AND THE NUMBER OF AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER PRPS.  THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO $1.0 BILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

LEGAL CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS FOR THIRD PARTY PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY STEMMING FROM ALLEGED ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS.  THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR LEGAL MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  MANAGEMENT MAKES ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ACCRUALS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT AND STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS, SETTLEMENTS, RULINGS, ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND EVENTS THAT MAY PERTAIN TO A PARTICULAR MATTER.  PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AND ESTIMATING RELATED COSTS AND EXPOSURE INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES.  IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS OF LIKELY OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION MATTERS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS.  THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE OF SPECIFIC CLAIMS INCLUDING UNASSERTED CLAIMS, THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR TYPES OF CLAIMS, THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE MATTER IS FILED, INPUT FROM OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESOLVING THE MATTER THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND THE MATTER'S CURRENT STATUS.  CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A LITIGATION ACCRUAL WHEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A COURT PROCEEDING.  IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE A LOSS IF, BASED UPON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PENDING JUDGMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY OVERTURNED ON APPEAL.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION MATTERS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INDEMNIFICATION ASSETS

PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED BY CHEMOURS AGAINST CERTAIN LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND OTHER LIABILITIES THAT AROSE PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION. THE TERM OF THIS INDEMNIFICATION IS INDEFINITE AND INCLUDES DEFENSE COSTS AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS MONETARY AND NON-MONETARY SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECOGNITION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE INDEMNIFIED MATTERS, THE COMPANY RECORDS AN INDEMNIFICATION ASSET WHEN RECOVERY IS DEEMED PROBABLE.  IN ASSESSING THE PROBABILITY OF RECOVERY, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS UNDER THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND ANY POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK.  FUTURE EVENTS, SUCH AS POTENTIAL DISPUTES RELATED TO RECOVERY AS WELL AS SOLVENCY OF CHEMOURS, COULD CAUSE THE INDEMNIFICATION ASSETS TO HAVE A LOWER VALUE THAN ANTICIPATED AND RECORDED.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE RECOVERY OF THE INDEMNIFICATION ASSETS RECORDED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUES MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE.

INCOME TAXES

THE BREADTH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND THE GLOBAL COMPLEXITY OF TAX REGULATIONS REQUIRE ASSESSMENTS OF UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN ESTIMATING TAXES THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY PAY. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, OUTCOMES OF TAX LITIGATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S TAX ASSETS AND TAX LIABILITIES. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT NET REDUCTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE IN THE RANGE OF $225 MILLION TO $250 MILLION WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WITH THE MAJORITY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WITH VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING THE NEED FOR AND MAGNITUDE OF APPROPRIATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS DEPENDENT ON GENERATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALTER THE PROBABILITY THAT THE COMPANY WILL REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD RESULT IN RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, THEREBY REDUCING THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND GENERATING A DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN SOME SITUATIONS THESE CHANGES COULD BE MATERIAL.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE COMPANY HAD A DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE OF $3.4 BILLION, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $1.5 BILLION. REALIZATION OF THESE ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE ASSETS.  SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE.

VALUATION OF ASSETS

THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE MEASURED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED, INCLUDING IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES, IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. THE DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF FAIR VALUE TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS BASED ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND VALUATION METHODOLOGIES REQUIRING CONSIDERABLE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATES BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION, CURRENT MARKET DATA AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED IN THE COMPANY'S VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE REVENUE GROWTH RATES, OPERATING MARGIN ESTIMATES, ROYALTY RATES, AND DISCOUNT RATES. ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATES WERE DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE DATES OF ACQUISITION, THOSE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES AND OTHER ASSETS IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMPANY'S NORMAL ONGOING REVIEW OF OPERATIONS.  TESTING FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE ASSETS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME.  THE DYNAMIC ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S DIVERSIFIED BUSINESSES OPERATE, AND KEY ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTED SELLING PRICES, MARKET GROWTH AND INFLATION RATES, CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF IMPAIRMENT TESTS.  ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  CHANGES IN FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE OF IMPAIRMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIME IN WHICH SUCH IMPAIRMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS TO ENSURE THEY ARE ACHIEVING THEIR GREATEST POTENTIAL AND ARE ALIGNED WITH THE COMPANY'S GROWTH STRATEGY.  STRATEGIC DECISIONS INVOLVING A PARTICULAR GROUP OF ASSETS MAY TRIGGER AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE RELATED ASSETS. SUCH AN ASSESSMENT COULD RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT LOSSES.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER 2015, WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE, AND THEREFORE THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS IS USING THE INCOME APPROACH BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  THE INCOME APPROACH HAS BEEN GENERALLY SUPPORTED BY ADDITIONAL MARKET TRANSACTION ANALYSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FORECASTED CASH FLOW AND REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH RATES MADE FOR PURPOSES OF THE ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UTILIZED ARE BOTH REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2015, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO DEFER FURTHER TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT OF A MULTI-YEAR, PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAS CAPITALIZED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ERP SYSTEM OF APPROXIMATELY $435 MILLION WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN PLACED IN SERVICE.  IT REMAINS PROBABLE THAT THE ERP SYSTEM WILL BE COMPLETED AND PLACED IN SERVICE.

LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS RETIREMENT-RELATED PROGRAMS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. THESE PLANS ARE TYPICALLY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, AS WELL AS MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES (OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS). APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PENSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS. PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY EXPLORES ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET ITS GLOBAL PENSION OBLIGATIONS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AS DEMOGRAPHICS, LIFE EXPECTANCY AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PENSION FUNDING RULES CHANGE. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE ITS PLANS THAT PROVIDE PENSION, MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS.

THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES HIRED IN THE U.S. ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS, BUT RECEIVE BENEFITS IN THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

BENEFITS UNDER DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID PRIMARILY FROM TRUST FUNDS ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE LIMITS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND PROCEDURES UTILIZED ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE PLANS' ACTUARIES TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.  NO CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2015 AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE $230 MILLION TO THIS PLAN IN 2016.

FUNDING FOR EACH PENSION PLAN OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IS GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE SOVEREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THUS, THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN PENSION FUNDING AND PENSION EXPENSE. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANS' FUNDED STATUS TENDS TO MODERATE SUBSEQUENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $164 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN IN 2015.

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS THAT EXCEED FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ARE COVERED BY SEPARATE UNFUNDED PLANS AND THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY'S REMAINING PENSION PLANS WITH NO PLAN ASSETS ARE PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY MADE BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF $144 MILLION TO ITS UNFUNDED PLANS IN 2015.

THE COMPANY'S OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS. PRE-TAX CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ACTUAL NET CLAIMS COSTS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $237 MILLION, $233 MILLION AND $207 MILLION FOR 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. CHANGES IN CASH REQUIREMENTS REFLECT THE NET IMPACT OF HIGHER PER CAPITA HEALTH CARE COSTS, DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES, PLAN AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES.

IN 2016, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT THE SAME AS 2015 FOR PENSION PLANS OTHER THAN THE PRINCIPAL U.S. PENSION PLAN, ITS REMAINING PLANS WITH NO PLAN ASSETS AND ITS OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

THE COMPANY'S INCOME CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PENSION AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFITS AS WELL AS OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMPANY'S INCOME OVER EACH OF THE LAST 3 YEARS WAS AFFECTED BY PRE-TAX CHARGES RELATED TO LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

THE ABOVE CHARGES FOR PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE DETERMINED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2015 IS DUE TO A CURTAILMENT GAIN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE.  THE DECREASE IN LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2014 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES AND BETTER THAN EXPECTED PENSION ASSET RETURNS. SEE "LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS" UNDER THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE 40 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON DETERMINING ANNUAL EXPENSE.

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

THE COMPANY'S KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING ITS PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASES AND THE DISCOUNT RATE (SEE NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2016, LONG TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE BY ABOUT $230 MILLION DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF THE FULL YIELD CURVE APPROACH AND A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE WHICH WILL BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FOR THE US PENSION PLAN FROM 8.5% TO 8.0%.  THE ADOPTION OF THE FULL YIELD CURVE APPROACH WILL REDUCE 2016 EXPENSE BY $210 MILLION AS A RESULT OF A $10 MILLION AND $200 MILLION REDUCTION IN SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS, RESPECTIVELY.  THE ESTIMATED 2016 LONG TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ANY SETTLEMENT LOSSES OR CURTAILMENT GAINS RESULTING FROM ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2016 GLOBAL COST SAVINGS AND RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, AS IT CANNOT BE ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

THE COMPANY OPERATES GLOBAL MANUFACTURING, PRODUCT HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  SUCH RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY THE IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY, AND THE COMPANY MONITORS THESE CHANGES CLOSELY.  COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES THAT ALL OPERATIONS FULLY MEET OR EXCEED LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTS VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, MINIMIZE THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE, DECREASE THE VOLUME OF WATER USE AND DISCHARGES, INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY USE AND REDUCE THE GENERATION OF PERSISTENT, BIOACCUMULATIVE AND TOXIC MATERIALS.  MANAGEMENT HAS NOTED A GLOBAL UPWARD TREND IN THE AMOUNT AND COMPLEXITY OF PROPOSED CHEMICALS REGULATION.  THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS AND GOALS, ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF TOTAL PRE-TAX ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS IN

2015

RESULTED FROM OPERATIONS IN THE U.S.  BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES, IF ANY, IN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES CHARGED TO CURRENT OPERATIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ANNUAL EXPENDITURES

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RANGE OF SUCH EXPENDITURES EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. LONGER TERM, EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY AND MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY.

ENVIRONMENTAL OPERATING COSTS

AS A RESULT OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY INCURS COSTS FOR POLLUTION ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROLS AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT, EMISSIONS TESTING AND MONITORING, AND OBTAINING PERMITS. THE COMPANY ALSO INCURS COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD AND TREATMENT STUDIES AS WELL AS TOXICITY AND DEGRADATION TESTING TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF PRODUCTS AND RAW MATERIALS.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS, AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO $1.0 BILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

HOWEVER, BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY LOSS, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ACCRUED, RELATED TO REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AT ANY INDIVIDUAL SITE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.

PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED BY CHEMOURS FOR CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY OF $492 MILLION, THAT HAVE AN ESTIMATED LIABILITY OF $291 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND A POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT RANGES UP TO APPROXIMATELY $610 MILLION ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN INDEMNIFICATION ASSET OF $291 MILLION CORRESPONDING TO THE COMPANY'S ACCRUAL BALANCE RELATED TO THESE MATTERS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE,

COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA OR SUPERFUND) OR SIMILAR STATE LAWS AT ABOUT 500 SITES AROUND THE U.S., INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 100 SITES FOR WHICH DUPONT DOES NOT BELIEVE IT HAS LIABILITY BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION. ACTIVE REMEDIATION IS UNDER WAY AT APPROXIMATELY 140 OF THESE SITES.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED

ITS LIABILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 190 SITES, EITHER BY COMPLETING REMEDIAL ACTIONS WITH OTHER PRPS OR BY PARTICIPATING IN "DE MINIMIS BUYOUTS" WITH OTHER PRPS WHOSE WASTE, LIKE THE COMPANY'S, REPRESENTED ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL WASTE PRESENT AT A SITE. THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY AT ONE NEW SITE DURING

2015

COMPARED WITH THREE AND FIVE SIMILAR NOTICES IN

2014

AND

2013

, RESPECTIVELY.

ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

IN

2015

, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CAPITAL PROJECTS EITHER REQUIRED BY LAW OR NECESSARY TO MEET THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BE ABOUT $40 MILLION IN

2016.

IN THE U.S., ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE NEXT DECADE FOR TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES FOR SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE AND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT (CAA).  UNTIL ALL CAA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED AND KNOWN, CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WILL REMAIN REGARDING ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE COSTS TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

CLIMATE CHANGE

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE THAT PRESENTS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES. EXPANDING UPON SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT REDUCTIONS MADE IN THE PERIOD 1990-2010, AS OF 2014 THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT, ACHIEVING REDUCTIONS OF 9 PERCENT IN GHG EMISSIONS INTENSITY AND 8 PERCENT IN WATER CONSUMPTION VERSUS A 2010 BASELINE. IN ADDITION, AS OF 2014, THE COMPANY ACHIEVED AN 11 PERCENT REDUCTION IN ENERGY INTENSITY FROM NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES VERSUS A 2010 BASELINE. THE COMPANY CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED DEMANDS OF A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY.

THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO DEVELOP CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC POLICIES TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AND ENCOURAGE LOWER CARBON FORMS OF ENERGY. SUCH POLICIES MAY BRING HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AS WELL AS GREATER REVENUE AND MARGIN OPPORTUNITIES. LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CONTROL OR LIMIT GHG EMISSIONS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ENERGY SOURCE AND SUPPLY CHOICES AS WELL AS INCREASE THE COST OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS DERIVED FROM FOSSIL FUELS. SUCH EFFORTS ARE ALSO ANTICIPATED TO PROVIDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WITH GREATER CERTAINTY FOR THE REGULATORY FUTURE, HELP GUIDE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND DRIVE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR LOW-CARBON AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO GROW FOR PRODUCTS THAT FACILITATE ADAPTATION TO A CHANGING CLIMATE.

THERE ARE EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS GHG EMISSIONS AT THE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS.  SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ARE REGULATED UNDER THE EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME.

CHINA HAS BEGUN PILOT PROGRAMS FOR CARBON TAXES AND TRADING OF GHG EMISSIONS IN SELECTED AREAS.

THE CURRENT UNSETTLED POLICY ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.S., WHERE MANY COMPANY FACILITIES ARE LOCATED, ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY TO BUSINESS DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.

47

PART II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CONTINUED

IN 2010, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) LAUNCHED A PHASED-IN SCHEME TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS FIRST FROM LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES UNDER THE EXISTING CAA PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO INSTALL BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY ON MAJOR NEW OR MODIFIED SOURCES OF GHG EMISSIONS. IN 2015, THE EPA PROMULGATED REGULATIONS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM NEW AND RECONSTRUCTED/MODIFIED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGU'S). IN 2015, THE EPA ALSO PROMULGATED NEW REGULATIONS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING EGUS THAT WOULD BE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL STATE EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THESE REGULATIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEING CHALLENGED IN THE U.S. FEDERAL COURT. IF THE REGULATIONS SURVIVE THESE CHALLENGES, THEY MAY AFFECT THE LONG TERM PRICE AND SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS AND DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE PRECISE IMPACT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REGULATIONS IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED TO THE STATES IN DEVELOPING THEIR PROGRAMS AND ANTICIPATED LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THIS REGULATORY APPROACH. A COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL POLICY THAT ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE BY RELYING ON MARKET-BASED MECHANISMS TO DRIVE REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GASES IS LIKELY TO BE MORE ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT THAN THE FACILITY-BY-FACILITY CONTROLS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF RECENTLY PROMULGATED RULES UNDER EPA’S EXISTING AUTHORITIES.

AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REGIONAL OR NATIONAL APPROACHES COULD PRESENT CHALLENGES IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR COORDINATED GLOBAL POLICY ACTIONS.  AN EFFECTIVE GLOBAL CLIMATE POLICY FRAMEWORK WILL HELP DRIVE THE MARKET CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO STIMULATE AND EFFICIENTLY DEPLOY NEW INNOVATIONS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WHILE MAINTAINING OPEN AND COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETS.

PART II

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL OPERATIONS ARE EXPOSED TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS RELATING TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY PRICES, AND INTEREST RATES.  THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS INCLUDING USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THE EXPOSURE TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS AS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS UNDER ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE DERIVATIVES AND RELATED EXPOSURES, SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DECISIONS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT TO HEDGE A GIVEN COMMITMENT ARE MADE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF THE EXPOSURE, MARKET VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE ALSO USED, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO MANAGE NEAR-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH REQUIREMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS

THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS RESULTING IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES, PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS.  THE PRIMARY CURRENCIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS AN EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE ARE THE EUROPEAN EURO (EUR), BRAZILIAN REAL, CHINESE YUAN, AND JAPANESE YEN.  THE COMPANY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO ESTABLISH WITH CERTAINTY THE USD AMOUNT OF FUTURE FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY.

CERTAIN FOREIGN ENTITIES OF THE COMPANY HELD USD DENOMINATED MARKETABLE SECURITIES, MAINLY US GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. THE USD/EUR IS THE PRIMARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE FOR THESE NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  THESE MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS “AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE” AND AS SUCH, FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE ARE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS (AOCI) WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY. THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED FROM AOCI TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE SOLD.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014

, AND THE EFFECT ON FAIR VALUES OF A HYPOTHETICAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES THAT EXISTED AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014

. THE SENSITIVITIES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE BASED ON A 10 PERCENT ADVERSE CHANGE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

SINCE THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE FOR EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PORTFOLIO DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD BE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, DERIVATIVES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE GENERALLY HIGHLY RATED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED AND THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY TO LIMIT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, IT CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATES THE RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING OF ALL OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVICE DUPONT AND MONITORS ACTUAL EXPOSURES VERSUS ESTABLISHED LIMITS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT SUSTAINED CREDIT LOSSES FROM INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

THE COMPANY'S SALES ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, NO ONE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER BALANCE REPRESENTED MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES BALANCE. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS RECEIVABLES BALANCE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC, INDUSTRY AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS STRONG CREDIT CONTROLS IN EVALUATING AND GRANTING CUSTOMER CREDIT. AS A RESULT, IT MAY REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMERS PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. LENGTH OF TERMS FOR CUSTOMER CREDIT VARIES BY INDUSTRY AND REGION.

NONE.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES TO GIVE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY'S REPORTS FILED OR SUBMITTED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT) IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE RULES AND FORMS OF THE SEC. THESE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ALSO GIVE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN SUCH REPORTS IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO MANAGEMENT TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO), TOGETHER WITH MANAGEMENT, CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES PURSUANT TO RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CEO AND CFO CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE.

THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT OCCURRED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2015

THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY'S SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

(SEE PAGE F-2).

ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COMMITTED RECEIVABLE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT OF UP TO $1 BILLION (THE REPURCHASE FACILITY) THAT EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 30, 2016.  UNDER THE REPURCHASE FACILITY, THE COMPANY MAY SELL A PORTFOLIO OF AVAILABLE AND ELIGIBLE OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER NOTES RECEIVABLES WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT TO PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY AGREE TO REPURCHASE AT A FUTURE DATE.  THE REPURCHASE FACILITY IS CONSIDERED A SECURED BORROWING WITH THE CUSTOMER NOTES RECEIVABLES, INCLUSIVE OF THOSE THAT ARE SOLD AND REPURCHASED, EQUAL TO 105% OF THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS BORROWED UTILIZED AS COLLATERAL.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE REPURCHASE FACILITY WILL HAVE AN INTEREST RATE OF LIBOR + 0.75%.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) AND ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP. THE PURPOSE OF THEIR AUDIT IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP. THEIR REPORT IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

I.

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

II.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATION OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

III.

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITIONS, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS WHICH MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES MAY CAUSE VARIATION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

. BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT AND THOSE CRITERIA, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, HAS AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A) (2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013) ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN "MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING" APPEARING ON PAGE F-2.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER NOTES THAT FOLLOW, ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY, SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IS MAINTAINED AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  FOR THOSE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP IS LESS THAN 100 PERCENT, THE OUTSIDE STOCKHOLDERS' INTERESTS ARE SHOWN AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT NOT A CONTROLLING INTEREST ARE CARRIED ON THE EQUITY METHOD.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014

, THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONS OF VIES FOR WHICH DUPONT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED WITH CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING THAT ARE VIES.  THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, AS THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE VIES DOES NOT PROVIDE IT THE POWER TO DIRECT THE VIES SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES.  FUTURE EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THESE VIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE COMPANY BECOMES THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014

, THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS RELATED TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED VIES IS NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR'S DATA HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR'S PRESENTATION.

ON JULY 1, 2015, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT THROUGH THE SPIN-OFF OF ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING STOCK OF THE CHEMOURS COMPANY (CHEMOURS).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS MAY NOT EQUAL THE TOTAL COMPANY EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS DUE TO ROUNDING.  THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT ARE PRESENTED AS ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  THE CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT HAVE NOT BEEN SEGREGATED AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT ARE CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED OR EXCLUDED FROM THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THE RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM.  SEE NOTE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THE COMPANY REVISED ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT JANUARY 1, 2013 TO ADJUST FOR CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF

$97

AND PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES OF

$54

THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN PRIOR YEARS.  THE REVISION RESULTED IN A

$151

DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN REINVESTED EARNINGS.  THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION WAS RELATED TO AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE EXCHANGE RATES USED BY A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY IN THE TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO U.S. DOLLAR (USD) IN PRIOR YEARS.  SEE FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES IN NOTE 18.  THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S CURRENT OR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS (WHICH REPRESENTED A REPORTABLE SEGMENT).  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE COATINGS ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND, AS SUCH, HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND SEGMENT RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE COATINGS BUSINESS HAVE NOT BEEN SEGREGATED AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RESPECTIVELY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  SEE NOTE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE FROM THE SALE OF A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD. REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES IS RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY, WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED, COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND PRICING IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE. A MAJORITY OF PRODUCT SALES ARE SOLD FOB (FREE ON BOARD) SHIPPING POINT OR, WITH RESPECT TO NON UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.) CUSTOMERS, AN EQUIVALENT BASIS.  ACCRUALS ARE MADE FOR SALES RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A REDUCTION IN SALES AND NONCASH SALES INCENTIVES AS A CHARGE TO COST OF GOODS SOLD OR SELLING EXPENSE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE INCENTIVE. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE DELIVERY OF GOODS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. TAXES ON REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.

THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO PREPAYMENT CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IN THE AGRICULTURE SEGMENT AND RECEIVES ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PRODUCT TO BE DELIVERED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THESE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE (CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES) OR DEBT, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AND TITLE, OWNERSHIP AND RISK OF LOSS PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.

LICENSING AND ROYALTY INCOME IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON TERMS, WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED, THE AMOUNT IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

COST OF GOODS SOLD

COST OF GOODS SOLD PRIMARILY INCLUDES THE COST OF MANUFACTURE AND DELIVERY, INGREDIENTS OR RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS AND OVERHEAD.

OTHER OPERATING CHARGES

OTHER OPERATING CHARGES INCLUDES PRODUCT CLAIM CHARGES AND RECOVERIES, NON-CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL PROJECTS AND OTHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES, COMMISSIONS, FUNCTIONAL COSTS, AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT EXPENSES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS FROM TIME OF PURCHASE. THEY ARE CARRIED AT COST PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT INVESTMENTS IN FIXED AND FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN

THREE

MONTHS AND UP TO

TWELVE

MONTHS AT TIME OF PURCHASE.  INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY ARE RECORDED AT AMORTIZED COST.  THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE INVESTMENT.  INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE CARRIED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WAS ESTABLISHED THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS) AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS). A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT'S LEVEL WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ANY INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING VALUATION TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FOR ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 1

–

QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES;

LEVEL 2

–

SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G. QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ITEMS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ITEMS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE SUCH AS INTEREST RATE AND YIELD CURVES, AND MARKET-CORROBORATED INPUTS);

LEVEL 3

–

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

INVENTORIES

THE COMPANY'S INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.  ELEMENTS OF COST IN INVENTORIES INCLUDE RAW MATERIALS, DIRECT LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. STORES AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR MARKET, WHICHEVER IS LOWER; COST IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY THE AVERAGE COST METHOD.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

APPROXIMATELY

55

,

30

AND

15 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANY’S INVENTORIES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FIRST-IN FIRST OUT (FIFO), AVERAGE COST AND LAST-IN FIRST OUT (LIFO) METHODS, RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014

APPROXIMATELY

60

,

25

AND

15 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANY’S INVENTORIES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FIFO, AVERAGE COST AND LIFO METHODS, RESPECTIVELY.  INVENTORIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FIFO METHOD ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS WITH SHORTER SHELF LIVES SUCH AS SEEDS, CERTAIN FOOD-INGREDIENTS AND ENZYMES.

THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ALLOWANCES FOR OBSOLESCENCE OF INVENTORY BASED UPON QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS CARRIED AT COST AND IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUIPMENT AND BUILDINGS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM

15

TO

25

YEARS. CAPITALIZABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

5

TO

7

YEARS. WHEN ASSETS ARE SURRENDERED, RETIRED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, THEIR GROSS CARRYING VALUES AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDED IN DETERMINING GAIN OR LOSS ON SUCH DISPOSALS.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS; REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE FUTURE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARISING FROM OTHER ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIED AND SEPARATELY RECOGNIZED. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY; HOWEVER, THESE TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.  IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUES.

DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PURCHASED AND LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, PATENTS AND CUSTOMER LISTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

20

YEARS OR AMORTIZED BASED ON UNITS OF PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE REASONABLENESS OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF THESE ASSETS. ONCE THESE ASSETS ARE FULLY AMORTIZED, THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

F-10

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET GROUP IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE TOTAL PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSETS ARE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE AND ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET. THE COMPANY'S FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY IS AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR MARKET VALUE WHICH IS MADE BASED ON PRICES OF SIMILAR ASSETS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR USE UNTIL THEIR DISPOSAL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR MARKET VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. DEPRECIATION IS DISCONTINUED FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCLUDES COSTS (PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF EMPLOYEE COSTS, MATERIALS, CONTRACT SERVICES, RESEARCH AGREEMENTS, AND OTHER EXTERNAL SPEND) RELATING TO THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, ENHANCEMENT OF EXISTING PRODUCTS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL OF NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS.

ROYALTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY’S AGRICULTURE SEGMENT CURRENTLY HAS CERTAIN THIRD PARTY BIOTECHNOLOGY TRAIT LICENSE AGREEMENTS, WHICH REQUIRE UP-FRONT AND VARIABLE PAYMENTS SUBJECT TO THE LICENSOR MEETING CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THESE PAYMENTS ARE REFLECTED AS PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS AND ARE AMORTIZED TO COST OF GOODS SOLD AS SEEDS CONTAINING THE RESPECTIVE TRAIT TECHNOLOGY ARE UTILIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE LICENSE.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PREPAID ROYALTIES WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

ENVIRONMENTAL

ACCRUALS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACCRUED LIABILITIES DO NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES AND ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE ALSO CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNLESS THEY INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OR REDUCE OR PREVENT CONTAMINATION FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, IN WHICH CASE, THEY ARE CAPITALIZED.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. ACCRETION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE USING THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT WHEN THE LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED. THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET, GENERALLY FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

1

TO

25

YEARS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO LITIGATION MATTERS WHEN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. LEGAL COSTS SUCH AS OUTSIDE COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE

THE COMPANY SELF-INSURES CERTAIN RISKS WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR REGULATION, INCLUDING WORKERS' COMPENSATION, VEHICLE LIABILITY AND EMPLOYEE RELATED BENEFITS. LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS ARE ESTIMATED IN PART BY CONSIDERING HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. FOR OTHER RISKS, THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF INSURANCE AND SELF-INSURANCE, REFLECTING COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF RELEVANT RISKS.  A RECEIVABLE FOR AN INSURANCE RECOVERY IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LOSS HAS OCCURRED AND COLLECTION IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE.

E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED TAXES REPRESENT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED TO OCCUR WHEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERED OR PAID. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REPRESENTS INCOME TAXES PAID OR PAYABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR PLUS THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES DURING THE YEAR. DEFERRED TAXES RESULT FROM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASIS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS WHEN CHANGES ARE ENACTED. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RECORDED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR INCOME TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EXCEPT FOR SUBSIDIARIES IN WHICH EARNINGS ARE DEEMED TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED. INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS OR GRANTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD EARNED (THE FLOW-THROUGH METHOD). INTEREST ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS INCLUDED IN MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET, WITHIN OTHER INCOME, NET. INCOME TAX RELATED PENALTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS UTILIZE THE U.S. DOLLAR (USD) OR LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, WHERE APPLICABLE. THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES ITS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FOREIGN ENTITIES AND GROUPS THE FOREIGN ENTITIES INTO TWO CATEGORIES: 1) EXTENSION OF THE PARENT (USD FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY) AND 2) SELF-CONTAINED (LOCAL FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY). IF A FOREIGN ENTITY DOES NOT ALIGN WITH EITHER CATEGORY, FACTORS ARE EVALUATED AND A JUDGMENT IS MADE TO DETERMINE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

FOR FOREIGN ENTITIES WHERE THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSET AND LIABILITY AMOUNTS ARE RE-MEASURED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH ARE RE-MEASURED AT HISTORICAL RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE RE-MEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE YEAR, EXCEPT FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS RE-MEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM RE-MEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

FOR FOREIGN ENTITIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES AND THE RESULTANT TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED, NET OF THEIR RELATED TAX EFFECTS, AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN EQUITY. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCY ARE RE-MEASURED INTO THE LOCAL CURRENCY PRIOR TO TRANSLATION INTO USD AND THE RESULTANT EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED INTO USD AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD.

THE COMPANY CHANGES THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF ITS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FOREIGN ENTITIES ONLY WHEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE CLEARLY THAT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY HAS CHANGED. AS A RESULT OF THE SEPARATION OF ITS PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT, COUPLED WITH THE COMPANY’S REDESIGN INITIATIVE, THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AT CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN ENTITIES WAS RE-EVALUATED WHICH, IN SOME CASES, HAS RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN THE FOREIGN ENTITIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DURING 2015.

VENEZUELAN FOREIGN CURRENCY

VENEZUELA IS CONSIDERED A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY UNDER GAAP AND THE USD IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES IN VENEZUELA.  THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE CONTINUES TO BE SET THROUGH THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR FOREIGN COMMERCE (CENCOEX, PREVIOUSLY CADIVI). BASED ON ITS EVALUATION OF THE RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS AFFECTING THE AVAILABILITY OF SPECIFIC EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISMS, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014 THAT THE ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY EXCHANGE SYSTEM (SICAD 2) AUCTION PROCESS WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY MECHANISM AVAILABLE.   AS A RESULT, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY CHANGED FROM THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE TO THE SICAD 2 EXCHANGE RATE, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF

$58

HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE OFFSET IN THE INCOME STATEMENT BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGE IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) UNTIL IT IS CLEARED TO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ALL HEDGES IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.

IN THE EVENT THAT A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT OR AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED AT TERMINATION ARE DEFERRED AND INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A HEDGED TRANSACTION MATURES, OR IS SOLD, EXTINGUISHED, OR TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A DERIVATIVE DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF SUCH TRANSACTION, GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE THROUGH THE DATE THE TRANSACTION MATURED ARE INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AND THE DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ARE RECLASSIFIED AS FOR TRADING PURPOSES IF THE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER PROBABLE.

CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS EITHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. CASH FLOWS FROM ALL OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 20 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED IN 2015

IN APRIL 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE AMENDING EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS REPORTING WILL BE LIMITED TO DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS THAT REPRESENT STRATEGIC SHIFTS HAVING A MAJOR EFFECT ON OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE ALSO ENHANCES DISCLOSURES AND REQUIRES ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A DISCONTINUED OPERATION TO BE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. PUBLIC ENTITIES WILL APPLY THE AMENDED GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL DISPOSALS OCCURRING WITHIN ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2014 AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2015.  DUE TO THE CHANGE IN REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURES OF DISPOSAL TRANSACTIONS AFTER ADOPTION MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN UNDER PREVIOUS STANDARDS.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO BE IMPLEMENTED

IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE (ASU) NO. 2015-17, INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740), BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES.  THE AMENDMENTS UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRE THAT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS BE CLASSIFIED AS NONCURRENT IN A CLASSIFIED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS.  EARLIER APPLICATION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES AS OF THE BEGINNING OF AN INTERIM OR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU MAY BE APPLIED EITHER PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY IS EARLY ADOPTING THIS GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS.

IN MAY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-07, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820), DISCLOSURES FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ENTITIES THAT CALCULATE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE OR ITS EQUIVALENT.  THIS GUIDANCE REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT TO CATEGORIZE WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ALL INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE IS MEASURED USING THE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT. THE GUIDANCE ALSO REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES FOR ALL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE USING THE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT. RATHER, THOSE DISCLOSURES ARE LIMITED TO INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH THE ENTITY HAS ELECTED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE USING THAT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT.  THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS.  A REPORTING ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE AMENDMENTS RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMISSIBLE.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THIS GUIDANCE WILL ONLY IMPACT DISCLOSURE AND WILL NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)

IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-02 CONSOLIDATION (TOPIC 810), AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS.  THE AMENDMENTS UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE MODIFY THE EVALUATION OF WHETHER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND SIMILAR LEGAL ENTITIES ARE VIES OR VOTING INTEREST ENTITIES AND ELIMINATE THE PRESUMPTION THAT A GENERAL PARTNER SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2015.  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN AN INTERIM PERIOD. A REPORTING ENTITY ALSO MAY APPLY THE AMENDMENTS RETROSPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN MAY 2014, THE FASB AND THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB) JOINTLY ISSUED ASU NO. 2014-9, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606), WHICH CLARIFIES THE PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE AND DEVELOPS A COMMON REVENUE STANDARD FOR GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS).  THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE GUIDANCE IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES.  IN JULY 2015, THE FASB APPROVED A DEFERRAL OF THE ASU EFFECTIVE DATE FROM ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2016 TO ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER 2015, A

$38

PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED IN EMPLOYEE SEPARATION / ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET WITHIN THE OTHER SEGMENT IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS.  THE MAJORITY RELATES TO A COST BASIS INVESTMENT IN WHICH THE ASSESSMENT RESULTED FROM THE VENTURE'S REVISED OPERATING PLAN REFLECTING UNDERPERFORMANCE OF ITS EUROPEAN WHEAT BASED ETHANOL FACILITY AND DETERIORATING EUROPEAN ETHANOL MARKET CONDITIONS.  ONE OF THE PRIMARY INVESTORS COMMUNICATED THAT THEY WOULD NOT FUND THE REVISED OPERATING PLAN OF THE INVESTEE.  AS A RESULT, THE CARRYING VALUE OF DUPONT'S

6 PERCENT

COST BASIS INVESTMENT IN THIS VENTURE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE BY

$37

, SUCH THAT AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2013, AS A RESULT OF STRATEGIC DECISIONS RELATED TO THE THIN FILM PHOTOVOLTAIC MARKET, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IMPAIRMENT TRIGGERING EVENTS HAD OCCURRED AND THAT ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSET GROUP RELATED TO ITS THIN FILM PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES AND SYSTEMS WERE WARRANTED.  THESE ASSESSMENTS DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDED ITS FAIR VALUE.  AS A RESULT OF THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS,

$129

OF PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECORDED DURING 2013 WITHIN THE ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACTS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014 AND 2013.  THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE, ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS, THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON NET MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS.  THE HEDGING PROGRAM GAINS ARE LARGELY TAXABLE IN THE U.S., WHEREAS THE OFFSETTING EXCHANGE LOSSES ON THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE NET MONETARY ASSET POSITIONS ARE OFTEN NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE IN THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THE NET PRE-TAX EXCHANGE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET AND THE RELATED TAX IMPACT IS RECORDED IN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS.

THE DECREASE IN PRE-TAX EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FROM 2014 TO 2015 IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER WORLDWIDE SALES VOLUME, THE ABSENCE OF 2014 GAINS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., HIGHER EMPLOYEE SEPARATION/ASSET RELATED CHARGES, AS WELL AS THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY’S HEDGING PROGRAM.

IN

2015

AND

2014

, THE U.S. RECORDED A NET EXCHANGE GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEDGING PROGRAM OF

$434

AND

$607

, RESPECTIVELY.  WHILE THE TAXATION OF THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED ON THE CHART ABOVE DOES NOT CORRESPOND PRECISELY TO THE JURISDICTION OF TAXATION (DUE TO TAXATION IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES, EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES, ETC.), IT REPRESENTS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES SPLIT BETWEEN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. SEE NOTE 20 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S HEDGING PROGRAM.

UNDER THE TAX LAWS OF VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, DEDUCTIONS OR CREDITS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY UTILIZED FOR TAX PURPOSES DURING THE CURRENT YEAR MAY BE CARRIED FORWARD OR BACK, SUBJECT TO STATUTORY LIMITATIONS, TO REDUCE TAXABLE INCOME OR TAXES PAYABLE IN FUTURE OR PRIOR YEARS.

EACH YEAR THE COMPANY FILES HUNDREDS OF TAX RETURNS IN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXING JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THESE TAX RETURNS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND POSSIBLE CHALLENGE BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES. POSITIONS CHALLENGED BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES MAY BE SETTLED OR APPEALED BY THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AN UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT NET REDUCTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD BE IN THE RANGE OF

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, COMM

ERCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ANTITRUST LAWSUITS.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS.  ALTHOUGH CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY.  HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES COULD BE MATERIAL TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD RECOGNIZED.

PFOA

DUPONT USED PFOA (COLLECTIVELY, PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACIDS AND ITS SALTS, INCLUDING THE AMMONIUM SALT), AS A PROCESSING AID TO MANUFACTURE SOME FLUOROPOLYMER RESINS AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING ITS WASHINGTON WORKS PLANT IN WEST VIRGINIA. AT

$20

CORRESPONDING TO THE ACCRUAL BALANCE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

THE ACCRUAL INCLUDES CHARGES RELATED TO DUPONT'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND VOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS TO THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.  THESE OBLIGATIONS AND VOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS INCLUDE SURVEYING, SAMPLING AND TESTING DRINKING WATER IN AND AROUND CERTAIN COMPANY SITES AND OFFERING TREATMENT OR AN ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER IF TESTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF PFOA IN DRINKING WATER AT OR GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY.

DRINKING WATER ACTIONS

IN AUGUST 2001, A CLASS ACTION, CAPTIONED LEACH V DUPONT, WAS FILED IN WEST VIRGINIA STATE COURT ALLEGING THAT RESIDENTS LIVING NEAR THE WASHINGTON WORKS FACILITY HAD SUFFERED, OR MAY SUFFER, DELETERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER.

DUPONT AND ATTORNEYS FOR THE CLASS REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN 2004 THAT BINDS ABOUT

80,000

RESIDENTS. IN 2005, DUPONT PAID THE PLAINTIFFS’ ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES OF

$23

AND MADE A PAYMENT OF

$70

, WHICH CLASS COUNSEL DESIGNATED TO FUND A COMMUNITY HEALTH PROJECT.  THE COMPANY FUNDED A SERIES OF HEALTH STUDIES WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2012 BY AN INDEPENDENT SCIENCE PANEL OF EXPERTS (THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL). THE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITIES EXPOSED TO PFOA TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON WHETHER ANY PROBABLE LINK EXISTS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND HUMAN DISEASE.

THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL FOUND PROBABLE LINKS, AS DEFINED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO PFOA AND PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, INCLUDING PREECLAMPSIA; KIDNEY CANCER; TESTICULAR CANCER; THYROID DISEASE; ULCERATIVE COLITIS; AND DIAGNOSED HIGH CHOLESTEROL.

IN MAY 2013, A PANEL OF THREE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL DOCTORS RELEASED ITS INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OF ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS.  IN SEPTEMBER 2014, THE MEDICAL PANEL RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING THREE YEARS AFTER INITIAL TESTING, BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RESULTS.  THE MEDICAL PANEL HAS NOT COMMUNICATED ITS ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETION OF ITS PROTOCOL.  THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO FUND UP TO

$235

FOR A MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS AND, IN ADDITION, ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING CLASS COUNSEL FEES.  IN JANUARY 2012, THE COMPANY PUT

$1

IN AN ESCROW ACCOUNT TO FUND MEDICAL MONITORING AS REQUIRED BY THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.  THE COURT APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL MONITORING HAS ESTABLISHED THE PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT THE MEDICAL PANEL'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, AS WELL AS ELIGIBILITY SCREENING, IS ONGOING. DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING AND TESTING HAS BEGUN AND ASSOCIATED PAYMENTS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE BEING DISBURSED FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WATER TREATMENT DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PFOA IN WATER TO SIX AREA WATER DISTRICTS, INCLUDING THE LITTLE HOCKING WATER ASSOCIATION (LHWA), AND PRIVATE WELL USERS.

CLASS MEMBERS MAY PURSUE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AGAINST DUPONT ONLY FOR THOSE HUMAN DISEASES FOR WHICH THE C8 SCIENCE PANEL DETERMINED A PROBABLE LINK EXISTS. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY

3,500

LAWSUITS FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS IN OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT

600

OVER YEAR END

2014

.  THESE LAWSUITS ARE CONSOLIDATED IN MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION IN OHIO FEDERAL COURT (MDL).  BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY, THE MAJORITY OF THE LAWSUITS ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND THYROID DISEASE FROM EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER.  THERE ARE

37

LAWSUITS ALLEGING WRONGFUL DEATH.  IN 2014,

SIX

PLAINTIFFS FROM THE MDL WERE SELECTED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TRIAL.  THE JURY AWARDED

$1.6

IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL TRIAL, CAPTIONED BARTLETT V DUPONT, WHICH WAS TRIED TO A VERDICT IN OCTOBER 2015.  THE PLAINTIFF ALLEGED THAT EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER HAD CAUSED KIDNEY CANCER.  DUPONT, THROUGH CHEMOURS, IS APPEALING THE DECISION.  THE SECOND TRIAL, CAPTIONED WOLF V DUPONT, WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN MARCH 2016 AND INVOLVES ALLEGATIONS THAT EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER CAUSED ULCERATIVE COLITIS.  A CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT FOR AN INCONSEQUENTIAL AMOUNT WAS REACHED IN JANUARY 2016.  IN JANUARY 2016, THE COURT DETERMINED THAT

40

CASES, MOST OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO INVOLVE ALLEGATIONS THAT EXPOSURE TO PFOA IN DRINKING WATER CAUSED CANCER, WOULD BE SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2017, BEGINNING IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR. DUPONT, THROUGH CHEMOURS, DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS IN THESE LAWSUITS AND IS DEFENDING ITSELF VIGOROUSLY.

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS

AN OHIO ACTION BROUGHT BY THE LHWA CLAIMS, “IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO HEALTH AND OR THE ENVIRONMENT” UNDER THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT (RCRA) IN ADDITION TO GENERAL CLAIMS OF PFOA CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER.  PURSUANT TO THE ORDER OF THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO, THE CASE, SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN JANUARY 2016, WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRIAL DOCKET.

PFOA SUMMARY

WHILE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL INCUR LIABILITIES RELATED TO FUNDING THE MEDICAL MONITORING PROGRAM, SUCH LIABILITIES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION BY ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS AND THE SCOPE OF TESTING.  DUPONT BELIEVES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE OTHER PFOA MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE; HOWEVER, A RANGE OF SUCH LIABILITIES, IF ANY, CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME, DUE TO THE UNIQUENESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MDL PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS AND THE COMPANY'S DEFENSES TO THOSE CLAIMS BOTH AS TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY AND DAMAGES ON AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS BASIS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED BY CHEMOURS FOR THESE PFOA MATTERS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONTINGENCIES PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IN THE FUTURE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO CORRECT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF PRIOR DISPOSAL PRACTICES OR RELEASES OF CHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM SUBSTANCES BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER PARTIES. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY SET FORTH IN NOTE 1.  MUCH OF THIS LIABILITY RESULTS FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT (CERCLA, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SUPERFUND), RCRA AND SIMILAR STATE AND GLOBAL LAWS. THESE LAWS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN INVESTIGATIVE, REMEDIATION AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES AT SITES WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS OR ONCE CONDUCTED OPERATIONS OR AT SITES WHERE COMPANY-GENERATED WASTE WAS DISPOSED.  THE ACCRUAL ALSO INCLUDES ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF SITES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY FOR WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION WILL BE REQUIRED, BUT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN DURATION AND COST FROM SITE TO SITE. THESE ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED COSTS, DEPEND ON THE MIX OF UNIQUE SITE CHARACTERISTICS, EVOLVING REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES, DIVERSE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.  AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED A LIABILITY OF

$492

, RELATING TO THESE MATTERS AND, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, IS APPROPRIATE BASED ON EXISTING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE AVERAGE TIME FRAME, OVER WHICH THE ACCRUED OR PRESENTLY UNRECOGNIZED AMOUNTS MAY BE PAID, BASED ON PAST HISTORY, IS ESTIMATED TO BE

15

-

20

YEARS.  CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE COSTS AND, UNDER ADVERSE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY MAY RANGE UP TO

$1,000

ABOVE THE AMOUNT ACCRUED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

.  PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3, THE COMPANY IS INDEMNIFIED BY CHEMOURS FOR CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, INCLUDED IN THE LIABILITY OF

$492

, THAT HAVE AN ESTIMATED LIABILITY OF

$291

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND A POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT RANGES UP TO APPROXIMATELY

$610

THE INCREASE IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT LOSSES OVER PRIOR YEAR FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, IS DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTHENING USD AGAINST PRIMARILY THE EURO AND BRAZILIAN REAL.  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE INCREASE OVER PRIOR YEAR IS ALSO DUE TO CHANGES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN ENTITY'S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1.

2.

THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT CHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME EXCLUDING CHANGES DUE TO RECLASSIFYING AMOUNTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS.

3.

THESE ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME COMPONENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST OF THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.  SEE NOTE 18 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

4.

THE UNREALIZED LOSS ON SECURITIES DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 IS DUE TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF USD DENOMINATED MARKETABLE SECURITIES HELD BY CERTAIN FOREIGN ENTITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 WITH A CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT.

18.  LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE COMPANY OFFERS VARIOUS LONG-TERM BENEFITS TO ITS EMPLOYEES. WHERE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE, MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE THE PLANS.

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS

THE COMPANY HAS BOTH FUNDED AND UNFUNDED NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING A MAJORITY OF THE U.S. EMPLOYEES. MOST EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. THE BENEFITS UNDER THESE PLANS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYEES' PAY NEAR RETIREMENT. THE COMPANY'S FUNDING POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  PENSION COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY'S NON-U.S. CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IS PROVIDED, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH SEPARATE PLANS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER SUCH PLANS ARE FUNDED BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH TRUSTEES, COVERED BY INSURANCE CONTRACTS, OR REMAIN UNFUNDED.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$32

(

$21

AFTER-TAX) DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, WHICH RELATED TO SETTLEMENTS THAT OCCURRED IN PRIOR PERIODS.  IN ADDITION, ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AT JANUARY 1, 2013 HAS BEEN REVISED TO ADJUST FOR

$54

, AFTER-TAX, FOR SETTLEMENT CHARGES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN PREVIOUS PERIODS WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN REINVESTED EARNINGS.  THE SETTLEMENT CHARGES WERE RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PENSION RESTORATION PLAN WHICH PROVIDES FOR LUMP SUM PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN ELIGIBLE RETIREES.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES PENSION SETTLEMENTS WHEN LUMP SUM PAYMENTS EXCEED THE SUM OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST OF THE PLAN FOR THE YEAR.  THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S CURRENT OR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

THE PARENT COMPANY AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES PROVIDE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. THE ASSOCIATED PLANS FOR RETIREE BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AND THE COST OF THE APPROVED CLAIMS IS PAID FROM COMPANY FUNDS. ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE COST AND LIABILITIES FOR THESE RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS.  THE NON-MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS CONTRIBUTORY WITH PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS' CONTRIBUTIONS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY TO ACHIEVE A 50/50 TARGET SHARING OF COST INCREASES BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS. IN ADDITION, LIMITS ARE APPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S PORTION OF THE RETIREE MEDICAL COST COVERAGE.  FOR MEDICARE ELIGIBLE PENSIONERS AND SURVIVORS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES A COMPANY-FUNDED HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENT (HRA). BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015, ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE ON AND AFTER THAT DATE WILL RECEIVE THE SAME LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PAYMENT, REGARDLESS OF AGE. THE MAJORITIES OF U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL, DENTAL AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES DISABILITY BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE DISABILITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE INSURED IN MANY COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., SUCH PLANS ARE GENERALLY SELF-INSURED. OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSES FOR SELF-INSURED PLANS ARE REFLECTED IN THE FIGURES BELOW.

IN THE U.S., THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DEVELOPED BY MATCHING THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE BENEFIT PLANS TO A YIELD CURVE CONSTRUCTED FROM A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PLAN'S ACTUARY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FOR NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES PREVAILING LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND INDICES TO DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IN THE U.S. WAS SELECTED FROM WITHIN THE REASONABLE RANGE OF RATES DETERMINED BY HISTORICAL REAL RETURNS (NET OF INFLATION) FOR THE ASSET CLASSES COVERED BY THE INVESTMENT POLICY, EXPECTED PERFORMANCE, AND PROJECTIONS OF INFLATION OVER THE LONG-TERM PERIOD DURING WHICH BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR YEARS, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. REFLECTS THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN AND THE EFFECT OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLANS' ASSETS.  FOR NON-U.S. PLANS, ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS APPLICABLE TO EACH COUNTRY.

IN OCTOBER 2014, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RELEASED FINAL REPORTS OF NEW MORTALITY TABLES AND A MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE FOR MEASUREMENT OF RETIREMENT PROGRAM OBLIGATIONS IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THESE TABLES IN MEASURING THE 2014 LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.  IN OCTOBER 2015, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES RELEASED AN UPDATED MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE REFLECTING A DECLINE IN LONGEVITY PROJECTION FROM THE OCTOBER 2014 RELEASE.

PLAN ASSETS

ALL PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN THE U.S. ARE INVESTED THROUGH A SINGLE MASTER TRUST FUND. THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THIS TRUST FUND IS APPROVED BY MANAGEMENT. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES GUIDING U.S. PENSION ASSET INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE THOSE EMBODIED IN THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (ERISA). THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE DISCHARGING THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE "PRUDENT EXPERT" STANDARD AND OTHER ERISA RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE TARGETS AND APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS FOR SIGNIFICANT ASSET CLASSES WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING A PRUDENT BALANCE BETWEEN RETURN AND RISK. STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SELECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE COUNTRIES. WHERE APPROPRIATE, ASSET LIABILITY STUDIES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCESS. U.S. PLAN ASSETS AND A PORTION OF NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. THE REMAINING ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL INVESTMENT FIRMS UNRELATED TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S PENSION INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS HAVE DISCRETION TO MANAGE THE ASSETS WITHIN ESTABLISHED ASSET ALLOCATION RANGES APPROVED BY MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, PENSION TRUST FUNDS ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS "DERIVATIVES". DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE SPECIFIC MARKET RISKS, HEDGE CURRENCY AND ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE TARGET ALLOCATION FOR PLAN ASSETS OF THE COMPANY'S U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

THE COMPANY SPONSORS SEVERAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS, WHICH COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN (THE PLAN). THIS PLAN INCLUDES A NON-LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). EMPLOYEES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ESOP AND THOSE WHO DO ARE FREE TO DIVERSIFY OUT OF THE ESOP. THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE RETIREMENT SAVINGS BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES AND TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY. THE PLAN IS A TAX QUALIFIED CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING PLAN, WITH CASH OR DEFERRED ARRANGEMENT AND ANY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

100 PERCENT

OF THE FIRST

6 PERCENT

OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION ELECTION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES

3 PERCENT

OF EACH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE'S ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE EMPLOYEE'S CONTRIBUTION.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETED SEPARATION OF THE PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS SEGMENT THROUGH THE SPIN-OFF OF ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING STOCK OF CHEMOURS, THE PROVISIONS OF OUR EXISTING COMPENSATION PLANS REQUIRED ADJUSTMENTS TO THE NUMBER AND TERMS OF OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), TIME-VESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (PSUS) TO PRESERVE THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE AWARDS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE SEPARATION. THE OUTSTANDING AWARDS WILL CONTINUE TO VEST OVER THE ORIGINAL VESTING PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THREE YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. OUTSTANDING AWARDS AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF WERE CONVERTED INTO AWARDS OF THE HOLDER’S EMPLOYER FOLLOWING SEPARATION.

THE STOCK AWARDS HELD AS OF JULY 1, 2015 WERE ADJUSTED AS FOLLOWS.

•

THE NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS WERE INCREASED AND THE EXERCISE PRICE WAS DECREASED TO MAINTAIN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND RIGHTS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE SPIN-OFF. A COMPARISON OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OUTSTANDING OPTION AWARDS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE SPIN-OFF RESULTED IN

$3

OF INCREMENTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO FULLY VESTED STOCK OPTION AWARDS AND WAS EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY.

•

THE NUMBER OF RSUS AND PSUS WERE INCREASED TO PRESERVE THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF SUCH AWARDS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO SEPARATION.  THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY INCREMENTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE CONVERSION OF THESE AWARDS.

IN APRIL 2011, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO THE DUPONT EQUITY AND INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP). THE EIP PROVIDES FOR EQUITY-BASED AND CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AND CONSULTANTS. UNDER THE AMENDED EIP, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR THE GRANT OR SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS IS

110 MILLION

SHARES, PROVIDED THAT EACH SHARE IN EXCESS OF

30 MILLION

THAT IS ISSUED WITH RESPECT TO ANY AWARD THAT IS NOT AN OPTION OR STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE

110 MILLION

SHARE LIMIT AS FOUR AND ONE-HALF SHARES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, APPROXIMATELY

40 MILLION

SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANTS UNDER THE COMPANY'S EIP. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS AND PSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF DUPONT COMMON STOCK.

THE COMPANY'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE MIX, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, RSUS AND PSUS AND MAY AUTHORIZE NEW GRANTS ANNUALLY.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE EXERCISE PRICE OF SHARES SUBJECT TO OPTION IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2004 EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT; OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2008 SERIALLY VESTED OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND CARRY A SIX-YEAR OPTION TERM. STOCK OPTION AWARDS GRANTED BETWEEN 2009 AND

2015

EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. THE PLAN ALLOWS RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO RETAIN ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING GRANT DATE.

FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AWARDS, THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE ASSUMPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED IN

2015

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DIVIDEND YIELD BY DIVIDING THE CURRENT ANNUAL DIVIDEND ON THE COMPANY'S STOCK BY THE OPTION EXERCISE PRICE. A HISTORICAL DAILY MEASUREMENT OF VOLATILITY IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION GRANTED. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE YIELD ON AN OUTSTANDING U.S. TREASURY NOTE WITH A TERM EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION GRANTED. EXPECTED LIFE IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

FOR STOCK OPTIONS OUTSTANDING PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICES IN THE TABLE BELOW REFLECT THE HISTORICAL EXERCISE PRICES. STOCK OPTION AWARDS AS OF

RSUS AND PSUS

THE COMPANY ISSUES RSUS THAT SERIALLY VEST OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD AND, UPON VESTING, CONVERT ONE-FOR-ONE TO DUPONT COMMON STOCK. A RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE RETAINS ANY GRANTED AWARDS UPON RETIREMENT PROVIDED THE EMPLOYEE HAS RENDERED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE. ADDITIONAL RSUS ARE ALSO GRANTED PERIODICALLY TO KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. THESE RSUS GENERALLY VEST OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM

TWO

TO

FIVE

YEARS. THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL STOCK-SETTLED RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE GRANT DATE.

THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTS PSUS TO SENIOR LEADERSHIP. IN

2015

, THERE WERE

309,042

PSUS GRANTED. VESTING FOR PSUS GRANTED IN 2015 IS EQUALLY BASED UPON YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING NET INCOME RELATIVE TO TARGET AND TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) RELATIVE TO PEER COMPANIES.  OPERATING NET INCOME IS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DUPONT EXCLUDING INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AFTER TAXES, SIGNIFICANT AFTER TAX BENEFITS (CHARGES), AND NON-OPERATING PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS. VESTING FOR PSUS GRANTED IN

2014

AND

20.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS (DERIVATIVES) TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS.  THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VARIETY OF DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS TO BE UTILIZED FOR FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT. THESE PROGRAMS REFLECT VARYING LEVELS OF EXPOSURE COVERAGE AND TIME HORIZONS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK.

DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS HAVE PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS AND ARE APPROVED BY THE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED ARE FORWARDS, OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT DESIGNATED ANY NONDERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES ALSO ADDRESS COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, LIMITS AND ROUTINE EXPOSURE MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MAJOR COMMODITY EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES COLLATERAL SUPPORT ANNEX AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSSES. THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS AND THEREFORE NO MATERIAL LOSS IS EXPECTED.  MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULARLY REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT.

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET ITS NET EXPOSURES, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS. THE PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVE OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN AN APPROXIMATELY BALANCED POSITION IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, NET OF RELATED TAX EFFECTS, ARE MINIMIZED.  THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HEDGE PROGRAM IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY RELATED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE MIX OF THE TOTAL DEBT PORTFOLIO AND RELATED OVERALL COST OF BORROWING.  INTEREST RATE SWAPS INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF FIXED FOR FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE DEBT INTO FLOATING RATE DEBT BASED ON USD LIBOR.  INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE A TARGET RANGE OF FLOATING RATE DEBT.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SERVE TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.  THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FORWARDS AND OPTIONS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OCCASIONALLY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OVER-THE-COUNTER AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS, TO HEDGE THE COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE COMMODITY EXPOSURES.

WHILE EACH RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME MATURITY PERIOD, MOST PROGRAMS CURRENTLY DO NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE NEXT TWO-YEAR PERIOD.  CASH FLOW HEDGE RESULTS ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED EXPOSURE IMPACTS EARNINGS. RECLASSIFICATIONS ARE MADE SOONER IF IT APPEARS THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS NOT PROBABLE OF OCCURRING.

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE ITS NET EXPOSURE, BY CURRENCY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS OPERATIONS SO THAT EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ARE MINIMIZED.  THE NETTING OF SUCH EXPOSURES PRECLUDES THE USE OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING; HOWEVER, THE REQUIRED REVALUATION OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INTENDS TO ACHIEVE A MINIMAL EARNINGS IMPACT, AFTER TAXES.  THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO OFFSET A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES SO THAT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE USD VALUE OF THE RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED REVENUES.

COMMODITY CONTRACTS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAPS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON PURCHASES OF INVENTORY SUCH AS CORN, SOYBEANS AND SOYBEAN MEAL.
