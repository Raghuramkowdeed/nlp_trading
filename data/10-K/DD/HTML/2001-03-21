                                    PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

  DuPont was founded in 1802 and was incorporated in Delaware in 1915. DuPont
is a world leader in science and technology in a range of disciplines
including high-performance materials, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology. The company operates globally through some 20 strategic
business units. Within the strategic business units, approximately 90
businesses manufacture and sell a wide range of products to many different
markets, including the transportation, textile, construction, automotive,
agricultural and hybrid seeds, nutrition and health, pharmaceuticals,
packaging and electronics markets.

  The company's strategic business units are aggregated into nine reportable
segments--Agriculture & Nutrition, Nylon Enterprise, Performance Coatings &
Polymers, Pharmaceuticals, Pigments & Chemicals, Pioneer, Polyester
Enterprise, Specialty Fibers, and Specialty Polymers. The following pages,
including those pages of Exhibit 13 specifically incorporated herein, provide
perspective on these nine segments. The company's nonaligned businesses and
embryonic businesses are grouped under "Other." These businesses represent
less than 2 percent of total 2000 segment sales and are discussed on page 27
of Exhibit 13. Financial data for the segments are provided in Note 30,
"Industry Segment Information," in Exhibit 13.

  The company and its subsidiaries have operations in about 70 countries
worldwide and, as a result, about 49 percent of consolidated sales are made to
customers outside the United States. Subsidiaries and affiliates of DuPont
conduct manufacturing, seed production, or selling activities, and some are
distributors of products manufactured by the company. Total worldwide
employment at year-end 2000 was about 93,000 people.

Discontinued Operations

  On September 28, 1998, the company announced that the Board of Directors had
approved a plan to divest the company's 100 percent-owned petroleum business,
Conoco Inc. On October 21, 1998, the company's interest in Conoco was reduced
to 69.5 percent following an initial public offering of Conoco Class A common
stock. On August 6, 1999, the company completed the planned divestiture
through a tax-free split off whereby the company exchanged its 436,543,573
shares of Conoco Class B common stock for 147,980,872 shares of DuPont common
stock. The company's consolidated financial statements and notes report its
former petroleum business as discontinued operations.

Sources of Supply

  The company utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply a
wide range of raw materials, energy, supplies, services and equipment. To
assure availability, the company maintains multiple sources for fuels and most
raw materials, including hydrocarbon feedstocks. Large volume purchases are
generally procured under competitively priced supply contracts.

  With the exception of the Pharmaceuticals and Pioneer segments, a
substantial portion of sales in the segments' businesses is dependent on
hydrocarbon feedstocks. Current hydrocarbon feedstock requirements are met by
purchases from major petroleum companies. DuPont's joint venture with Equistar
Chemicals, LP manufactures and supplies a significant portion of the company's
requirements for ethylene glycol.

 Pioneer
----------
The Pioneer segment, in the hybrid seed industry, has seed production
facilities located throughout the world, in both the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres. In the production of its parent and commercial seed, Pioneer
generally provides the seed stock, detasseling and roguing labor, and certain
other production inputs. The balance of the labor, equipment, and inputs are
supplied by independent growers. Pioneer believes the availability of growers,
parent seed stock, and other inputs necessary to produce its commercial seed
is adequate for planned production levels. The principal risk in the
production of seed is the environment, with weather being the single largest
variant. Pioneer lessens this risk by distributing production across many
locations around the world. Due to its global presence, the company can engage
in seed production year-round.

  In addition, during 2000, the company consumed substantial amounts of
electricity and natural gas for energy.

  In June 1997, DuPont formed alliances with Computer Sciences Corporation
(CSC) and Accenture LLP (formerly Andersen Consulting). CSC operates a
majority of DuPont's global information systems and technology infrastructures
and provides selected applications and software services. Accenture provides
information systems solutions designed to enhance DuPont's manufacturing,
marketing, distribution and customer service.

Patents and Trademarks

  The company believes that its patent and trademark estate provides it with a
significant competitive advantage and has established an international network
of attorneys and agents to procure and protect it.

  The company owns and is licensed under various patents, which expire from
time to time, covering many products, processes and product uses. The actual
protection afforded by these patents varies from country to country and
depends upon the scope of coverage of each individual patent as well as the
availability of legal remedies in each country. The company owns almost 21,000
worldwide patents and about 16,000 worldwide patent applications. In 2000, the
company was granted almost 500 U.S. patents and about 1,600 international
patents. No individual patent is of material importance to any of the
company's segments. However, the company's rights under its patents and
licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to
the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each segment.

  Patent protection is important to the ability of DuPont Pharmaceuticals
Company ("DuPont Pharmaceuticals") to successfully commercialize its products.
DuPont Pharmaceuticals owns or is licensed under a number of patents and
pending patent applications in the United States and other countries, relating
to its marketed products and its development pipeline. The patent protection
for Coumadin(R) (warfarin sodium) has expired. DuPont Pharmaceuticals is
exclusively licensed in the United States, Canada and certain European
countries under Merck & Co.'s patents covering Sustiva(TM) (efavirenz). The
U.S. patents covering the Sustiva(TM) compound and use of Sustiva(TM) for the
treatment of HIV infection expire in 2013 and 2014, respectively. U.S. patents
covering Cardiolite(R) (kit for the preparation of technetium Tc99m sestamibi
for injection) expire in 2007 and 2008. DuPont has exclusively licensed
marketing rights for Cozaar(R) (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar(R) (losartan
potassium, hydrochlorothiazide) to Merck & Co. Inc. under the patents covering
these products. The U.S. patents covering Cozaar(R) and Hyzaar(R) compounds,
pharmaceutical formulation, and use for treatment for hypertension expire in
2009.

  The environment in which Pioneer and the rest of the seed industry compete
is increasingly affected by new patents, patent positions, patent lawsuits and
the status of various intellectual property rights. Ownership of and access to
intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to biotechnology,
are important to Pioneer and its competitors. No single patent owned by
Pioneer is vitally important to its business. However, Pioneer's ability to
compete in the future may be affected by competitors' intellectual rights,
especially those relating to genetically engineered crops, particularly if
those rights withstand legal challenges, and competitors do not offer licenses
on commercially reasonable terms. See the Pioneer Segment Review on pages 13-
14 of this Report, including the information incorporated by reference on
pages 20-21 of Exhibit 13.

  The company has almost 2,400 individual trademarks for its products and
services and has almost 27,000 worldwide registrations and applications for
these trademarks. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the
trademarks are continued in use and properly protected. The company has a
number of trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer level,
and many are the most recognized brands in their categories. Examples include
the DuPont Oval, Lycra(R) elastane, Corian(R) surfaces, Stainmaster(R)
carpets, Teflon(R) fluoropolymers, films, fabric protector, fibers, and
dispersions, and Pioneer(R) brand seeds. The company's rights under its
trademarks are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees,
important to each industry segment. All of DuPont Pharmaceuticals' significant
products are sold under trademarks, which are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries in which its products are marketed. DuPont
Pharmaceuticals considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material
importance to the operation of its business.

Seasonality

  Sales of the company's products in the Agriculture & Nutrition, Performance
Coatings & Polymers, and Pioneer segments are affected by seasonality. The
Agriculture & Nutrition and Pioneer segments are strongest in the first half
of the year. Substantially all Pioneer's seed sales and earnings are made
during the first half of the year. Pioneer generally operates at a loss during
the third and fourth quarters of the year. Due to the seasonal nature of the
seed business, Pioneer segment's inventory is at its highest level at the end
of the calendar year and

                                       6
<PAGE>

is sold down in the first and second quarters. Trade receivables in the
Agriculture & Nutrition and Pioneer segments are at a low point at year-end
and increase through the selling season to peak at the end of the second
quarter.

  Performance Coatings & Polymers sales reflect the seasonal pattern related
to motor vehicle builds and the seasonally strong second quarter for the
refinish business.

  In general, businesses in the remaining segments are not materially affected
by seasonal factors.

Marketing

  With the exception of Pioneer, most products are marketed primarily through
DuPont's sales force, although in some regions more emphasis is placed on
sales through distributors. In North America, the majority of Pioneer(R) brand
seed is marketed through independent sales representatives. In areas outside
the traditional corn belt, seed products are often marketed through dealers
and distributors who handle other agricultural supplies. Pioneer products are
marketed outside North America through a network of subsidiaries, joint
ventures, and independent producer-distributors.

Major Customers

  The company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or
small group of customers. The Nylon Enterprise, Polyester Enterprise, and
Performance Coatings & Polymers segments; however, have several large
customers in their respective industries that are important to these segments'
operating results. For the Pharmaceuticals segment in 2000, ten wholesale
distributors of the DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company comprised 62 percent of
gross sales.

Competition

  Businesses in DuPont's nine reportable segments compete on a variety of
factors such as price, product quality or specifications, customer service and
breadth of product line, depending on the characteristics of the particular
market involved.

  Principal competitors for all segments except Pharmaceuticals and Pioneer
include major chemical companies based in the United States, Europe and Asia,
principally Japan and China. Competitors offer a comparable range of products
from agricultural, commodity and specialty chemicals to plastics and fibers
products. The company also competes in certain product markets with smaller,
more specialized firms. In addition, the company competes with petrochemical
operations in oil-producing countries.

  The Pharmaceuticals segment faces competition from both ethical
pharmaceutical companies which produce drugs that treat indications treated by
DuPont's products and from generic companies which produce drugs that are the
generic equivalents of DuPont's products.

  The Pioneer and Agriculture & Nutrition segments participate in the crop
protection, feed and food ingredient markets. Pioneer sells hybrid seeds,
principally for the production of corn and soybeans globally and directly
competes with other hybrid seed suppliers. The Agriculture & Nutrition
businesses provide crop protection chemicals, soy-based food ingredients and
food safety equipment and services. As such, these businesses compete
primarily with other major chemical companies and grain and food processors.

Research and Development

  The company performs research and development in support of strategic
business units in all nine reportable segments.

  The highest concentration of research is carried out at several large
research centers in and around Wilmington, Delaware, which are primary
research locations for eight of the nine reportable segments (all except

                                       7
<PAGE>

Pioneer). Among these, the Experimental Station laboratories engage in
exploratory and applied research, the Chestnut Run laboratories focus on
applications research, and the Stine-Haskell Research Center conducts
agricultural product research and toxicological research on company products
to assure they are safe for manufacture and use. In addition, research for
these eight segments is conducted in the United States at over 40 sites in 18
states at either dedicated research facilities or manufacturing plants. DuPont
also operates an increasing number of research facilities at locations outside
the United States in countries such as Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom, reflecting the company's global interests.

  The Pioneer segment carries out research and product development to develop
hybrids of corn, sorghum and sunflower, and varieties of soybean, alfalfa,
wheat, and canola for worldwide markets. Pioneer operates more than 100
primary research locations involved in developing and testing new products.
Hybrids and varieties are developed at these primary research locations and
tested at thousands of other locations.

  Relative to historical levels, the company is placing increasing emphasis on
bioscience-related research and development through the Agriculture &
Nutrition and Pioneer segments. The Pharmaceuticals segment is increasing
investment in research, development and marketing to support a promising R&D
pipeline.

  The objectives of the company's research and development programs are to
discover new products, processes and business opportunities in relevant
fields, and to improve existing products and processes. Each strategic
business unit of the company funds research and development activities to
support its business mission. The corporate laboratories are responsible for
assuring that leading-edge science and engineering concepts are identified and
diffused throughout the DuPont technical community. All research and
development activities are coordinated by senior research and development
management through a corporate technology council to ensure that technical
activities are consistent with business and corporate plans, and that the core
technical competencies underlying DuPont's current and future businesses
remain healthy and continue to provide competitive advantages.

  Annual research and development expense and such expense shown "As Percent
of Sales" for the five years 1996 through 2000 are included under the heading
"General" of the Five-Year Financial Review on page 73 of Exhibit 13.

 Forward-Looking Statements

  This presentation contains forward-looking statements which may be
identified by their use of words like "plans," "expects," "will,"
"anticipates," "intends," "projects," "estimates" or other words of similar
meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the
future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product
development, market position, expenditures and financial results, are forward-
looking statements.

  Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations
of future events. The company cannot guarantee that these assumptions and
expectations are accurate or will be realized. In addition to the factors
discussed in this report and in Management's Discussion and Analysis in the
company's latest

                                       8
<PAGE>

Annual Report, the following are some of the important factors that could
cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected
in any such forward-looking statements:

  .  The company operates in approximately 70 countries worldwide and derives
     about half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes
     in the laws or policies of other governmental and quasi-governmental
     activities in the countries in which the company operates could affect
     its business in the country and the company's results of operations. In
     addition, economic factors (including inflation and fluctuations in
     interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates) and competitive
     factors (such as greater price competition or a decline in U.S. or
     European industry sales from slowing economic growth) in those countries
     could affect the company's revenues, expenses and results.

  .  The company's ability to grow earnings will be affected by increases in
     the cost of raw materials, particularly petroleum-based feedstocks,
     natural gas and paraxylene. The company may not be able to fully offset
     the effects of higher raw material costs through price increases or
     productivity improvements.

  .  The company's growth objectives are largely dependent on its ability to
     renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to
     market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays
     in product development such as the inability to: identify viable new
     products; successfully complete research and development projects;
     obtain relevant regulatory approvals, which may include approval from
     the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; obtain adequate intellectual
     property protection; or gain market acceptance of the new products.

  .  As part of its strategy for growth, the company has made and may
     continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic
     alliances. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or
     beneficial to the company.

  .  To a significant degree, results in the company's Agriculture &
     Nutrition and Pioneer segments reflect changes in agricultural
     conditions, including weather and government programs. These results
     also reflect the seasonality of sales of agricultural products; highest
     sales in the United States occur in the first half of the year. In
     addition, demand for products produced in these segments may be affected
     by market acceptance of genetically enhanced products.

  .  The company has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity
     initiatives, including organizational restructurings and Six Sigma
     productivity improvement projects, to improve performance and generate
     cost savings. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or
     beneficial to the company. Also there can be no assurance that any
     estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.

  .  The company's facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental
     laws and regulations. The costs of complying with complex environmental
     laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs, are
     significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. The
     company's accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate
     since the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number
     of factors including the nature of the allegation, the complexity of the
     site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with
     regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at
     multiparty sites, and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.

  .  The company's results of operations could be affected by significant
     litigation adverse to the company including product liability claims,
     patent infringement claims and antitrust claims.

  The foregoing list of important factors is not inclusive, or necessarily in
order of importance.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

  The company owns and operates manufacturing, processing, production,
marketing, and research and development facilities worldwide.

  Property, plant and equipment outside the United States and Puerto Rico is
located at about 90 sites, principally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany,
The Netherlands, Taiwan, Spain, Singapore, Luxembourg, France, Mexico, Brazil,
Belgium, China, Argentina, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

  The company's plants and equipment are well maintained and in good operating
condition. Sales as a percent of capacity were 81 percent in 2000, 83 percent
in 1999, and 82 percent in 1998. These properties are directly owned by the
company except for some auxiliary facilities and miscellaneous properties,
such as certain buildings and transportation equipment, which are leased.
Although no title examination of the properties has been made for the purpose
of this Report, the company knows of no material defects in title to any of
these properties.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  In 1991, DuPont began receiving claims by growers that use of Benlate(R) 50
DF fungicide had caused crop damage. Based on the belief that Benlate(R) 50 DF
would be found to be a contributor to the claimed damage, DuPont began paying
crop damage claims. In 1992, after 18 months of extensive research, DuPont
scientists concluded that Benlate(R) 50 DF was not responsible for plant
damage reports received since March 1991. Concurrent with these research
findings, DuPont stopped paying claims. DuPont since has been served with
several hundred lawsuits most of which were disposed of by trial, dismissal or
settlement. Approximately 120 of the cases are pending. Most of these lawsuits
were filed by growers who allege plant damage from using Benlate(R) 50 DF
although some include claims for alleged damage to shrimping operations and a
smaller number of cases include claims for alleged personal injuries. Also,
many of these cases include general allegations of fraud and misconduct. In
addition, a securities fraud class action was filed in September 1995 by a
shareholder in federal district court in Florida against the company and the
then-Chairman. This action is still pending. The plaintiff in this case
alleges that DuPont made false and misleading statements and omissions about
Benlate(R) 50 DF, with the alleged effect of inflating the price of DuPont's
stock between June 19, 1993, and January 27, 1995.

                                      10
<PAGE>

The district court has certified the case as a class action. Discovery is
proceeding. Certain plaintiffs who previously settled with the company have
filed cases alleging fraud and other misconduct relating to the litigation and
settlement of Benlate(R) 50 DF claims. Approximately 42 such cases are
pending. These cases are in various stages of proceedings in trial and
appellate courts in Florida and Hawaii.

  On June 21, 2000, a jury in Texas state court awarded compensatory damages
of $10.3 million, prejudgment interest, and punitive damages of $90 million to
two growers who claimed Benlate(R) 50 WP failed to protect their melons and
cantaloupe crops. Due to limitations on punitive damages in Texas, the total
award will be reduced to approximately $35 million. DuPont has appealed.

  DuPont continues to believe that Benlate(R) 50 DF did not cause the damages
alleged in these cases and denies the allegations of fraud and misconduct.
DuPont intends to defend itself in ongoing matters and in any additional cases
that may be filed or reopened. The ultimate liabilities from Benlate(R) 50 DF
lawsuits and the Benlate(R) 50 WP lawsuit discussed above may be significant
to DuPont Crop Protection's results of operations in the period recognized,
but management does not anticipate that they will have a material adverse
effect on the company's consolidated financial position or liquidity.

  The company's balance sheet reflects accruals for estimated costs associated
with this matter. Adverse changes in estimates for such liabilities could
result in additional future charges.

Environmental Proceedings

  On September 2, 1997, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit
against DuPont related to an August 1995 oleum release from DuPont's plant in
Wurtland, Kentucky. DuPont previously paid a $125,000 fine and agreed to
undertake supplemental environmental projects, related to the oleum release,
valued at $460,000. In its complaint, the DOJ alleges violations under Section
112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), Section 103(a) of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Section
304(a)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. DOJ
offered to settle this action for $2.7 million. DuPont and the DOJ have
reached a settlement in principle to resolve this matter. DuPont has agreed to
pay $650,000 for an emergency planning computer system to be in place and
operating in September 2001 for 10 counties in Kentucky, and to pay a penalty
of $850,000. A Consent Decree formalizing the settlement was filed with the
Court on August 1, 2000, and entered on September 19, 2000.

  On May 19, 1997, approximately 11,500 pounds of a hydrogen fluoride (HF)/tar
mixture was released from DuPont's Louisville, Kentucky, fluoroproducts
facility. This release lasted about 40 minutes. There were no on-site
injuries, and only one off-site person reported any exposure. No toxic tort
suits were filed as a result of this release. DuPont's incident investigation
concluded that an inadequate valve stem design was a key factor contributing
to the release (the valve stem twisted and the valve indicated it was in a
closed position, when it was actually open). DuPont's process isolation
procedures were also reviewed and modified as a result of this incident. The
DOJ proposed a settlement of $1.7 million. Subsequently, by letter dated July
13, 1999, the DOJ provided "formal notice" to DuPont that it intended to bring
a "federal court action" against DuPont under the CAA Section 112(r)--General
Duty Clause. DuPont will contest the proposed $1.7 million fine as excessive
and unreasonable because there was no environmental harm or human health
impacts associated with the May 1997 incident. DuPont presented a settlement
offer to the DOJ and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in December
2000. The DOJ and the EPA are considering DuPont's offer.

  The Indiana Departments of Natural Resources and Environmental Management
and the United States Department of Interior are in the process of conducting
a natural resource damage assessment of the Grand Calumet River and the
Indiana Harbor Canal system under CERCLA and the Oil Pollution Act. The
company's plant in East Chicago, Indiana, which discharges industrial
wastewater into these waterways, was identified as one of 17 potentially
responsible parties (PRPs) for the cost of the assessment and any determined
natural resource damages. The trustees recently indicated that their preferred
remedy is to dredge the entire Grand Cal/Indiana Harbor system. DuPont has
joined with eight other PRPs to contest the remedy. A settlement offer has
been tendered to the trustees and negotiations are ongoing.

  Further to the Pioneer Segment discussion in Exhibit 13 on pages 20-

    YieldGard(R) MON 810 Bt Insect Resistant Corn
    In July 1993, the Monsanto Company and Pioneer entered into an
    agreement relating to the development and marketing of MON 810 Bt
    corn, a product resistant to the European Corn Borer. Under the
    terms of the agreement, Monsanto granted Pioneer the right to sell
    and produce MON 810 Bt corn under Monsanto's registered trademark
    YieldGard(R).

    Subsequently, in a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Missouri (St. Louis), Monsanto sought to
    terminate the agreement. On August 24, 2000, a jury found that
    Pioneer had materially breached the agreement. The court entered
    judgment on January 2, 2001, terminating the agreement. The court,
    however, ruled that Monsanto was not entitled to any past damages
    for the alleged breach. The company is appealing the judgment.

    In 1996, DEKALB Genetics Corporation filed a number of patent
    infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Illinois (Rockford) alleging that YieldGard(R) corn
    sold by Pioneer infringed its patents. At the time the first
    lawsuit was filed, Monsanto had a substantial equity interest in
    DEKALB and subsequently acquired all of DEKALB. Pioneer believes
    that it does not infringe any of the DEKALB patents and that these
    patents are invalid and unenforceable. Also, Pioneer believes that
    it has an implied license under the DEKALB patents by virtue of
    Monsanto's acquisition and control of DEKALB and the 1993
    agreement between Monsanto and Pioneer granting Pioneer the right
    to produce and sell YieldGard(R) corn. In February 2001, the first
    case ended in a mistrial because the jury could not arrive at a
    unanimous verdict. No further trials are expected in 2001.

    On June 1, 2000, prior to the trial of the lawsuit in St. Louis,
    Monsanto and Pioneer entered into an agreement that permitted
    Pioneer to produce and sell YieldGard(R) corn irrespective of the
    outcome of the St. Louis and Rockford lawsuits. On October 1,
    1999, the company acquired the approximately 80 percent of Pioneer
    not previously owned for $7,684 million. An intangible asset has
    been recorded to recognize the value of the 1993 license
    agreement. Should the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits be
    adverse to the company, the value of this intangible asset may
    become impaired, resulting in a one-time noncash charge to
    earnings.

    In May 2000, Aventis CropScience filed a patent infringement
    lawsuit against Pioneer in the U.S. District Court for the Middle
    District of North Carolina alleging that YieldGard(R) corn sold by
    Pioneer and a new Bt corn product being developed by Pioneer
    infringed its patents. In December 2000, Monsanto filed its own
    action against Aventis in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
    District of Missouri seeking a declaration that the Aventis
    patents are invalid, unenforceable and not infringed. Pioneer has
    moved to stay the North Carolina action brought by Aventis pending
    the outcome of the Monsanto St. Louis lawsuit against Aventis.

    Glyphosate Tolerant Soybeans
    In December 1999, Monsanto filed suit in the U.S. District court
    for the Eastern District of Missouri to terminate a 1992 license
    agreement granting Pioneer the right to produce and market Roundup
    Ready(R) glyphosate tolerant soybeans. Monsanto alleges that
    Pioneer breached the agreement by virtue of its merger with the
    company. If the court finds that the merger breached the agreement
    and, therefore, the agreement is terminated, Monsanto has alleged
    that Pioneer infringed its patents and misappropriated its trade
    secrets. The lawsuit is in its early stages relating to whether
    DuPont's acquisition of Pioneer constitutes a breach of the
    agreement justifying termination. Pioneer believes that its merger
    with the company ultimately will be found not to be a breach of the
    agreement. On October 1, 1999, the company acquired the
    approximately 80 percent of Pioneer not previously owned for $7,684
    million. An intangible asset has been recorded to recognize the
    value of the 1992 license agreement. Should the ultimate outcome of
    this lawsuit be adverse to the company, the value of this
    intangible asset may become impaired, resulting in a one-time
    noncash charge to earnings.

    Management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of the
    lawsuits discussed under the subheadings "YieldGard(R) MON 810 Bt
    Insect Resistant Corn" and "Glyphosate Tolerant Soybeans" will have
    a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial
    position or liquidity, although it could be significant to the
    results of operations of the Pioneer segment in the period
    recognized.

Item 14. EXHIBITS, FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES, AND REPORTS ON FORM 8-K

  (a) Financial Statements, Financial Statement Schedule and Exhibits

    1. Financial Statements. (See listing at Part II, Item 8 of this report
  regarding financial statements, which are incorporated by reference to
  Exhibit 13.)

    2. Financial Statement Schedules--none required.

  The following should be read in conjunction with the previously referenced
Financial Statements:

    Financial Statement Schedules listed under SEC rules but not included in
  this report are omitted because they are not applicable or the required
  information is shown in the consolidated financial statements or notes
  thereto incorporated by reference.

    Condensed financial information of the parent company is omitted because
  restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries do not exceed 25 percent
  of consolidated net assets. Footnote disclosure of restrictions on the
  ability of subsidiaries and affiliates to transfer funds is omitted because
  the restricted net assets of subsidiaries combined with the company's
  equity in the undistributed earnings of affiliated companies does not
  exceed 25 percent of consolidated net assets at December 31, 2000.

    Separate financial statements of affiliated companies accounted for by
  the equity method are omitted because no such affiliate individually
  constitutes a 20 percent significant subsidiary.

    3. Exhibits

  The following list of exhibits includes both exhibits submitted with this
Form 10-K as filed with the SEC and those incorporated by reference to other
filings:
