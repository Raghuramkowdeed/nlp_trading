Whenever reference is made in this Form 10-K to specific sections or pages of the

are incorporated herein by reference. The &quot;Corporation&quot;, unless the context

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Item 1. Business</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">General</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United
Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. Growth is attributable to
acquisitions and the internal development of existing businesses of the Corporation. The
following description of the Corporation's business should be read in conjunction with
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
appearing on pages 2 through 13 of the Corporation's 2002 Annual Report to Shareowners,
especially the information contained therein under the heading &quot;Business
Environment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Corporation's operating units include a diverse portfolio of businesses with operations
throughout the world. Otis and Carrier primarily serve customers in the commercial and
residential property industries worldwide. In 2002, the revenues generated by Otis and
Carrier operations were 54 percent of the Corporation's total segment revenues. Pratt
&amp; Whitney and the Flight Systems segment, which includes Hamilton Sundstrand and
Sikorsky Aircraft, primarily provide aerospace products and services to commercial and
government customers. In 2002, commercial aerospace and U.S. Government aerospace revenues
were approximately 30 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of the Corporation's total
segment revenues. Revenues in 2002 from outside the United States, including U.S. export
sales, were 55 percent of the Corporation's total segment revenues. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As worldwide
businesses, the Corporation's operations can be affected by a variety of economic and
other factors, including those described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Corporation's 2002 Annual
Report to Shareowners and those described in the &quot;Business&quot; section of this Form
10-K under the heading &quot;Other Matters Relating to the Corporation's Business as a
Whole.&quot; Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number
of companies in the United States and other countries, and each competes on the basis of
price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Corporation's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports

conducts its business through four principal segments. The segments were generally
determined based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar

&amp; Whitney provides overhaul and repair services, spare parts, and fleet management
services for the engines it produces and other commercial and military jet and gas turbine
engines. Pratt &amp; Whitney products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers,
airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign
governments. Pratt &amp; Whitney sales in the U.S. and Canada are made directly to the
customer and, to a limited extent, through independent distributors. Other export sales
are made with the assistance of independent sales representatives. Sales to The Boeing
Company (&quot;Boeing&quot;) and Airbus Industrie (&quot;Airbus&quot;) were 11 and 10
percent, respectively, of total Pratt &amp; Whitney revenues in 2002, before taking into
account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pratt &amp;
Whitney currently produces two families of large commercial jet engines: the PW4000 engine
series (powering the Airbus A310-300, A300-600 and A330-200/300 series of aircraft; the
Boeing 747-400, 767-200/300 and 777-200/300 series of aircraft; and the out-of-production
Boeing MD-11 aircraft) and the PW2000 engine series (powering the Boeing 757-200/PF/300
aircraft). Also, Pratt &amp; Whitney has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with
Airbus to develop, market and sell PW6000 series engines for installation on Airbus A318
aircraft, expected to enter service during 2005. The PW6000 was certified by U.S.
airworthiness authorities in January 2002. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the
risk and cost associated with developing new engines, Pratt &amp; Whitney has entered into
certain collaboration arrangements in which costs, revenues and risks are shared. At
December 31, 2002, the interests of other participants in Pratt &amp; Whitney's current
commercial jet engine production programs ranged from 14 to 29 percent. Pratt &amp;
Whitney also has a 33 percent interest in the International Aero Engines collaboration
that sells and supports V2500 engines. Applications for the V2500 engine include Airbus'
A319, A320 and A321 aircraft and Boeing's out-of-production MD-90. Pratt &amp; Whitney has
a 50 percent interest in an alliance with GE Aircraft Engines to develop, market and
manufacture the GP7000 engine. At December 31, 2002, other participants held interests
totaling 35 percent in Pratt &amp; Whitney's share of this program. The alliance
anticipates the first full engine test in 2004. The new engine will power the Airbus A380
aircraft, with first aircraft deliveries scheduled for 2006.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pratt &amp;
Whitney currently produces three military aircraft engines: the F119 (powering the
two-engine F/A-22 fighter aircraft), the F100 (powering two-engine F-15 and single-engine
F-16 fighter aircraft) and the F117 (powering four-engine C-17 transport aircraft). The
F119 and F117 are currently the only sources of propulsion for the F/A-22 fighter aircraft
and C-17 transport aircraft, respectively. Pratt &amp; Whitney is under contract with the
U.S. Air Force (&quot;USAF&quot;) to complete flight-testing and initial production of
F119 engines through 2003. All of Pratt &amp; Whitney's F100 sales contracts are with the
USAF or with foreign governments. All of Pratt &amp; Whitney's F117 sales contracts are
with either the USAF or Boeing. Pratt &amp; Whitney is also under contract with the USAF
to develop the F135 engine, a derivative of Pratt &amp; Whitney's F119 engine, to power
the single-engine F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft being developed by Lockheed Martin.
Management cannot predict with certainty whether, when, and in what quantities Pratt &amp;
Whitney will produce F135 engines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pratt &amp;
Whitney Canada (&quot;P&amp;WC&quot;) is a world leader in aviation engines powering
business, regional, utility and military aircraft and helicopters. P&amp;WC also designs
and manufactures engines for auxiliary power units and industrial applications. Its
operations and service network span the globe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pratt &amp;
Whitney Space Propulsion (&quot;SP&quot;) produces hydrogen fueled rocket engines for
commercial and U.S. Government space applications, advanced turbo pumps for NASA's Space
Shuttle program and solid fuel propulsion systems for civil and military
applications.&nbsp; SP also has a 50 percent interest in a joint venture with NPO
Energomash that provides kerosene fueled RD-180 rocket engines for satellite launch
applications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pratt &amp;
Whitney Power Systems (&quot;PWPS&quot;) supplies industrial power generation and
mechanical drive equipment in the one megawatt to 50 megawatts range. PWPS also provides
gas turbines for marine propulsion applications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenues from
Pratt &amp; Whitney's international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 54
percent and 50 percent of total Pratt &amp; Whitney segment revenues in each of 2002 and
2001, respectively. At December 31, 2002, Pratt &amp; Whitney's business backlog was
$13,030 million, including $2,001 million of U.S. Government funded contracts and
subcontracts, as compared to $11,161 million and $1,949 million, respectively, at December
31, 2001. Of the total Pratt &amp; Whitney backlog at December 31, 2002, approximately
$4,365 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2003. Pratt &amp; Whitney's backlog
includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total revenues.

Sundstrand's industrial products is tied closely to the level of general economic
activity. Hamilton Sundstrand believes that its research and development, proprietary
technology, and product and service reputations have been significant in maintaining its
competitive standing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sikorsky is one
of the world's largest manufacturers of military and commercial helicopters and is the
primary supplier of transport helicopters to the U.S. Army and Navy. Sikorsky also
supplies helicopters to foreign governments and the worldwide commercial market.
Sikorsky's aftermarket business, which includes spare parts sales, overhaul and repair and
service contracts for helicopters and other aircraft, has become a more significant part
of Sikorsky's business in recent years. During 2002, Sikorsky acquired Derco Holding, a
supplier of military aircraft logistics and component distribution, component repairs, and
aftermarket program management.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current
production programs at Sikorsky include the Black Hawk medium-transport helicopter for the
U.S. and foreign governments; the MH-60 Fleet Combat Support helicopter for the U.S. Navy;
the International Naval Hawk for multiple naval missions; and the S-76 intermediate-sized
helicopter for commercial operations. Under a multi-year contract with the U.S.
Government, Sikorsky has delivered 249 Black Hawk helicopters, with the remaining three
helicopters scheduled for delivery in 2003. A new multi-year contract was signed in 2002
that provides for additional deliveries of 80 Army and 82 Navy helicopters over the next
five years. Under a $238 million research, development and test contract, Sikorsky is
performing work to evaluate the potential for upgrading the U.S. Army fleet of Black
Hawks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving
type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration in December 2002, Sikorsky is
entering into the final stages of development of the S-92 helicopter for the commercial
market. An H-92 variant of the helicopter for the military market is also in development.
A portion of the development work is being carried out in collaboration with companies in
Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Japan, Spain and Taiwan. Marketing efforts for the
S-92 and H-92 are in process and several non-binding deposit agreements have been received
for S-92 helicopters. Deliveries of the first S-92 helicopters are planned for 2004.
Management cannot predict with certainty whether, when, and in what quantities S-92 and
H-92 helicopters will be produced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sikorsky has a
50 percent interest in a joint venture with Boeing for the development of the RAH-66
Comanche light attack and reconnaissance helicopter. The Sikorsky-Boeing joint venture is
performing under a cost reimbursement contract awarded by the U.S. Army in 1991. During
November 2002, the U.S. Army awarded the joint venture a revised Engineering and
Manufacturing Development contract that increased the contract value by $3.4 billion to
$6.6 billion. Under the revised contract, the joint venture is required to deliver nine
Comanche helicopters in 2005 and 2006 for test and evaluation purposes and to provide
aircraft capability improvements to these helicopters through 2011. Management cannot
predict with certainty whether, when, and in what quantities Comanche helicopters will be
produced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenues
generated by the Flight Systems segment's international operations, including export
sales, were 25 percent and 39 percent of total Flight Systems segment revenues in 2002 and
2001, respectively. At December 31, 2002, Flight Systems' business backlog was $3,642
million, including $1,839 million under funded contracts and subcontracts with the U.S.
Government, as compared to $3,784 million and $1,743 million, respectively, at December
31, 2001. Of the total Flight Systems segment backlog at December 31, 2002, approximately
$2,664 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2003.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pratt &amp; Whitney and Flight Systems Aerospace and
Defense Products<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation's aerospace and defense
businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers, foreign
manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance,
marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products) and companies that
obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. In particular, Pratt &amp;
Whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations.
Engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives,
performance and operating cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and
maintenance agreements. Customer selections of engines and components can also have a
significant impact on later sales of parts and services. Pratt &amp; Whitney's major
competitors in the sale of engines are General Electric Company and Rolls Royce plc. (For
information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of
customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, see Notes 4
and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 22 through 23 and 30 through
31 of the Corporation's 2002 Annual Report to Shareowners.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other factors
that can affect the results of the Corporation's aerospace and defense businesses include
lengthy and costly development cycles and heavy dependence on a small number of products
and programs. Sales of military products are affected by defense budgets in the U.S. and
other countries, U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight
operations. Military spare parts sales are affected by policies of the U.S. and other
governments of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment
manufacturer. Pratt &amp; Whitney's and Flight Systems' operations can also be affected by
a variety of economic and other factors including those described in Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the
Corporation's 2002 Annual Report to Shareowners and those described in the
&quot;Business&quot; section of this Form 10-K under the heading &quot;Other Matters
Relating to the Corporation's Business as a Whole&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significant
elements of Pratt &amp; Whitney's and Flight Systems' business, such as spare parts sales
for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog information
may not be indicative of future demand. Also, since a substantial portion of the backlog
for commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2003, changes in economic
conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. </font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UTC Power develops and markets distributed
power generation equipment producing up to one megawatt, including fuel cells and
microturbines, for use in commercial transportation and light industrial businesses,
institutions and office buildings. UTC Fuel Cells, LLC (&quot;UTC Fuel Cells&quot;), a
part of UTC Power, is a world leader in fuel cell production and development for
commercial, transportation, residential and space applications. UTC Fuel Cells is the sole
supplier of fuel cells for U.S. space missions and also offers a commercially available
fuel cell power plant, known as the PC25&#153;. Over 250 PC25 units have been delivered
around the world. Fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane technology
(&quot;PEM&quot;) are currently in development for transportation, commercial stationary,
and residential applications. UTC Fuel Cells is working with automakers and bus
manufacturers, as well as the U.S. Department of Energy, on development and demonstration
programs for vehicles. In December 2002, UTC Fuel Cells signed an agreement to license its
PEM technology on a non-exclusive basis to Nissan Motor Company Ltd. (&quot;Nissan&quot;)
and to engage in joint development of this technology for automotive applications. In that
same month Nissan unveiled its zero-emission X-TRAIL vehicle powered by a UTC Fuel Cells
power plant. In 2001, UTC Fuel Cells and Shell Hydrogen US formed a joint venture to
develop, manufacture and sell fuel processors and hydrogen generation systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although fuel
cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generators in terms of efficiency
and environmental characteristics, current production rates remain low across the
industry. Continued technology advancement and wider market acceptance are required to
reduce the production cost of fuel cell components and power plants. Government support
for fuel cells could also impact the advancement of the technology. There is still
significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable PEM fuel cells will be
produced. UTC Fuel Cells continues to seek strategic partners to develop sources of
supply, as well as marketing and distribution channels. Toshiba Corporation owns a 10
percent equity interest in UTC Fuel Cells. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results of
UTC Power are included in the &quot;Eliminations and other&quot; category in the segment

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="2">Other Matters Relating to the Corporation's
Business as a Whole</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Research and Development<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since changes in technology can have a
significant impact on the Corporation's operations and competitive position, the
Corporation spends substantial amounts of its own funds on research and development. Such
expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred, were $1,191 million, or 4.3
percent of total sales in 2002, as compared with $1,254 million or 4.6 percent of total
sales in 2001 and $1,302 million or 5.0 percent of total sales in 2000. The Corporation
also performs research and development work under contracts funded by the U.S. Government
and other customers. Such contract research and development, which is performed
principally in the Pratt &amp; Whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the Flight
Systems segment, amounted to $1,189 million in 2002, as compared with $846 million in 2001
and $865 million in 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Contracts, Other Risk Factors, Environmental and Other
Matters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination at the
convenience of the U.S. Government, in which event the Corporation normally would be
entitled to reimbursement for its allowable costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. Most
of the Corporation's government sales are made under fixed-price type contracts;
approximately $1.6 billion of the Corporation's total sales for 2002 were made under
cost-reimbursement type contracts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many
defense contractors, the Corporation has received allegations from the U.S. Government
that some contract prices should be reduced because cost or pricing data submitted in
negotiation of the contract prices may not have been in conformance with government
regulations. The Corporation has made voluntary refunds in those cases it believes
appropriate, has settled some allegations, and does not believe that any further price
reductions that may be required will have a material effect upon its financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation
is now, and believes that in light of the current government contracting environment it
will be, the subject of one or more government investigations. See Item 3 - Legal
Proceedings on pages 8 through 9 of this Form 10-K and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements on page 31 of the Corporation's 2002 Annual Report to Shareowners for
further discussion. If the Corporation or one of its business units were charged with
wrongdoing as a result of any of these investigations, it could be suspended from bidding
on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal
proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the Corporation could be fined and debarred
from new government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years. Any
contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the Government.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation
conducts its businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide, some of which have
significant minority interests. Changes in legislation or government policies can have an
impact on the Corporation's worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of
refrigerants is important to Carrier's businesses, while government safety regulations,
restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices
can impact the Corporation's aerospace and defense businesses. The Corporation's
international operations are also subject to changes in local government regulations and
policies, including those related to investments, exchange controls and repatriation of
earnings. Some foreign customers in the Corporation's aerospace and defense businesses may
require counter-purchase or offset arrangements as a condition to a sale, such as
requiring the Corporation to purchase supplies in the customer's country or to participate
in manufacturing and financial support projects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Corporation's operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and
local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over
its foreign operations. The Corporation has incurred and will likely continue to incur
liabilities under various state and federal statutes for the cleanup of pollutants
previously released into the environment. The Corporation does not anticipate that
compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that
any payments it may be required to make for these cleanup liabilities will have a material
adverse effect upon its cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results
of operations. (Environmental matters are further addressed in Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 11 and Notes 1 and 16 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 21 and 31 of the Corporation's 2002
Annual Report to Shareowners.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the laws
governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If the Corporation were
convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility
or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any
U.S. Government contract awarded to the Corporation until the Environmental Protection
Agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the
Corporation's patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises are cumulatively important to
its business, the Corporation does not believe that the loss of any one or&nbsp; group of
related patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect
on the overall business of the Corporation or on any of its operating segments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation
has sought cost reductions in its purchases of materials, components and supplies. These
cost reductions may be achieved through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating
its purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and using
online bidding competitions among potential suppliers. In some instances, the Corporation
is reliant upon a single source of supply. Greater dependence on global sources of supply
requires reliable transportation and import and export processes. A disruption in
deliveries from its suppliers, therefore, could have an adverse effect on the
Corporation's ability to meet its commitments to customers. Like other users in the U.S.,
the Corporation is largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain of its raw materials
requirements such as cobalt (Africa, Australia and Russia), tantalum (Australia and Asia),
chromium (Africa and Kazakhstan) and rhenium (Chile and Kazakhstan). To alleviate this
dependence and accompanying risk associated with these particular raw materials, the
Corporation has a number of ongoing programs which include the increased use of more
readily available materials through material substitutions and the development of new
alloys and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing
processes such as near net shape forging. The Corporation believes that its supply
management practices in general are based on an appropriate balancing of the associated
risks and the additional cost of other practices. The Corporation does not foresee any
unavailability of materials, components, or supplies that will have any material adverse
effect on its overall business, or on any of its business segments, in the near term.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For discussion
of the effect of the Corporation's restructuring actions on production facilities, see
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on
page 7 and Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 29 of the
Corporation's 2002 Annual Report to Shareowners.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management
believes that the fixed assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at December 31,
2002 for the production of the Corporation's products are suitable and adequate for the
business conducted therein in the current business environment, are being appropriately
utilized consistent with experience and have sufficient production capacity for their
present intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the
products. The Corporation continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities
and, based on that review, may from time to time adjust its facilities needs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Item 3. Legal Proceedings <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As previously reported, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the
Corporation are litigating whether Pratt &amp; Whitney's government cost accounting
practices for certain engine parts are acceptable. The litigation, filed in 1994 with the
Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (&quot;ASBCA&quot;), No. 47416 et al., relates to
the accounting for engine parts produced by foreign companies under commercial engine
collaboration programs from 1984 through 1995. On July 31, 2001, the ASBCA issued a
decision in favor of the Corporation. The DoD appealed this decision to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit on November 29, 2001. On January 15, 2003, the Court of
Appeals reversed the ASBCA and remanded the case to the ASBCA for further proceedings. The
Corporation intends to seek reconsideration of this decision by the Court. The DoD has
claimed approximately $158 million in damages, and approximately $103 million in interest
through December 31, 1996. Should the DoD ultimately prevail on liability, damages could
be larger than initially claimed because the DoD may amend its claim to include the period
after 1995 to the present, and interest could continue to accrue from January 1, 1997. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As previously
reported, the Corporation has pending against it one qui tam complaint under the civil
False Claims Act in United States District Court for the District of Connecticut: U.S. ex
rel. Drake v. Norden Systems, Inc. and UTC, No. 394CV00963 (filed July 1997, and involving
allegations of improper accounting for fixed assets). The civil False Claims Act provides
for penalties in a civil case of up to $10,000 per false claim submitted. The number of
false claims implicated by this qui tam complaint cannot currently be ascertained;
however, if determined adversely to the Corporation, the number could result in
significant penalties. The qui tam relator has claimed unspecified damages (trebled) and
penalties, and the Department of Justice has declined to take over the litigation. In
August 2000 and August 2001, the court dismissed portions of the complaint. In October
2002, the court ordered the parties to address whether the court should dismiss the case
entirely. Additional papers were filed in November 2002, and a decision by the court is
expected in 2003.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 1999,
the Department of Justice filed a civil False Claims Act complaint against the Corporation
in United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Western Division), No.
C-3-99-093. This lawsuit relates to the &quot;Fighter Engine Competition&quot; between
Pratt &amp; Whitney's F100 engine and GE's F110 engine, for contracts awarded by the U.S.
Air Force between fiscal years 1985 and 1990, inclusive. The Government alleges that Pratt
&amp; Whitney inflated its estimated costs for purchased parts and withheld data that
would have revealed the overstatements. In mid-2002, the Court denied motions filed by the
Corporation that could have resulted in dismissal of all or part of the Government's
claims. The Corporation has requested that the Court reconsider this denial. The
Government's most recent quantification of its claimed damages in August 2001 includes
False Claims Act damages of approximately $76 million (subject to trebling, plus penalties
of up to $10,000 per false claim), and damages under the Truth in Negotiations Act of
approximately $65 million plus interest of approximately $81 million. Interest could
continue to accrue on this portion of the Government's claim. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many other
companies in recent years, the Corporation or its subsidiaries have been named as a
defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos
integrated into certain of the Corporation's products or premises. While the Corporation
has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it in any
currently-manufactured products, certain of its historical products, like those of many
other manufacturers, have contained components incorporating asbestos. The Corporation has
made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date. The remainder of
the resolved cases have settled for amounts that are not material to the Corporation, and
have been supported in part by insurance. At present, the Corporation is named in
approximately 850 lawsuits involving approximately 16,000 individual claimants. More than
13,000 of these claimants are joined in seven lawsuits in circuit court in various
counties in Mississippi that were filed or amended during 2002 to include the Corporation
or certain of its subsidiaries. Each of these Mississippi lawsuits names from 200 to more
than 400 other companies as defendants along with the Corporation or its subsidiaries. The
complaints do not identify any products of the Corporation or its named subsidiaries, or
specify the amount of damages claimed. Nor do they allege which claimants, if any, were
exposed to asbestos attributable to the Corporation's products or premises, or the extent,
if any, to which such claimants have been harmed. No discovery or other pretrial
proceedings to develop such information have yet occurred.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation
does not believe that resolution of any of the foregoing or any other legal matters will
have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's competitive position, results of
operations, cash flows, or financial condition. A further discussion of government
contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of the Corporation's
environmental liabilities, can be found under the heading &quot;Other Matters Relating to
the Corporation's Business as a Whole &#150; Contracts, Other Risk Factors, Environmental
