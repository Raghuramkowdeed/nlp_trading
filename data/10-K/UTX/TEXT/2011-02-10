ALSO SELECTED THE PUREPOWER PW1000G ENGINE TO POWER THE PROPOSED NEW IRKUT MC-21 PASSENGER AIRCRAFT, WHICH IS PLANNED TO ENTER INTO SERVICE IN 2016. THE SUCCESS OF THESE AIRCRAFT AND THE PUREPOWER PW1000G ENGINE IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS

INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES, AIRCRAFT DEMAND, AND REGULATORY APPROVAL. BASED ON THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF SUCCESS OF AIRCRAFT PROGRAM LAUNCHES BY AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS, ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE PUREPOWER

PROGRAM MAY BE REQUIRED. PRATT & WHITNEY HAS ALSO RECEIVED FEDERAL AVIATION AUTHORITY (FAA) AND EUROPEAN AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY (EASA) CERTIFICATION FOR THE ADVANTAGE70 UPGRADE TO ITS PW4000 ENGINE FOR AIRBUS A330 AIRCRAFT. THE ADVANTAGE70

UPGRADE IS INTENDED TO REDUCE MAINTENANCE AND FUEL COSTS AND INCREASE THRUST. PWR IS DEVELOPING A LIQUID FUEL J-2X ENGINE TO SUPPORT NASAS VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION. PWR IS ALSO UPGRADING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RS-68 ENGINE TO SUPPORT U.S.

68 PERCENT AND 63 PERCENT OF TOTAL SIKORSKY SEGMENT SALES IN 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. SALES GENERATED BY SIKORSKYS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING U.S. EXPORT SALES, WERE 33 PERCENT AND 32 PERCENT OF TOTAL SIKORSKY SEGMENT SALES IN

2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, SIKORSKYS BACKLOG WAS $9,287 MILLION, INCLUDING $4,234 MILLION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT-FUNDED CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THESE AMOUNTS WERE $10,329 MILLION AND

$4,957 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OF THE TOTAL SIKORSKY BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY $5,421 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED AS SALES IN 2011.

UTC POWER IS A WORLD LEADER IN THE APPLICATION OF FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY FOR STATIONARY

AND TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS. UTC POWER HAS DELIVERED MORE THAN 280 OF ITS 200KW PHOSPHORIC ACID FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS FOR STATIONARY INSTALLATIONS SINCE 1992. UTC POWER CEASED PRODUCTION OF THE 200KW UNIT IN 2009 AND BEGAN DELIVERIES OF ITS

400KW PHOSPHORIC ACID FUEL CELL. THIS NEW FUEL CELL IS EXPECTED TO HAVE GREATER DURABILITY THAN ANY OTHER LARGE STATIONARY FUEL CELL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. UTC POWERS AUTOMOTIVE AND BUS TRANSPORTATION FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS ARE

BASED ON PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE (PEM) TECHNOLOGY. PUREMOTION 120 POWER PLANTS ARE CURRENTLY USED IN REVENUE SERVICE IN TRANSIT BUS APPLICATIONS IN CONNECTICUT, CALIFORNIA AND EUROPE. UTC POWER IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING PEM FUEL CELLS FOR SUBMARINE

APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, UTC POWER IS THE MAKER OF ALKALINE-BASED FUEL CELLS USED TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AND DRINKING WATER TO THE U.S. SPACE SHUTTLE.

ALTHOUGH FUEL CELLS ARE GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES IN TERMS OF TOTAL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL IN EITHER EARLY

COMMERCIALIZATION OR THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND COST REDUCTION ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE WIDE-SCALE MARKET ACCEPTANCE. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO FULLY COMMERCIALIZE FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS STILL

SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FUEL CELLS WILL BE PRODUCED.

IN JANUARY 2010, WE ACQUIRED A 49.5%

EQUITY STAKE IN CLIPPER WINDPOWER PLC (CLIPPER), A CALIFORNIA-BASED WIND TURBINE MANUFACTURER. IN DECEMBER 2010, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF ALL OF THE REMAINING SHARES OF CLIPPER. THIS INVESTMENT IS INTENDED TO EXPAND OUR POWER GENERATION

PORTFOLIO AND ALLOW US TO ENTER THE WIND POWER MARKET BY LEVERAGING OUR EXPERTISE IN BLADE TECHNOLOGY, TURBINES AND GEARBOX DESIGN.

THE

RESULTS OF UTC POWER AND CLIPPER ARE INCLUDED IN THE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER CATEGORY IN THE SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA IN NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES

AS WORLDWIDE BUSINESSES, OUR OPERATIONS

CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION, IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT, IN

ITEM 1, CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS, AND IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K. EACH BUSINESS UNIT IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND EACH COMPETES ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, DELIVERY SCHEDULE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE.

OUR

AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR NATIONAL

COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT &

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING

COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST

GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4, 14 AND 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE U.S.

GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS POLICIES OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AFFECT MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES. SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES

FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GE AVIATION, ROLLS-ROYCE, HONEYWELL AND

TURBOMECA.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED

TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $1,746 MILLION OR 3.2 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2010, AS COMPARED WITH $1,558 MILLION OR 3.0 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2009 AND $1,771 MILLION OR 3.0 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2008. WE ALSO PERFORM RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND

SIKORSKY SEGMENTS, AMOUNTED TO $1,951 MILLION IN 2010, AS COMPARED TO $2,124 MILLION IN 2009 AND $2,101 MILLION IN 2008. THESE CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, THROUGH COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND

AMOUNTS THAT ARE CAPITALIZED INTO INVENTORY TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOVERED THROUGH PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT SHIPMENTS. OF THE TOTAL CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, $1,890 MILLION, $2,095 MILLION AND $2,008 MILLION WERE EXPENSED IN 2010, 2009 AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING COSTS HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF

OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WE WOULD NORMALLY BE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE

GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. MOST OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER

FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY $2,961 MILLION OR 5.5 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR 2010 WERE MADE UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT WE REDUCE CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES

BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS HAVE RECOMMENDED SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS. WE HAVE MADE

VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, HAVE SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND CONTINUE TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1A, RISK

FACTORS AND ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE HAVE INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER

VARIOUS GOVERNMENT STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO

MAKE FOR CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES 1 AND 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT.

MOST OF THE U.S. LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF WE WERE CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE

VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE ARE AWARDED UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THEREAFTER CERTIFIES THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

IN ADDITION, WE COULD BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS IMPOSED IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS OVER CLIMATE CHANGE. CHANGES IN CLIMATE CHANGE

CONCERNS, OR IN THE REGULATION OF SUCH CONCERNS, INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR

GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN AFFECT OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE SAFETY REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF CARRIER, OTIS AND UTC

FIRE & SECURITY, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

WE MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE THIS PORTFOLIO IS CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP

OF RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SOURCES FOR OUR PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING. WE WORK

CONTINUOUSLY WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND TO REDUCE COSTS. WE PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING OUR PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL

SOURCING AND USING BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. LIKE OTHER USERS

IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (FINLAND, NORWAY, RUSSIA AND CANADA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND CANADA), CHROMIUM (SOUTH AFRICA, KAZAKHSTAN, ZIMBABWE AND RUSSIA)

AND RHENIUM (CHILE, KAZAKHSTAN AND GERMANY). WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH RECENT HIGH PRICES FOR SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES

(FOR EXAMPLE, STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM, TITANIUM AND NICKEL) HAVE CAUSED MARGIN AND COST PRESSURES, WE DO NOT FORESEE NEAR TERM UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS,

COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WAS APPROXIMATELY 208,200, APPROXIMATELY 65 PERCENT OF WHICH REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES BASED

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES INCREASED IN 2010, AS COMPARED TO 2009, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS ACROSS THE COMPANY, MOST NOTABLY THE 2010 ACQUISITION OF THE GE SECURITY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

INTEGRATING WITHIN THE UTC FIRE & SECURITY SEGMENT. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN 2010 ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION ACTIVITY WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. DURING

2010, WE RENEGOTIATED EIGHT DOMESTIC MULTI-YEAR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVERED CERTAIN WORKERS AT PRATT & WHITNEY, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY. IN 2011, NUMEROUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE

SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVER CERTAIN WORKERS AT CARRIER. ALTHOUGH SOME PREVIOUS CONTRACT RENEGOTIATIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY AT SIKORSKY, WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE THAT THE RENEGOTIATION OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT,

SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND UNDER MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 12 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2010 ANNUAL REPORT.

RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED

FUTURE RESULTS. FOR A DISCUSSION IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE BUSINESS SECTION UNDER THE HEADINGS

OUR GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO

A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC RISKS

THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WHICH EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN THROUGHOUT 2008 AND 2009, INCLUDING

WIDESPREAD RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS, RECORD LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, SIGNIFICANT DISTRESS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, EXTREME VOLATILITY IN SECURITY PRICES, SEVERELY DIMINISHED LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY, RATING DOWNGRADES OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

AND DECLINING VALUATIONS OF OTHERS, BEGAN SHOWING SIGNS OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN 2010. HOWEVER, WHILE SOME ECONOMIC INDICATORS TRENDED POSITIVELY, THE OVERALL RATE OF GLOBAL RECOVERY EXPERIENCED DURING THE COURSE OF 2010 HAS BEEN UNEVEN AND

UNCERTAINTY CONTINUES TO EXIST OVER THE STABILITY OF THE RECOVERY. GLOBAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH IN 2010 WAS LED BY EMERGING MARKETS. IN THE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, WHERE THE RECOVERY IS SLUGGISH, THE UNWINDING OF FISCAL

STIMULI AND LINGERING HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF EXPANSIONARY MONETARY POLICIES TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC RECOVERIES. ALTHOUGH CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN THE U.S. HAS IMPROVED SINCE THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, IT STILL REMAINS LOW, WHILE

UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH AND THE HOUSING MARKET REMAINS DEPRESSED. THERE CAN BE

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE BROAD BASED AND SUSTAINABLE, OR THAT THEY WILL ENHANCE CONDITIONS IN MARKETS RELEVANT TO US. FURTHER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE FURTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL. WHILE THESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS HAVE NOT IMPAIRED OUR

ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT MARKETS AND FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS TO DATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A FURTHER DETERIORATION IN FINANCIAL MARKETS AND CONFIDENCE IN MAJOR ECONOMIES. THESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH

AS OURS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES AND OPERATIONS AND COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OR CANCELLATION OF

ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS. SIMILARLY, THIS TIGHTENING OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SUPPLIER BASE AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR ONE OR MORE OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO

EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR BANKRUPTCY. OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECREASES IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DECREASES IN BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SPENDING, AIR TRAVEL, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, THE FINANCIAL

STRENGTH OF AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS JET OPERATORS, AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT. STRENGTHENING OF THE RATE OF EXCHANGE FOR THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST CERTAIN MAJOR CURRENCIES SUCH AS THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR RESULTS.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 57% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN

2010, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, REGULATORY CHANGES, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND

ENERGY COSTS, THE TIGHTENING OF THE U.S. CREDIT MARKETS AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. A SLOWDOWN IN BUILDING AND REMODELING ACTIVITY CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CARRIERS BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, CARRIERS FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND, IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 43% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2010, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND

DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE. ALTHOUGH THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CURRENTLY FACED BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN 2010, UNCERTAINTY CONTINUES TO EXIST. AS A RESULT, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES,

INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, OF ONE OR MORE OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CANCELLATIONS OF ORDERS, REDUCTIONS IN OUR AEROSPACE SALES AND LOSSES UNDER EXISTING CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEMAND FOR AIRCRAFT

ENGINE AND COMPONENT AFTERMARKET PARTS AND SERVICE BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, AIRCRAFT OPERATORS AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS ARE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL

PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS, AIRLINE CONSOLIDATION, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CORPORATE PROFITABILITY, AND BACKLOG

LEVELS, ALL OF WHICH COULD REDUCE BOTH THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL AND THE AFTERMARKET SALES AND MARGINS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES. FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIONS OR PANDEMIC HEALTH ISSUES COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE BOTH THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL AND OUR

AEROSPACE BUSINESSES AFTERMARKET SALES AND MARGINS. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2011, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM

ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. AT TIMES, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ALSO ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO BEAR COST OVERRUNS RELATED TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL AND DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT ARISE DURING THE

DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL POLITICAL

ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS, INCLUDING USAGE,

PRICING, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATORY CHANGES AND THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT

THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTING RISKS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE

GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS

OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS RELATING

TO CERTAIN OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IF WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD

SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUBJECT US TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER

DAMAGES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER

CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND

SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR EXPORT PRIVILEGES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO U.S. MILITARY BUDGETS, WHICH MAY FLUCTUATE TO REFLECT THE POLICIES OF A NEW ADMINISTRATION OR CONGRESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

WE CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 60% OF OUR TOTAL 2010 SEGMENT SALES DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING U.S. EXPORT SALES. CHANGES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES, MAY

AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND AND REPORTED PROFITS IN OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES) WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS

FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING MARGINS MAY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WORLDWIDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS FOR CERTAIN CROSS BORDER TRANSACTIONS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN

U.S. DOLLARS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES ARE NON-U.S.

BASED, A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

MAJORITY OF SALES IN THE AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHILE THE MAJORITY OF COSTS AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE INCURRED IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY

(PRINCIPALLY THE EURO AND THE CANADIAN DOLLAR). FOR OPERATING UNITS WITH U.S. DOLLAR SALES AND LOCAL CURRENCY COSTS, THERE IS A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF

THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. TO MANAGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES, WE EMPLOY LONG-TERM HEDGING STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR SALES. SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2010 ANNUAL

REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES

IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND

OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING

LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL

SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS.

IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, MEXICO,

RUSSIA, SOUTH AFRICA AND COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK. WE EXPECT THAT SALES TO EMERGING MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES AS OUR BUSINESS EVOLVES

AND AS THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS AND REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCREASE THEIR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. EMERGING MARKET OPERATIONS CAN PRESENT MANY RISKS, INCLUDING CIVIL DISTURBANCES, HEALTH CONCERNS, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT

AND BUSINESS PRACTICES, VOLATILITY IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, ECONOMIC AND GOVERNMENT INSTABILITY, AND THE IMPOSITION OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CAPITAL CONTROLS. WHILE THESE FACTORS AND THEIR IMPACT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF

RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER-PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD

INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS, THIRD

PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS. IN MANY INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, CLOSING OR BANKRUPTCY OF OUR SUPPLIERS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES.

NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH,

OR DISPOSING OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES FROM, OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

WE SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, IN ADDITION TO INTERNAL GROWTH. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT

AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ASSETS AND PERSONNEL ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, APPLY OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES

TO THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AND COOPERATE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. HOWEVER, OUR DUE DILIGENCE REVIEWS MAY NOT IDENTIFY ALL OF THE MATERIAL ISSUES NECESSARY TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE COST AND POTENTIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES OF A PARTICULAR

TRANSACTION, INCLUDING POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO REGULATORY SANCTIONS RESULTING FROM AN ACQUISITION TARGETS PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES. WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING POST-CLOSING ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED

WITH ELIMINATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES, LITIGATION, AND OTHER LIABILITIES. WE ALSO MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, APPLYING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, OR IN MANAGING STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ACCOUNTING

REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT TO EXPENSE CERTAIN ACQUISITION COSTS AS INCURRED, MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR GREATER EARNINGS VOLATILITY AND GENERALLY LOWER EARNINGS DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE ACQUIRE NEW

BUSINESSES. FURTHERMORE, WE MAKE STRATEGIC DIVESTITURES FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE

TRANSACTION. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NONPERFORMANCE BY THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON US AND COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES; THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVES RISKS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS

INITIALLY ANTICIPATED

WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, SALE AND SUPPORT OF INNOVATIVE

PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. THE PRODUCT, PROGRAM AND SERVICE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGE AND EVOLVE REGULARLY, AND WE INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT PURSUE ADVANCEMENTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF

TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES; EXECUTION OF

INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIER- AND INTERNALLY-PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS; HIRING AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES;

IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS IN OUR TARGET END-MARKETS; VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES; THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS, AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE

TECHNOLOGIES WE DEVELOP. THESE FACTORS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ANY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS DIVERT RESOURCES FROM OTHER POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR

PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AS FULLY AS COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE OUR TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT DEVELOP OR GROW AS WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE. WE OR OUR

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THESE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. DUE TO THE DESIGN COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY IN

THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN COMPLETING THE DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS. ANY DELAYS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED DEVELOPMENT COSTS OR DEFLECT RESOURCES FROM OTHER PROJECTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER,

WHEN AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES WILL PRODUCE AND SELL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, HELICOPTERS, AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED CERTIFICATIONS. OUR CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY

AWARDED ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE COST TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. TO GENERATE AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE CONTRACTS WE MUST BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE OUR COSTS TO PROVIDE THE

SERVICES REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE OUR COSTS OR THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A CONTRACT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM AND DELIVER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS AND SCHEDULE. FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR COMPETITORS WILL

NOT DEVELOP COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE IN ADVANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGY OR OFFERINGS THAT MIGHT CAUSE OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS TO BECOME

OBSOLETE. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION, TAX, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LITIGATION, TAX AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POSSIBLE LIABILITY RELATING TO PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES,

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN EXPORT LAWS, COMPETITION LAWS AND LAWS GOVERNING IMPROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF SUCH MATTERS. IF CONVICTED OR

FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS, OTHER DAMAGES (IN CERTAIN CASES, TREBLE DAMAGES), OR SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE OF US OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO

COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE EXPORT AND TRADE PRACTICE LAWS COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF EXPORT PRIVILEGES. AS A GLOBAL BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER

COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE INTERPRETED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THEY MAY ALSO CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AS MAY RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER GUIDANCE. CHANGES IN LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EXPENSES

AND PAYMENTS, AND UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY ALSO AFFECT HOW WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AND STRUCTURE OUR INVESTMENTS AND COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING LAWS RELATING TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD LEAD TO NEW OR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN PRODUCT DESIGNS AND COULD INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE EXPENDITURES. CHANGES IN CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS, OR IN THE REGULATION OF

SUCH CONCERNS, INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE AREA OF TAXES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER TAX GUIDANCE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR TAX RECEIVABLES AND LIABILITIES AND OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATIONS BY VARIOUS

AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING TAX AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION TO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS LAUNCHED IN THE FUTURE BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AND EXISTING INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE EXPANDED. THE

GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY.

FOR NON-INCOME TAX RISKS, WE ESTIMATE MATERIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND ESTABLISH

RESERVES AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CONTINGENCIES WHERE LIABILITY IS DEEMED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO US AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME.

SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY AFFECT OUR ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATES OF THE LOSS CONTINGENCY RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OR AS A RESERVE AGAINST ASSETS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE PART I, ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K.

FOR INCOME TAX RISKS, WE RECOGNIZE TAX BENEFITS BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT THAT A TAX BENEFIT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY THAT HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL RELEVANT

FACTS. FOR THOSE INCOME TAX POSITIONS WHERE WE ASSESS THAT THERE IS NOT A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH TAX BENEFITS WILL BE SUSTAINED, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A TAX BENEFIT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS MAY CAUSE US TO CHANGE

OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUSTAINING A PREVIOUSLY-RECOGNIZED BENEFIT WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH EVENT OCCURS OR ON OUR CASH FLOWS IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY OCCURS.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REALIZE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM OUR COST

REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS AND OUR PROFITABILITY MAY BE HURT OR OUR BUSINESS OTHERWISE MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

IN

ORDER TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND CONTROL COSTS, WE ANNOUNCE FROM TIME TO TIME RESTRUCTURING PLANS, WHICH INCLUDE WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS GLOBAL FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. THESE PLANS ARE INTENDED TO

GENERATE OPERATING EXPENSE SAVINGS THROUGH DIRECT AND INDIRECT OVERHEAD EXPENSE REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SAVINGS. WE MAY UNDERTAKE FURTHER WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS OR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE. THESE TYPES OF COST REDUCTION AND

RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE COMPLEX. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR CURRENT RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, OR ANY OTHER RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES THAT WE MAY UNDERTAKE IN THE FUTURE, EXPECTED EFFICIENCIES AND BENEFITS MIGHT BE DELAYED OR NOT

REALIZED, AND OUR OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS COULD BE DISRUPTED. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIONS AND OTHER WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES INCLUDE DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTICIPATED WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS, ADDITIONAL UNEXPECTED COSTS, CHANGES IN

RESTRUCTURING PLANS THAT INCREASE OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AFFECTED, ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EMPLOYEE MORALE AND THE FAILURE TO MEET OPERATIONAL TARGETS DUE TO THE LOSS OF EMPLOYEES, ANY OF WHICH MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED

COSTS REDUCTIONS OR MAY OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE DEPEND ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND INFRINGEMENT OR FAILURE TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS

WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS AND NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY. OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS TO US, THAT PATENTS ISSUED TO OR LICENSED BY US IN

THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED OR CIRCUMVENTED BY COMPETITORS, OR THAT THESE PATENTS WILL BE FOUND TO BE VALID OR SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PRECLUDE OUR COMPETITORS FROM INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGIES SIMILAR TO THOSE COVERED BY OUR PATENTS

AND PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE AND PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMPETITORS TO CAPTURE MARKET POSITION IN SUCH

COUNTRIES BY UTILIZING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE DEVELOPED OR LICENSED BY US.

ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR FACTORS COULD

DIMINISH OR CAUSE US TO LOSE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, SUBJECT US TO JUDGMENTS, PENALTIES AND SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION COSTS, AND/OR TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY DISRUPT OUR SALES AND MARKETING OF THE AFFECTED

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

OUR FIXED ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 INCLUDE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND NON-MANUFACTURING FACILITIES SUCH AS WAREHOUSES SET FORTH IN THE

TABLES ABOVE AND A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST OF WHICH ARE GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT USING SPECIAL JIGS, TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC CONTROL FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS. THE

FACILITIES, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN USE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE WELL-MAINTAINED AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN REGULAR USE.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) SUED US IN 1999 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO, CLAIMING THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND COMMON LAW. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE

COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE AND GENERAL ELECTRICS F110 ENGINE. THE DOJ ALLEGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERPAID FOR F100 ENGINES UNDER CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE IN FISCAL YEARS 1985 THROUGH

1990 BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR SOME PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. AT TRIAL OF THIS MATTER, COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2004, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED PRATT &

WHITNEYS LIABILITY TO BE $624 MILLION. ON AUGUST 1, 2008, THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE HELD THAT THE AIR FORCE HAD NOT SUFFERED ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT PRICE CONCESSIONS. HOWEVER, THE TRIAL COURT

JUDGE FOUND THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT DUE TO INACCURATE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITS 1983 OFFER. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL DAMAGES, THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE AWARDED THE DOJ THE MAXIMUM CIVIL PENALTY OF

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$7.09 MILLION, OR $10,000 FOR EACH OF THE 709 INVOICES PRATT & WHITNEY SUBMITTED IN 1989 AND LATER UNDER THE CONTRACTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, BOTH THE DOJ AND UTC APPEALED THE DECISION TO

THE SIXTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. IN NOVEMBER 2010, THE SIXTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED PRATT & WHITNEYS LIABILITY UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ON THE QUESTION OF

DAMAGES. SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY PREVAIL, THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES

WOULD BE PAID.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON FEBRUARY 21, 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS COMPETITION DIRECTORATE (EU

COMMISSION) RULED THAT OTIS SUBSIDIARIES IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG AND THE NETHERLANDS, AND A PORTION OF THE BUSINESS OF OTIS GERMAN SUBSIDIARY, VIOLATED EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COMPETITION RULES AND ASSESSED A



225 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION) CIVIL FINE AGAINST OTIS, ITS RELEVANT LOCAL ENTITIES, AND UTC, WHICH WAS PAID DURING 2007. IN MAY

2007, WE FILED AN APPEAL OF THE DECISION BEFORE THE GENERAL COURT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE. A DECISION ON THE APPEAL IS EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. DEPENDING UPON THE OUTCOME, A FURTHER APPEAL BY EITHER PARTY TO THE EUROPEAN

COURT OF JUSTICE IS POSSIBLE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN DECEMBER 2008, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) ISSUED A CONTRACT CLAIM

AGAINST SIKORSKY TO RECOVER OVERPAYMENTS THE DOD ALLEGES IT HAS INCURRED SINCE JANUARY 2003 IN CONNECTION WITH COST ACCOUNTING CHANGES APPROVED BY THE DOD AND IMPLEMENTED BY SIKORSKY IN 1999 AND 2006. THESE CHANGES RELATE TO THE CALCULATION OF

MATERIAL OVERHEAD RATES IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. THE DOD CLAIMS THAT SIKORSKYS LIABILITY IS APPROXIMATELY $88 MILLION (INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH DECEMBER 2010). WE BELIEVE THIS CLAIM IS WITHOUT MERIT, AND SIKORSKY FILED AN APPEAL IN DECEMBER

2009 WITH THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS, WHICH IS PENDING.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN SEPTEMBER 2009, PRATT & WHITNEY

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CLOSE A REPAIR FACILITY IN EAST HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 AND AN ENGINE OVERHAUL FACILITY IN CHESHIRE, CONNECTICUT BY EARLY 2011. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS (IAM) SUBSEQUENTLY FILED

A LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT ALLEGING THAT PRATT & WHITNEYS DECISION TO CLOSE THESE FACILITIES AND TRANSFER CERTAIN WORK TO FACILITIES OUTSIDE CONNECTICUT BREACHED THE

TERMS OF ITS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE IAM AND SEEKING TO ENJOIN PRATT & WHITNEY FROM MOVING THE WORK FOR THE DURATION OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. IN FEBRUARY 2010, FOLLOWING A TRIAL ON THE MERITS, THE

DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT PERMANENTLY ENJOINING PRATT & WHITNEY FROM CLOSING THE FACILITIES AND TRANSFERRING THE WORK FOR THE DURATION OF ITS CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES NEGOTIATED A RESOLUTION OF

THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES AS PART OF A NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE IAM AND PRATT & WHITNEY, WHICH IAM MEMBERS RATIFIED ON DECEMBER 5, 2010. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INCLUDES A

PLANT-CLOSURE AGREEMENT COVERING THE CLOSURE OF THE TWO FACILITIES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN 2011.

AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, ON AUGUST 27, 2010, ROLLS-ROYCE PLC (ROLLS-ROYCE) SUED PRATT & WHITNEY IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA, ALLEGING THAT FAN BLADES ON CERTAIN ENGINES MANUFACTURED BY PRATT & WHITNEY

INFRINGE A U.S. PATENT HELD BY ROLLS-ROYCE. ROLLS-ROYCE SEEKS DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT PLUS INTEREST, AN INJUNCTION, A FINDING OF WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT, AND ATTORNEYS FEES. WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THE CASE AND BELIEVE THAT

ROLLS-ROYCES PATENT IS INVALID AND THAT PRATT & WHITNEYS PRODUCTS DO NOT INFRINGE IT. TRIAL IN THE MATTER COULD TAKE PLACE AS EARLY AS MARCH 2011. SHOULD THE PLAINTIFF ULTIMATELY PREVAIL, THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER COULD RESULT

IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. ON NOVEMBER 5, 2010, PRATT & WHITNEY AMENDED ITS

PREVIOUSLY-DISCLOSED COMPLAINT AGAINST ROLLS-ROYCE IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT, ADDING ROLLS-ROYCE GROUP PLC (ROLLS-ROYCE GROUP), THE PARENT OF ROLLS-ROYCE, AS A PARTY, OMITTING PREVIOUSLY ASSERTED CLAIMS, AND ALLEGING

THAT CERTAIN TURBOMACHINERY BLADES, ENGINES AND COMPONENTS MANUFACTURED BY ROLLS-ROYCE INFRINGE A U.S. PATENT HELD BY PRATT & WHITNEY. PRATT & WHITNEY SEEKS AN INJUNCTION, DAMAGES, INTEREST, ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER RELIEF.

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2010, PRATT & WHITNEY ALSO FILED COMPLAINTS AGAINST ROLLS-ROYCE IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE, CHANCERY DIVISION, PATENT COURT (HCJ) IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) AND WITH THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (ITC). THE

HCJ ACTION ALLEGES SIMILAR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AGAINST ROLLS-ROYCE BASED UPON A UK PATENT HELD BY PRATT & WHITNEY AND SEEKS DAMAGES PLUS INTEREST AND ALL OTHER RELIEF TO WHICH PRATT & WHITNEY IS ENTITLED, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS

FEES, EXPENSES, AND A PERMANENT ORDER PREVENTING FURTHER INFRINGEMENTS. THE ITC COMPLAINT SEEKS A PERMANENT EXCLUSION ORDER BARRING THE IMPORTATION INTO THE U.S. OF INFRINGING TURBOMACHINERY BLADES, ENGINES AND ENGINE COMPONENTS MANUFACTURED BY

ROLLS-ROYCE AND ROLLS-ROYCE GROUP, AND REQUESTS A PERMANENT CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER AGAINST ROLLS-ROYCE AND ROLLS-ROYCE GROUP PREVENTING FURTHER IMPORTING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING, DEMONSTRATING, TESTING, DISTRIBUTING, LICENSING, OFFERING FOR SALE, OR

USE OF SUCH INFRINGING TURBOMACHINERY BLADES, ENGINES AND ENGINE COMPONENTS.

LIKE MANY OTHER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, WE

OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE WE HAVE NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATE IT IN ANY

CURRENTLY-MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS HAVE BEEN COVERED BY INSURANCE OR

OTHER FORMS OF INDEMNITY OR HAVE BEEN DISMISSED WITHOUT PAYMENT. THE REMAINDER OF THE CLOSED CASES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE

THAT RESOLUTION OF THESE ASBESTOS-RELATED MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ROUTINE LAWSUITS, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS (SOME OF WHICH INVOLVE

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE LEGAL MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH

BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK
