FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GE AVIATION AND ROLLS-ROYCE. FOR

INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL

REPORT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED,

WERE $1,678 MILLION, OR 3.1 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2007, AS COMPARED WITH $1,529 MILLION OR 3.2 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2006 AND $1,367 MILLION OR 3.2 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2005. WE ALSO PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS

FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY SEGMENTS, AMOUNTED TO

$2,123 MILLION IN 2007, AS COMPARED TO $1,952 MILLION IN 2006 AND $1,650 MILLION IN 2005. THESE CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, THROUGH COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND AMOUNTS THAT ARE CAPITALIZED

INTO INVENTORY TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOVERED THROUGH PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT SHIPMENTS. OF THE TOTALS, $1,872 MILLION, $1,621 MILLION AND $1,478 MILLION WERE EXPENSED IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING COSTS HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WE WOULD NORMALLY BE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR

ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. MOST OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY $2,221 MILLION

OR 4.1 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR 2007 WERE MADE UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE

ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT WE REDUCE CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR

COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS HAVE INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS. WE HAVE MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, HAVE SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND

CONTINUE TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE HAVE INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION,

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES 1 AND 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT.

MOST OF THE U.S. LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF WE WERE

CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE ARE AWARDED UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN AFFECT OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE SAFETY

REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF CARRIER, OTIS AND UTC F&S RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT OUR

AEROSPACE BUSINESSES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RAW MATERIALS

WE MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE THIS PORTFOLIO IS CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF

RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SOURCES FOR OUR PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING. WE WORK CONTINUOUSLY WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND TO

REDUCE COSTS. WE PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING OUR PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING ONLINE BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME

INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR

CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (FINLAND, NORWAY, RUSSIA AND CANADA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND CANADA), CHROMIUM (SOUTH AFRICA, KAZAKHSTAN, ZIMBABWE AND RUSSIA) AND RHENIUM (CHILE, KAZAKHSTAN AND GERMANY). WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE

BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH RECENT HIGH PRICES FOR SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES (STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM, TITANIUM AND NICKEL) HAVE CAUSED

MARGIN AND COST PRESSURES, WE DO NOT FORESEE ANY NEAR TERM UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES THAT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE

EFFECTS OF THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 225,600, APPROXIMATELY 66 PERCENT OF WHICH REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2007, WE RENEGOTIATED TWENTY-TWO MULTI-YEAR

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVERED CERTAIN WORKERS AT OTIS AND PRATT & WHITNEY. IN 2008, NUMEROUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVER CERTAIN WORKERS AT

CARRIER AND HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY PROBLEMS IN RENEGOTIATING THESE CONTRACTS THAT WOULD EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR DISCUSSION

OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE

RESULTS. FOR A DISCUSSION IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE AND

CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE AEROSPACE AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 37 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED

REVENUES IN 2007, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES. THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND CAPITAL SPENDING BY AIRLINES AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS, CORPORATE PROFITABILITY AND BACKLOG LEVELS. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2008, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO

REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. AT TIMES, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ALSO ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO BEAR COST OVERRUNS RELATED TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL AND DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT

ARISE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS,

INCLUDING USAGE, PRICING, REGULATORY CHANGES, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO NEW ENGINES THAT INCREASE RELIABILITY. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS

IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES IN 2007, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, CARRIERS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT

EQUIPMENT AND, IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR

FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER

DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. IF WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH

WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE

COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUBJECT US TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD. THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR EXPORT PRIVILEGES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 62 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL 2007 SEGMENT

REVENUES DERIVED FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM U.S. EXPORT SALES. FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND IN EXPORT MARKETS AND AFFECT REPORTED PROFITS OF OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY THE COMMERCIAL

BUSINESSES) WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A

STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MAJORITY OF SALES IN THE AEROSPACE BUSINESSES IS TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CONSISTENT WITH

ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHILE THE MAJORITY OF COSTS AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS INCURRED IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY (PRINCIPALLY THE EURO AND THE CANADIAN DOLLAR). FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.S. DOLLAR SALES AND LOCAL

CURRENCY COSTS, THERE IS A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. TO MANAGE THIS EXPOSURE, WE EMPLOY

LONG-TERM HEDGING STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR REVENUES. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING

GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR

AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO

PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA AND SOUTH AFRICA THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY,

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK. WHILE THESE FACTORS OR THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER-PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND

SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN

THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE

SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS OR THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE

INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES

ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE

AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS

WE

SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE

SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ASSETS AND PERSONNEL ACQUIRED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, APPLY OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AND COOPERATE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. WE MAY

ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, APPLYING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, AND IN MANAGING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS WE

ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE DESIGN,

MANUFACTURE AND SERVICE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES; THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVES RISKS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED

WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, SALE AND SUPPORT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. WE

REGULARLY INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT PURSUE ADVANCEMENTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES; EXECUTION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF INTERNAL AND SUPPLIER-PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS

AND SUBCONTRACTORS; ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FACTORS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

- 9 -

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THESE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING

OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES PRATT & WHITNEY OR ITS AFFILIATES WILL PRODUCE AIRCRAFT ENGINES CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED

CERTIFICATIONS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND LEGAL

COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE

RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LITIGATION CONCERNING PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN EXPORT LAWS,

COMPETITION LAWS AND SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES. WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF SUCH LITIGATION. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS, OTHER DAMAGES (IN

CERTAIN CASES, TREBLE DAMAGES), OR SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE OF US OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE EXPORT AND TRADE PRACTICE LAWS COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND

SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF EXPORT PRIVILEGES. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE THESE RISKS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL

CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. AS REQUIRED BY

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE ESTIMATE MATERIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND ESTABLISH RESERVES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CONTINGENCIES WHERE LIABILITY IS DEEMED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

KNOWN TO US AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. IF THERE IS A RANGE OF ESTIMATES AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THAT RANGE IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THAN ANOTHER, THEN WE ACCRUE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY AFFECT OUR

ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATES OF THE LOSS CONTINGENCY RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OR AS A RESERVE AGAINST ASSETS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE

RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR FIXED ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES AND NON-MANUFACTURING FACILITIES SUCH AS WAREHOUSES SET FORTH IN THE TABLES ABOVE AND A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST OF WHICH ARE GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT USING SPECIAL JIGS, TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND

IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC CONTROL FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS. THE FACILITIES, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN USE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE WELL-MAINTAINED AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN

REGULAR USE.

OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 FOR THE

PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES. UTILIZATION OF THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON

DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUOUSLY REVIEW OUR ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST OUR FACILITY NEEDS.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) SUED US IN 1999 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO, CLAIMING THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND COMMON LAW. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE

COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE AND GENERAL ELECTRICS F110 ENGINE. THE DOJ ALLEGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERPAID FOR F100 ENGINES UNDER CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE IN FISCAL YEARS 1985 THROUGH

1990 BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR SOME PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. TREBLE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM COULD BE ASSESSED IF THE COURT

FINDS THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT, AND COMMON LAW DAMAGES WOULD ACCRUE PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST. TRIAL OF THIS MATTER WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2004. AT TRIAL, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED PRATT & WHITNEYS

LIABILITY IS $624 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSTATED, DENIED ANY LIABILITY AND VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED AGAINST THE DOJS CLAIMS. A DECISION IS PENDING. SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY PREVAIL, THE OUTCOME OF THIS

MATTER COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON FEBRUARY 21, 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS COMPETITION DIRECTORATE (EU COMMISSION) RULED THAT OTIS

SUBSIDIARIES IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG AND THE NETHERLANDS, AND A PORTION OF THE BUSINESS OF OTIS GERMAN SUBSIDIARY, VIOLATED EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COMPETITION RULES AND ASSESSED A 225 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION) CIVIL FINE

AGAINST OTIS, ITS RELEVANT LOCAL ENTITIES, AND UTC, WHICH WAS PAID DURING 2007. IN MAY 2007, WE FILED AN APPEAL OF THE DECISION BEFORE THE EUS EUROPEAN COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE. RESOLUTION OF THE MATTER IS NOT EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE

MONTHS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE AUSTRIAN FEDERAL COMPETITION AUTHORITY (COMPETITION AUTHORITY)

FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE CARTEL COURT IN AUSTRIA (CARTEL COURT) AGAINST OTIS AUSTRIAN SUBSIDIARY IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF UNLAWFUL COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE AUSTRIAN ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR INDUSTRY. ON DECEMBER 14,

2007 THE CARTEL COURT, AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMPETITION AUTHORITY, ASSESSED CIVIL FINES AGAINST THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING A FINE OF 18.2 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION) AGAINST OTIS AUSTRIAN

SUBSIDIARY, WHICH FINE HAS BEEN FULLY PROVIDED FOR AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. WE HAVE APPEALED THE CARTEL COURT RULING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN 2005 THE KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION (KFTC) CONDUCTED AN INSPECTION AT THE

OFFICES OF OTIS KOREA AND ITS THREE KOREAN COMPETITORS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF A SUBSEQUENT INTERNAL INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY OTIS, WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN OTIS KOREA EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN COLLUSIVE ACTIVITIES IN THE KOREAN MARKET FOR NEW

EQUIPMENT, AND THAT CERTAIN EMPLOYEES ALSO ENGAGED IN PRICE-FIXING IN THE MARKET FOR INDUSTRIAL ELECTRIC MOTORS. IN MAY 2007, THE KFTC EXPANDED ITS INVESTIGATION TO ALSO FOCUS ON PRICING OF SUBCONTRACTS FOR ELEVATOR INSTALLATION. BASED ON ITS OWN

INVESTIGATION, OTIS BELIEVES CERTAIN OTIS KOREA EMPLOYEES SHARED SUBCONTRACTOR PRICING INFORMATION WITH COMPETITORS IN YEARS PRIOR TO 2005. OTIS HAS FULLY COOPERATED WITH THE KFTC INVESTIGATION, DISCLOSED THE RESULTS OF ITS INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS

TO THE KFTC, AND APPLIED FOR LENIENCY WITH RESPECT TO THOSE DISCLOSURES. IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE KFTC ISSUED ITS DECISION REGARDING THE MOTOR CARTEL AND GRANTED OTIS KOREA 100 PERCENT LENIENCY. OTIS EXPECTS TO RECEIVE A COMPLAINT REGARDING THE NEW

EQUIPMENT SALES INVESTIGATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. A COMPLAINT REGARDING INSTALLATION SUBCONTRACTOR PRICING MAY BE RECEIVED SOMETIME IN 2008. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY FINES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS OR ON OTIS COMPETITIVE POSITION.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, CLASS ACTION CONSUMER

COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST CARRIER IN WASHINGTON, MINNESOTA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, ONTARIO AND BRITISH COLUMBIA. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE CARRIER ENGAGED IN DECEPTIVE AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BY KNOWINGLY SELLING HIGH-EFFICIENCY CONDENSING

FURNACES CONTAINING SECONDARY HEAT EXCHANGERS THAT CORRODE AND FAIL PREMATURELY, CAUSING RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS TO INCUR LABOR COSTS FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY CARRIERS WARRANTY. WHILE CARRIER DENIES LIABILITY AND

DISPUTES THE CLAIMS, CARRIER AND COUNSEL FOR THE CLASS ACTION PLAINTIFFS HAVE REACHED A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THESE ACTIONS. UNDER THE SETTLEMENT, CARRIER AGREES TO (1) EXTEND THE LABOR WARRANTY ON THE HEAT EXCHANGERS FOR CURRENT

OWNERS OF AFFECTED FURNACES, OR PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL CREDIT TOWARD THE PURCHASE OF NEW EQUIPMENT, (2) REIMBURSE OWNERS WHO HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR REPAIRS TO THEIR HEAT EXCHANGER, AND (3) PAY THE FEES AND COSTS INCURRED BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE

SETTLEMENT IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE U.S. AND CANADIAN COURTS, AFTER NOTICE TO THE POTENTIAL CLASS MEMBERS. CARRIER ANTICIPATES DECISIONS BY THESE COURTS DURING 2008. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE RECORDED A RESERVE FOR THE

ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COSTS OF THE SETTLEMENT.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, WE OR OUR

SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE WE HAVE NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATE IT IN ANY

CURRENTLY-MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. WE HAVE MADE NO PAYMENT IN A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE CASES CLOSED TO DATE. THE

REMAINDER OF THE RESOLVED CASES HAVE SETTLED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO US, AND HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN PART BY INSURANCE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE WERE NAMED IN APPROXIMATELY 3,100 LAWSUITS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 14,400 INDIVIDUAL

CLAIMANTS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE PENDING CLAIMS ARE IN STATE COURTS IN MISSISSIPPI, TEXAS AND NEW YORK.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED

ABOVE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE LEGAL MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE  COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS IN ITEM 1, BUSINESS, AND IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS, IN THIS FORM 10-K.

STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT

MISSTATEMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
