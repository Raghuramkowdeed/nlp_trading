PRATT & WHITNEY AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS AEROSPACE

AND DEFENSE PRODUCTS

THE CORPORATIONS AEROSPACE AND

DEFENSE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS,

FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND

COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS.  IN

PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL

AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS.  MANUFACTURERS OF MANY AIRCRAFT OFFER THEIR CUSTOMERS A

CHOICE OF ENGINES AT THE TIME OF SALE OF AIRCRAFT.  AS A RESULT, ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY

OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST

GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS.

PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GENERAL ELECTRIC

COMPANY AND ROLLS ROYCE PLC.  THE INITIAL SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND OTHER COMPONENTS

BY MANUFACTURERS AND PURCHASERS OF NEW AIRCRAFT CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

LATER SALES OF SPARE PARTS AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES.  IN ADDITION TO THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS OF SALE MENTIONED ABOVE, THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION IN THE PRATT

& WHITNEY AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS SEGMENTS ARE PRICE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, SERVICE AND

DELIVERY SCHEDULE.  (FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS,

PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND

OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ON PAGES 17 AND 24 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE

RESULTS OF THE CORPORATIONS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES INCLUDE LENGTHY AND

COSTLY DEVELOPMENT CYCLES AND HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON A SMALL NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS.

SALES OF MILITARY PRODUCTS ARE AFFECTED BY DEFENSE BUDGETS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER

COUNTRIES, U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS.

MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES ARE AFFECTED BY POLICIES OF THE U.S. AND OTHER

GOVERNMENTS OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURER.  PRATT & WHITNEYS AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS OPERATIONS CAN

ALSO BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATIONS 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS AND THOSE DESCRIBED

IN THE BUSINESS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS RELATING

TO THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE.

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF PRATT &

WHITNEY'S AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS BUSINESS, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND

AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES.  THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT

BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND.  ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR

COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2002, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED.

UTC FUEL CELLS, LLC (UTC FUEL

CELLS) IS A WORLD LEADER IN FUEL CELL PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT FOR COMMERCIAL,

TRANSPORTATION, RESIDENTIAL AND SPACE APPLICATIONS.  UTC FUEL CELLS IS THE SOLE

SUPPLIER OF FUEL CELLS FOR U.S. SPACE MISSIONS AND ALSO OFFERS A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

FUEL CELL POWER PLANT, KNOWN AS THE PC25.  OVER 245 PC25 UNITS HAVE BEEN

DELIVERED AROUND THE WORLD.  FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS USING PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE

TECHNOLOGY ("PEM") ARE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION, COMMERCIAL

STATIONARY, AND RESIDENTIAL APPLICATIONS.  UTC FUEL CELLS IS WORKING WITH AUTOMAKERS

AND BUS MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, ON DEVELOPMENT AND

DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS FOR AUTOMOBILES.  IN 2001, UTC FUEL CELLS AND SHELL HYDROGEN

US FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND SELL FUEL PROCESSORS AND HYDROGEN

GENERATION SYSTEMS.

ALTHOUGH FUEL CELLS ARE BELIEVED TO BE

SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER GENERATORS IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL

CHARACTERISTICS, CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES REMAIN LOW ACROSS THE INDUSTRY.  CONTINUED

TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND WIDER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION

COST OF FUEL CELL COMPONENTS AND POWER PLANTS.  THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT

UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PEM FUEL CELLS WILL BE PRODUCED.

UTC FUEL CELLS CONTINUES TO SEEK STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO DEVELOP SOURCES OF SUPPLY,

AS WELL AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.  TOSHIBA CORPORATION OWNS A 10

PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN UTC FUEL CELLS.

CORPORATIONS 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE CORPORATION'S BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, THE

CORPORATION SPENDS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ITS OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

SUCH EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $1,254 MILLION OR

4.6 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2001, AS COMPARED WITH $1,302 MILLION OR 5.0 PERCENT OF

TOTAL SALES IN 2000 AND $1,292 MILLION OR 5.4 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 1999.  THE

CORPORATION ALSO PERFORMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS.  SUCH CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS

PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE

FLIGHT SYSTEMS SEGMENT, AMOUNTED TO $845 MILLION IN 2001, AS COMPARED WITH $866 MILLION IN

2000 AND $963 MILLION IN 1999.

CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND

OTHER MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO

TERMINATION AT THE CONVENIENCE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, IN WHICH EVENT THE CORPORATION

NORMALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITS ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED PLUS A

REASONABLE PROFIT.  MOST OF THE CORPORATION'S SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE

CONTRACTS; APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION OF THE CORPORATION'S TOTAL SALES FOR 2001 WERE MADE

UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THE CORPORATION HAS RECEIVED

ALLEGATIONS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT SOME CONTRACT PRICES SHOULD BE REDUCED BECAUSE

COST OR PRICING DATA SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN

CONFORMANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

THE CORPORATION

HAS MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES IT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE, HAS SETTLED SOME

ALLEGATIONS, AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY FURTHER PRICE REDUCTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH

FLOWS.

THE CORPORATION IS NOW, AND BELIEVES THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT IT WILL BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS.  SEE ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ON PAGE 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE

14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 24 OF THE CORPORATIONS 2001

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  IF THE CORPORATION OR ONE OF

ITS BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY OF THESE

INVESTIGATIONS, IT COULD BE SUSPENDED FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  IF CONVICTED OR

FOUND LIABLE, THE CORPORATION COULD BE FINED AND DEBARRED FROM NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING

FOR A PERIOD GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED THREE YEARS.

ANY

CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD COULD BE VOIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE, SOME OF WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT MINORITY INTERESTS.  CHANGES IN

LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS WORLDWIDE

OPERATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS IS IMPORTANT TO

CARRIERS BUSINESSES, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT

ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT THE

CORPORATIONS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES.  THE CORPORATIONS

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND

POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INVESTMENTS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF

EARNINGS.

SOME FOREIGN CUSTOMERS IN THE

CORPORATIONS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES MAY REQUIRE COUNTER-PURCHASE OR OFFSET

ARRANGEMENTS AS A CONDITION TO A SALE, SUCH AS REQUIRING THE CORPORATION TO PURCHASE

SUPPLIES IN THE CUSTOMERS COUNTRY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL

SUPPORT PROJECTS.

THE CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

WITH JURISDICTION OVER ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  THE CORPORATION HAS INCURRED AND WILL

LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL STATUTES FOR THE

CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE CORPORATION DOES

NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE

ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR THESE CLEANUP LIABILITIES

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON ITS CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON

PAGE 8 AND NOTES 1 AND 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 16 AND 24

OF THE CORPORATION'S 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

MOST OF THE LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS.  IF THE CORPORATION WERE CONVICTED OF A

VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES

INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACT AWARDED TO THE CORPORATION UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIES

THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAS BEEN CORRECTED.

- 6 -

WHILE THE CORPORATION'S PATENTS,

TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES ARE CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO ITS BUSINESS, THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS,

TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL

BUSINESS OF THE CORPORATION OR ON ANY OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE U.S., THE

CORPORATION IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS RAW MATERIALS

REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (AFRICA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND CHILE) AND CHROMIUM (AFRICA,

EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE AND THE COUNTRIES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION).  TO

ALLEVIATE THIS DEPENDENCE AND ACCOMPANYING RISK, THE CORPORATION HAS A NUMBER OF ON-GOING

PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SUPPLIERS; THE INCREASED USE OF MORE READILY

AVAILABLE MATERIALS THROUGH MATERIAL SUBSTITUTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ALLOYS; AND

THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

SUCH AS NET SHAPE FORGING.

THE CORPORATION HAS SOUGHT COST

REDUCTIONS IN ITS PURCHASES OF CERTAIN OTHER MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, AND SUPPLIES BY

CONSOLIDATING ITS PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND USING ONLINE BIDDING

COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS.  IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION IS

RELIANT UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY.  A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM ITS

SUPPLIERS, THEREFORE, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION'S ABILITY TO MEET

ITS COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS.  THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT IT HAS APPROPRIATELY

BALANCED THE RISKS AGAINST THE COSTS OF SUSTAINING A GREATER NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT FORESEE ANY UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, OR SUPPLIES

WHICH WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OVERALL BUSINESS, OR ON ANY OF ITS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IN THE NEAR TERM.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER RISKS TO WHICH

THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS MAY BE

SUBJECT, INCLUDING THE RISKS OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, SEE THE

BUSINESS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT

AND MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION APPEARING ON PAGES 1 THROUGH 9 OF THE CORPORATIONS 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS.

EMPLOYEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE CORPORATION'S

TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 152,000.  FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE

CORPORATION'S RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON PAGE 4 AND NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 22 TO 23 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2001 ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

THE CORPORATION'S FIXED ASSETS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001 INCLUDE THE PLANTS AND WAREHOUSES DESCRIBED BELOW AND A SUBSTANTIAL

QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST OF WHICH IS GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT USING SPECIAL JIGS, TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC

CONTROL FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS.  THE PLANTS, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT IN USE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE WELL

MAINTAINED, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN REGULAR USE.

THE FOLLOWING SQUARE FOOTAGE NUMBERS ARE

APPROXIMATIONS.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE CORPORATION OPERATED (A) PLANTS IN THE

U.S. WHICH HAD 29.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 3.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED; (B)

PLANTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHICH HAD 20.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 2.3 MILLION SQUARE

FEET WERE LEASED; (C) WAREHOUSES IN THE U.S. WHICH HAD 10.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH

6.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED; AND (D) WAREHOUSES OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHICH HAD 5.9

MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 3.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF THE

CORPORATION'S RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON PRODUCTION FACILITIES, SEE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON PAGE 4 AND NOTE 11 OF

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 22 TO 23 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2001

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED

ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 FOR THE PRODUCTION

OF THE CORPORATION'S PRODUCTS ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN

IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, ARE BEING APPROPRIATELY UTILIZED CONSISTENT WITH

EXPERIENCE AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES.

UTILIZATION OF THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS.  THE

CORPORATION CONTINUOUSLY REVIEWS ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES AND, BASED ON

THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL FACILITIES OR DISPOSE OF EXISTING

FACILITIES.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT

OF DEFENSE AND THE CORPORATION ARE LITIGATING WHETHER PRATT & WHITNEY'S ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES  FOR CERTAIN ENGINE PARTS ARE ACCEPTABLE.  THE LITIGATION, FILED WITH

THE ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS (ASBCA), NO. 47416 ET AL.,

RELATES TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR ENGINE PARTS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES UNDER COMMERCIAL

ENGINE COLLABORATION PROGRAMS FROM 1984 THROUGH 1995.  IN DECEMBER 1996 THE

GOVERNMENT CLAIMED DAMAGES OF $157.6 MILLION, PLUS $102.7 MILLION IN INTEREST THROUGH

1996.  PRATT & WHITNEY BELIEVES ITS ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ARE PROPER AND HAS NOT

MODIFIED THEM.  ON JULY 31, 2001, THE ASBCA ISSUED A DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE

CORPORATION.  THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT ON NOVEMBER 29, 2001.  SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT

ULTIMATELY PREVAIL ON LIABILITY, DAMAGES COULD BE LARGER THAN INITIALLY CLAIMED BECAUSE

THE GOVERNMENT MAY AMEND ITS CLAIM TO INCLUDE THE PERIOD AFTER 1995 AND INTEREST CONTINUES

TO ACCRUE ON THE CLAIM ASSERTED IN 1996.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE CORPORATION

HAS BEEN SERVED WITH TWO QUI TAM COMPLAINTS UNDER THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT: U.S. EX REL. DRAKE V. NORDEN

SYSTEMS, INC. AND UTC, NO. 394CV00963 (FILED JULY 1997, AND INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF

IMPROPER ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED ASSETS) AND U.S. EX REL. CAPELLA V. UTC AND NORDEN SYSTEMS

INC., NO. 394CV02063 (FILED DECEMBER 1994, AND INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER

ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE COSTS).  THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDES FOR PENALTIES

IN A CIVIL CASE OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM SUBMITTED.  THE NUMBER OF FALSE

CLAIMS IMPLICATED BY THE FOREGOING QUI TAM COMPLAINTS CANNOT CURRENTLY BE ASCERTAINED;

HOWEVER, IF DETERMINED ADVERSELY TO THE CORPORATION, THE NUMBER COULD RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES.  THE QUI TAM RELATOR IN EACH CASE HAS CLAIMED UNSPECIFIED

DAMAGES (TREBLED) AND PENALTIES, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN EACH CASE HAS DECLINED

TO TAKE OVER THE LITIGATION.  IN AUGUST 2000, THE COURT DISMISSED PORTIONS OF THE

COMPLAINTS.  IN AUGUST 2001, THE COURT DISMISSED ADDITIONAL CLAIMS IN THE

DRAKE

CASE.

IN MARCH 1999, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FILED A CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (WESTERN DIVISION), NO. C-3-99-093.  THIS

LAWSUIT IS RELATED TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT &

WHITNEY'S F100 ENGINE AND GE'S F110 ENGINE, FOR CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE

BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS 1985 AND 1990, INCLUSIVE.  THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT PRATT

& WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT

WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS.  THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS DAMAGES OF AT LEAST $95

MILLION (SOME PORTION OF WHICH WOULD BE TREBLED PLUS PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER CLAIM

SUBMITTED).

- 8 -

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING OR ANY OTHER LEGAL MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, OR

FINANCIAL POSITION.  A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED

INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF THE CORPORATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE

CORPORATIONS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE  CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL

AND OTHER MATTERS IN ITEM 1  BUSINESS ON PAGE 6 OF THIS FORM 10-K.
