AND EACH COMPETES ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, DELIVERY SCHEDULE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE.

OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO

SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN

REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. IN

ADDITION, THE U.S. AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS POLICIES OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AFFECT MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES. SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALES IN 2005 AND $1,267 MILLION OR 3.5 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2004. WE ALSO PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK

UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY

SEGMENTS, AMOUNTED TO $1,952 MILLION IN 2006, AS COMPARED WITH $1,650 MILLION IN 2005 AND $1,619 MILLION IN 2004. THESE CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, THROUGH COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND AMOUNTS

THAT ARE CAPITALIZED INTO INVENTORY TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOVERED THROUGH PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT SHIPMENTS. OF THE TOTALS, $1,621 MILLION, $1,478 MILLION AND $1,585 MILLION WERE EXPENSED IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING COSTS HAVE

BEEN CAPITALIZED.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR

CONVENIENCE, WE WOULD NORMALLY BE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE

GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. MOST OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR

2006 WERE MADE UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY

DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT WE REDUCE CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT

HAVE CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS HAVE INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS. WE HAVE MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, HAVE SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND WE CONTINUE TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE HAVE INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE

THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES 1 AND 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT.

MOST OF THE U.S. LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF WE WERE

CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE ARE AWARDED UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN AFFECT OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE SAFETY

REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF CARRIER, OTIS AND UTC F&S RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT OUR

AEROSPACE BUSINESSES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RAW MATERIALS

WE MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE THIS PORTFOLIO IS CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF

RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SOURCES FOR OUR PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING. WE WORK CONTINUOUSLY WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND TO

REDUCE COSTS. WE PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING OUR PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING ONLINE BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME

INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS BY SUPPLIERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE U.S., WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS

REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (FINLAND, NORWAY, RUSSIA AND CANADA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND CANADA), CHROMIUM (SOUTH AFRICA, KAZAKHSTAN, ZIMBABWE AND RUSSIA) AND RHENIUM (CHILE, KAZAKHSTAN AND GERMANY). WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH RECENT HIGH PRICES FOR SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES

(STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM, TITANIUM AND NICKEL) HAVE CAUSED MARGIN AND COST PRESSURES, WE DO NOT FORESEE ANY NEAR TERM UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES THAT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OR ON ANY OF OUR BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY

214,500, APPROXIMATELY 66 PERCENT OF WHICH REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2006, WE RENEGOTIATED TWENTY MULTI-YEAR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVERED CERTAIN WORKERS AT SIKORSKY AND CARRIER.

IN 2007, NUMEROUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVER CERTAIN WORKERS AT HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND, OTIS AND PRATT & WHITNEY. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY PROBLEMS IN RENEGOTIATING THESE CONTRACTS

THAT WOULD EITHER INDIVIDUALLY, OR IN THE AGGREGATE, HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE

IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESULTS. FOR A DISCUSSION IDENTIFYING

ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE AND CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2006

ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE AEROSPACE AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED 37 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES IN 2006, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES. THE AVIATION INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND CAPITAL SPENDING BY AIRLINES AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC

LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS AND BACKLOG LEVELS. ALSO,

SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2007, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. IN ADDITION, OUR

AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE

SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS, INCLUDING USAGE, PRICING, REGULATORY CHANGES, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER

AIRCRAFT AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO NEW ENGINES THAT INCREASE RELIABILITY. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED 63 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES

IN 2006, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS AND

OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, CARRIERS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND, IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY

THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE

CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. IF WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS

(INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUBJECT US TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM

RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND

TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE U.S. COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR EXPORT PRIVILEGES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH 60 PERCENT

OF OUR TOTAL 2006 SEGMENT REVENUES DERIVED FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM U.S. EXPORT SALES. FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND IN EXPORT MARKETS AND AFFECT REPORTED PROFITS OF OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS

(PRIMARILY THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES) WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR

REVENUES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION,

EXCHANGE CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE

US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS. IN

ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA AND SOUTH AFRICA, THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK. WHILE THESE FACTORS OR THE

IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION

DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS OR THIRD PARTY CONTRACT

MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR

COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE

INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS

WE SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE

VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ASSETS AND

PERSONNEL ACQUIRED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, APPLY OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AND COOPERATE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, AND IN MANAGING

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE, OR TIMING, OF BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES; THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVES RISKS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED

WE SEEK TO

ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, SALE AND SUPPORT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. WE REGULARLY INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT PURSUE ADVANCEMENTS IN A

WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES;

EXECUTION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF INTERNAL AND SUPPLIER PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS; ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES AND VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE

TECHNOLOGIES. THESE FACTORS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THESE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. IN

PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES PRATT & WHITNEY OR ITS AFFILIATES WILL PRODUCE AIRCRAFT ENGINES CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED CERTIFICATIONS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

OPERATING RESULTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

LITIGATION CONCERNING PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, COMPLIANCE WITH COMPETITION LAWS AND SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADOPTED

APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE THESE RISKS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM

TIME TO TIME. OUR RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE ESTIMATE MATERIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND

ESTABLISH RESERVES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CONTINGENCIES WHERE LIABILITY IS DEEMED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO US AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MAY AFFECT OUR ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATES OF THE LOSS CONTINGENCY RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OR AS A RESERVE AGAINST ASSETS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY

WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR FIXED ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND NON-MANUFACTURING FACILITIES SUCH AS WAREHOUSES SET FORTH IN THE

TABLES ABOVE AND A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST OF WHICH ARE GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT USING SPECIAL JIGS, TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC CONTROL FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS. THE

FACILITIES, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN USE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN REGULAR USE.

OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS

ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES. UTILIZATION OF THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS. WE

CONTINUOUSLY REVIEW OUR ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST OUR FACILITY NEEDS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) SUED US IN 1999 IN

THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO, CLAIMING THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND COMMON LAW. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT &

WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE AND GES F110 ENGINE. THE DOJ ALLEGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERPAID FOR F100 ENGINES UNDER CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE IN FISCAL YEARS 1985 THROUGH 1990 BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS

ESTIMATED COSTS FOR SOME PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. TREBLE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM COULD BE ASSESSED IF THE COURT FINDS THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE

CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT, AND COMMON LAW DAMAGES WOULD ACCRUE PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST. TRIAL OF THIS MATTER WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2004. AT TRIAL, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED PRATT & WHITNEYS LIABILITY IS $624 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

ESTIMATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSTATED, DENIED ANY LIABILITY AND VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED AGAINST THE DOJS CLAIMS. A DECISION IS PENDING. SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY PREVAIL WITH RESPECT TO THE FOREGOING GOVERNMENT CONTRACT MATTER, THE OUTCOME

COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSIONS COMPETITION DIRECTORATE (EU COMMISSION) CONDUCTED INSPECTIONS IN EARLY 2004 AT OFFICES OF OUR OTIS SUBSIDIARY IN BERLIN, BRUSSELS, LUXEMBOURG AND PARIS RELATING TO AN INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE UNLAWFUL COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS

INVOLVING THE EUROPEAN ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR INDUSTRY. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OTIS EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES AT A LOCAL LEVEL IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG, THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY IN

VIOLATION OF OTIS AND UTC POLICIES AND EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW. ON OCTOBER 13, 2005, WE RECEIVED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS (SO) FROM THE EU COMMISSION RELATING TO THIS INVESTIGATION. THE SO, AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT, ALLEGES INFRINGEMENTS

OF EU COMPETITION RULES BY CERTAIN ELEVATOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING OTIS, IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG, THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY. WE RESPONDED TO THE SO ON FEBRUARY 21, 2006 AND HAVE COOPERATED FULLY WITH THE EU COMMISSION. WE EXPECT THE EU

COMMISSION TO ISSUE A DECISION IN THE NEAR TERM, BUT CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF CIVIL FINES TO WHICH WE OR OTIS WOULD LIKELY BE SUBJECT. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH FINES COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD IN

WHICH THE LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE FINES WOULD BE PAID. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH FINES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WOULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OTIS COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SINCE THE EU COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION BECAME PUBLIC, CLASS

ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES ALLEGING THAT WE, OTIS AND OTHER ELEVATOR MANUFACTURERS ENGAGED IN VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE SHERMAN ACT. THOSE LAWSUITS WERE TRANSFERRED TO AND

CONSOLIDATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. ON JUNE 6, 2006, THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS WITHOUT LEAVE TO REPLEAD. ON JUNE 30, 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. WE EXPECT A DECISION IN THE SECOND OR THIRD QUARTER OF 2007. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THIS LITIGATION IS WITHOUT MERIT.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN DECEMBER 2003, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY EXECUTED A SEARCH WARRANT AT HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND SEEKING RECORDS AND DATA REGARDING PROCESSES FOR MONITORING, TREATING AND DISCHARGING

WASTEWATER AT A CONNECTICUT MANUFACTURING FACILITY. HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND ALSO RECEIVED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME MATTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. ON FEBRUARY 8, 2007 HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND PLED

GUILTY TO A TWO-COUNT FEDERAL CRIMINAL INFORMATION ALLEGING THAT IT VIOLATED THE CLEAN WATER ACT BY FILING INACCURATE REPORTS OF HEXAVALENT CHROME LEVELS AT AN INTERNAL SAMPLING POINT FROM 2001 TO 2003, AND BY DISCHARGING WASTEWATER CONTAINING AN

EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF COPPER INTO THE FARMINGTON RIVER. PURSUANT TO A PLEA AGREEMENT, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND WILL PAY A $1 MILLION PENALTY AND BE PLACED ON PROBATION FOR A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. OVER THIS PERIOD, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO

AND PERFORM $11 MILLION OF PROJECTS TO BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING, COMPLIANCE, OVERSIGHT, REPORTING AND AUDITING. HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND ALSO ENTERED INTO A CONSENT ORDER WITH THE

CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO RESOLVE THE RELATED NOTICE OF VIOLATION. UNDER THE CONSENT ORDER, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND WILL PAY AN ADDITIONAL $75,000 FINE, AND $675,000 OF THE $11 MILLION IN PROJECTS DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL BE

DESIGNATED TO RESOLVE ITS LIABILITY UNDER THE NOTICE OF VIOLATION.

IN 2005, THE KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION CONDUCTED AN INSPECTION AT

THE OFFICE OF OTIS KOREAN SUBSIDIARY IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE UNLAWFUL COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE KOREAN ELEVATOR INDUSTRY. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, WE BELIEVE THAT SOME EMPLOYEES AT THIS

SUBSIDIARY ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES AT A LOCAL LEVEL IN VIOLATION OF OTIS AND UTC POLICIES AND KOREAN COMPETITION LAW. WE ARE COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY FINES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED WILL BE MATERIAL TO UTC OR HAVE

A MATERIALLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON OTIS COMPETITIVE POSITION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, WE OR

OUR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE WE HAVE NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATE IT IN

ANY CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. WE HAVE MADE NO PAYMENT IN A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE CASES CLOSED TO DATE. THE

REMAINDER OF THE RESOLVED

- 12 -

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASES HAVE SETTLED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO US, AND HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN PART BY INSURANCE. AT PRESENT, WE

ARE NAMED IN APPROXIMATELY 2,830 LAWSUITS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 15,365 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS. IN OUR REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE REPORTED THAT APPROXIMATELY 18,000 CLAIMANTS WERE THEN JOINED IN LAWSUITS IN

MISSISSIPPI STATE COURTS. TYPICALLY, THESE MISSISSIPPI LAWSUITS NAMED FROM 200 TO 400 OTHER COMPANIES AS DEFENDANTS ALONG WITH US OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPLAINTS DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, OR SPECIFY

THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLAINTS DID NOT ALLEGE WHICH CLAIMANTS, IF ANY, WERE EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES, NOR THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH SUCH CLAIMANTS HAD BEEN HARMED. SINCE OUR 2004

REPORT, AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE LAW GOVERNING JOINDER AND PLEADING IN MISSISSIPPI, APPROXIMATELY 5,700 MISSISSIPPI CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION ASBESTOS DOCKET IN PENNSYLVANIA. MANY OTHER CLAIMANTS

HAVE BEEN DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND REQUIRED TO FILE CLAIMS, IF THEY CAN, THAT ALLEGE MORE SPECIFICALLY THE CLAIMANTS EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND THE RESULTING HARM. AT PRESENT, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS IN MISSISSIPPI IS APPROXIMATELY

4,955.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED ABOVE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE LEGAL MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND

UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE  COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ITEM 1 BUSINESS AND IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM

ON DECEMBER 13, 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO

60 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. SHARES MAY BE PURCHASED ON THE OPEN MARKET, IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR BOTH. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN UNDER WHICH A BROKER REPURCHASES SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK ON OUR BEHALF PURSUANT TO RULES 10B5-1 AND 10B-18 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. THESE REPURCHASES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF OUR OVERALL REPURCHASE PROGRAM DISCUSSED ABOVE. WE MAY ALSO REACQUIRE SHARES

IN JUNE 2006 AND MAY 2005, WE CONTRIBUTED 2,497,919 AND 3,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, VALUED AT $150 MILLION AND $157 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, TO OUR U.S. DEFINED PENSION PLANS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 4(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL REDUCE OUR FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO FUND THE PLANS.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY SYSTEM OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR AND THE

CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF THE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. ACCORDINGLY, EVEN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES CAN ONLY PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THEIR CONTROL OBJECTIVES. BASED UPON OUR EVALUATION, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS (COSO) OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. OUR MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS IN OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT.

THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 THAT HAS
