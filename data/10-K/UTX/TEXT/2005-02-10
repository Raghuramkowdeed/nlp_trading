

HELICOPTER PROGRAM AND REALLOCATE FUNDS TO RESTRUCTURE AND REVITALIZE U.S. ARMY AVIATION PROGRAMS TO MEET CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS. A PARTIAL TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE NOTICE WAS ISSUED EFFECTIVE MARCH 19, 2004. THE

SELECTED TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUED UNDER THE COMANCHE CONTRACT WILL BE COMPLETED BY FEBRUARY 2005. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, UTC ANNOUNCED THE PLANNED CLOSURE OF ITS COMANCHE FACILITY AND INITIATED OTHER COST REDUCTION ACTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE

PROGRAM TERMINATION. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE BOEING SIKORSKY JOINT VENTURE AND U.S. ARMY AGREED TO A CONTRACT MODIFICATION THAT REVISED PROGRAM FUNDING LEVELS AND ESTABLISHED CONTRACT PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES RELATED TO THE CONTRACT

TERMINATION. THE JOINT VENTURE EXPECTS TO SUBMIT ITS TERMINATION PROPOSAL DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005. UTC DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMANCHE PROGRAM TERMINATION AND THE RELATED COST REDUCTION ACTIONS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON UTCS

IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED AS SALES IN 2005.

UTCS AEROSPACE AND

DEFENSE PRODUCTS

UTCS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE

BUSINESSES (PRATT & WHITNEY, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY) ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, MARKETING

SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE

COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND

COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (GE) AND ROLLS ROYCE PLC. (FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER

FINANCING COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN UTCS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT.)

OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE RESULTS OF UTCS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE

BUSINESSES INCLUDE LENGTHY AND COSTLY DEVELOPMENT CYCLES AND HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON A SMALL NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS. SALES OF MILITARY PRODUCTS ARE AFFECTED BY DEFENSE BUDGETS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES, U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL

OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. THE U.S. AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS POLICIES OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AFFECT MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES. THE OPERATIONS OF PRATT & WHITNEY,

HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN UTCS 2004

ANNUAL REPORT AND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO UTCS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE.

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF THE BUSINESS OF PRATT & WHITNEY, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN

SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2005, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED.

OF DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND COST REDUCTION ARE REQUIRED FOR WIDE-SCALE MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

UTC FUEL CELLS, A PART OF UTC POWER, IS A WORLD LEADER IN FUEL CELL PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT FOR COMMERCIAL, TRANSPORTATION AND SPACE APPLICATIONS. UTC

FUEL CELLS IS THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF FUEL CELLS FOR U.S. SPACE MISSIONS AND ALSO OFFERS A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FUEL CELL POWER PLANT, KNOWN AS THE PURECELL

TM

200. FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS USING PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY (PEM) ARE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION AND STATIONARY APPLICATIONS. UTC FUEL CELLS IS WORKING WITH AUTOMAKERS AND

BUS MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, ON DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS FOR VEHICLES. SINCE 2002, UTC FUEL CELLS HAS BEEN PARTICIPATING IN LICENSING AND JOINT DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH NISSAN MOTOR COMPANY AND HYUNDAI MOTOR

COMPANY. IN OCTOBER 2003, NISSAN UNVEILED ITS ZERO-EMISSION FUEL CELL VEHICLE POWERED BY A UTC FUEL CELLS POWER PLANT. HYUNDAI AND UTC FUEL CELLS HAVE INTEGRATED A FUEL CELL POWER PLANT CAPABLE OF OPERATING IN FREEZING CONDITIONS INTO A HYUNDAI

SPORTS UTILITY VEHICLE PLATFORM. HYUNDAI PLANS TO LEASE A NUMBER OF SUCH VEHICLES TO FLEET OPERATORS IN 2005 AS PART OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGYS FREEDOM CAR PROGRAM. FUNDING FOR THE FREEDOM CAR PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION BY

THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE FULL OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM.

ALTHOUGH FUEL CELLS ARE BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS,

THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES REMAIN LOW ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND COST REDUCTION OF KEY FUEL CELL COMPONENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE WIDE-SCALE MARKET ACCEPTANCE. GOVERNMENT

SUPPORT FOR FUEL CELLS IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PEM FUEL CELLS WILL BE PRODUCED. IN NOVEMBER 2004, UTC FUEL CELLS ANNOUNCED A

RESTRUCTURING OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH TOSHIBA CORPORATION. UNDER THE TERMS OF UTCS AGREEMENT WITH TOSHIBA CORPORATION, UTC FUEL CELLS PURCHASED THE 10% EQUITY INTEREST TOSHIBA HELD IN UTC FUEL CELLS AND TOSHIBA PURCHASED UTC FUEL CELLS

49% INTEREST IN TOSHIBA INTERNATIONAL FUEL CELLS. JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF PEM TECHNOLOGY WILL CONTINUE UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES CROSS-LICENSING PROVISIONS.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO UTCS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON UTCS OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, UTC SPENDS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ITS OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. SUCH EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS

INCURRED, WERE $1,256 MILLION, OR 3.4 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2004, AS COMPARED WITH $1,027 MILLION OR 3.3 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2003 AND $1,191 MILLION OR 4.3 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2002. UTC ALSO PERFORMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK

UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. SUCH CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY SEGMENTS,

AMOUNTED TO $1,619 MILLION IN 2004, AS COMPARED WITH $1,580 MILLION IN 2003 AND $1,189 MILLION IN 2002.

CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT BY UTC FOR FAILURE TO

PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, UTC NORMALLY IS ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITS ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR

DEFAULT BY UTC, UTC COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. MOST OF UTCS U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE

UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS; APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION OF UTCS TOTAL SALES FOR 2004 WERE MADE UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

UTC IS NOW, AND BELIEVES THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT IT WILL BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS. SEE ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN UTCS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. IF UTC OR ONE OF ITS BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING

AS A RESULT OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), IT COULD BE SUSPENDED FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE

COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, UTC COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD COULD BE VOIDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE U.S. COULD

RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF UTCS EXPORT PRIVILEGES.

UTCS CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, UTC HAS RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES BE REDUCED BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN CONFORMANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE

AUDIT REPORTS HAVE INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS. UTC HAS MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES IT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE, HAS SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND CONTINUES TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES. SEE ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND

NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN UTCS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

UTC CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE, SOME OF WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT MINORITY INTERESTS. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR

GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON UTCS WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE PROTECTION REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF

CARRIER, OTIS AND CHUBB RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT UTCS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES.

UTCS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LOCAL

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INVESTMENTS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. SOME FOREIGN CUSTOMERS IN UTCS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES MAY REQUIRE COUNTER-PURCHASE OR OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS AS

A CONDITION TO A SALE, SUCH AS REQUIRING UTC TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES IN THE CUSTOMERS COUNTRY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROJECTS.

UTCS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS. UTC HAS INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO

THE ENVIRONMENT. UTC DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR THESE CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON ITS

CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES 1 AND 15 OF NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN UTCS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT.)

MOST OF THE LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF UTC WERE CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE

TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT AWARDED TO UTC UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WHILE UTCS PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES ARE

CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO ITS BUSINESS, UTC DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL BUSINESS OF UTC OR ON ANY OF ITS OPERATING

SEGMENTS.

UTC CONTINUOUSLY SEEKS TO REDUCE THE COST OF ITS

PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES. THESE COST REDUCTIONS MAY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING ITS PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING ONLINE

BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. GREATER DEPENDENCE ON GLOBAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY REQUIRES RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION AND IMPORT AND EXPORT PROCESSES. UTC IS RELIANT ON COMMODITY MARKETS AND ITS RESULTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY COMMODITY

PRICING. IN SOME INSTANCES, UTC DEPENDS UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATES IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM UTCS SUPPLIERS, THEREFORE, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON UTCS ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE U.S., UTC IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (AFRICA, AUSTRALIA AND RUSSIA), TANTALUM

(AUSTRALIA AND ASIA), CHROMIUM (AFRICA AND KAZAKHSTAN) AND RHENIUM (CHILE AND KAZAKHSTAN). UTC HAS A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS

THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. UTC BELIEVES THAT ITS SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE ASSOCIATED RISKS AND THE ADDITIONAL COST OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH HIGH PRICES FOR

SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO SOME OF UTCS BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY CARRIER (COPPER, STEEL, ALUMINUM), HAVE CAUSED PRICING PRESSURES, UTC DOES NOT FORESEE ANY UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES THAT WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OVERALL BUSINESS, OR ON ANY OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IN THE NEAR TERM.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER RISKS TO WHICH UTCS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS MAY BE SUBJECT, INCLUDING THE RISKS OF UTCS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, SEE THE FURTHER DISCUSSION UNDER

THE HEADINGS GENERAL AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT IN THIS SECTION AND MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN UTCS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF UTCS RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON PRODUCTION FACILITIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN UTCS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF UTCS PRODUCTS ARE

SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, ARE BEING APPROPRIATELY UTILIZED CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIENCE AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES. UTILIZATION OF THE

FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS. UTC CONTINUOUSLY REVIEWS ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST ITS FACILITIES NEEDS.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) AND UTC ARE LITIGATING WHETHER PRATT & WHITNEYS GOVERNMENT COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR

CERTAIN ENGINE PARTS ARE ACCEPTABLE. THE LITIGATION, FILED IN 1994 WITH THE ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS (ASBCA), NO. 47416 ET AL., RELATES TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR ENGINE PARTS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES UNDER COMMERCIAL ENGINE

COLLABORATION PROGRAMS SINCE 1984. ON JULY 31, 2001, THE ASBCA ISSUED A DECISION IN FAVOR OF UTC. THE DOD APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT ON NOVEMBER 29, 2001. ON JANUARY 15, 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED

THE ASBCA AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE ASBCA FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. UTC SOUGHT REVIEW BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS DENIED ON NOVEMBER 10, 2003. ON NOVEMBER 24, 2003, THE DOD SUPPLEMENTED ITS ORIGINAL CLAIM TO ADD DAMAGES AND INTEREST FOR

THE PERIOD AFTER 1996. THE DODS CLAIM NOW TOTALS APPROXIMATELY $367 MILLION IN DAMAGES THROUGH 2002 AND APPROXIMATELY $388 MILLION IN INTEREST THROUGH 2001. UTC HAS APPEALED THIS SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM TO THE ASBCA.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) FILED A COMPLAINT

UNDER THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND RELATED COMMON LAW THEORIES IN MARCH 1999 AGAINST UTC IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIGHTER ENGINE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE AND GES F110 ENGINE, FOR CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR

FORCE BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS 1985 AND 1990, INCLUSIVE. THE DOJ ALLEGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERPAID FOR ENGINES BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR SOME PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE

OVERSTATEMENTS. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DOJ AMENDED ITS COMPLAINT IN SEPTEMBER 2003 TO ALLEGE DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $141 MILLION, AND TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL ALLEGATION WITHOUT QUANTIFYING DAMAGES. TREBLE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER

FALSE CLAIM COULD BE ASSESSED IF THE COURT FINDS THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT, AND COMMON LAW DAMAGES WOULD ACCRUE PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST. ON MAY 28, 2004, A GOVERNMENT REPORT ESTIMATED PRATT & WHITNEYS

LIABILITY AT $624 MILLION. UTC BELIEVES THAT THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSTATED, DENIES ANY LIABILITY AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE DOJS CLAIMS. TRIAL OF THIS MATTER WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2004 AND A DECISION IS EXPECTED IN 2005.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A QUI TAM RELATOR FILED A COMPLAINT IN

JULY 1997 AGAINST UTC AND ITS SUBSIDIARY, NORDEN SYSTEMS, INC., IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN CONNECTICUT (

U.S. EX REL. DRAKE V. NORDEN SYSTEMS, INC. AND UTC

, NO. 394CV00963) ALLEGING THAT UTC AND NORDEN ARE LIABLE UNDER THE CIVIL FALSE

CLAIMS ACT FOR VIOLATING U.S. GOVERNMENT RULES ON ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED ASSETS. THE QUI TAM RELATOR CLAIMED UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND PENALTIES. THE DOJ DECLINED TO INTERVENE. IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED UTCS MOTION TO DISMISS

THE CASE FOR LACK OF PROSECUTION AND THE RELATOR APPEALED. IN JULY 2004, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST UTC, BUT REMANDED CERTAIN OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST NORDEN BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT

FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDES FOR TREBLE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM SUBMITTED TO THE GOVERNMENT. THE NUMBER OF FALSE CLAIMS, IF ANY, IMPLICATED BY THE REMAINING CLAIMS CANNOT CURRENTLY BE

ASCERTAINED; HOWEVER, IF DETERMINED ADVERSELY TO NORDEN, THE NUMBER COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES AND PENALTIES, WHICH UTC MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO PAY. UTC BELIEVES THE CLAIMS AGAINST NORDEN ARE WITHOUT MERIT, AND INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND

THIS MATTER VIGOROUSLY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSIONS COMPETITION DIRECTORATE CONDUCTED INSPECTIONS IN EARLY 2004 AT OFFICES OF UTCS OTIS SUBSIDIARY IN BERLIN, BRUSSELS, LUXEMBOURG AND PARIS. THE INSPECTIONS RELATE TO THE COMMISSIONS ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE

UNLAWFUL COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING THE ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR INDUSTRY IN EUROPE. UTC IS COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF ITS OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, UTC BELIEVES THAT SOME OTIS EMPLOYEES

IN LIMITED EUROPEAN LOCATIONS ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES AT A LOCAL LEVEL IN VIOLATION OF OTIS AND UTC POLICIES, AND MAY HAVE VIOLATED APPLICABLE COMPETITION LAW. IT IS STILL TOO EARLY IN THE COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION FOR UTC TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE

THE RANGE OF CIVIL FINES TO WHICH IT WOULD LIKELY BE SUBJECT. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH FINES, IF ULTIMATELY IMPOSED, COULD BE MATERIAL TO UTCS OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR

THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE FINES WOULD BE PAID. UTC DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH FINES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON UTCS FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OTIS

COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SINCE THE COMMISSIONS

INVESTIGATION BECAME PUBLIC AND UTC ANNOUNCED THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF ITS INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES NAMING UTC, OTIS AND OTHERS AS DEFENDANTS AND ALLEGING

A WORLDWIDE AGREEMENT AMONG ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR MANUFACTURERS TO FIX PRICES IN VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN ACT. THOSE LAWSUITS HAVE NOW BEEN TRANSFERRED TO AND CONSOLIDATED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE LAWSUITS DO NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT

OF DAMAGES CLAIMED. UTC BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE THE RESULT OF PRESS REPORTS ABOUT THE COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION. UTC BELIEVES THAT THE LAWSUITS ARE DEVOID OF MERIT AND WILL DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, UTC OR ITS

SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF UTCS PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE UTC HAS NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATES IT

IN ANY CURRENTLY-MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF ITS HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. UTC HAS MADE NO PAYMENT IN A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE CASES CLOSED TO DATE. THE

REMAINDER OF THE RESOLVED CASES HAVE SETTLED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO UTC, AND HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN PART BY INSURANCE. AT PRESENT, UTC IS NAMED IN APPROXIMATELY 1,700 LAWSUITS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 25,000 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS.

APPROXIMATELY 18,000 OF THESE CLAIMANTS ARE JOINED IN LAWSUITS IN MISSISSIPPI STATE COURTS. TYPICALLY, THESE MISSISSIPPI LAWSUITS NAME FROM 200 TO MORE THAN 400 OTHER COMPANIES AS DEFENDANTS ALONG WITH UTC OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPLAINTS DO NOT

IDENTIFY ANY PRODUCTS OF UTC OR ITS NAMED SUBSIDIARIES, OR SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLAINTS DO NOT ALLEGE WHICH CLAIMANTS, IF ANY, WERE EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS ATTRIBUTABLE TO UTCS PRODUCTS OR PREMISES, NOR THE

EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH SUCH CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN HARMED. DISCOVERY HAS BEGUN IN SOME OF THE CASES, BUT TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN ONLY MINIMAL PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ON DECEMBER 16, 2003, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) EXECUTED A SEARCH WARRANT AT

HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND. THE SEARCH WARRANT, ISSUED BY THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT, SOUGHT RECORDS AND DATA REGARDING THE COMPANYS PROCESSES FOR MONITORING, TREATING, TESTING AND DISCHARGING WASTEWATER AT HAMILTON

SUNDSTRANDS WINDSOR LOCKS, CONNECTICUT MANUFACTURING FACILITY. HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND HAS ALSO RECEIVED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME MATTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. SEVERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN

SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND JURY, AND HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND ALSO RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FOR RECORDS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS,

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND HAS REVIEWED THE OPERATIONS OF THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY, HAS MADE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PHYSICAL PLANT AND HAS IMPROVED OPERATING

PROCEDURES. HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND CONTINUES TO COOPERATE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS IN THE INVESTIGATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, CARRIER CORPORATION HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE EPA TO RESOLVE ITS CURRENT LIABILITY AT THE PUENTE VALLEY

OPERABLE UNIT SUPERFUND SITE IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT, CARRIER WOULD PAY APPROXIMATELY $125,000 AND UNDERTAKE AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY $500,000, IN SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CIVIL PENALTIES RELATED TO ALLEGED

NONCOMPLIANCE WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER. IN ADDITION, CARRIER WOULD PAY A PORTION OF THE EPAS UNREIMBURSED PAST COSTS FOR THE SITE AND UNDERTAKE A PORTION OF THE INTERIM REMEDY EPA SELECTED FOR THE SITE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE COSTS

ARE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR WITHIN THE TOTAL AMOUNT RESERVED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION NOTED UNDER THE HEADING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IN UTCS 2004 ANNUAL REPORT. UTC EXPECTS THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA TO BE FINALIZED IN

A CONSENT DECREE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS EXPECTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON

UTCS COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY PREVAIL WITH RESPECT TO ONE OR MORE OF THE SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT CONTRACT MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE OUTCOME COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON UTCS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN

THE PERIOD THE MATTER IS RESOLVED. HOWEVER, UTC DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON UTCS COMPETITIVE POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF UTCS ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS

THE

MANAGEMENT OF UTC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPALS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF UTCS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY

THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS (COSO) OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT, UTCS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. UTC MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF UTCS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN UTCS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING UTCS QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 THAT HAS MATERIALLY
