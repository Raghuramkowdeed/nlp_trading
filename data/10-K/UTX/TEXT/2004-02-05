PRATT & WHITNEY AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE PRODUCTS

THE CORPORATIONS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW

COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER

SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (GE) AND ROLLS ROYCE PLC. (FOR

INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES

24

TO

25 AND

36 OF THE CORPORATIONS 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE CORPORATIONS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES INCLUDE LENGTHY AND COSTLY DEVELOPMENT CYCLES AND HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON A SMALL NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS. SALES

OF MILITARY PRODUCTS ARE AFFECTED BY DEFENSE BUDGETS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES, U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES ARE AFFECTED BY POLICIES OF THE U.S. AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS

OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER. PRATT & WHITNEYS AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS OPERATIONS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATIONS 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS AND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE BUSINESS SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE

HEADING OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE.

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF PRATT & WHITNEYS AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS BUSINESS, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT BE

INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2004, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED.

TECHNOLOGY FOR AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS. IN OCTOBER 2003, NISSAN UNVEILED ITS SECOND GENERATION ZERO-EMISSION FUEL CELL VEHICLE POWERED BY A UTC FUEL CELLS POWER PLANT. IN JUNE 2003, UTC FUEL CELLS ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH HYUNDAI MOTOR CO.

(HYUNDAI), A PARTNER WITH UTC FUEL CELLS SINCE 2000, TO JOINTLY DEVELOP A NEW AUTOMOTIVE FUEL CELL POWER PLANT CAPABLE OF OPERATING IN FREEZING CONDITIONS. HYUNDAI AND UTC FUEL CELLS INTEND TO INTEGRATE THE POWER PLANTS INTO A NEW

HYUNDAI SPORTS UTILITY VEHICLE PLATFORM. HYUNDAI PLANS TO LEASE A NUMBER OF SUCH VEHICLES TO FLEET OPERATORS IN 2004.

ALTHOUGH FUEL CELLS ARE BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS,

THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES REMAIN LOW ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND COST REDUCTION OF KEY FUEL CELL COMPONENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE WIDE-SCALE MARKET ACCEPTANCE. GOVERNMENT

SUPPORT FOR FUEL CELLS IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PEM FUEL CELLS WILL BE PRODUCED. TOSHIBA CORPORATION OWNS A 10 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST

IN UTC FUEL CELLS.

THE RESULTS OF UTC POWER ARE INCLUDED IN

THE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER CATEGORY IN THE SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA IN NOTE 17 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES

37 THROUGH

39 OF THE CORPORATIONS 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, THE CORPORATION SPENDS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ITS OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. SUCH EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $1,027 MILLION, OR 3.3 PERCENT OF

TOTAL SALES IN 2003, AS COMPARED WITH $1,191 MILLION OR 4.3 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2002 AND $1,254 MILLION OR 4.6 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2001. THE CORPORATION ALSO PERFORMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. SUCH CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE FLIGHT SYSTEMS SEGMENT, AMOUNTED TO $1,580 MILLION IN 2003, AS COMPARED WITH

$1,189 MILLION IN 2002 AND $846 MILLION IN 2001.

CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK

FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT BY THE CORPORATION FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, THE

CORPORATION NORMALLY IS ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITS ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR DEFAULT BY THE CORPORATION, THE CORPORATION COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS

INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. MOST OF THE CORPORATIONS GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS; APPROXIMATELY $2.0

BILLION OF THE CORPORATIONS TOTAL SALES FOR 2003 WERE MADE UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

THE CORPORATION IS NOW, AND BELIEVES THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT IT WILL BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS. SEE ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ON PAGES 9 THROUGH 10 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 36 OF THE CORPORATIONS 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. IF

THE CORPORATION OR ONE OF ITS BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR OTHER GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), IT COULD BE SUSPENDED FROM BIDDING

ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE CORPORATION COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE

TAINTED BY FRAUD COULD BE VOIDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHTS TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY

DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE U.S. COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THE

CORPORATIONS EXPORT PRIVILEGES.

THE CORPORATIONS

CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THE CORPORATION HAS RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES BE REDUCED BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA

SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN CONFORMANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS INVOLVE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS. THE CORPORATION HAS MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE

CASES IT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE, HAS SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND CONTINUES TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES. SEE ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ON PAGES 9 THROUGH 10 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 36 OF

THE CORPORATIONS 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

- 6 -

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE, SOME OF WHICH HAVE

SIGNIFICANT MINORITY INTERESTS. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE PROTECTION

REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF CARRIER, OTIS AND CHUBB RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT THE CORPORATIONS

AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES.

THE CORPORATIONS

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INVESTMENTS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. SOME FOREIGN CUSTOMERS IN THE CORPORATIONS AEROSPACE AND

DEFENSE BUSINESSES MAY REQUIRE COUNTER-PURCHASE OR OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS AS A CONDITION TO A SALE, SUCH AS REQUIRING THE CORPORATION TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES IN THE CUSTOMERS COUNTRY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROJECTS.

THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED

BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THE CORPORATION HAS INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER

VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS

IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR THESE CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON ITS CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON PAGE

13 AND NOTES 1 AND 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES

22 AND

36 OF THE CORPORATIONS 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS.)

MOST OF THE LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF THE CORPORATION WERE CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACT AWARDED TO THE CORPORATION UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WHILE THE CORPORATIONS PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES ARE CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO ITS BUSINESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL BUSINESS OF THE CORPORATION OR ON ANY OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE CORPORATION CONTINUOUSLY SEEKS TO REDUCE THE COST OF ITS PURCHASES OF

MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES. THESE COST REDUCTIONS MAY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING ITS PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING ONLINE BIDDING

COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. GREATER DEPENDENCE ON GLOBAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY REQUIRES RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION AND IMPORT AND EXPORT PROCESSES. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION IS RELIANT UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATES IN

COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS BY THE SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, THEREFORE, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CORPORATIONS ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN

THE U.S., THE CORPORATION IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (AFRICA, AUSTRALIA AND RUSSIA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND ASIA), CHROMIUM (AFRICA AND KAZAKHSTAN) AND RHENIUM (CHILE AND

KAZAKHSTAN). THE CORPORATION HAS A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE

CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT ITS SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE ASSOCIATED RISKS AND THE ADDITIONAL COST OF OTHER PRACTICES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT FORESEE ANY UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR

SUPPLIES THAT WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OVERALL BUSINESS, OR ON ANY OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IN THE NEAR TERM.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF THE CORPORATIONS RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON PRODUCTION FACILITIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON PAGES

7 THROUGH 8 AND NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES

32 THROUGH 34 OF THE CORPORATIONS 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS

CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTS ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, ARE BEING APPROPRIATELY UTILIZED

CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIENCE AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES. UTILIZATION OF THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION CONTINUOUSLY REVIEWS ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR

FACILITIES AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST ITS FACILITIES NEEDS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) AND THE CORPORATION ARE LITIGATING WHETHER PRATT & WHITNEYS GOVERNMENT COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN ENGINE PARTS ARE ACCEPTABLE. THE LITIGATION, FILED IN 1994 WITH

THE ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS (ASBCA), NO. 47416 ET AL., RELATES TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR ENGINE PARTS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES UNDER COMMERCIAL ENGINE COLLABORATION PROGRAMS SINCE 1984. THE DOD INITIALLY CLAIMED

APPROXIMATELY $158 MILLION IN DAMAGES AND APPROXIMATELY $103 MILLION IN INTEREST THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 1996. ON JULY 31, 2001, THE ASBCA ISSUED A DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CORPORATION. THE DOD APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FEDERAL CIRCUIT ON NOVEMBER 29, 2001. ON JANUARY 15, 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE ASBCA AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE ASBCA FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE CORPORATION SOUGHT REVIEW BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS DENIED ON NOVEMBER 10,

2003. ON NOVEMBER 24, 2003, THE DOD SUPPLEMENTED ITS ORIGINAL CLAIM TO ADD DAMAGES AND INTEREST FOR THE PERIOD AFTER 1996. THE DODS CLAIM NOW TOTALS APPROXIMATELY $367 MILLION IN DAMAGES THROUGH 2002 AND APPROXIMATELY $388 MILLION IN INTEREST

THROUGH 2001. THE CORPORATION PLANS TO APPEAL THIS SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM TO THE ASBCA.

- 9 -

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE CORPORATION HAD PENDING AGAINST IT A QUI TAM COMPLAINT UNDER THE CIVIL FALSE

CLAIMS ACT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT: U.S. EX REL. DRAKE V. NORDEN SYSTEMS, INC. AND UTC, NO. 394CV00963 (FILED JULY 1997, AND INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED ASSETS). THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT

INTERVENED. THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDES FOR TREBLE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM SUBMITTED. THE QUI TAM RELATOR CLAIMED UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES (SUBJECT TO TREBLING) AND PENALTIES. IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED THE

CORPORATIONS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE. THE RELATOR SOUGHT RECONSIDERATION, WHICH WAS DENIED IN JUNE 2003. THE RELATOR HAS APPEALED TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT. A DECISION IS EXPECTED IN 2004.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN MARCH 1999, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILED A

CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO, NO. C-3-99-093. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE

AND GES F110 ENGINE, FOR CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS 1985 AND 1990, INCLUSIVE. THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT WOULD HAVE

REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. IN MID-2002, THE COURT DENIED MOTIONS FILED BY THE CORPORATION THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN DISMISSAL OF ALL OR PART OF THE GOVERNMENTS CLAIMS. ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2003, THE COURT ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO AMEND ITS

COMPLAINT. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $141 MILLION, AND ADDS ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS WITHOUT QUANTIFYING ADDITIONAL DAMAGES. THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDES FOR TREBLE DAMAGES

AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM SUBMITTED. THE COMPLAINT INCLUDES COMMON LAW CLAIMS ON WHICH INTEREST WOULD ACCRUE. TRIAL OF THIS MATTER IS SCHEDULED FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004.

LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, THE CORPORATION OR ITS

SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE THE CORPORATION HAS NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO

LONGER INCORPORATES IT IN ANY CURRENTLY-MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF ITS HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. THE CORPORATION HAS MADE NO PAYMENT IN A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF THE CASES CLOSED TO DATE. THE REMAINDER OF THE RESOLVED CASES HAVE SETTLED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CORPORATION, AND HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN PART BY INSURANCE. AT PRESENT, THE CORPORATION IS NAMED IN APPROXIMATELY 1,500

LAWSUITS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 24,000 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS. MORE THAN 21,000 OF THESE CLAIMANTS ARE JOINED IN LAWSUITS IN MISSISSIPPI STATE COURTS. TYPICALLY, THESE MISSISSIPPI LAWSUITS NAME FROM 200 TO MORE THAN 400 OTHER COMPANIES AS DEFENDANTS

ALONG WITH THE CORPORATION OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPLAINTS DO NOT IDENTIFY ANY PRODUCTS OF THE CORPORATION OR ITS NAMED SUBSIDIARIES, OR SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLAINTS DO NOT ALLEGE WHICH CLAIMANTS, IF ANY,

WERE EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTS OR PREMISES, NOR THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH SUCH CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN HARMED. DISCOVERY HAS BEGUN IN SOME OF THE LARGER CASES, BUT TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN ONLY MINIMAL PRODUCT

IDENTIFICATION.

ON DECEMBER 16, 2003, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) EXECUTED A SEARCH WARRANT AT HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND. THE SEARCH WARRANT, ISSUED BY THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT, SOUGHT RECORDS AND DATA REGARDING THE COMPANYS PROCESSES FOR

MONITORING, TREATING, TESTING AND DISCHARGING WASTEWATER AT THE COMPANYS WINDSOR LOCKS, CONNECTICUT MANUFACTURING FACILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS RECEIVED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME MATTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. SEVERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND JURY, AND THE COMPANY ALSO RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FOR RECORDS. THE COMPANY IS CONDUCTING ITS OWN INVESTIGATION AND IS COOPERATING WITH FEDERAL AND STATE

OFFICIALS IN THE INVESTIGATION.

SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT

ULTIMATELY PREVAIL WITH RESPECT TO ONE OR MORE OF THE SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT CONTRACT MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE OUTCOME COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THE MATTER IS RESOLVED.

HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF THE CORPORATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS

RELATING TO THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS AS A WHOLE  CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS IN ITEM 1  BUSINESS ON PAGES
