SIKORSKY AND BY ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES. SIKORSKY IS INCREASINGLY ENGAGING IN LOGISTICS SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND PARTNERING WITH ITS GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS TO MANAGE AND PROVIDE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR SERVICES.

SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WERE 63% IN 2009, AS COMPARED WITH 57% IN 2008. REVENUES GENERATED BY SIKORSKYS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

U.S. EXPORT SALES, WERE 33 PERCENT AND 36 PERCENT OF TOTAL SIKORSKY REVENUES IN 2009 AND IN 2008, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, SIKORSKYS BUSINESS BACKLOG WAS $10,329 MILLION, INCLUDING $4,957 MILLION UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT-FUNDED

CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS, AS COMPARED TO $13,167 MILLION AND $6,725 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. OF THE TOTAL SIKORSKY BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY $5,142 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED AS SALES IN

2010.

UTC POWER IS A

WORLD LEADER IN THE APPLICATION OF FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY TO STATIONARY AND TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS. IN THE APPLICATION OF STATIONARY FUEL CELL POWER, UTC HAS DELIVERED MORE THAN 260 200KW PHOSPHORIC ACID FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS SINCE 1992. UTC

POWER CEASED PRODUCTION OF THE 200KW UNIT IN 2009 AND BEGAN DELIVERIES OF ITS 400KW PHOSPHORIC ACID FUEL CELL. THIS NEW FUEL CELL IS EXPECTED TO HAVE GREATER DURABILITY THAN ANY OTHER LARGE STATIONARY FUEL CELL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. UTC

POWERS AUTOMOTIVE AND BUS TRANSPORTATION FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS ARE BASED ON PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE (PEM) TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING ITS PUREMOTION 120 POWER PLANT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY USED IN REVENUE SERVICE IN TRANSIT BUS APPLICATIONS IN

CONNECTICUT, CALIFORNIA AND EUROPE. UTC POWER IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING PEM FUEL CELLS FOR SUBMARINE APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, UTC POWER IS THE MAKER OF ALKALINE-BASED FUEL CELLS USED TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AND DRINKING WATER TO THE U.S. SPACE

SHUTTLE.

ALTHOUGH FUEL CELLS ARE BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES IN TERMS OF TOTAL SYSTEM

EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL IN EITHER EARLY COMMERCIALIZATION OR DEVELOPMENT. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND COST REDUCTION ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE WIDE-SCALE MARKET ACCEPTANCE. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IS

NEEDED TO FULLY COMMERCIALIZE FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FUEL CELLS WILL BE PRODUCED.

IN 2009, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSITION OF UTC POWERS MICRO-TURBINE-BASED COMBINED COOLING, HEATING AND POWER SYSTEMS BUSINESS TO CARRIERS BUSINESSES, ITS GEOTHERMAL POWER SYSTEMS BUSINESS TO

PRATT & WHITNEYS POWER SYSTEMS BUSINESS, AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OF ITS SPACE AND DEFENSE FUEL CELL POWER PLANT BUSINESS TO HAMILTON SUNDSTRANDS ENERGY, SPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESS. THE RESULTS OF UTC POWER ARE INCLUDED IN THE

ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER CATEGORY IN THE SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT.

IN DECEMBER 2009, WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE A 49.5% EQUITY STAKE IN CLIPPER WINDPOWER PLC (CLIPPER), A CALIFORNIA-BASED WIND TURBINE MANUFACTURER THAT TRADES ON THE AIM LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE. WE COMPLETED THE

ACQUISITION ON JANUARY 12, 2010. PURSUANT TO OUR AGREEMENT WITH CLIPPER, WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL SHARES OF CLIPPER WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE CLOSING DATE THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN EQUITY STAKE IN EXCESS OF 49.9% WITHOUT THE

PRIOR APPROVAL OF CLIPPER. THE INVESTMENT IS INTENDED TO EXPAND OUR POWER GENERATION PORTFOLIO AND ALLOW US TO ENTER THE WIND POWER SEGMENT BY LEVERAGING OUR EXPERTISE IN BLADE TECHNOLOGY, TURBINES AND GEARBOX DESIGN.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES

AS WORLDWIDE BUSINESSES, OUR OPERATIONS CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION, IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT, IN ITEM 1, CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS, AND IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K. EACH BUSINESS UNIT IS SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND EACH COMPETES ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, DELIVERY SCHEDULE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE.

OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES

PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR NATIONAL COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY

EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND

MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS POLICIES OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM

SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AFFECT MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES. SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG

INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GE AVIATION, ROLLS-ROYCE, HONEYWELL AND TURBOMECA. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS,

PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN

TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $1,558 MILLION OR 3.0

PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2009, AS COMPARED WITH $1,771 MILLION OR 3.0 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2008 AND $1,678 MILLION OR 3.1 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2007. WE ALSO PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY SEGMENTS, AMOUNTED TO $2,124 MILLION IN

2009, AS COMPARED TO $2,101 MILLION IN 2008 AND $2,123 MILLION IN 2007. THESE CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, THROUGH COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND AMOUNTS THAT ARE CAPITALIZED INTO INVENTORY TO BE

SUBSEQUENTLY RECOVERED THROUGH PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT SHIPMENTS. OF THE TOTALS, $2,095 MILLION, $2,008 MILLION AND $1,872 MILLION WERE EXPENSED IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING COSTS HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WE WOULD NORMALLY

BE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING

UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. MOST OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY $2,874 MILLION OR 5.5 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR 2009 WERE MADE

UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE

CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT WE REDUCE CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE

CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS HAVE INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS. WE HAVE MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, HAVE SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND CONTINUE TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2009 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE HAVE INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE

THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES 1 AND 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOST OF THE U.S. LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF WE WERE

CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE ARE AWARDED UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN AFFECT OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE SAFETY

REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF CARRIER, OTIS AND UTC FIRE & SECURITY RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES

CAN IMPACT OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RAW MATERIALS

WE MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE THIS PORTFOLIO IS CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO

OUR BUSINESS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SOURCES FOR OUR PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING. WE WORK CONTINUOUSLY

WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND TO REDUCE COSTS. WE PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING OUR PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING

ONLINE BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE

UNITED STATES, WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (FINLAND, NORWAY, RUSSIA AND CANADA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND CANADA), CHROMIUM (SOUTH AFRICA, KAZAKHSTAN, ZIMBABWE AND RUSSIA) AND

RHENIUM (CHILE, KAZAKHSTAN AND GERMANY). WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH RECENT HIGH PRICES FOR SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES

(STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM, TITANIUM AND NICKEL) HAVE CAUSED MARGIN AND COST PRESSURES, WE DO NOT FORESEE ANY NEAR TERM UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES THAT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 206,700, APPROXIMATELY 65 PERCENT OF WHICH REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2009, WE RENEGOTIATED TWELVE DOMESTIC MULTI-YEAR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS,

THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVERED CERTAIN WORKERS AT SIKORSKY, OTIS AND CARRIER. IN 2010, NUMEROUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVER CERTAIN WORKERS AT PRATT & WHITNEY, CARRIER AND HAMILTON

SUNDSTRAND. ALTHOUGH SOME PREVIOUS CONTRACT RENEGOTIATIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY AT SIKORSKY, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE SUCH PROBLEMS IN THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE ABOVE CONTRACTS

THAT WOULD EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND UNDER MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, SEE THE FURTHER DISCUSSION UNDER THE HEADINGS GENERAL AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT IN THIS SECTION, ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K, AND UNDER

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED

FUTURE RESULTS. FOR A DISCUSSION IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE BUSINESS SECTION UNDER THE HEADINGS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO

A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC RISKS

AS WIDELY REPORTED, THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL THAT BEGAN IN 2008 CONTINUED THROUGHOUT 2009,

INCLUDING WIDESPREAD RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS, RECORD LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, SIGNIFICANT DISTRESS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, EXTREME VOLATILITY IN SECURITY PRICES, SEVERELY DIMINISHED LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY, RATING DOWNGRADES OF CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS AND DECLINING VALUATIONS OF OTHERS. GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN UNPRECEDENTED ACTIONS INTENDED TO ADDRESS EXTREME FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT INCLUDE SEVERELY RESTRICTED CREDIT AND DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES. IN RECENT MONTHS,

CERTAIN INDICES AND ECONOMIC DATA HAVE BEGUN TO SHOW FIRST SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT AND STABILIZATION IN THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE BROAD-BASED AND SUSTAINABLE, OR THAT THEY WILL

AFFECT MARKETS RELEVANT TO US. FURTHER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE FURTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT MAY BE MATERIAL TO OUR REVENUES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL. THESE ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES AND OPERATIONS AND COULD RESULT

IN A DECREASE IN OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS. SIMILARLY, THIS TIGHTENING OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SUPPLIER BASE AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR ONE

OR MORE OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR BANKRUPTCY. OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECREASES IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUCH AS DECREASES IN BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SPENDING, AIR TRAVEL, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS JET OPERATORS, AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT.

STRENGTHENING OF THE RATE OF EXCHANGE FOR THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST CERTAIN MAJOR CURRENCIES SUCH AS THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR RESULTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE LIKELY DURATION AND SEVERITY

OF DISRUPTION IN FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE

CONDITIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED

APPROXIMATELY 58% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2009, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, REGULATORY CHANGES, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS, THE TIGHTENING OF THE U.S. CREDIT MARKETS AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, CARRIERS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY

PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND, IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL

AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 42% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2009, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE. THE CHALLENGING

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CURRENTLY FACED BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. AS A RESULT, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, OF ONE OR MORE OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CANCELLATIONS OF ORDERS,

REDUCTIONS IN OUR AEROSPACE REVENUES AND LOSSES UNDER EXISTING CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEMAND FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINE AND COMPONENT AFTERMARKET PARTS AND SERVICE BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, AIRCRAFT OPERATORS AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS

ARE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS, AIRLINE CONSOLIDATION, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT,

REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CORPORATE PROFITABILITY, AND BACKLOG LEVELS, ALL OF WHICH COULD REDUCE BOTH THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL AND THE AFTERMARKET SALES AND MARGINS OF OUR AEROSPACE

BUSINESSES. FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIONS OR PANDEMIC HEALTH ISSUES COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE BOTH THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL AND OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES AFTERMARKET SALES AND MARGINS. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL

AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2010, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. AT TIMES, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ALSO ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT

CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO BEAR COST OVERRUNS RELATED TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL AND DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT ARISE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND

FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN

MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS, INCLUDING USAGE, PRICING, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATORY CHANGES AND THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE

LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE COMMERCIAL

AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE

LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL

CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. IF WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT

LAWS), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUBJECT US TO FINES, PENALTIES,

REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR

OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR

CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR EXPORT PRIVILEGES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO U.S. MILITARY BUDGETS, WHICH MAY FLUCTUATE TO REFLECT THE POLICIES OF A NEW ADMINISTRATION OR CONGRESS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY

59% OF OUR TOTAL 2009 SEGMENT REVENUES DERIVED FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM U.S. EXPORT SALES. CHANGES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES, MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND AND

REPORTED PROFITS IN OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES) WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR

PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING MARGINS MAY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WORLDWIDE

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS FOR CERTAIN CROSS BORDER TRANSACTIONS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY

ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR

FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MAJORITY OF SALES IN THE AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE TRANSACTED

IN U.S. DOLLARS, CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHILE THE MAJORITY OF COSTS AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE INCURRED IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY (PRINCIPALLY THE EURO AND THE CANADIAN DOLLAR). FOR OPERATING UNITS WITH

U.S. DOLLAR SALES AND LOCAL CURRENCY COSTS, THERE IS A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. TO MANAGE

CERTAIN EXPOSURES, WE EMPLOY LONG-TERM HEDGING STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR REVENUES. SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING

THOSE RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES,

INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION

OF SALE OR AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE

FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS.

IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA, SOUTH AFRICA AND COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK. WE EXPECT THAT SALES TO EMERGING MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT

FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL SALES AS OUR BUSINESS EVOLVES AND AS THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS AND REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCREASE THEIR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. EMERGING MARKET OPERATIONS CAN PRESENT MANY RISKS, INCLUDING CIVIL

DISTURBANCES, HEALTH CONCERNS, CULTURAL DIFFERENCES, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS PRACTICES, VOLATILITY IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, ECONOMIC AND GOVERNMENT INSTABILITY, AND THE IMPOSITION OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS. WHILE THESE FACTORS AND THEIR IMPACT

ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

WE USE A VARIETY

OF RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER-PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD

INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS, THIRD

PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE

SOURCE OF SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS OR THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIER

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS

OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY

CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH, OR DISPOSING OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES FROM, OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE

THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

WE SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. IN THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY

ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, APPLYING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, OR IN MANAGING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A

TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE RECENT EFFECTIVENESS OF REVISIONS TO ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE COMPANIES TO EXPENSE

CERTAIN ACQUISITION COSTS AS INCURRED, MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR GREATER EARNINGS VOLATILITY AND GENERALLY LOWER EARNINGS DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE ACQUIRE NEW BUSINESSES. FURTHERMORE, WE MAKE STRATEGIC DIVESTITURES FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE

DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION. LOWER PERFORMANCE BY THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADVANCEMENTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES; EXECUTION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF INTERNAL AND SUPPLIER-PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS;

ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FACTORS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS

MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THESE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES

OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY PRATT & WHITNEY, SIKORSKY AND HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND, WILL PRODUCE AIRCRAFT ENGINES, HELICOPTERS, AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED

CERTIFICATIONS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION, TAX,

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF

LITIGATION TAX AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LITIGATION CONCERNING PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE

WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN EXPORT LAWS, COMPETITION LAWS AND LAWS GOVERNING IMPROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF SUCH LITIGATION. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO

FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS, OTHER DAMAGES (IN CERTAIN CASES, TREBLE DAMAGES), OR SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE OF US OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE EXPORT AND TRADE PRACTICE LAWS

COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF EXPORT PRIVILEGES. AS A GLOBAL BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY

BE INTERPRETED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THEY MAY ALSO CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AS MAY RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER GUIDANCE. CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EXPENSES AND PAYMENTS, AND UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO LAWS AND

REGULATIONS MAY ALSO AFFECT HOW WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AND STRUCTURE OUR INVESTMENTS AND COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD LEAD TO NEW OR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN PRODUCT DESIGNS

AND COULD INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE EXPENDITURES. IN THE AREA OF TAX, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER TAX GUIDANCE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR TAX RECEIVABLES AND LIABILITIES AND

OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATIONS BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING TAX AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION TO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL

INVESTIGATIONS LAUNCHED IN THE FUTURE BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AND EXISTING INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE EXPANDED. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE

THESE RISKS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY.

FOR NON-INCOME TAX RISKS, WE ESTIMATE MATERIAL LOSS

CONTINGENCIES AND ESTABLISH RESERVES AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CONTINGENCIES WHERE LIABILITY IS DEEMED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO US AT

A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY AFFECT OUR ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATES OF THE LOSS CONTINGENCY RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OR AS A RESERVE AGAINST ASSETS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COULD RESULT IN AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE PART I, ITEM 3 LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K. FOR INCOME TAX RISKS, WE RECOGNIZE TAX BENEFITS BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT THAT A TAX BENEFIT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY THAT

HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS. FOR THOSE INCOME TAX POSITIONS WHERE WE ASSESS THAT THERE IS NOT A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH TAX BENEFITS WILL BE SUSTAINED, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A TAX BENEFIT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS MAY CAUSE US TO CHANGE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUSTAINING A PREVIOUSLY-RECOGNIZED BENEFIT WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH EVENT OCCURS OR ON OUR CASH

FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY OCCURS.

OUR FIXED ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 INCLUDE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND NON-MANUFACTURING FACILITIES SUCH AS WAREHOUSES SET FORTH IN THE TABLES ABOVE AND A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT, MOST OF WHICH ARE GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT USING SPECIAL JIGS, TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC CONTROL FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS. THE FACILITIES, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN USE

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE WELL-MAINTAINED AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN REGULAR USE.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED,

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) SUED US IN 1999 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO, CLAIMING THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND COMMON LAW. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE

COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE AND GENERAL ELECTRICS F110 ENGINE. THE DOJ ALLEGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERPAID FOR F100 ENGINES UNDER CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE IN FISCAL YEARS 1985 THROUGH

1990 BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR SOME PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. AT TRIAL OF THIS MATTER, COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2004, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED PRATT &

WHITNEYS LIABILITY TO BE $624 MILLION. ON AUGUST 1, 2008, THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE HELD THAT THE AIR FORCE HAD NOT SUFFERED ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT PRICE CONCESSIONS. HOWEVER, THE TRIAL COURT

JUDGE FOUND THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT DUE TO INACCURATE STATEMENTS

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTAINED IN THE 1983 OFFER. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL DAMAGES, THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE AWARDED THE DOJ THE MAXIMUM CIVIL PENALTY OF $7.09 MILLION, OR $10,000 FOR EACH OF THE 709 INVOICES

PRATT & WHITNEY SUBMITTED IN 1989 AND LATER UNDER THE CONTRACTS. BOTH THE DOJ AND UTC HAVE APPEALED THE DECISION. SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY PREVAIL, THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID.

IN

DECEMBER 2008, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) ISSUED A CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST SIKORSKY TO RECOVER OVERPAYMENTS THE DOD ALLEGES IT HAS INCURRED SINCE JANUARY 2003 IN CONNECTION WITH COST ACCOUNTING CHANGES APPROVED BY THE DOD AND IMPLEMENTED BY

SIKORSKY IN 1999 AND 2006. THESE CHANGES RELATE TO THE CALCULATION OF MATERIAL OVERHEAD RATES IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. THE DOD CLAIMS THAT SIKORSKYS LIABILITY IS APPROXIMATELY $83 MILLION (INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH DECEMBER 2009). WE BELIEVE

THIS CLAIM IS WITHOUT MERIT AND SIKORSKY FILED AN APPEAL IN DECEMBER 2009 WITH THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS.

AS PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED, ON FEBRUARY 21, 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS COMPETITION DIRECTORATE (EU COMMISSION) RULED THAT OTIS SUBSIDIARIES IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG AND THE NETHERLANDS, AND A PORTION OF THE BUSINESS OF OTIS GERMAN

SUBSIDIARY, VIOLATED EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COMPETITION RULES AND ASSESSED A



225 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION) CIVIL FINE

AGAINST OTIS, ITS RELEVANT LOCAL ENTITIES, AND UTC, WHICH WAS PAID DURING 2007. IN MAY 2007, WE FILED AN APPEAL OF THE DECISION BEFORE THE EUS EUROPEAN COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE. A DECISION ON THE APPEAL IS EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE

MONTHS. DEPENDING UPON THE OUTCOME, A FURTHER APPEAL BY EITHER PARTY TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS POSSIBLE.

ON

SEPTEMBER 21, 2009, PRATT & WHITNEY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CLOSE ITS CONNECTICUT AIRFOIL REPAIR OPERATIONS FACILITY IN EAST HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 AND ITS ENGINE OVERHAUL FACILITY IN CHESHIRE, CONNECTICUT BY

EARLY 2011. ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2009, THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS (IAM) FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT ALLEGING THAT PRATT & WHITNEYS DECISION

TO CLOSE THESE FACILITIES AND TRANSFER CERTAIN WORK TO FACILITIES OUTSIDE CONNECTICUT BREACHED THE TERMS OF ITS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE IAM, WHICH EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 5, 2010, AND SEEKING TO ENJOIN PRATT & WHITNEY FROM

MOVING THE WORK FOR THE DURATION OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. PRATT & WHITNEY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS FULLY COMPLIED WITH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND THAT THE IAMS CONTENTIONS ARE WITHOUT MERIT. ON FEBRUARY 5,

2010, FOLLOWING A TRIAL ON THE MERITS, THE COURT ISSUED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT PRATT & WHITNEY HAD BREACHED ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND PERMANENTLY ENJOINED PRATT & WHITNEY FROM CLOSING THE FACILITIES

AND TRANSFERRING THE WORK DESCRIBED IN THE CHALLENGED PLANS FOR THE DURATION OF THE CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. PRATT & WHITNEY IS REVIEWING THE DECISION AND CONSIDERING WHETHER TO APPEAL. PRATT & WHITNEY HAS RECORDED $53

MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANNED CLOSURES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

LIKE MANY OTHER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, WE OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL

INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE WE HAVE NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATE IT IN ANY CURRENTLY-MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE

THOSE OF MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS HAVE BEEN COVERED BY INSURANCE OR OTHER FORMS OF INDEMNITY OR HAVE BEEN DISMISSED WITHOUT PAYMENT. THE

REMAINDER OF THE CLOSED CASES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF THESE ASBESTOS-RELATED MATTERS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE

NOTED ABOVE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE LEGAL MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE  COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO) AND THE VICE PRESIDENT, CONTROLLER (CONTROLLER), OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY SYSTEM OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THEIR CONTROL OBJECTIVES. BASED UPON OUR EVALUATION, OUR CEO, CFO AND CONTROLLER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN THE REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE

APPLICABLE RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT IT IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CEO, CFO AND CONTROLLER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED

IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

. OUR MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT.

THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING.
