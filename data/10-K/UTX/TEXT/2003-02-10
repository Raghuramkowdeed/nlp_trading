$2,664 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED AS SALES IN 2003.

PRATT & WHITNEY AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS AEROSPACE AND

DEFENSE PRODUCTS

THE CORPORATION'S AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE

BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN

MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE,

MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT

OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT &

WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS.

ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES,

PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND

MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. PRATT & WHITNEY'S MAJOR

COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND ROLLS ROYCE PLC. (FOR

INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF

CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4

AND 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 22 THROUGH 23 AND 30 THROUGH

31 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

OTHER FACTORS

THAT CAN AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE CORPORATION'S AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES INCLUDE

LENGTHY AND COSTLY DEVELOPMENT CYCLES AND HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON A SMALL NUMBER OF PRODUCTS

AND PROGRAMS. SALES OF MILITARY PRODUCTS ARE AFFECTED BY DEFENSE BUDGETS IN THE U.S. AND

OTHER COUNTRIES, U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT

OPERATIONS. MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES ARE AFFECTED BY POLICIES OF THE U.S. AND OTHER

GOVERNMENTS OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURER. PRATT & WHITNEY'S AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS' OPERATIONS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY

A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE

CORPORATION'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS AND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE

"BUSINESS" SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "OTHER MATTERS

RELATING TO THE CORPORATION'S BUSINESS AS A WHOLE".

SIGNIFICANT

ELEMENTS OF PRATT & WHITNEY'S AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS' BUSINESS, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES

FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION

MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG

FOR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2003, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED.

OTHER

UTC POWER DEVELOPS AND MARKETS DISTRIBUTED

POWER GENERATION EQUIPMENT PRODUCING UP TO ONE MEGAWATT, INCLUDING FUEL CELLS AND

MICROTURBINES, FOR USE IN COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION AND LIGHT INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES,

INSTITUTIONS AND OFFICE BUILDINGS. UTC FUEL CELLS, LLC ("UTC FUEL CELLS"), A

PART OF UTC POWER, IS A WORLD LEADER IN FUEL CELL PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT FOR

COMMERCIAL, TRANSPORTATION, RESIDENTIAL AND SPACE APPLICATIONS. UTC FUEL CELLS IS THE SOLE

SUPPLIER OF FUEL CELLS FOR U.S. SPACE MISSIONS AND ALSO OFFERS A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

FUEL CELL POWER PLANT, KNOWN AS THE PC25. OVER 250 PC25 UNITS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED

AROUND THE WORLD. FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS USING PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY

("PEM") ARE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION, COMMERCIAL STATIONARY,

AND RESIDENTIAL APPLICATIONS. UTC FUEL CELLS IS WORKING WITH AUTOMAKERS AND BUS

MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, ON DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION

PROGRAMS FOR VEHICLES. IN DECEMBER 2002, UTC FUEL CELLS SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO LICENSE ITS

PEM TECHNOLOGY ON A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS TO NISSAN MOTOR COMPANY LTD. ("NISSAN")

AND TO ENGAGE IN JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS. IN THAT

SAME MONTH NISSAN UNVEILED ITS ZERO-EMISSION X-TRAIL VEHICLE POWERED BY A UTC FUEL CELLS

POWER PLANT. IN 2001, UTC FUEL CELLS AND SHELL HYDROGEN US FORMED A JOINT VENTURE TO

DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND SELL FUEL PROCESSORS AND HYDROGEN GENERATION SYSTEMS.

ALTHOUGH FUEL

CELLS ARE BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER GENERATORS IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY

AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS, CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES REMAIN LOW ACROSS THE

INDUSTRY. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND WIDER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE REQUIRED TO

REDUCE THE PRODUCTION COST OF FUEL CELL COMPONENTS AND POWER PLANTS. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

FOR FUEL CELLS COULD ALSO IMPACT THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS STILL

SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PEM FUEL CELLS WILL BE

PRODUCED. UTC FUEL CELLS CONTINUES TO SEEK STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO DEVELOP SOURCES OF

SUPPLY, AS WELL AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. TOSHIBA CORPORATION OWNS A 10

PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN UTC FUEL CELLS.

THE RESULTS OF

UTC POWER ARE INCLUDED IN THE "ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER" CATEGORY IN THE SEGMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, THE

CORPORATION SPENDS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ITS OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. SUCH

EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $1,191 MILLION, OR 4.3

PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2002, AS COMPARED WITH $1,254 MILLION OR 4.6 PERCENT OF TOTAL

SALES IN 2001 AND $1,302 MILLION OR 5.0 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2000. THE CORPORATION

ALSO PERFORMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. SUCH CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED

PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE FLIGHT

SYSTEMS SEGMENT, AMOUNTED TO $1,189 MILLION IN 2002, AS COMPARED WITH $846 MILLION IN 2001

AND $865 MILLION IN 2000.

CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER

MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION AT THE

CONVENIENCE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, IN WHICH EVENT THE CORPORATION NORMALLY WOULD BE

ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITS ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT. MOST

OF THE CORPORATION'S GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS;

APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF THE CORPORATION'S TOTAL SALES FOR 2002 WERE MADE UNDER

COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

LIKE MANY

DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THE CORPORATION HAS RECEIVED ALLEGATIONS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

THAT SOME CONTRACT PRICES SHOULD BE REDUCED BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA SUBMITTED IN

NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN CONFORMANCE WITH GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS. THE CORPORATION HAS MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES IT BELIEVES

APPROPRIATE, HAS SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS, AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY FURTHER PRICE

REDUCTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

THE CORPORATION

IS NOW, AND BELIEVES THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT IT

WILL BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. SEE ITEM 3 - LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS ON PAGES 8 THROUGH 9 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 31 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION. IF THE CORPORATION OR ONE OF ITS BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH

WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, IT COULD BE SUSPENDED FROM BIDDING

ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE CORPORATION COULD BE FINED AND DEBARRED

FROM NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED THREE YEARS. ANY

CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD COULD BE VOIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

THE CORPORATION

CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE, SOME OF WHICH HAVE

SIGNIFICANT MINORITY INTERESTS. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN HAVE AN

IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION'S WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF

REFRIGERANTS IS IMPORTANT TO CARRIER'S BUSINESSES, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY REGULATIONS,

RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES

CAN IMPACT THE CORPORATION'S AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES. THE CORPORATION'S

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND

POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INVESTMENTS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF

EARNINGS. SOME FOREIGN CUSTOMERS IN THE CORPORATION'S AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESSES MAY

REQUIRE COUNTER-PURCHASE OR OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS AS A CONDITION TO A SALE, SUCH AS

REQUIRING THE CORPORATION TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES IN THE CUSTOMER'S COUNTRY OR TO PARTICIPATE

IN MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROJECTS.

THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER

ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THE CORPORATION HAS INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR

LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS

PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT

COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT

ANY PAYMENTS IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR THESE CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT UPON ITS CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. (ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON PAGE 11 AND NOTES 1 AND 16 OF

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 21 AND 31 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

MOST OF THE LAWS

GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF THE CORPORATION WERE

CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY

OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT AWARDED TO THE CORPORATION UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WHILE THE

CORPORATION'S PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES ARE CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO

ITS BUSINESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR  GROUP OF

RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE OVERALL BUSINESS OF THE CORPORATION OR ON ANY OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE CORPORATION

HAS SOUGHT COST REDUCTIONS IN ITS PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES. THESE

COST REDUCTIONS MAY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING

ITS PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING

ONLINE BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION

IS RELIANT UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY. GREATER DEPENDENCE ON GLOBAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY

REQUIRES RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION AND IMPORT AND EXPORT PROCESSES. A DISRUPTION IN

DELIVERIES FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, THEREFORE, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

CORPORATION'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE U.S.,

THE CORPORATION IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS RAW MATERIALS

REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (AFRICA, AUSTRALIA AND RUSSIA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND ASIA),

CHROMIUM (AFRICA AND KAZAKHSTAN) AND RHENIUM (CHILE AND KAZAKHSTAN). TO ALLEVIATE THIS

DEPENDENCE AND ACCOMPANYING RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PARTICULAR RAW MATERIALS, THE

CORPORATION HAS A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDE THE INCREASED USE OF MORE

READILY AVAILABLE MATERIALS THROUGH MATERIAL SUBSTITUTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

ALLOYS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES SUCH AS NEAR NET SHAPE FORGING. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT ITS SUPPLY

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN GENERAL ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE ASSOCIATED

RISKS AND THE ADDITIONAL COST OF OTHER PRACTICES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT FORESEE ANY

UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, OR SUPPLIES THAT WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS OVERALL BUSINESS, OR ON ANY OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IN THE NEAR TERM.

CASH FLOWS MAY BE SUBJECT, INCLUDING THE RISKS OF THE CORPORATION'S INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, SEE THE "BUSINESS" SECTION OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADINGS

CORPORATION'S BUSINESS AS A WHOLE" AND IN THE "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" SECTION.

ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION AS TO RISK FACTORS IS INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATION'S 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS IN THE SECTION TITLED "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND

ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM THOSE STATED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, SEE

THE CORPORATION'S REPORTS ON FORMS 10-Q AND 8-K FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION FROM TIME TO TIME.

EMPLOYEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE CORPORATION'S TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS

APPROXIMATELY 155,000. FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE CORPORATION'S RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON PAGE 7 AND NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ON PAGE 29 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

THE CORPORATION'S FIXED ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 INCLUDE

THE PLANTS AND WAREHOUSES DESCRIBED BELOW AND A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT, MOST OF WHICH IS GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT USING SPECIAL JIGS,

TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC CONTROL FEATURES AND SPECIAL

ADAPTATIONS. THE PLANTS, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN USE AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2002 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE WELL MAINTAINED, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN

REGULAR USE.

THE FOLLOWING

SQUARE FOOTAGE NUMBERS ARE APPROXIMATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE CORPORATION OPERATED

(A) PLANTS IN THE U.S. WHICH HAD 32.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 4.4 MILLION SQUARE

FEET WERE LEASED; (B) PLANTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHICH HAD 24.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH

2.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED; (C) WAREHOUSES IN THE U.S. WHICH HAD 10.9 MILLION

SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 7.7 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED; AND (D) WAREHOUSES OUTSIDE THE

U.S. WHICH HAD 4.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 3.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED.

FOR DISCUSSION

OF THE EFFECT OF THE CORPORATION'S RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON PRODUCTION FACILITIES, SEE

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON

PAGE 7 AND NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 29 OF THE

CORPORATION'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE CORPORATION'S PRODUCTS ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE

BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, ARE BEING APPROPRIATELY

UTILIZED CONSISTENT WITH EXPERIENCE AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR

PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES. UTILIZATION OF THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE

PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION CONTINUOUSLY REVIEWS ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES

AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST ITS FACILITIES NEEDS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) AND THE

CORPORATION ARE LITIGATING WHETHER PRATT & WHITNEY'S GOVERNMENT COST ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN ENGINE PARTS ARE ACCEPTABLE. THE LITIGATION, FILED IN 1994 WITH THE

ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS ("ASBCA"), NO. 47416 ET AL., RELATES TO

THE ACCOUNTING FOR ENGINE PARTS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES UNDER COMMERCIAL ENGINE

COLLABORATION PROGRAMS FROM 1984 THROUGH 1995. ON JULY 31, 2001, THE ASBCA ISSUED A

DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CORPORATION. THE DOD APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT ON NOVEMBER 29, 2001. ON JANUARY 15, 2003, THE COURT OF

APPEALS REVERSED THE ASBCA AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE ASBCA FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE

CORPORATION INTENDS TO SEEK RECONSIDERATION OF THIS DECISION BY THE COURT. THE DOD HAS

CLAIMED APPROXIMATELY $158 MILLION IN DAMAGES, AND APPROXIMATELY $103 MILLION IN INTEREST

THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 1996. SHOULD THE DOD ULTIMATELY PREVAIL ON LIABILITY, DAMAGES COULD

BE LARGER THAN INITIALLY CLAIMED BECAUSE THE DOD MAY AMEND ITS CLAIM TO INCLUDE THE PERIOD

AFTER 1995 TO THE PRESENT, AND INTEREST COULD CONTINUE TO ACCRUE FROM JANUARY 1, 1997.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, THE CORPORATION HAS PENDING AGAINST IT ONE QUI TAM COMPLAINT UNDER THE CIVIL

FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT: U.S. EX

REL. DRAKE V. NORDEN SYSTEMS, INC. AND UTC, NO. 394CV00963 (FILED JULY 1997, AND INVOLVING

ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED ASSETS). THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDES

FOR PENALTIES IN A CIVIL CASE OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM SUBMITTED. THE NUMBER OF

FALSE CLAIMS IMPLICATED BY THIS QUI TAM COMPLAINT CANNOT CURRENTLY BE ASCERTAINED;

HOWEVER, IF DETERMINED ADVERSELY TO THE CORPORATION, THE NUMBER COULD RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES. THE QUI TAM RELATOR HAS CLAIMED UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES (TREBLED) AND

PENALTIES, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS DECLINED TO TAKE OVER THE LITIGATION. IN

AUGUST 2000 AND AUGUST 2001, THE COURT DISMISSED PORTIONS OF THE COMPLAINT. IN OCTOBER

2002, THE COURT ORDERED THE PARTIES TO ADDRESS WHETHER THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THE CASE

ENTIRELY. ADDITIONAL PAPERS WERE FILED IN NOVEMBER 2002, AND A DECISION BY THE COURT IS

EXPECTED IN 2003.

IN MARCH 1999,

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILED A CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CORPORATION

IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (WESTERN DIVISION), NO.

C-3-99-093. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE "FIGHTER ENGINE COMPETITION" BETWEEN

PRATT & WHITNEY'S F100 ENGINE AND GE'S F110 ENGINE, FOR CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S.

AIR FORCE BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS 1985 AND 1990, INCLUSIVE. THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT PRATT

& WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT

WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. IN MID-2002, THE COURT DENIED MOTIONS FILED BY THE

CORPORATION THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN DISMISSAL OF ALL OR PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S

CLAIMS. THE CORPORATION HAS REQUESTED THAT THE COURT RECONSIDER THIS DENIAL. THE

GOVERNMENT'S MOST RECENT QUANTIFICATION OF ITS CLAIMED DAMAGES IN AUGUST 2001 INCLUDES

FALSE CLAIMS ACT DAMAGES OF APPROXIMATELY $76 MILLION (SUBJECT TO TREBLING, PLUS PENALTIES

OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM), AND DAMAGES UNDER THE TRUTH IN NEGOTIATIONS ACT OF

APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION PLUS INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY $81 MILLION. INTEREST COULD

CONTINUE TO ACCRUE ON THIS PORTION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CLAIM.

LIKE MANY OTHER

COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, THE CORPORATION OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS

INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF THE CORPORATION'S PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE THE CORPORATION

HAS NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATES IT IN ANY

CURRENTLY-MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF ITS HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY

OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. THE CORPORATION HAS

MADE NO PAYMENT IN A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE CASES CLOSED TO DATE. THE REMAINDER OF

THE RESOLVED CASES HAVE SETTLED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE CORPORATION, AND

HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN PART BY INSURANCE. AT PRESENT, THE CORPORATION IS NAMED IN

APPROXIMATELY 850 LAWSUITS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 16,000 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS. MORE THAN

13,000 OF THESE CLAIMANTS ARE JOINED IN SEVEN LAWSUITS IN CIRCUIT COURT IN VARIOUS

COUNTIES IN MISSISSIPPI THAT WERE FILED OR AMENDED DURING 2002 TO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION

OR CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. EACH OF THESE MISSISSIPPI LAWSUITS NAMES FROM 200 TO MORE

THAN 400 OTHER COMPANIES AS DEFENDANTS ALONG WITH THE CORPORATION OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE

COMPLAINTS DO NOT IDENTIFY ANY PRODUCTS OF THE CORPORATION OR ITS NAMED SUBSIDIARIES, OR

SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED. NOR DO THEY ALLEGE WHICH CLAIMANTS, IF ANY, WERE

EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CORPORATION'S PRODUCTS OR PREMISES, OR THE EXTENT,

IF ANY, TO WHICH SUCH CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN HARMED. NO DISCOVERY OR OTHER PRETRIAL

PROCEEDINGS TO DEVELOP SUCH INFORMATION HAVE YET OCCURRED.

THE CORPORATION

DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING OR ANY OTHER LEGAL MATTERS WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF THE CORPORATION'S

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING "OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO

THE CORPORATION'S BUSINESS AS A WHOLE  CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL

AND OTHER MATTERS" IN ITEM 1  BUSINESS ON PAGES 6 THROUGH 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

NO MATTERS WERE SUBMITTED TO SECURITY HOLDERS FOR A VOTE DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002.
