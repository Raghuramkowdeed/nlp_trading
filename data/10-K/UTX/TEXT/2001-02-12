OTIS AND CARRIER WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS

OTIS AND CARRIER CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND

AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE, SOME OF WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT MINORITY INTERESTS.  IN

ADDITION, THEIR GLOBAL GROWTH STRATEGIES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN MARKETS

WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING THOSE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC

OF CHINA, RUSSIA, BRAZIL, SOUTH KOREA AND OTHER COUNTRIES, WHICH INVOLVE A

HIGHER DEGREE OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK THAN INVESTMENTS IN MORE

DEVELOPED MARKETS.

THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS OF OTIS AND CARRIER CAN BE AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, WEATHER AND INTERNATIONAL

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES (WHICH CAN AFFECT DEMAND FOR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES), CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, CHANGES IN LEGISLATION AND

GOVERNMENT POLICIES (INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INVESTMENTS, EXCHANGE CONTROLS,

REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS AND, IN THE CASE OF CARRIER, REGULATION OF

REFRIGERANTS), CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, CHANGES IN

EXCHANGE RATES, CHANGES IN LABOR COSTS (WHICH CAN AFFECT OTIS SERVICE AND

MAINTENANCE MARGINS) AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, AND COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER

OF COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES.  CARRIER'S OPERATIONS CAN

ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF

TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT, IN THE LEVEL OF RETAIL SALES OF PERISHABLE FOOD PRODUCTS,

AND IN FUEL PRICES.  THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION ARE PRICE, DELIVERY

SCHEDULE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE.

PRATT & WHITNEY AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE PRODUCTS

PRATT & WHITNEY AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS PRODUCE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE PRODUCTS.

SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY; LENGTHY AND COSTLY

DEVELOPMENT CYCLES; THE EFFECTS OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE

INDUSTRY; HEAVY DEPENDENCE ON A SMALL NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS; CHANGES

IN LEGISLATION (INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS)

AND IN GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES; POLICIES OF SOME FOREIGN CUSTOMERS

WHICH REQUIRE OFFSET PROGRAMS (IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL

SUPPORT PROJECTS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION TO OBTAINING ORDERS) OR OTHER

ARRANGEMENTS; SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN

MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL

PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE

SPARE PARTS; AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRIAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THESE TWO SEGMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED IN

A NUMBER OF RESPECTS BY THE GENERAL LEVEL OF ACTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND THE AVIATION INDUSTRY AND BY CHANGES IN FUEL

PRICES.  THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OF THESE SEGMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO LOCAL

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS (INCLUDING REGULATIONS RELATING TO INVESTMENTS, EXCHANGE

CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS) AS WELL AS TO VARYING CURRENCY, POLITICAL

AND ECONOMIC RISKS.  SALES OF MILITARY PRODUCTS ARE AFFECTED BY DEFENSE BUDGETS

(BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD) AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY.  MILITARY SPARE PARTS

SALES ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY POLICIES OF THE U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OF

PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS.

THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION IN THE CORPORATION'S AEROSPACE AND

DEFENSE BUSINESSES ARE PRICE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, SERVICE, DELIVERY SCHEDULE

AND OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE, INCLUDING DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS

AND PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL JET ENGINES AND

HELICOPTERS.  ENGINE SELECTIONS BY AIRLINES, AIRFRAME MANUFACTURERS AND

OPERATORS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SALES OF SPARE PARTS AND MAINTENANCE

SERVICES.  SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF PRATT & WHITNEY'S AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS'

BUSINESS, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE

SHORT LEAD TIMES.  THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF

FUTURE DEMAND.  ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL

CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2001, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED.

IN 2000, THE CORPORATION ANNOUNCED ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE FORMATION OF

MYAIRCRAFT, A JOINT VENTURE TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS E-COMMERCE

MARKETPLACE FOR AEROSPACE AFTERMARKET PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODELS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS DUE TO RAPID CHANGES

IN TECHNOLOGY, BUSINESS PRACTICES AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, AS WELL AS

SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM OTHER E-COMMERCE INITIATIVES.  THESE E-COMMERCE

EXCHANGES CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THE

CORPORATION SELLS PARTS AND SERVICES.

PRATT & WHITNEY

PRATT & WHITNEY IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING PRODUCERS OF COMMERCIAL,

GENERAL AVIATION AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT ENGINES.  PRATT & WHITNEY PROVIDES

THE BOEING MD-11 AIRCRAFT.  (THE BOEING COMPANY ("BOEING") PHASED OUT PRODUCTION

OF MD-80 AIRCRAFT IN DECEMBER 1999 AND HAS ANNOUNCED THAT MD-11 PRODUCTION WOULD

BE PHASED OUT IN 2001.)  PRATT & WHITNEY HAS ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF

UNDERSTANDING WITH AIRBUS INDUSTRIE ("AIRBUS") TO DEVELOP, MARKET AND SELL

PW6000 SERIES ENGINES FOR INSTALLATION ON AIRBUS A318 AIRCRAFT, CURRENTLY

EXPECTED TO ENTER SERVICE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002.

- 3 -

IN VIEW OF THE RISK AND COST ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING NEW ENGINES, PRATT &

WHITNEY HAS ENTERED INTO COMMERCIAL ENGINE COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH

COSTS, REVENUES AND RISKS ARE SHARED.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE INTERESTS OF

OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THESE ITEMS WERE APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS: 24 PERCENT OF

THE JT8D-200 SERIES ENGINE PROGRAM, 29 PERCENT OF THE PW2000 SERIES ENGINE

PROGRAM, 14 PERCENT OF THE 94 AND 100 INCH FAN MODELS OF THE PW4000, 26 PERCENT

OF THE PW4084 AND PW4090 MODELS AND 24 PERCENT OF THE PW4098 MODEL.  IAE

1996 WITH GE AIRCRAFT ENGINES TO DEVELOP, MARKET AND MANUFACTURE A NEW JET

ENGINE KNOWN AS THE GP7000.  THE NEW ENGINE IS INTENDED TO POWER BOEING 767-

400ERX, BOEING 747X AND AIRBUS A380 AIRCRAFT.  IN DECEMBER 2000, AIRBUS

ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF THE A380 AIRCRAFT (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE A3XX), WITH

FIRST DELIVERIES SCHEDULED FOR 2006.

MANUFACTURERS OF MANY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT OFFER THEIR CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF

ENGINES, GIVING RISE TO COMPETITION AMONG ENGINE MANUFACTURERS AT THE TIME OF

SALE OF AIRCRAFT.  THIS COMPETITION IS INTENSE, PARTICULARLY FOR NEW COMMERCIAL

AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS, AND CAN RESULT IN OFFERS BY ENGINE SUPPLIERS OF

SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES AND

MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS.  PRATT & WHITNEY'S MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF

ENGINES ARE THE AIRCRAFT ENGINE BUSINESSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY AND ROLLS

ROYCE PLC.  (FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS,

PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE

AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 13 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 16 AND 21 TO 22 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2000 ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

PRATT & WHITNEY PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS,

PROCEED INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HAVE

SELECTED DERIVATIVES OF PRATT & WHITNEY'S F119 ENGINE TO POWER THEIR COMPETING

DEMONSTRATION AIRCRAFT.  MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN,

AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES PRATT & WHITNEY WILL PRODUCE F119 ENGINES.

AND WASTE WATER TREATMENT).  THESE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD DIRECTLY TO END-

USERS, THROUGH MANUFACTURER REPRESENTATIVES AND DISTRIBUTORS AND THROUGH

ENGINEERING CONTRACTORS.  DEMAND FOR HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND'S INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS

IS TIED CLOSELY TO THE LEVEL OF GENERAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.  HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND

HAS COMPETITORS OR POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN BOTH ITS AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL

BUSINESSES.  HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND BELIEVES THAT ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, AND PRODUCT AND SERVICE REPUTATIONS HAVE BEEN

SIGNIFICANT IN MAINTAINING ITS COMPETITIVE STANDING.

REVENUES GENERATED BY THE FLIGHT SYSTEMS SEGMENT'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING EXPORT SALES, WERE 44 PERCENT AND 41 PERCENT OF TOTAL FLIGHT SYSTEMS

SEGMENT REVENUES IN 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, FLIGHT

SYSTEMS' BUSINESS BACKLOG WAS $4,593 MILLION, INCLUDING $2,532 MILLION UNDER

FUNDED CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AS COMPARED TO

$3,930 MILLION AND $1,011 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 1999.  OF THE

TOTAL FLIGHT SYSTEMS SEGMENT BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, APPROXIMATELY $2,985

MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED AS SALES IN 2001.

OTHER

THE CORPORATION'S INTERNATIONAL FUEL CELLS UNIT ("IFC") IS A WORLD LEADER IN

FUEL CELL PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT FOR COMMERCIAL, TRANSPORTATION, RESIDENTIAL

AND SPACE APPLICATIONS.  IFC IS THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF FUEL CELLS FOR U.S. SPACE

MISSIONS AND ALSO OFFERS A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FUEL CELL POWER PLANT, KNOWN

AS THE PC25 (TRADEMARK SYMBOL).

THE PC25 IS A 200 KILOWATT STATIONARY FUEL CELL POWER PLANT WITH A

PHOSPHORIC ACID CELL STACK.  OVER 200 PC25 UNITS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED AROUND

THE WORLD.  FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS USING PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY

(PEM) ARE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION, COMMERCIAL STATIONARY,

AND RESIDENTIAL APPLICATIONS.  IFC IS WORKING WITH FIVE AUTOMAKERS AND TWO

BUS MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, ON DEVELOPMENT

AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS FOR AUTOMOBILES.

ALTHOUGH FUEL CELLS ARE BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER

GENERATORS IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS, CURRENT

PRODUCTION RATES REMAIN LOW ACROSS THE INDUSTRY.  CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY

ADVANCEMENT AND WIDER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION

COST OF FUEL CELL COMPONENTS AND POWER PLANTS.  THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT

UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PEM FUEL CELLS WILL BE

PRODUCED.  IFC CONTINUES TO SEEK STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO DEVELOP SOURCES OF

SUPPLY, AS WELL AS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.  TOSHIBA CORPORATION

OWNS A 13 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN IFC.

THE RESULTS OF IFC ARE INCLUDED IN THE "ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER" CATEGORY IN

THE SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA IN NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ON PAGES 22 TO 24 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE CORPORATION'S BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION, THE CORPORATION SPENDS SUBSTANTIAL

AMOUNTS OF ITS OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  SUCH EXPENDITURES, WHICH

ARE CHARGED TO INCOME AS INCURRED, WERE $1,302 MILLION OR 5.0 PERCENT OF TOTAL

SALES IN 2000, AS COMPARED WITH $1,292 MILLION OR 5.4 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN

1999 AND $1,168 MILLION OR 5.1 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 1998.  THE CORPORATION

ALSO PERFORMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS.  SUCH CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH

IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT

IN THE FLIGHT SYSTEMS SEGMENT, AMOUNTED TO $1,004 MILLION IN 2000, AS COMPARED

WITH $1,044 MILLION IN 1999 AND $1,065 MILLION IN 1998.

CONTRACTS, OTHER RISK FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION AT THE CONVENIENCE OF THE

GOVERNMENT, IN WHICH EVENT THE CORPORATION NORMALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO

REIMBURSEMENT FOR ITS ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT.  MOST

OF THE CORPORATION'S SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS; ONLY 4

PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION'S TOTAL SALES FOR 2000 WERE MADE UNDER COST-

REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THE CORPORATION HAS RECEIVED ALLEGATIONS FROM

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THAT SOME CONTRACT PRICES SHOULD BE REDUCED BECAUSE COST OR

PRICING DATA SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

IN CONFORMANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.  THE CORPORATION HAS MADE VOLUNTARY

REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES IT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE, HAS SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS,

AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY FURTHER PRICE REDUCTIONS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

CASH FLOWS.

THE CORPORATION IS NOW, AND BELIEVES THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT IT WILL BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS.  SEE ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ON PAGES 9 AND 10 OF THIS FORM

10-K AND NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 22 OF THE

CORPORATION'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE CORPORATION'S BUSINESSES ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND

GEOGRAPHICALLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAS HELPED TO LIMIT IN VARYING DEGREES THE

EFFECT OF ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN ANY ONE INDUSTRY OR THE ECONOMY OF ANY COUNTRY

OR REGION ON THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE CORPORATION.  THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN ONE OR MORE

INDUSTRIES OR REGIONS WILL BE LIMITED OR OFFSET IN THE FUTURE.

LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE U.S., THE CORPORATION IS LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON

FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN OF ITS RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT

(AFRICA) AND CHROMIUM (AFRICA, EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE AND THE COUNTRIES OF

THE FORMER SOVIET UNION).  TO ALLEVIATE THIS DEPENDENCE AND ACCOMPANYING RISK,

THE CORPORATION HAS A NUMBER OF ON-GOING PROGRAMS WHICH INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT

OF NEW SUPPLIERS; THE INCREASED USE OF MORE READILY AVAILABLE MATERIALS THROUGH

MATERIAL SUBSTITUTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ALLOYS; AND THE CONSERVATION

OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES SUCH AS

NET SHAPE FORGING.

THE CORPORATION HAS SOUGHT COST REDUCTIONS IN ITS PURCHASES OF CERTAIN OTHER

MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, AND SUPPLIES BY CONSOLIDATING ITS PURCHASES, REDUCING THE

NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND USING ONLINE BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL

SUPPLIERS.  IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION IS RELIANT UPON A SINGLE SOURCE

OF SUPPLY.  A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, THEREFORE, COULD HAVE

AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS TO

CUSTOMERS.  THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT IT HAS APPROPRIATELY BALANCED THE

RISKS AGAINST THE COSTS OF SUSTAINING A GREATER NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS.  THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT FORESEE ANY UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, OR

SUPPLIES WHICH WILL HAVE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OVERALL BUSINESS, OR

ON ANY OF ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IN THE NEAR TERM.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT FEDERAL,

STATE AND LOCAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON ITS CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION,

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE THE

SUBJECT OF CERTAIN OF THE LEGAL MATTERS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ON PAGES 9 AND 10 OF THIS FORM 10-K, AND ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON PAGE

7 AND NOTES 1 AND 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 15

AND 22 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

MOST OF THE LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL

PROVISIONS.  IF THE CORPORATION WERE CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL

CLEAN AIR ACT OR THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE

VIOLATION WOULD BE LISTED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S ("EPA") LIST

OF VIOLATING FACILITIES.  THE LISTING WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL THE EPA CONCLUDED

THAT THE CAUSE OF THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CURED.  LISTED FACILITIES CANNOT BE

USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT AWARDED TO THE CORPORATION

DURING ANY PERIOD OF LISTING BY THE EPA.

WHILE THE CORPORATION'S PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES ARE

CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO ITS BUSINESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR

FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL BUSINESS OF THE

CORPORATION OR ON ANY OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

EMPLOYEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE CORPORATION'S TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY

153,800.  FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE CORPORATION'S RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON PAGE 4 AND NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 20 TO 21 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2000

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

THE CORPORATION'S FIXED ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 INCLUDE THE PLANTS

AND WAREHOUSES DESCRIBED BELOW AND A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT, MOST OF WHICH IS GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT USING

SPECIAL JIGS, TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC CONTROL

FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS.  THE PLANTS, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT IN USE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE

WELL MAINTAINED, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN REGULAR USE.

THE FOLLOWING SQUARE FOOTAGE NUMBERS ARE APPROXIMATIONS.  AT DECEMBER 31,

2000, THE CORPORATION OPERATED (A) PLANTS IN THE U.S. WHICH HAD 30.6 MILLION

SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 3.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED; (B) PLANTS OUTSIDE

THE U.S. WHICH HAD 18.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 1.8 MILLION SQUARE FEET

WERE LEASED; (C) WAREHOUSES IN THE U.S. WHICH HAD 8.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF

WHICH 5.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE LEASED; AND (D) WAREHOUSES OUTSIDE THE U.S.

WHICH HAD 8.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 6.1 MILLION SQUARE FEET WERE

LEASED.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF THE CORPORATION'S RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON

PRODUCTION FACILITIES, SEE MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON PAGE 4 AND NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 20 TO 21 OF THE CORPORATION'S 2000

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

- 8 -

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN

OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE CORPORATION'S PRODUCTS

ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, ARE BEING APPROPRIATELY UTILIZED CONSISTENT WITH

EXPERIENCE AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED

PURPOSES.  UTILIZATION OF THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE

PRODUCTS.  THE CORPORATION CONTINUOUSLY REVIEWS ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS

FOR FACILITIES AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ACQUIRE

ADDITIONAL FACILITIES AND/OR DISPOSE OF EXISTING FACILITIES.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE CORPORATION ARE

LITIGATING WHETHER PRATT & WHITNEY'S ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN ENGINE

PARTS ARE ACCEPTABLE.  THE LITIGATION, FILED WITH THE ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF

CONTRACT APPEALS ("ASBCA"), NO. 47416 ET AL., RELATES TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR

ENGINE PARTS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES UNDER COMMERCIAL ENGINE COLLABORATION

PROGRAMS FROM 1984 THROUGH 1995.  IN DECEMBER 1996 THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED

DAMAGES OF $157.6 MILLION, PLUS $102.7 MILLION IN INTEREST THROUGH 1996.  PRATT

& WHITNEY BELIEVES ITS ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ARE PROPER AND HAS NOT MODIFIED

THEM.  IN MARCH AND APRIL 1998, THE MATTER WAS TRIED BEFORE AN ASBCA JUDGE.  A

DECISION IS ANTICIPATED IN 2001.  SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT PREVAIL ON LIABILITY,

DAMAGES COULD BE LARGER THAN INITIALLY CLAIMED BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT MAY AMEND

ITS CLAIM TO INCLUDE THE PERIOD AFTER 1995 AND INTEREST CONTINUES TO ACCRUE ON

THE CLAIM ASSERTED IN 1996.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A JURY IN CHROMALLOY GAS TURBINE CORPORATION V.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, NO. 95-CI-12541, A TEXAS STATE ACTION, FOUND

THAT PRATT & WHITNEY DID NOT MONOPOLIZE ANY RELEVANT MARKET BUT DID WILLFULLY

ATTEMPT TO MONOPOLIZE AN UNSPECIFIED MARKET.  IN MAY 1997, THE COURT ENTERED A

FINAL JUDGMENT DENYING CHROMALLOY'S REQUEST FOR DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND

DECLARATORY RELIEF.  IN OCTOBER 1998, THE TEXAS FOURTH COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED

THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT, DECLINING TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO

CHROMALLOY.  IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE APPELLATE COURT DENIED CHROMALLOY'S MOTIONS

FOR REHEARING AND REHEARING EN BANC.  IN MARCH 2000, CHROMALLOY FILED A PETITION

FOR REVIEW WITH THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT.  IN DECEMBER 2000, THE TEXAS SUPREME

COURT DENIED CHROMALLOY'S PETITION FOR REVIEW.  IN JANUARY 2001, CHROMALLOY

FILED A MOTION FOR REHEARING WITH THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN SERVED WITH TWO QUI TAM

COMPLAINTS UNDER THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT:  U.S. EX REL. DRAKE V. NORDEN SYSTEMS, INC. AND

UTC, NO.394CV00963 (FILED JULY 1997, AND INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER

ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED ASSETS) AND U.S. EX REL. CAPELLA V. UTC AND NORDEN SYSTEMS

INC., NO. 394CV02063 (FILED DECEMBER 1994, AND INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER

ACCOUNTING FOR INSURANCE COSTS).  THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDES FOR

PENALTIES IN A CIVIL CASE OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM SUBMITTED.  THE

NUMBER OF FALSE CLAIMS IMPLICATED BY THE FOREGOING QUI TAM COMPLAINTS CANNOT

CURRENTLY BE ASCERTAINED; HOWEVER, IF DETERMINED ADVERSELY TO THE CORPORATION,

THE NUMBER COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES.  THE QUI TAM RELATOR IN EACH

CASE HAS CLAIMED UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES (TREBLED) AND PENALTIES, AND THE DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE IN EACH CASE HAS DECLINED TO TAKE OVER THE LITIGATION.  IN AUGUST

2000, THE COURT DISMISSED PORTIONS OF THE COMPLAINTS.

IN MARCH 1999, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILED A CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT

COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (WESTERN DIVISION), NO. C-3-99-093.  THIS LAWSUIT IS

RELATED TO THE "FIGHTER ENGINE COMPETITION" BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEY'S F100

ENGINE AND GE'S F110 ENGINE, FOR CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE BETWEEN

FISCAL YEARS 1985 AND 1990, INCLUSIVE.  THE GOVERNMENT ALLEGES THAT PRATT

& WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA

THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS.  THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS DAMAGES OF

AT LEAST $95 MILLION (SOME PORTION OF WHICH WOULD BE TREBLED PLUS PENALTIES

OF UP TO $10,000 PER CLAIM SUBMITTED).

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING

LEGAL MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S

COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE CORPORATION IS NOW, AND BELIEVES THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT IT WILL BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS.  IF THE CORPORATION OR ONE OF ITS BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED

WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, THE CORPORATION OR

ONE OF ITS BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE SUSPENDED FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS

OF NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  IF

CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE CORPORATION COULD BE FINED AND DEBARRED FROM NEW

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED THREE YEARS.  ANY

CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD COULD BE VOIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

- 9 -

THE CORPORATION HAS INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES

UNDER VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS

PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT ANY

PAYMENTS IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AS A RESULT OF THESE CLAIMS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE OR FINANCIAL POSITION, OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE CORPORATION.  (FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE

MATTERS DISCUSSED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, SEE "ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS" IN MANAGEMENT'S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON PAGE
