FULLY COMMERCIALIZE FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FUEL CELLS WILL BE PRODUCED.

UTC POWER MERGED WITH UTC FUEL CELLS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, WITH UTC POWER CONTINUING AS THE SURVIVING ENTITY. UTC IS IN THE PROCESS OF INCORPORATING UTC POWERS COMBINED COOLING, HEATING AND POWER

SYSTEMS BUSINESS WITHIN CARRIERS BUSINESSES, ITS GEOTHERMAL POWER SYSTEMS BUSINESS WITHIN PRATT & WHITNEYS POWER SYSTEMS BUSINESS, AND ITS SPACE AND DEFENSE FUEL CELL POWER PLANT BUSINESS WITHIN HAMILTON SUNDSTRANDS

ENERGY, SPACE AND DEFENSE BUSINESS. THESE TRANSITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2009. THE RESULTS OF UTC POWER AND UTC FUEL CELLS ARE INCLUDED IN THE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER CATEGORY IN THE SEGMENT FINANCIAL

DATA IN NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES

AS WORLDWIDE BUSINESSES, OUR OPERATIONS CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION, IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT, IN ITEM 1, CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS, AND IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K. EACH BUSINESS UNIT IS SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND EACH COMPETES ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, DELIVERY SCHEDULE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE.

OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR NATIONAL COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY

EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND

MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS POLICIES OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM

SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AFFECT MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES. SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG

INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GE AVIATION, ROLLS-ROYCE, HONEYWELL AND TURBOMECA. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS,

PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY

CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $1,771 MILLION OR 3.1 PERCENT OF

TOTAL SALES IN 2008, AS COMPARED WITH $1,678 MILLION OR 3.1 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2007 AND $1,529 MILLION OR 3.2 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2006. WE ALSO PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY SEGMENTS, AMOUNTED TO $2,101 MILLION IN 2008, AS COMPARED

TO $2,123 MILLION IN 2007 AND $1,952 MILLION IN 2006. THESE CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, THROUGH COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND AMOUNTS THAT ARE CAPITALIZED INTO INVENTORY TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY

RECOVERED THROUGH PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT SHIPMENTS. OF THE TOTALS, $2,008 MILLION, $1,872 MILLION AND $1,621 MILLION WERE EXPENSED IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING COSTS HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WE WOULD NORMALLY BE

ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING

UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. MOST OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY $2,721 MILLION OR 4.6 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR 2008 WERE MADE

UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS,

WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT WE REDUCE CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE CONFORMED TO

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS HAVE INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS. WE HAVE MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, HAVE SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND CONTINUE TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE HAVE INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS WE MAY BE

REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES 1 AND 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT.

MOST OF THE U.S. LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF WE WERE CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE

VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE ARE AWARDED UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN AFFECT OUR WORLDWIDE

OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE SAFETY REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF CARRIER, OTIS AND UTC FIRE & SECURITY RESPECTIVELY, WHILE

GOVERNMENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RAW MATERIALS

WE MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND

FRANCHISES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE THIS PORTFOLIO IS CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SOURCES FOR OUR PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS,

SERVICES AND SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING. WE WORK CONTINUOUSLY WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND TO REDUCE COSTS. WE PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING OUR PURCHASES,

REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING ONLINE BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO

ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE UNITED STATES, WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS COBALT (FINLAND, NORWAY, RUSSIA AND CANADA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND

CANADA), CHROMIUM (SOUTH AFRICA, KAZAKHSTAN, ZIMBABWE AND RUSSIA) AND RHENIUM (CHILE, KAZAKHSTAN AND GERMANY). WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE

CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH

RECENT HIGH PRICES FOR SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES (STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM, TITANIUM AND NICKEL) HAVE CAUSED MARGIN AND COST PRESSURES, WE DO NOT FORESEE ANY NEAR TERM UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES

THAT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN

THIS FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 223,100, APPROXIMATELY 65 PERCENT OF WHICH REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2008, WE RENEGOTIATED THIRTEEN MULTI-YEAR

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVERED CERTAIN WORKERS AT CARRIER, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND, AND SIKORSKY. IN 2009, NUMEROUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVER CERTAIN WORKERS

AT SIKORSKY AND CARRIER. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY PROBLEMS IN RENEGOTIATING THESE CONTRACTS THAT WOULD EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR DISCUSSION OF THE

EFFECTS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER MATTERS WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING THE RISKS OF

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, SEE THE FURTHER DISCUSSION UNDER THE HEADINGS GENERAL AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT IN THIS SECTION, ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K, AND UNDER

RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE

RESULTS. FOR A DISCUSSION IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN THE BUSINESS SECTION UNDER THE HEADINGS OTHER

OPERATIONS AND NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR GLOBAL GROWTH IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF

ECONOMIC RISKS

AS WIDELY REPORTED, FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ASIA HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING EXTREME

DISRUPTION IN RECENT MONTHS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXTREME VOLATILITY IN SECURITY PRICES, SEVERELY DIMINISHED LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY, RATING DOWNGRADES OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DECLINING VALUATIONS OF OTHERS. GOVERNMENTS HAVE

TAKEN UNPRECEDENTED ACTIONS INTENDED TO ADDRESS EXTREME MARKET CONDITIONS THAT INCLUDE SEVERELY RESTRICTED CREDIT AND DECLINES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES. WHILE CURRENTLY THESE CONDITIONS HAVE NOT IMPAIRED OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT MARKETS AND FINANCE

OUR OPERATIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A FURTHER DETERIORATION IN FINANCIAL MARKETS AND CONFIDENCE IN MAJOR ECONOMIES. THESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THE CURRENT TIGHTENING

OF CREDIT IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES AND OPERATIONS AND COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS IMPACT

THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS. SIMILARLY, THIS TIGHTENING OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SUPPLIER BASE AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR ONE OR MORE OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR BANKRUPTCY. OUR GLOBAL

BUSINESS IS ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECREASES IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DECREASES IN BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SPENDING, AIR TRAVEL, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT.

STRENGTHENING OF THE RATE OF EXCHANGE FOR THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST CERTAIN MAJOR CURRENCIES SUCH AS THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTS OUR RESULTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE LIKELY DURATION AND SEVERITY

OF THE CURRENT DISRUPTION IN FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 62 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES IN 2008, ARE

INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, REGULATORY CHANGES, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY

COSTS, THE TIGHTENING OF THE U.S. CREDIT MARKETS AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, CARRIERS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND, IN ITS

RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY

38 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2008, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE. THE CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CURRENTLY FACED BY COMMERCIAL

AIRLINES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. AS A RESULT, CAPITAL SPENDING BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING,

LABOR ISSUES, WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS, AIRLINE CONSOLIDATION, AIRLINE INSOLVENCIES, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CORPORATE PROFITABILITY, AND

BACKLOG LEVELS, ALL OF WHICH COULD REDUCE BOTH THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL AND THE AFTERMARKET SALES AND MARGINS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES. FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIONS OR PANDEMIC HEALTH ISSUES COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE BOTH THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL

AND OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES AFTERMARKET SALES AND MARGINS. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2009, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT

FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. AT TIMES, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ALSO ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO BEAR COST OVERRUNS RELATED TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL AND DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT ARISE DURING THE

DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL POLITICAL

ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS, INCLUDING USAGE,

PRICING, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATORY CHANGES AND THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT

THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR

FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER

DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. IF WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH

WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE

COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUBJECT US TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD. THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR EXPORT PRIVILEGES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO U.S. MILITARY

BUDGETS, WHICH MAY FLUCTUATE TO REFLECT THE POLICIES OF A NEW ADMINISTRATION OR CONGRESS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK

AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 64 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL 2008 SEGMENT REVENUES DERIVED FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM U.S. EXPORT SALES. CHANGES IN LOCAL AND

REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES, MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND AND REPORTED PROFITS IN OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES) WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES.

IN ADDITION, CURRENCY

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING MARGINS MAY ALSO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY

WORLDWIDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS FOR CROSS BORDER TRANSACTIONS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MAJORITY OF SALES IN THE AEROSPACE BUSINESSES IS TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED

INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHILE THE MAJORITY OF COSTS AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS INCURRED IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY (PRINCIPALLY THE EURO AND THE CANADIAN DOLLAR). FOR OPERATING UNITS WITH U.S. DOLLAR SALES AND LOCAL CURRENCY COSTS,

THERE IS A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. TO MANAGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES, WE EMPLOY LONG-TERM HEDGING

STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR REVENUES. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION,

EXCHANGE CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE

US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS. IN

ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA AND SOUTH AFRICA THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK.

WHILE THESE FACTORS OR THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER-PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT

MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND

SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE

SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS OR THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE

INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES

ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE

AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS

WE SEEK

TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE SUCCESS

OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ASSETS AND PERSONNEL ACQUIRED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, APPLY OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AND COOPERATE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, APPLYING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, OR IN MANAGING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE WHEN

WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE RECENT EFFECTIVENESS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141 (REVISED 2007), BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO EXPENSE CERTAIN ACQUISITION COSTS AS INCURRED, MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR GREATER EARNINGS VOLATILITY AND GENERALLY LOWER EARNINGS DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE ACQUIRE NEW BUSINESSES.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES; THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVES RISKS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED

WE SEEK TO

ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, SALE AND SUPPORT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. WE REGULARLY INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT PURSUE ADVANCEMENTS IN A

WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES;

EXECUTION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF INTERNAL AND SUPPLIER-PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS; ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES

AND THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FACTORS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THESE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE

OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES PRATT & WHITNEY OR ITS AFFILIATES WILL PRODUCE AIRCRAFT ENGINES CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED

CERTIFICATIONS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND LEGAL

COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE

RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LITIGATION CONCERNING PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN EXPORT LAWS,

COMPETITION LAWS AND SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES. WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF SUCH LITIGATION. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS, OTHER DAMAGES (IN

CERTAIN CASES, TREBLE DAMAGES), OR SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE OF US OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE EXPORT AND TRADE PRACTICE LAWS COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND

SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF EXPORT PRIVILEGES. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE THESE RISKS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL

CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. FOR NON-INCOME TAX

RISKS, WE ESTIMATE MATERIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND ESTABLISH RESERVES AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CONTINGENCIES WHERE LIABILITY IS DEEMED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO US AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY AFFECT OUR ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATES OF THE LOSS CONTINGENCY RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OR AS A RESERVE AGAINST ASSETS IN OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE

PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K. FOR INCOME TAX RISKS, WE RECOGNIZE TAX BENEFITS BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT THAT A TAX BENEFIT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH THE

APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY THAT HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS. FOR THOSE INCOME TAX POSITIONS WHERE WE ASSESS THAT THERE IS NOT A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH TAX BENEFIT WILL BE SUSTAINED, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A TAX BENEFIT IN

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS MAY CAUSE US TO CHANGE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUSTAINING A PREVIOUSLY-RECOGNIZED BENEFIT WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH EVENT

OCCURS OR ON OUR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY OCCURS.

FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE, EMERGING MARKETS IS BASED ON THE COUNTRIES INCLUDED IN THE MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL

INTERNATIONAL EMERGING MARKETS GLOBAL INDEX

SM.

OUR FIXED ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCLUDE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND NON-MANUFACTURING FACILITIES SUCH AS WAREHOUSES SET FORTH IN THE TABLES ABOVE AND A SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITY OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT,

MOST OF WHICH ARE GENERAL PURPOSE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT USING SPECIAL JIGS, TOOLS AND FIXTURES AND IN MANY INSTANCES HAVING AUTOMATIC CONTROL FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS. THE FACILITIES, WAREHOUSES, MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN USE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION, ARE WELL-MAINTAINED AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ARE IN REGULAR USE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES. UTILIZATION OF

THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUOUSLY REVIEW OUR ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST OUR FACILITY NEEDS.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) SUED US IN 1999 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO, CLAIMING THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND COMMON LAW. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE

COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE AND GENERAL ELECTRICS F110 ENGINE. THE DOJ ALLEGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERPAID FOR F100 ENGINES UNDER CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE IN FISCAL YEARS 1985 THROUGH

1990 BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR SOME PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. AT TRIAL OF THIS MATTER, COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2004, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED PRATT &

WHITNEYS LIABILITY TO BE $624 MILLION. ON AUGUST 1, 2008, THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE HELD THAT THE AIR FORCE HAD NOT SUFFERED ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT PRICE

CONCESSIONS. HOWEVER, THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE FOUND THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT DUE TO INACCURATE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE 1983 OFFER. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTUAL DAMAGES, THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE AWARDED

THE DOJ THE MAXIMUM CIVIL PENALTY OF $7.09 MILLION, OR $10,000 FOR EACH OF THE 709 INVOICES PRATT & WHITNEY SUBMITTED IN 1989 AND LATER UNDER THE CONTRACTS. BOTH THE DOJ AND UTC HAVE APPEALED THE DECISION.

SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY PREVAIL, THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON FEBRUARY 21, 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS COMPETITION DIRECTORATE (EU COMMISSION) RULED THAT

OTIS SUBSIDIARIES IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG AND THE NETHERLANDS, AND A PORTION OF THE BUSINESS OF OTIS GERMAN SUBSIDIARY, VIOLATED EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COMPETITION RULES AND ASSESSED A 225 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION)

CIVIL FINE AGAINST OTIS, ITS RELEVANT LOCAL ENTITIES, AND UTC, WHICH WAS PAID DURING 2007. IN MAY 2007, WE FILED AN APPEAL OF THE DECISION BEFORE THE EUS EUROPEAN COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE. RESOLUTION OF THE MATTER IS NOT EXPECTED WITHIN THE

NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, THE AUSTRIAN FEDERAL COMPETITION AUTHORITY (COMPETITION

AUTHORITY) FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE CARTEL COURT IN AUSTRIA (CARTEL COURT) AGAINST OTIS AUSTRIAN SUBSIDIARY IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF UNLAWFUL COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE AUSTRIAN ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR INDUSTRY. ON

DECEMBER 14, 2007, THE CARTEL COURT, AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMPETITION AUTHORITY, ASSESSED CIVIL FINES AGAINST THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING A FINE OF 18.2 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION) AGAINST

OTIS AUSTRIAN SUBSIDIARY, WHICH FINE WAS FULLY PROVIDED FOR AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. OTIS AUSTRIA APPEALED THIS RULING IN JANUARY 2008. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE CARTEL COURT DENIED THE APPEAL AND IN DECEMBER 2008, THIS FINE WAS PAID IN FULL.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN 2005 THE KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION (KFTC) CONDUCTED AN INSPECTION AT THE OFFICES OF OTIS KOREA AND ITS

KOREAN COMPETITORS WITH RESPECT TO COLLUSIVE ACTIVITIES IN THE MARKET FOR NEW EQUIPMENT SALES, AND IN MAY 2007 EXPANDED ITS INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE PRICING OF SUBCONTRACTS FOR ELEVATOR INSTALLATION. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE KFTC ASSESSED A FINE

AGAINST OTIS KOREA OF SOUTH KOREAN WON 17.3 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION) WITH RESPECT TO THE NEW EQUIPMENT SALES INVESTIGATION, WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THIS FINE WAS PAID IN FULL. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE KFTC NOTIFIED US

THAT THE INSTALLATION SUBCONTRACTOR PRICING INVESTIGATION HAD BEEN CLOSED WITHOUT ACTION.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

(DOD) ISSUED A CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST SIKORSKY TO RECOVER OVERPAYMENTS THE DOD ALLEGES IT HAS INCURRED SINCE JANUARY 2003 IN CONNECTION WITH COST ACCOUNTING CHANGES APPROVED BY THE DOD AND IMPLEMENTED BY SIKORSKY IN 1999 AND 2006. THESE CHANGES

RELATE TO THE CALCULATION OF MATERIAL OVERHEAD RATES IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. THE DOD CLAIMED THAT SIKORSKYS LIABILITY IS APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION (INCLUDING INTEREST). WE BELIEVE THIS CLAIM IS WITHOUT MERIT AND INTEND TO APPEAL.

LIKE MANY OTHER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, WE OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT

OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE WE HAVE NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATE IT IN ANY CURRENTLY-MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY OTHER

MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS HAVE BEEN COVERED BY INSURANCE OR OTHER FORMS OF INDEMNITY OR HAVE BEEN DISMISSED WITHOUT PAYMENT. THE REMAINDER OF THE CLOSED

CASES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF THESE ASBESTOS-RELATED MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

AS REQUIRED BY RULE 13A-15

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, WE CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO), THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO) AND THE VICE PRESIDENT, CONTROLLER (CONTROLLER), OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY SYSTEM OF DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR AND THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF THE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. ACCORDINGLY, EVEN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES CAN ONLY PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING

THEIR CONTROL OBJECTIVES. BASED UPON OUR EVALUATION, OUR CEO, OUR CFO AND OUR CONTROLLER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN THE

REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE APPLICABLE RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT IT IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CEO, OUR CFO AND OUR CONTROLLER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED THE CRITERIA

SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN

THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT.

THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE

QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
