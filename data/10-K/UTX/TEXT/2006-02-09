COMPETITION AND

OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES

OUR

AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL

PRODUCTS) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER

SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS POLICIES OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AFFECT MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES. SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF OUR AEROSPACE

BUSINESSES, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. THE OPERATIONS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF

ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IN THIS SECTION AND IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS OF THIS FORM 10-K AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT. PRATT & WHITNEYS MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GE AIRCRAFT ENGINES AND ROLLS ROYCE PLC. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING

CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, SEE NOTES 4 AND 14 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.

MARKETED AS THE PURE COMFORT PRODUCT FAMILY. IN 2004, WE INTRODUCED THE PURECYCLE 200 PRODUCT, WHICH UTILIZES AN ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE TO CONVERT WASTE HEAT INTO ENERGY. MICROTURBINES AND ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE DEVICES ARE IN AN EARLY STAGE OF

DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND COST REDUCTION ARE REQUIRED FOR WIDE-SCALE MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

UTC FUEL CELLS, A PART OF UTC POWER, IS A WORLD LEADER IN FUEL CELL PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT FOR COMMERCIAL, TRANSPORTATION AND SPACE APPLICATIONS. UTC

FUEL CELLS IS THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF FUEL CELLS FOR U.S. SPACE MISSIONS AND ALSO OFFERS A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FUEL CELL POWER PLANT FOR ON-SITE POWER APPLICATIONS, KNOWN AS THE PURECELL 200, WHICH USES PROVEN PHOSPHORIC ACID FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY.

IN THE TRANSPORTATION MARKET, UTC FUEL CELLS IS WORKING WITH AUTOMOTIVE AND BUS MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, ON DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS FOR VEHICLES. IN 2005, UTC FUEL CELLS PROVIDED PUREMOTION 120 FUEL CELL POWER

PLANTS FOR BUSES INTENDED FOR REVENUE SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA. UTC POWER IS ACTIVELY PURSUING FURTHER COMMERCIALIZATION OF THESE POWER PLANTS. UTC FUEL CELLS IS ALSO PROVIDING FUEL CELLS TO HYUNDAI MOTOR CORPORATION UNDER THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

FREEDOM CAR PROGRAM. UTC POWER CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH MANY OF THE MAJOR AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS TO ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL POWERED CARS. FUEL CELL POWER PLANTS USING PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY (PEM) ARE

CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ON-SITE APPLICATIONS.

ALTHOUGH FUEL CELLS ARE BELIEVED TO BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES REMAIN LOW ACROSS

THE INDUSTRY. CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT AND COST REDUCTION OF KEY FUEL CELL COMPONENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE WIDE-SCALE MARKET ACCEPTANCE. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO ADVANCE FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY TO A TRULY COMMERCIAL STAGE. THERE IS

STILL SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PEM FUEL CELLS WILL BE PRODUCED.

THE RESULTS OF UTC POWER ARE INCLUDED IN THE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER CATEGORY IN THE SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA IN NOTE 16 OF NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SINCE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS

AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $1,367 MILLION, OR 3.2 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2005, AS COMPARED WITH $1,267

MILLION OR 3.5 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2004 AND $1,040 MILLION OR 3.4 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2003. WE ALSO PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THIS CONTRACT RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED PRINCIPALLY IN THE PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN THE HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND AND SIKORSKY SEGMENTS, AMOUNTED TO $1,498 MILLION IN 2005, AS COMPARED WITH $1,619 MILLION IN 2004 AND $1,580

MILLION IN 2003.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT,

EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WE WOULD NORMALLY BE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR ALLOWABLE COSTS

INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND

ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. MOST OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS; APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR 2005 WERE MADE UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY

DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH RECOMMEND THAT WE REDUCE CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT

HAVE CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS HAVE INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS. WE HAVE MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, HAVE SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND WE CONTINUE TO LITIGATE CERTAIN CASES.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AND ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE HAVE

INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION

OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE

FURTHER ADDRESSED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES 1 AND 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.)

MOST OF THE U.S. LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL

PROVISIONS. IF WE WERE CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE ARE AWARDED UNTIL

THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CERTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN AFFECT OUR WORLDWIDE

OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES AND FIRE SAFETY REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF CARRIER, OTIS AND UTC F&S RESPECTIVELY, WHILE GOVERNMENT

SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RAW MATERIALS

WE MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE THIS PORTFOLIO IS CUMULATIVELY IMPORTANT TO OUR

BUSINESS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES OR FRANCHISES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL BUSINESS OR ON ANY OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SOURCES FOR OUR PURCHASES OF MATERIALS,

COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING. WE WORK CONTINUOUSLY WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND TO REDUCE COSTS. WE PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING OUR

PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING ONLINE BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE

SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS BY SUPPLIERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE U.S., WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COBALT (AFRICA, AUSTRALIA AND RUSSIA), TANTALUM (AUSTRALIA AND ASIA), CHROMIUM (AFRICA AND KAZAKHSTAN) AND RHENIUM (CHILE

AND KAZAKHSTAN). WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH RECENT HIGH PRICES FOR SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES (STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM),

HAVE CAUSED MARGIN AND COST PRESSURES, WE DO NOT FORESEE ANY NEAR TERM UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES THAT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OR ON ANY OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE

EFFECTS OF THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM IA. RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR TOTAL EMPLOYMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 222,200, APPROXIMATELY 67 PERCENT OF WHICH REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES. DURING 2005, WE RENEGOTIATED MULTI-YEAR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS COVERING CERTAIN WORKERS AT CARRIER AND OTIS. IN 2006, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS COVERING CERTAIN WORKERS AT SIKORSKY AND CARRIER ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION.

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.

FOR A DISCUSSION

OF OTHER MATTERS WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING THE RISKS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, SEE THE FURTHER DISCUSSION UNDER THE HEADINGS GENERAL AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

BY SEGMENT IN THIS SECTION AND ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR

FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESULTS. FOR A DISCUSSION IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR

BUSINESS AS A WHOLE AND CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE AEROSPACE AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED 36 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES IN 2005, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES. THE AVIATION INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND CAPITAL SPENDING BY AIRLINES AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC

LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS AND BACKLOG LEVELS. ALSO,

SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2006, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE

BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING

AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS, INCLUDING USAGE, PRICING, REGULATORY CHANGES, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT AND

TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO NEW ENGINES THAT INCREASE RELIABILITY. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED 64 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES IN 2005, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, CARRIERS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT

AND, IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS IN SEASONAL PERIODS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY

THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES

FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. IF WE OR ONE OF OUR

BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), WE COULD BE SUSPENDED FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD COULD BE VOIDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE U.S. COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR EXPORT PRIVILEGES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH 61 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL 2005 SEGMENT REVENUES, INCLUDING U.S. EXPORT SALES, DERIVED FROM OPERATIONS

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND IN EXPORT MARKETS AND AFFECT REPORTED PROFITS OF OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES) WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN

LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE

TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN

CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION, EXCHANGE CONTROLS,

EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL

TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR TO THE AWARDING OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE US TO AGREE TO

OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF

OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA RUSSIA AND SOUTH AFRICA, WHICH CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK. WHILE THESE FACTORS OR THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

OUR RELIANCE ON

FOREIGN SUPPLIERS AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY

MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS

TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES OR THE UNAVAILABILITY

OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS

WE SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. IN

THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR

ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ASSETS AND PERSONNEL ACQUIRED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, APPLY OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AND COOPERATE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH

OUR OPERATIONS, AND IN MANAGING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE, OR TIMING, OF BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS

OUR RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. AS REQUIRED BY GAAP, WE ESTIMATE MATERIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND ESTABLISH RESERVES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CONTINGENCIES WHERE LIABILITY IS DEEMED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN LIGHT

OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN TO US AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY AFFECT OUR ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATES OF THE LOSS CONTINGENCY RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OR AS A RESERVE AGAINST ASSETS IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT LEGAL

FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON PRODUCTION FACILITIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FIXED ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND THE FACILITIES IN OPERATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE

SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED THEREIN IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR THEIR PRESENT INTENDED PURPOSES. UTILIZATION OF THE FACILITIES VARIES BASED ON DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS. WE

CONTINUOUSLY REVIEW OUR ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES AND, BASED ON THAT REVIEW, MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST OUR FACILITY NEEDS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, WE ARE IN LITIGATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) AS TO WHETHER PRATT & WHITNEYS GOVERNMENT COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR ENGINE PARTS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES UNDER COMMERCIAL ENGINE COLLABORATION

PROGRAMS SINCE 1984 ARE ACCEPTABLE. IN 2001, THE ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS (ASBCA) RULED IN OUR FAVOR, BUT THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT REVERSED IN 2003 AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE ASBCA TO DETERMINE THE

APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO REVIEW THAT DECISION. IN NOVEMBER 2003, THE DOD SUPPLEMENTED ITS CLAIM TO ADD DAMAGES AND INTEREST FOR THE PERIOD AFTER 1996, BRINGING DODS CLAIM TO APPROXIMATELY $367 MILLION IN

DAMAGES THROUGH 2002 AND APPROXIMATELY $388 MILLION IN INTEREST THROUGH 2001. OUR APPEAL OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL MATTER.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) SUED US IN 1999 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

OF OHIO, CLAIMING THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND COMMON LAW. THIS LAWSUIT RELATES TO THE FIGHTER ENGINE COMPETITION BETWEEN PRATT & WHITNEYS F100 ENGINE AND GES F110 ENGINE. THE

DOJ ALLEGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERPAID FOR F100 ENGINES UNDER CONTRACTS AWARDED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE IN FISCAL YEARS 1985 THROUGH 1990 BECAUSE PRATT & WHITNEY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATED COSTS FOR SOME PURCHASED PARTS AND WITHHELD DATA THAT

WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE OVERSTATEMENTS. TREBLE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM COULD BE ASSESSED IF THE COURT FINDS THAT PRATT & WHITNEY VIOLATED THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT, AND COMMON LAW DAMAGES WOULD ACCRUE

PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST. TRIAL OF THIS MATTER WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2004. AT TRIAL, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED PRATT & WHITNEYS LIABILITY IS $624 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ESTIMATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSTATED, DENIED ANY LIABILITY

AND VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED AGAINST THE DOJS CLAIMS. A DECISION IS EXPECTED IN 2006.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY PREVAIL WITH RESPECT TO EITHER OF THE FOREGOING GOVERNMENT CONTRACT

MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE OUTCOME COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THESE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A QUI TAM RELATOR FILED A COMPLAINT IN JULY 1997 AGAINST US AND OUR SUBSIDIARY, NORDEN SYSTEMS,

INC., IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN CONNECTICUT (

U.S. EX REL. DRAKE V. NORDEN SYSTEMS, INC. AND UTC

, NO. 394CV00963) ALLEGING THAT WE AND NORDEN ARE LIABLE UNDER THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT FOR VIOLATING U.S. GOVERNMENT RULES ON

ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED ASSETS. THE QUI TAM RELATOR CLAIMED UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND PENALTIES. THE DOJ DECLINED TO INTERVENE. IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE FOR LACK OF PROSECUTION AND THE RELATOR APPEALED.

IN JULY 2004, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST US, BUT REMANDED CERTAIN OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST NORDEN BACK TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROVIDES

FOR TREBLE DAMAGES AND PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER FALSE CLAIM SUBMITTED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE NUMBER OF FALSE CLAIMS, IF ANY, IMPLICATED BY THE REMAINING CLAIMS CANNOT CURRENTLY BE ASCERTAINED; HOWEVER, IF DETERMINED ADVERSELY TO NORDEN,

THE NUMBER COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES AND PENALTIES, WHICH WE MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO PAY. WE BELIEVE THE CLAIMS AGAINST NORDEN ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND CONTINUE TO DEFEND THIS MATTER VIGOROUSLY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS COMPETITION

DIRECTORATE (THE EU COMMISSION) CONDUCTED INSPECTIONS IN EARLY 2004 AT OFFICES OF OUR OTIS SUBSIDIARY IN BERLIN, BRUSSELS, LUXEMBOURG AND PARIS RELATING TO AN INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE UNLAWFUL COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING THE

EUROPEAN ELEVATOR AND ESCALATOR INDUSTRY. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OTIS EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES AT A LOCAL LEVEL IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG, THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY IN VIOLATION OF OTIS AND

UTC POLICIES AND EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW. ON OCTOBER 13, 2005, WE RECEIVED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS FROM THE EU COMMISSION RELATING TO THIS INVESTIGATION. THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS, AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT, ALLEGES INFRINGEMENTS OF EU

COMPETITION RULES BY CERTAIN ELEVATOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING OTIS, IN BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG, THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY. WE ARE CAREFULLY REVIEWING THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS AND WILL RESPOND TIMELY TO THE EU COMMISSION. AS WE HAVE FROM THE START, WE

CONTINUE TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE EU COMMISSION. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, WE BELIEVE IT IS STILL TOO EARLY IN THE EU COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION FOR US TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF CIVIL FINES TO WHICH WE OR OTIS WOULD LIKELY BE

SUBJECT. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH FINES, IF ULTIMATELY IMPOSED, COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE FINES WOULD BE PAID. WE DO NOT BELIEVE

THAT ANY SUCH FINES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OTIS COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SINCE THE EU COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION BECAME PUBLIC, CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED IN VARIOUS FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES ALLEGING THAT WE, OTIS AND OTHER ELEVATOR MANUFACTURERS ENGAGED IN VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE SHERMAN ACT. THOSE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO AND

CONSOLIDATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE LAWSUITS DO NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE THE RESULT OF PRESS REPORTS ABOUT THE EU COMMISSIONS INVESTIGATION. WE

BELIEVE THAT THE LAWSUITS ARE DEVOID OF MERIT AND WILL DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN DECEMBER 2003, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) EXECUTED A SEARCH WARRANT AT HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND, SEEKING RECORDS AND DATA REGARDING THE PROCESSES FOR MONITORING, TREATING,

TESTING AND DISCHARGING WASTEWATER AT HAMILTON SUNDSTRANDS WINDSOR LOCKS, CONNECTICUT MANUFACTURING FACILITY. HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND HAS ALSO RECEIVED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME MATTER FROM THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. SEVERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND JURY, AND HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND ALSO RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FOR RECORDS. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS, HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND HAS REVIEWED

THE OPERATIONS OF THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY, MODIFIED THE PHYSICAL PLANT AND IMPROVED OPERATING PROCEDURES. HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND CONTINUES TO COOPERATE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS IN THE INVESTIGATION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, CARRIER REACHED AN

AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA TO RESOLVE ITS CURRENT LIABILITY AT THE PUENTE VALLEY OPERABLE UNIT SUPERFUND SITE IN CALIFORNIA. IN AUGUST 2005, THE AGREEMENT WAS FINALIZED AND INCORPORATED IN A PROPOSED CONSENT DECREE THAT IS PENDING APPROVAL BY THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER THIS PROPOSED CONSENT DECREE, CARRIER WOULD PAY APPROXIMATELY $125,000 AND UNDERTAKE AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY $500,000, IN SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS FOR CIVIL PENALTIES

RELATED TO ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER. IN ADDITION, CARRIER WOULD PAY A PORTION OF THE EPAS UNREIMBURSED PAST COSTS FOR THE SITE AND UNDERTAKE A PORTION OF THE INTERIM REMEDY EPA SELECTED FOR THE SITE. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT THESE COSTS ARE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR WITHIN THE TOTAL AMOUNT RESERVED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION NOTED UNDER THE HEADING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT AND THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION RECENTLY CONDUCTED AN INSPECTION AT THE OFFICE OF OTIS KOREAN SUBSIDIARY IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF

POSSIBLE UNLAWFUL COLLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE KOREAN ELEVATOR INDUSTRY. BASED ON THE

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTS OF OUR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, WE BELIEVE THAT SOME EMPLOYEES AT THIS SUBSIDIARY ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES AT A LOCAL LEVEL IN VIOLATION OF OTIS AND UTC

POLICIES AND KOREAN COMPETITION LAW. WE ARE COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY FINES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED WILL BE MATERIAL TO UTC OR HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON OTIS COMPETITIVE POSITION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, LIKE MANY OTHER COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS, WE OR OUR

SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS INTEGRATED INTO CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES. WHILE WE HAVE NEVER MANUFACTURED ASBESTOS AND NO LONGER INCORPORATE IT IN ANY

CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS, CERTAIN OF OUR HISTORICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE THOSE OF MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS, HAVE CONTAINED COMPONENTS INCORPORATING ASBESTOS. WE HAVE MADE NO PAYMENT IN A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE CASES CLOSED TO DATE. THE

REMAINDER OF THE RESOLVED CASES HAVE SETTLED FOR AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO US, AND HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN PART BY INSURANCE. AT PRESENT, WE ARE NAMED IN APPROXIMATELY 2,270 LAWSUITS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 20,100 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS. IN OUR

REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE REPORTED THAT APPROXIMATELY 18,000 WERE THEN JOINED IN LAWSUITS IN MISSISSIPPI STATE COURTS. TYPICALLY, THESE MISSISSIPPI LAWSUITS NAMED FROM 200 TO 400 OTHER COMPANIES AS

DEFENDANTS ALONG WITH US OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPLAINTS DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, OR SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLAINTS DID NOT ALLEGE WHICH CLAIMANTS, IF ANY, WERE

EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR PRODUCTS OR PREMISES, NOR THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH SUCH CLAIMANTS HAD BEEN HARMED. SINCE OUR PREVIOUS REPORT, AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE LAW GOVERNING JOINDER AND PLEADING IN MISSISSIPPI, APPROXIMATELY

5,700 MISSISSIPPI CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE FEDERAL MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION ASBESTOS DOCKET IN PENNSYLVANIA. MANY OTHER CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND REQUIRED TO FILE CLAIMS, IF THEY CAN, THAT ALLEGE MORE

SPECIFICALLY THE CLAIMANTS EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS AND THE RESULTING HARM. AT PRESENT, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS IN MISSISSIPPI IS APPROXIMATELY 6,300.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED ABOVE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THE LEGAL MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE  COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ITEM 1 BUSINESS AND IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN THIS FORM 10-K.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

NO MATTERS WERE SUBMITTED TO SECURITY HOLDERS FOR A VOTE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

AS REQUIRED BY RULE 13A-15 UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, WE CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE VICE PRESIDENT, ACCOUNTING AND

CONTROL AND THE VICE PRESIDENT, FINANCE, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY SYSTEM OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING

THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN ERROR AND THE CIRCUMVENTION OR OVERRIDING OF THE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. ACCORDINGLY, EVEN EFFECTIVE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES CAN ONLY PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THEIR CONTROL OBJECTIVES. BASED UPON

OUR EVALUATION, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, OUR VICE PRESIDENT, ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL AND OUR VICE PRESIDENT, FINANCE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO

BE DISCLOSED BY US IN THE REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED, WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE APPLICABLE RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT IT IS ACCUMULATED AND

COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, OUR VICE PRESIDENT, ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL AND OUR VICE PRESIDENT, FINANCE, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. OUR MANAGEMENT

HAS ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN MAKING ITS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS (COSO) OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. OUR MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH APPEARS

IN OUR 2005 ANNUAL REPORT.

THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
