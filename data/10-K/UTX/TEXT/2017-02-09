TABLE OF CONTENTS

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS.  IN ADDITION, PRATT & WHITNEY HAS INTERESTS IN OTHER ENGINE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING A 50 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE ENGINE ALLIANCE (EA), A JOINT VENTURE WITH GE AVIATION, WHICH MARKETS AND MANUFACTURES THE GP7000 ENGINE FOR THE AIRBUS A380 AIRCRAFT.

PRATT & WHITNEY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INTERESTS IN THE EA JOINT VENTURE UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. PRATT & WHITNEY CONTINUES TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL COLLABORATION PARTNERS.

PRATT & WHITNEY HOLDS A NET 61 PERCENT PROGRAM SHARE INTEREST IN THE IAE INTERNATIONAL AERO ENGINES AG (IAE) COLLABORATION WITH MTU AERO ENGINES AG (MTU) AND JAPANESE AERO ENGINES CORPORATION (JAEC). AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN JUNE 2012, ROLLS-ROYCE SOLD ITS COLLABORATION INTEREST IN IAE TO PRATT & WHITNEY, WHILE ALSO ENTERING INTO AN AGREEMENT TO LICENSE ITS V2500 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO PRATT & WHITNEY. ROLLS-ROYCE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM AS A STRATEGIC SUPPLIER FOR THE V2500 ENGINE AND CONTINUES TO MANUFACTURE PARTS AND ASSEMBLE ENGINES.  PRATT & WHITNEY ALSO HOLDS A 59 PERCENT PROGRAM SHARE INTEREST IN THE INTERNATIONAL AERO ENGINES, LLC (IAE LLC) COLLABORATION WITH MTU AND JAEC.  IAE LLC SELLS THE PW1100G-JM ENGINE FOR THE AIRBUS A320NEO AIRCRAFT AND THE PW1400G-JM ENGINE FOR THE IRKUT MC21 AIRCRAFT.

PRATT & WHITNEY IS UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S F-35 JOINT PROGRAM OFFICE TO PRODUCE, AND SUSTAIN THE F135 ENGINE, A DERIVATIVE OF PRATT & WHITNEY’S F119 ENGINE, TO POWER THE SINGLE-ENGINE F-35 LIGHTNING II AIRCRAFT (COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER) BEING PRODUCED BY LOCKHEED MARTIN. THE TWO F135 PROPULSION SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE F-35A/F-35C AND F-35B JETS ARE CERTIFIED FOR PRODUCTION AND IN USE BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND THE U.S. MARINE CORPS. F135 ENGINES ARE ALSO USED ON F-35 AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PARTNER COUNTRIES AND FOREIGN MILITARY SALES COUNTRIES.

IN ADDITION, PRATT & WHITNEY HAS DEVELOPED THE PUREPOWER® PW1000G GEARED TURBOFAN ENGINE WHICH ENTERED INTO SERVICE IN JANUARY 2016 AND IS INTENDED TO ENABLE IT TO POWER BOTH CURRENTLY-PROPOSED AND FUTURE AIRCRAFT. THE PUREPOWER® PW1000G ENGINE HAS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FUEL BURN AND NOISE LEVELS WITH LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS AND OPERATING COSTS THAN CURRENT PRODUCTION ENGINES. AIRBUS HAS SELECTED THE PW1100G-JM ENGINE, A MEMBER OF THE PUREPOWER® PW1000G ENGINE FAMILY, AS A NEW ENGINE OPTION TO POWER ITS A320NEO FAMILY OF AIRCRAFT, WHICH ENTERED INTO SERVICE IN JANUARY 2016. THE PW1100G-JM IS BEING PRODUCED AND SOLD AS PART OF A COLLABORATION WITH MTU AND JAEC. ADDITIONALLY, PUREPOWER® PW1000G ENGINE MODELS HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY BOMBARDIER TO POWER THE NEW CSERIES PASSENGER AIRCRAFT, MITSUBISHI AIRCRAFT CORPORATION TO POWER THE NEW MITSUBISHI REGIONAL JET, IRKUT CORPORATION TO POWER THE NEW IRKUT MC-21 PASSENGER AIRCRAFT AND EMBRAER TO POWER THE NEXT GENERATION OF EMBRAER’S E-JET FAMILY OF AIRCRAFT.  IN OCTOBER 2014, GULFSTREAM ANNOUNCED THE SELECTION OF THE PUREPOWER® PW 800 ENGINE TO EXCLUSIVELY POWER GULFSTREAM’S NEW G500 AND G600 BUSINESS JETS SCHEDULED TO ENTER SERVICE IN 2018. THE CSERIES (CS100) AIRCRAFT, DESIGNED TO CARRY 100 TO 133 PASSENGERS, WAS CERTIFIED IN DECEMBER 2015.  THE LARGER CSERIES (CS300) AIRCRAFT, DESIGNED TO CARRY UP TO 160 PASSENGERS, WAS CERTIFIED IN JULY 2016. THE IRKUT MC-21 AND EMBRAER’S NEXT GENERATION OF E-JET FAMILY AIRCRAFT ARE SCHEDULED TO ENTER SERVICE IN 2018. THE MITSUBISHI REGIONAL JET IS SCHEDULED TO ENTER SERVICE IN 2020. THE SUCCESS OF THESE AIRCRAFT AND THE PUREPOWER® FAMILY OF ENGINES IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRAM EXECUTION, AIRCRAFT DEMAND, AND REGULATORY APPROVAL. BASED ON THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF SUCCESS OF AIRCRAFT PROGRAM LAUNCHES BY AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS, ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE PUREPOWER® PROGRAM MAY BE REQUIRED. P&WC HAS DEVELOPED AND CERTIFIED THE PW210 ENGINE FAMILY FOR HELICOPTERS MANUFACTURED BY SIKORSKY AND LEONARDO HELICOPTERS. PRATT & WHITNEY CONTINUES TO ENHANCE ITS PROGRAMS THROUGH PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT MEASURES AND PRODUCT BASE EXPANSION.

PRATT & WHITNEY’S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS, AIRLINES AND OTHER AIRCRAFT OPERATORS, AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANIES AND THE U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. PRATT & WHITNEY’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MUST ADHERE TO STRICT REGULATORY AND MARKET-DRIVEN SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THE FREQUENTLY CHANGING NATURE OF THESE STANDARDS, ALONG WITH THE LONG DURATION OF AIRCRAFT ENGINE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS, CREATES UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ENGINE PROGRAM PROFITABILITY. SALES TO AIRBUS (PRATT & WHITNEY’S LARGEST CUSTOMER BY SALES) WERE 34 PERCENT AND 39 PERCENT OF TOTAL PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT SALES IN 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DISCOUNTS OR FINANCIAL INCENTIVES OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WERE 21 PERCENT OF TOTAL PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT SALES IN BOTH 2016 AND 2015.

SALES GENERATED BY PRATT & WHITNEY’S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING U.S. EXPORT SALES, WERE 63 PERCENT AND 60 PERCENT OF TOTAL PRATT & WHITNEY SEGMENT SALES IN 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, PRATT & WHITNEY’S BACKLOG WAS $61.8 BILLION, INCLUDING $6.4 BILLION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT-FUNDED CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THESE AMOUNTS WERE $52.5 BILLION AND $4.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OF THE TOTAL PRATT & WHITNEY BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, APPROXIMATELY $10.5 BILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED AS SALES IN 2017. PRATT & WHITNEY’S BACKLOG INCLUDES CERTAIN CONTRACTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL COSTS MAY ULTIMATELY EXCEED TOTAL SALES. PRATT & WHITNEY’S BACKLOG EXCLUDES ORDERS FOR NEW COMMERCIAL ENGINES THAT HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED AVIATION AUTHORITY ENGINE CERTIFICATION. THE PUREPOWER® PW1100G-JM ENGINE COMPLETED FEDERAL AVIATION AGENCY (FAA) CERTIFICATION FOR THE AIRBUS A320NEO PLATFORM ON DECEMBER 19, 2014 AND ENTERED INTO SERVICE IN JANUARY 2016. THE CSERIES (CS100) AIRCRAFT WAS CERTIFIED IN DECEMBER 2015, AND THE LARGER CSERIES (CS300)

OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE

COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES

AS WORLDWIDE BUSINESSES, OUR OPERATIONS CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION, IN "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" INCLUDED IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT, IN ITEM 1, "CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS," AND IN ITEM 1A, "RISK FACTORS" IN THIS FORM 10-K. EACH BUSINESS UNIT IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AND EACH COMPETES ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, DELIVERY SCHEDULE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE.

OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS, FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS (WHOSE GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, MARKETING SUBSIDIES AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR CERTAIN OF THEIR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS BEYOND THE ASSISTANCE THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE IN THE U.S.) AND COMPANIES THAT OBTAIN REGULATORY AGENCY APPROVAL TO MANUFACTURE SPARE PARTS. IN PARTICULAR, PRATT & WHITNEY EXPERIENCES INTENSE COMPETITION FOR NEW COMMERCIAL AIRFRAME/ENGINE COMBINATIONS. ENGINE SUPPLIERS MAY OFFER SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, AND PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, IN AN EFFORT TO COMPETE FOR THE AFTERMARKET ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ENGINES. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING CUSTOMER FINANCING COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATION IN GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING COST GUARANTEES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRATT & WHITNEY, SEE NOTES 5 AND 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT. CUSTOMER SELECTIONS OF ENGINES AND COMPONENTS CAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON LATER SALES OF PARTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT’S AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS’ POLICIES OF PURCHASING PARTS FROM SUPPLIERS OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AFFECT MILITARY SPARE PARTS SALES. SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, SUCH AS SPARE PARTS SALES FOR ENGINES AND AIRCRAFT IN SERVICE, HAVE SHORT LEAD TIMES. THEREFORE, BACKLOG INFORMATION MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE DEMAND. PRATT & WHITNEY’S MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE SALE OF ENGINES ARE GE AVIATION, HONEYWELL, TURBOMECA, AND CFM INTERNATIONAL.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION, WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF OUR OWN FUNDS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED, WERE $2.3 BILLION OR 4.1 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2016 AND 2015, AND $2.5 BILLION OR 4.3 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN 2014. WE ALSO PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK UNDER CONTRACTS FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. COSTS INCURRED UNDER THIS CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS PERFORMED IN OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, AMOUNTED TO $1.4 BILLION IN 2016, AS COMPARED TO $1.5 BILLION IN 2015 AND $2.0 BILLION IN 2014. THESE CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, THROUGH COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND AMOUNTS THAT ARE CAPITALIZED INTO INVENTORY TO BE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOVERED THROUGH PRODUCTION SHIPMENTS. TOTAL CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $1.4 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION WERE EXPENSED THROUGH COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

CONTRACTING WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENTAILS CERTAIN UNIQUE RISKS. U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT IN THE EVENT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IN THE CASE OF A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WE WOULD NORMALLY BE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR ALLOWABLE COSTS INCURRED, PLUS TERMINATION COSTS AND A REASONABLE PROFIT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. MOST OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES ARE MADE UNDER FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OR 3 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR 2016 WERE MADE UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT TYPE CONTRACTS.

OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS, WHICH RECOMMEND THAT CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES SHOULD BE REDUCED, OR THAT CERTAIN PAYMENTS SHOULD BE DELAYED OR WITHHELD, TO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, INCLUDING REPORTS ALLEGING THAT COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.  SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS. WE HAVE MADE VOLUNTARY REFUNDS IN THOSE CASES WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, HAVE SETTLED SOME ALLEGATIONS AND, IN SOME CASES, CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND/OR LITIGATE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING, ITEM 1A, "RISK FACTORS" AND ITEM 3, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS," IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WITH JURISDICTION OVER OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE HAVE INCURRED AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO INCUR LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT STATUTES FOR THE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT OR THAT ANY PAYMENTS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE FOR CLEANUP LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CASH FLOWS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE FURTHER ADDRESSED IN "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" AND NOTES 1 AND 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT.

MOST OF THE U.S. LAWS GOVERNING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. IF WE WERE CONVICTED OF A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT OR CLEAN WATER ACT, THE FACILITY OR FACILITIES INVOLVED IN THE VIOLATION WOULD BE INELIGIBLE TO BE USED IN PERFORMING ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WE ARE AWARDED UNTIL THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THEREAFTER CERTIFIES THAT THE CONDITION GIVING RISE TO THE VIOLATION HAD BEEN CORRECTED.

IN ADDITION, WE COULD BE AFFECTED BY FUTURE LAWS OR REGULATIONS IMPOSED IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS OVER CLIMATE CHANGE. CHANGES IN CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS, OR IN THE REGULATION OF SUCH CONCERNS, INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASED ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COSTS.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES WORLDWIDE. CHANGES IN LEGISLATION OR GOVERNMENT POLICIES CAN AFFECT OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF REFRIGERANTS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND FIRE SAFETY REGULATIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR UTC CLIMATE, CONTROLS & SECURITY BUSINESSES, AND ELEVATOR SAFETY CODES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE BUSINESSES OF OTIS, WHILE GOVERNMENT SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REGULATIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON AIRCRAFT ENGINE NOISE AND EMISSIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT PRACTICES CAN IMPACT OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES.

U.S. LAWS, REGULATIONS, ORDERS, AND OTHER MEASURES CONCERNING THE EXPORT OR RE-EXPORT OF PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY TO, AND OTHER TRADE-RELATED ACTIVITIES INVOLVING, NON-U.S. COUNTRIES AND PARTIES AFFECT THE OPERATIONS OF UTC AND ITS AFFILIATES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

WE MAINTAIN A PORTFOLIO OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE TAKEN REASONABLE MEASURES TO PROTECT THIS PORTFOLIO, OUR EFFORTS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.  SEE ITEM 1A "RISK FACTORS" IN THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SOURCES FOR OUR PURCHASES OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING. WE WORK CONTINUOUSLY WITH OUR SUPPLY BASE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND TO REDUCE COSTS. WE PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING OUR PURCHASES, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, STRATEGIC GLOBAL SOURCING AND USING BIDDING COMPETITIONS AMONG POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. LIKE OTHER USERS IN THE U.S., WE ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN SOURCES FOR CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS COBALT, TANTALUM, CHROMIUM, RHENIUM AND NICKEL. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ONGOING PROGRAMS TO MANAGE THIS DEPENDENCE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RISK, INCLUDING LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSERVATION OF MATERIALS THROUGH SCRAP RECLAMATION AND NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH AT TIMES HIGH PRICES FOR SOME RAW MATERIALS IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESSES (FOR EXAMPLE, STEEL, COPPER, ALUMINUM, TITANIUM AND NICKEL) HAVE CAUSED MARGIN AND COST PRESSURES, WE DO NOT FORESEE NEAR TERM UNAVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, COMPONENTS OR SUPPLIES THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS ON OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A, "RISK FACTORS" IN THIS FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WAS APPROXIMATELY 202,000, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 68 PERCENT REPRESENTS EMPLOYEES BASED OUTSIDE THE U.S. DURING 2016, WE NEGOTIATED OR CONCLUDED

EIGHT DOMESTIC COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVERED CERTAIN WORKERS AT PRATT & WHITNEY’S FACILITIES IN EAST HARTFORD AND MIDDLETOWN, CONNECTICUT. IN 2017, NUMEROUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION, THE LARGEST OF WHICH COVERS CERTAIN WORKERS AT OTIS ACROSS THE U.S.  ALTHOUGH SOME PREVIOUS CONTRACT RENEGOTIATIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE RENEGOTIATION OF THESE CONTRACTS IN 2017 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT, SEE ITEM 1A, "RISK FACTORS" IN THIS FORM 10-K AND UNDER "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" AND NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR GLOBAL GROWTH MAY BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC, CAPITAL MARKET AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS, INCLUDING CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, LEVELS OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, COMMODITY PRICES, EXCHANGE RATES, LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND DEFICITS, TRADE POLICIES, POLITICAL CONDITIONS, ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED DEFAULT ON SOVEREIGN DEBT AND OTHER CHALLENGES THAT COULD AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  THESE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. TIGHTENING OF CREDIT IN FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES AND OPERATIONS AND COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS. SIMILARLY, SUCH TIGHTENING OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SUPPLIER BASE AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR ONE OR MORE OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR BANKRUPTCY. OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECREASES IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DECREASES IN BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SPENDING, AIR TRAVEL, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF AIRLINES AND BUSINESS JET OPERATORS, AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY

50

PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SALES IN

2016

, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, REGULATORY CHANGES, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS, GLOBAL CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SLOWDOWN IN BUILDING AND REMODELING ACTIVITY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OTIS AND UTC CLIMATE, CONTROLS & SECURITY. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF UTC CLIMATE, CONTROLS & SECURITY CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND, PARTICULARLY IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY

50

PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SALES IN

2016

, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE. CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEMAND FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINES, AEROSPACE PRODUCTS AND COMPONENT AFTERMARKET PARTS AND SERVICE BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, AIRCRAFT OPERATORS AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS ARE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS, AIRLINE CONSOLIDATION, BANKRUPTCIES, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CORPORATE PROFITABILITY, COST REDUCTION EFFORTS AND BACKLOG LEVELS.  ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE THE SALES AND MARGINS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES. OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIONS, PANDEMIC HEALTH ISSUES OR MAJOR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD ALSO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE SALES AND MARGINS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND

2017

, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. AT TIMES, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ALSO ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO BEAR COST OVERRUNS RELATED TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL AND DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT ARISE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT AND EARLY PRODUCTION STAGES OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS.  SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS, INCLUDING USAGE, PRICING, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATORY CHANGES AND THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING U.S. AND GLOBAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFICIT REDUCTION MEASURES, CONGRESSIONAL AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH DISPUTES OVER BUDGETS AND DEBT CEILINGS AND THE IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION HAVE INCREASED MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR MILITARY BUSINESSES.  SHOULD THESE FACTORS CONTINUE AND OVERALL U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE SPENDING DECLINE, IT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, CASH FLOW, PROFIT AND BACKLOG FOR OUR MILITARY BUSINESSES.  ONE OR MORE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY SUPPORT OR ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING COULD BE PHASED-OUT, LIMITED OR TERMINATED.  REDUCTIONS IN THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS, UNLESS OFFSET BY OTHER PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY

61

PERCENT OF OUR

2016

TOTAL SEGMENT SALES DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING U.S. EXPORT SALES. CHANGES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES, MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND AND REPORTED PROFITS IN OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (ESPECIALLY THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES AND P&W CANADA), WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING MARGINS ALSO MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WORLDWIDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS FOR CERTAIN CROSS BORDER TRANSACTIONS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MAJORITY OF SALES IN THE AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHILE THE MAJORITY OF COSTS AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE INCURRED IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY (PRINCIPALLY THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, AND THE POLISH ZLOTY). FOR OPERATING UNITS WITH U.S. DOLLAR SALES AND LOCAL CURRENCY COSTS, THERE IS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. TO MANAGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES, WE EMPLOY LONG-TERM HEDGING STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR SALES. SEE NOTES 1 AND 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENTS SUCH AS IMPORT QUOTAS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, PUNITIVE TAXES OR TARIFFS, WHETHER ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTS OR ADDRESSED BY REGIONAL TRADE BLOCS, CAN AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PREVENT US FROM BEING ABLE TO MANUFACTURE OR SELL PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES.  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MORE RESTRICTIVE TRADE POLICIES OR THE RENEGOTIATION OF EXISTING TRADE AGREEMENTS IN THE U.S. OR COUNTRIES WHERE WE SELL LARGE QUANTITIES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR PROCURE SUPPLIES AND OTHER MATERIALS INCORPORATED INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  FOR EXAMPLE, A GOVERNMENT'S ADOPTION OF "BUY NATIONAL" POLICIES OR RETALIATION BY ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGAINST SUCH POLICIES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS.

IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, INDONESIA, MEXICO, POLAND, RUSSIA, SOUTH AFRICA AND COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL, COMPLIANCE AND ECONOMIC RISK.  WE EXPECT THAT SALES TO EMERGING MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES AS OUR BUSINESSES EVOLVE AND AS THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS AND REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCREASE THEIR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.  EMERGING MARKET OPERATIONS CAN PRESENT MANY RISKS, INCLUDING CULTURAL DIFFERENCES (SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS PRACTICES), VOLATILITY IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, ECONOMIC AND GOVERNMENT INSTABILITY, AND THE IMPOSITION OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CAPITAL CONTROLS.  WHILE THESE FACTORS AND THEIR IMPACT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MORE OF THEM COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER-PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS) AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS. IN MANY INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING, LOGISTICS SUPPORT OR ASSEMBLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, SUPPLIER QUALITY ISSUES, CLOSING OR BANKRUPTCY OF OUR SUPPLIERS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH, OR DISPOSING OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES FROM, OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES.

WE SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN ADDITION TO INTERNAL GROWTH. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. OUR DUE DILIGENCE REVIEWS MAY NOT IDENTIFY ALL OF THE MATERIAL ISSUES NECESSARY TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE COST AND POTENTIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, INCLUDING POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO REGULATORY SANCTIONS RESULTING FROM AN ACQUISITION TARGET’S PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED COSTS, EXPENSES OR OTHER LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF AN ACQUISITION TARGET’S VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS, SUCH AS THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA) OR  OTHER ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION LAWS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.  WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING POST-CLOSING ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ELIMINATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES, LITIGATION, AND OTHER LIABILITIES. WE ALSO MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, APPLYING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, OR IN MANAGING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT TO EXPENSE CERTAIN ACQUISITION COSTS AS INCURRED, MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR GREATER EARNINGS VOLATILITY AND GENERALLY LOWER EARNINGS DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE ACQUIRE NEW BUSINESSES. FURTHERMORE, WE MAKE STRATEGIC DIVESTITURES FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS OR CONTINUED SUPPLY AND SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NONPERFORMANCE BY THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OBLIGATIONS BEING IMPOSED ON US THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE SUCCESS OF FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES WILL DEPEND ON THE SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO, AND CONSUMMATION OF, THE PENDING TRANSACTIONS, THE TIMING OF CONSUMMATION OF THESE PENDING TRANSACTIONS, AND THE ABILITY OF THE PARTIES TO SECURE ANY REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

OUR DEBT LEVELS AND RELATED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES; OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR OUTLOOK OR OUR CREDIT RATINGS.

WE HAVE OUTSTANDING DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY.  OUR DEBT LEVEL AND RELATED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS.

•

REQUIRING US TO DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR DEBT, WHICH WOULD REDUCE FUNDS WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS, REINVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESSES, DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK;

•

REDUCING OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR OR REACTING TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND MARKET CONDITIONS; AND

•

EXPOSING US TO INTEREST RATE RISK BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE AT VARIABLE RATES.

WE DEPEND, IN PART, UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS. IF WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN ORDER TO FUND OUTSTANDING FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR MEET OTHER BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, OUR MARKET LIQUIDITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.  A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR INCREASED BORROWING COSTS AND TO HAVE GREATER

DIFFICULTY ACCESSING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKETS FOR DEBT, INCLUDING DISRUPTIONS OR DECLINES IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND/OR A DECLINE IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS.

QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED OR MODIFIED, ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES AND MAY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM CONSTITUTE COMPONENTS OF OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY, WHICH WE FUND WITH FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, BORROWINGS AND DIVESTITURES. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS OR MAKE ANY SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED, ACCELERATED, SUSPENDED OR DELAYED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. EVEN IF NOT DISCONTINUED, THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES MAY BE CHANGED, AND THE AMOUNT, TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF SUCH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES MAY VARY FROM HISTORICAL PRACTICE OR FROM THE COMPANY’S STATED EXPECTATIONS. DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL BE BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO DISCONTINUE, LIMIT, SUSPEND, INCREASE OR DELAY OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS OR SHARE REPURCHASES INCLUDE MARKET CONDITIONS, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, THE NATURE AND TIMING OF OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THE TERMS OF OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, OUR OUTLOOK AS TO THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING AT ATTRACTIVE RATES, THE IMPACT ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF DOMESTIC CASH.

THE REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF OUR CASH DIVIDEND OR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  ADDITIONALLY, REPURCHASES OF OUR SHARES WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SHARE REPURCHASES WILL ENHANCE SHAREHOLDER VALUE BECAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE BELOW THE LEVELS AT WHICH WE REPURCHASED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. ALTHOUGH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE, SHORT-TERM STOCK PRICE FLUCTUATIONS COULD REDUCE THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS.

SEE ITEM 5, "MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES" IN THIS FORM 10-K FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND PAST SHARE REPURCHASES, INCLUDING OUR PRIOR ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (ASR) TRANSACTIONS.

WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES; THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVES RISKS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED.

WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, SALE AND SUPPORT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. THE PRODUCT, PROGRAM AND SERVICE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGE AND EVOLVE REGULARLY, AND WE INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO PURSUE ADVANCEMENTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OF PARTICULAR NOTE, PRATT & WHITNEY IS CURRENTLY PRODUCING THE PUREPOWER® PW1000G GEARED TURBOFAN ENGINE TO POWER VARIOUS AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING THE A320NEO FAMILY OF AIRCRAFT, WHICH ENTERED INTO SERVICE IN JANUARY 2016. THE LEVEL OF ORDERS RECEIVED FOR THE PUREPOWER® FAMILY OF ENGINES COUPLED WITH A REQUIREMENT TO ACHIEVE MATURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IN A VERY SHORT TIMEFRAME ARE NECESSITATING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN CAPACITY. IF OUR PRODUCTION RAMP-UP EFFORTS ARE DELAYED OR IF SUPPLIERS CANNOT TIMELY DELIVER OR PERFORM TO OUR STANDARDS, WE MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMERS’ PRODUCTION SCHEDULES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS, INCLUDING PENALTIES THAT COULD BE ASSESSED UNDER EXISTING CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES; EXECUTION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIER AND INTERNALLY-PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS; HIRING AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES; IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS IN OUR TARGET END-MARKETS; VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES; THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS; AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE TECHNOLOGIES WE DEVELOP. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO LARGER SYSTEMS AND END PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  THESE SYSTEMS AND END PRODUCTS MAY INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES MANUFACTURED BY THIRD PARTIES AND INVOLVE ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AS A RESULT, THE PERFORMANCE AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE LARGER SYSTEMS AND END PRODUCTS COULD AFFECT THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.

ANY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS DIVERT RESOURCES FROM OTHER POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AS FULLY AS COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE OUR TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT DEVELOP OR GROW AS WE ANTICIPATE. WE OR OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS OR SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED OR MAY OTHERWISE SUFFER SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES. DUE TO THE DESIGN COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN COMPLETING THE DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS. ANY DELAYS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED DEVELOPMENT COSTS OR DEFLECT RESOURCES FROM OTHER PROJECTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN AND IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHAT QUANTITIES OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES WILL PRODUCE AND SELL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED CERTIFICATIONS. OUR CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY AWARDED ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE COST TO PROVIDE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. TO GENERATE AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE CONTRACTS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE OUR COSTS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND DELIVER THE PRODUCTS REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE OUR COSTS OR THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A CONTRACT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM AND DELIVER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS AND SCHEDULE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY FACE CUSTOMER DIRECTED COST REDUCTION TARGETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS.  FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR COMPETITORS WILL NOT DEVELOP COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE IN ADVANCE OF OR INSTEAD OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGY OR OFFERINGS THAT MIGHT CAUSE OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS TO BECOME OBSOLETE.  IN ADDITION, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT COMPETITORS WILL DEVELOP AFTERMARKET SERVICES AND AFTERMARKET PARTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS WHICH ATTRACT CUSTOMERS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON NEW PRODUCTS.  ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS.

MOST OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS.  WHILE FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS ENABLE US TO BENEFIT FROM PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS, COST REDUCTIONS AND EFFICIENCIES, THEY ALSO SUBJECT US TO THE RISK OF REDUCED MARGINS OR LOSSES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE ESTIMATED COSTS AND REVENUES.  U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. SUCH U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OFTEN TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE AND COULD RESULT IN ADMINISTRATIVE, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITIES, INCLUDING REPAYMENTS, FINES, TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES, FORFEITURES, RESTITUTION OR PENALTIES, OR COULD LEAD TO SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR OF EXPORT PRIVILEGES.  FOR INSTANCE, IF  WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD FINE AND DEBAR US FROM NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED THREE YEARS. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD.  OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS, WHICH RECOMMEND THAT CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES SHOULD BE REDUCED TO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, INCLUDING BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, OR THAT CERTAIN PAYMENTS BE DELAYED OR WITHHELD.  SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS.

EXPORTS OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS EXPORT CONTROL REGULATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE,

OR

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY OR REGULATORY AGENCIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES.

AS AN EXPORTER, WE MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE EXPORT OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY FROM THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVING JURISDICTION OVER OUR OPERATIONS. IN THE U.S., THESE LAWS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE U.S. EXPORT ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS (EAR) ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY, THE INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ARMS REGULATIONS (ITAR) ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, DIRECTORATE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS AND TRADE SANCTIONS REGULATIONS AND EMBARGOES ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL. CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE MILITARY OR STRATEGIC APPLICATIONS AND ARE ON THE MUNITIONS LIST OF THE ITAR

AND THE COMMERCE CONTROL LIST OF THE EAR, OR REPRESENT SO-CALLED "DUAL USE" ITEMS GOVERNED BY THE EAR. AS A RESULT, THESE PRODUCTS MAY

REQUIRE

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TO BE EXPORTED TO CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. ANY FAILURES BY US OR OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES, FINES, INVESTIGATIONS, ADVERSE PUBLICITY OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPORT OUR PRODUCTS, AND REPEAT FAILURES COULD CARRY MORE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES. ANY CHANGES IN EXPORT OR SANCTIONS REGULATIONS MAY FURTHER RESTRICT THE EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED BY THE LICENSING PROCESSES CAN VARY, POTENTIALLY DELAYING THE SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE CORRESPONDING REVENUE.  ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT LINES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL, PRODUCT SAFETY AND OTHER LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POSSIBLE LIABILITY RELATING TO PRODUCT SAFETY, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONTRACT-RELATED CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS, COMPETITION LAWS AND LAWS GOVERNING IMPROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF SUCH MATTERS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS, OTHER DAMAGES (IN CERTAIN CASES, TREBLE DAMAGES). AS A GLOBAL BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE INTERPRETED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THEY MAY ALSO CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AS MAY RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER GUIDANCE. CHANGES IN LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EXPENSES AND PAYMENTS, AND UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY ALSO AFFECT HOW WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AND STRUCTURE OUR INVESTMENTS AND COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, INCLUDING LAWS RELATING TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD LEAD TO NEW OR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN PRODUCT DESIGNS AND COULD INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE EXPENDITURES. CHANGES IN CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS, OR IN THE REGULATION OF SUCH CONCERNS, INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COSTS.

AT TIMES WE ARE INVOLVED IN DISPUTES WITH PRIVATE PARTIES OVER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, INCLUDING LITIGATION OVER ALLOCATION OF CLEANUP COSTS, ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES AND ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE. PERSONAL INJURY LAWSUITS MAY INVOLVE INDIVIDUAL AND PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGING THAT CONTAMINANTS ORIGINATING FROM OUR OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES’ CURRENT OR FORMER OPERATING FACILITIES CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CANCERS INCURRED BY EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES OR RESIDENTS IN THE AREA AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE OR DIMINUTION OF REAL ESTATE VALUES. EVEN IN LITIGATION WHERE WE BELIEVE OUR LIABILITY IS REMOTE, THERE IS A RISK THAT A NEGATIVE FINDING OR DECISION IN A MATTER INVOLVING MULTIPLE PLAINTIFFS OR A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN REGIONS WHERE WE HAVE, OR PREVIOUSLY HAD, SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS. PRODUCT RECALLS AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS (INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SAFETY OR RELIABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS) ALSO CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS, INCLUDING FINES, AS WELL AS NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, MANAGEMENT DISTRACTION AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION THAT COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2016 ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ADDITION, THE FCPA AND OTHER ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION LAWS GENERALLY PROHIBIT COMPANIES AND THEIR INTERMEDIARIES FROM MAKING IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO NON-U.S. OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING BUSINESS. THE FCPA APPLIES TO COMPANIES, INDIVIDUAL DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. UNDER THE FCPA, U.S. COMPANIES MAY BE HELD LIABLE FOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY STRATEGIC OR LOCAL PARTNERS OR REPRESENTATIVES. THE FCPA ALSO IMPOSES ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS ON PUBLICLY TRADED U.S. CORPORATIONS AND THEIR FOREIGN AFFILIATES, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PREVENT THE DIVERSION OF CORPORATE FUNDS TO THE PAYMENT OF BRIBES AND OTHER IMPROPER PAYMENTS. CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. ARE WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE FCPA AND OTHER ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION LAWS. OUR POLICIES MANDATE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION LAWS. DESPITE MEANINGFUL MEASURES THAT WE UNDERTAKE TO SEEK TO ENSURE LAWFUL CONDUCT, WHICH INCLUDE TRAINING AND INTERNAL CONTROL POLICIES, THESE MEASURES MAY NOT ALWAYS PREVENT OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS FROM VIOLATING THE FCPA OR SIMILAR LAWS. AS A RESULT, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES, DISGORGEMENT, FURTHER CHANGES OR ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR PROCEDURES, POLICIES AND CONTROLS, PERSONNEL CHANGES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS, OR ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH VIOLATIONS, COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT DISTRACTION AND RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE OR ADDITIONAL TAX EXPOSURES COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES AND CONFLICTS IN RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER TAX GUIDANCE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR TAX RECEIVABLES AND LIABILITIES AND OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATIONS BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING TAX AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION TO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS LAUNCHED IN THE FUTURE BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, AND EXISTING INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE EXPANDED. THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATION OR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY.

SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON INCOME TAXES AND RELATED CONTINGENCIES.

OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISK THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INTEREST RATES CAN IMPACT OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN EXPENSES AND FUNDING OBLIGATIONS.  SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE OR INVESTMENT LOSSES ON PLAN ASSETS MAY INCREASE OUR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON PENSION PLANS AND RELATED OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REALIZE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM OUR COST REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS AND OUR PROFITABILITY MAY BE HURT OR OUR BUSINESS OTHERWISE MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ORDER TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND CONTROL COSTS, WE ANNOUNCE FROM TIME TO TIME RESTRUCTURING PLANS, WHICH INCLUDE WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS GLOBAL FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. THESE PLANS ARE INTENDED TO GENERATE OPERATING EXPENSE SAVINGS THROUGH DIRECT COST AND INDIRECT OVERHEAD EXPENSE REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SAVINGS. WE MAY UNDERTAKE FURTHER WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS OR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE. THESE TYPES OF COST REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE COMPLEX. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR CURRENT RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, OR ANY OTHER RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES THAT WE MAY UNDERTAKE IN THE FUTURE, EXPECTED EFFICIENCIES AND BENEFITS MIGHT BE DELAYED OR NOT REALIZED, AND OUR OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS COULD BE DISRUPTED. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIONS AND OTHER WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES INCLUDE POLITICAL RESPONSES TO SUCH ACTIONS, UNFORESEEN DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTICIPATED WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS, ADDITIONAL UNEXPECTED COSTS, ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EMPLOYEE MORALE AND THE FAILURE TO MEET OPERATIONAL TARGETS DUE TO THE LOSS OF EMPLOYEES OR WORK STOPPAGES, ANY OF WHICH MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED COST REDUCTIONS OR MAY OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ATTACKS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER CYBER-BASED AND BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OWN OR THIRD PARTY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (“IT”) INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT FROM (AMONG OTHER CAUSES) ATTACKS ON OR FAILURES OF SUCH INFRASTRUCTURE,  COMPROMISES TO ITS PHYSICAL SECURITY, AS WELL AS FROM DAMAGING WEATHER OR OTHER ACTS OF NATURE. CYBER-BASED RISKS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE EVOLVING AND INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, BOTH ATTACKS ON OUR IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ATTACKS ON THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIRD PARTIES (BOTH ON PREMISES AND IN THE CLOUD) IN ATTEMPTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, OR INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES.  CYBER-BASED RISKS COULD ALSO INCLUDE ATTACKS TARGETING THE SECURITY, INTEGRITY AND/OR RELIABILITY OF THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION INSTALLED, STORED OR TRANSMITTED IN OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING AFTER THE PURCHASE OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND WHEN THEY ARE INCORPORATED INTO THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, FACILITIES OR INFRASTRUCTURE.  SUCH ATTACKS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS TO SYSTEMS (OUR OWN OR THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES), UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHERWISE PROTECTED INFORMATION AND CORRUPTION OF DATA (OUR OWN OR THAT OF THIRD PARTIES). WE HAVE EXPERIENCED CYBER-BASED ATTACKS AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THEM GOING FORWARD, POTENTIALLY WITH MORE FREQUENCY. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL RISKS TO OUR TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND OPERATIONS FROM THESE POTENTIAL ATTACKS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE TIMING, NATURE AND SCOPE OF SUCH ATTACKS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCTION DOWNTIMES, OPERATIONAL DELAYS, OTHER DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS OR ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, THE COMPROMISING OF CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHERWISE PROTECTED INFORMATION, MISAPPROPRIATION, DESTRUCTION OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, SECURITY BREACHES, OTHER MANIPULATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR OR THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS, NETWORKS OR PRODUCTS, FINANCIAL LOSSES FROM REMEDIAL ACTIONS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR POTENTIAL LIABILITY, AND/OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE DEPEND ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS; INFRINGEMENT OR FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS.

WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS AND OTHER MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE ALSO RELY ON NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY SYSTEMS AND OTHER MEASURES TO PROTECT CERTAIN CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER INFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION OR TO WHICH WE HAVE ACCESS. OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS TO US, THAT PATENTS ISSUED TO OR LICENSED BY US IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED OR CIRCUMVENTED BY COMPETITORS, OR THAT THESE PATENTS WILL BE FOUND TO BE VALID OR SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PRECLUDE OUR COMPETITORS FROM INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGIES SIMILAR TO THOSE COVERED BY OUR PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS.  OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S.  IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF COMPETITOR OR OTHER THIRD PARTY PATENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS SEEKING SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES OR SEEKING TO PREVENT OUR SALE AND MARKETING OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, LOSSES

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND LIABILITY RESULTING FROM VARIOUS CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FAILURES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, SUBJECT US TO JUDGMENTS, PENALTIES AND SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION COSTS OR TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY DISRUPT OUR SALES AND MARKETING OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

EXPORT VIOLATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON JUNE 28, 2012, WE ENTERED INTO A FOUR-YEAR CONSENT AGREEMENT (CA) WITH THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT’S OFFICE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS COMPLIANCE (DTCC) TO RESOLVE VIOLATIONS OF THE U.S. ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT (AECA) AND INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ARMS REGULATIONS (ITAR) THAT WE HAD VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSED TO DTCC. DTCC OFFICIALLY CLOSED THE CA ON OCTOBER 11, 2016.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JUNE 2012, DTCC IMPOSED A PARTIAL STATUTORY DEBARMENT ON P&WC WITH RESPECT TO OBTAINING NEW OR RENEWED ITAR LICENSE PRIVILEGES FOLLOWING P&WC'S GUILTY PLEA TO CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF THE AECA AND ITAR. THE DEBARMENT DOES NOT AFFECT ITAR LICENSES/AUTHORIZATIONS EXISTING AT THE TIME OF THE PARTIAL DEBARMENT, NOR DOES IT EXTEND TO PROGRAMS SUPPORTING: (1) THE U.S. GOVERNMENT; (2) NATO ALLIES; OR (3) "MAJOR NON-NATO ALLIES" (AS DEFINED IN THE ITAR). P&WC MAY SEEK AND HAS RECEIVED "TRANSACTION EXCEPTION" APPROVALS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS FOR NEW OR RENEWED ITAR LICENSING IN OTHER CASES DURING THE PERIOD OF DEBARMENT. IN FEBRUARY 2015, P&WC APPLIED FOR FULL REINSTATEMENT OF ITS ITAR PRIVILEGES. DTCC’S DECISION ON P&WC’S APPLICATION IS PENDING. UTC EXPECTS DTCC TO TERMINATE THE DEBARMENT AND REINSTATE P&WC’S FULL ITAR PRIVILEGES, AND WE ARE AWAITING FORMAL ACTION.

PRATT & WHITNEY GRAND JURY SUBPOENA

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, PRATT & WHITNEY RECEIVED A SUBPOENA IN MAY 2012 ISSUED BY A FEDERAL GRAND JURY IN CONNECTICUT, REQUESTING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO PRATT & WHITNEY’S USE IN CERTAIN MILITARY ENGINES OF TITANIUM PROCURED FROM SUPPLIERS THAT POTENTIALLY DID NOT CONFORM TO UNDERLYING CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS. IN JANUARY 2017,  THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CONNECTICUT INFORMED THE COMPANY THAT THE GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION WAS CLOSED AND THAT THE MATTER WAS REFERRED TO ITS CIVIL DIVISION FOR FURTHER REVIEW. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT REVIEW, PRATT & WHITNEY RECEIVED A CIVIL SUBPOENA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, SEEKING THE DOCUMENTS REQUESTED BY THE GRAND JURY SUBPOENA.

WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF LOSS, IF ANY, THAT MAY RESULT FROM THIS MATTER GIVEN THE CURRENT PROCEDURAL STATUS OF THE MATTER.

TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, UTC FIRE & SECURITY AMERICAS CORPORATION, INC. (UTCFS) WAS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN NUMEROUS PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS THAT WERE FILED ON BEHALF OF PURPORTED CLASSES OF PERSONS WHO ALLEGED THAT THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES PLACED "ROBOCALLS" AND/OR PLACED CALLS TO NUMBERS LISTED ON THE "DO NOT CALL REGISTRY" ON BEHALF OF UTCFS IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (TCPA).  IN EACH PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION SUIT, PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND MONETARY DAMAGES.  EACH VIOLATION UNDER THE TCPA PROVIDES FOR $500 IN STATUTORY DAMAGES OR UP TO $1,500 FOR ANY WILLFUL VIOLATION.  IN AUGUST 2016, UTCFS MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA, THE COURT IN WHICH ALL OF THE PENDING TCPA CASES HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED, ARGUING THAT THE THIRD PARTIES WHO PLACED THE CALLS IN ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE TCPA WERE NOT ACTING AS UTCFS’ AGENTS AND, THEREFORE, UTCFS COULD NOT BE VICARIOUSLY LIABLE FOR THOSE CALLS UNDER THE TCPA.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2016, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED UTCFS’ SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION AND DISMISSED THE CLAIMS AGAINST UTCFS. PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT YET FILED AN APPEAL.

DOJ/SEC INVESTIGATIONS

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN DECEMBER 2013 AND JANUARY 2014, UTC MADE VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ), THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT AND THE UNITED KINGDOM’S SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE TO REPORT THE STATUS OF ITS INTERNAL INVESTIGATION REGARDING A NON-EMPLOYEE SALES REPRESENTATIVE RETAINED BY UNITED TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INC. (UTIO) AND IAE FOR THE SALE OF PRATT & WHITNEY AND IAE ENGINES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, IN CHINA. ON APRIL 7, 2014, THE SEC NOTIFIED UTC THAT IT WAS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION AND ISSUED A SUBPOENA TO UTC. THE DOJ AND SEC ALSO CONTINUE TO REQUEST INFORMATION, AND THE SEC ISSUED A SECOND SUBPOENA ON MARCH 9, 2015 SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO INTERNAL ALLEGATIONS OF ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS FROM UTC’S AEROSPACE AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO OTIS BUSINESSES IN CHINA. UTC CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS AND RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION.  BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE ONGOING, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OR THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF AT THIS TIME.

AT THE OUTSET OF THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, UTIO AND IAE SUSPENDED ALL COMMISSION PAYMENTS TO THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE, AND UTIO AND IAE HAVE NOT RESUMED MAKING ANY PAYMENTS. THIS LED TO TWO CLAIMS BY THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE FOR UNPAID COMMISSIONS: A CIVIL LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST UTIO AND UTC AND AN ARBITRATION CLAIM AGAINST IAE. IN DECEMBER 2014, THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THE LAWSUIT AND AGREED TO WITHDRAW THE ARBITRATION CLAIM, EACH WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ALLOW

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE TO RE-ASSERT THE CLAIMS, BUT ONLY ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2016.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WOULD CONTEST ANY FUTURE CLAIM, AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE RESOLUTION OF A FUTURE LAWSUIT OR ARBITRATION BY THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MOS OTIS FAS INVESTIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, FOLLOWING INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERAL ANTI-MONOPOLY SERVICE (FAS) AT THE OFFICES OF MOS OTIS AND THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS BY MOS OTIS, IN OCTOBER 2014 FAS NOTIFIED MOS OTIS THAT IT HAD FOUND INDICATIONS OF VIOLATIONS OF RUSSIAN COMPETITION LAW IN THE MARKET FOR MAINTENANCE OF UNIFIED DISPATCH SYSTEMS, WHICH REMOTELY MONITOR ELEVATORS AND DISPATCH SERVICE TECHNICIANS IN MOSCOW. MOS OTIS IS AN INDIRECTLY OWNED AND CONTROLLED JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN OTIS AND THE CITY OF MOSCOW. FAS HAS NOT PURSUED AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AGAINST MOS OTIS TO DATE. AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF ANY POTENTIAL LOSS OR IMPACT TO THE BUSINESS THAT MAY RESULT.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF OTHER LAWSUITS, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS (SOME OF WHICH INVOLVE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS).  FOR A DISCUSSION OF CONTINGENCIES RELATED TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT.  EXCEPT AS INDICATED HEREIN OR IN NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2016

ANNUAL REPORT, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED INVESTIGATIONS, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, CAN BE FOUND UNDER THE HEADING "OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE – COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS" IN ITEM 1, "BUSINESS," AND IN ITEM 1A, "RISK FACTORS," IN THIS FORM 10-K.

CONSISTS OF: (I) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AWARDED UNDER THE UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED (LTIP); (II) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON THE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) AWARDED UNDER THE LTIP, (III) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON THE VESTING OF OUTSTANDING DEFERRED STOCK UNITS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AWARDED UNDER THE UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEFERRED STOCK UNIT PLAN, AS AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 23, 2014 AND (IV) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE PURSUANT TO OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AND PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARDS, ASSUMING PERFORMANCE AT THE TARGET LEVEL, EXCEPT FOR THE 2014 PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARDS WHICH REFLECT ACTUAL PERFORMANCE ACHIEVED. UNDER THE LTIP, EACH SAR REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (II) IS EXERCISABLE FOR A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAVING A VALUE EQUAL TO THE INCREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF A SHARE OF SUCH STOCK FROM THE DATE THE SAR WAS GRANTED.  FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE ISSUED IN RESPECT OF OUTSTANDING SARS AS REFLECTED IN COLUMN (A) ABOVE, WE HAVE USED THE NYSE CLOSING PRICE FOR A SHARE OF COMMON STOCK ON DECEMBER 31, 2016 OF $109.62.  THE AMOUNT OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (IV) ABOVE INCLUDES 2,033,000 RESTRICTED SHARES AND RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS AND 1,323,000 PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS.  UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 1,323,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK COULD BE ISSUED IF PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE ACHIEVED ABOVE TARGET.

PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (FULL SHARE AWARDS) WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR DELIVERY UNDER THE LTIP IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 4.03 TIMES THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO WHICH THE AWARD CORRESPONDS.  STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS DO NOT CONSTITUTE FULL SHARE AWARDS AND WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR DELIVERY UNDER THE LTIP ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS.
