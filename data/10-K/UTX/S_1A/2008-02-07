RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE

RESULTS. FOR A DISCUSSION IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE AND

CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE AEROSPACE AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 37 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED

REVENUES IN 2007, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES. THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND CAPITAL SPENDING BY AIRLINES AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS, CORPORATE PROFITABILITY AND BACKLOG LEVELS. ALSO, SINCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2008, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO

REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. AT TIMES, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ALSO ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO BEAR COST OVERRUNS RELATED TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL AND DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT

ARISE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS,

INCLUDING USAGE, PRICING, REGULATORY CHANGES, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO NEW ENGINES THAT INCREASE RELIABILITY. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS

IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES IN 2007, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FACTORS, CARRIERS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT

EQUIPMENT AND, IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR

FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER

DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF ONE OR MORE U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. IF WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH

WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE

COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUBJECT US TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS AND TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD. THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT. DEBARMENT GENERALLY DOES NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH

U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPORT OF GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF OUR EXPORT PRIVILEGES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 62 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL 2007 SEGMENT

REVENUES DERIVED FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM U.S. EXPORT SALES. FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND IN EXPORT MARKETS AND AFFECT REPORTED PROFITS OF OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (PRIMARILY THE COMMERCIAL

BUSINESSES) WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A

STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MAJORITY OF SALES IN THE AEROSPACE BUSINESSES IS TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CONSISTENT WITH

ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHILE THE MAJORITY OF COSTS AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS INCURRED IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY (PRINCIPALLY THE EURO AND THE CANADIAN DOLLAR). FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.S. DOLLAR SALES AND LOCAL

CURRENCY COSTS, THERE IS A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. TO MANAGE THIS EXPOSURE, WE EMPLOY

LONG-TERM HEDGING STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR REVENUES. SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING

GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR

AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO

PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA AND SOUTH AFRICA THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY,

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK. WHILE THESE FACTORS OR THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER-PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND

SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN

THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE

SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS OR THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER AND THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, PRICE

INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES

ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE

AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITIONS

WE

SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. THE

SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ASSETS AND PERSONNEL ACQUIRED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, APPLY OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AND COOPERATE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS. WE MAY

ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, APPLYING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, AND IN MANAGING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS WE

ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE DESIGN,

MANUFACTURE AND SERVICE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES; THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVES RISKS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED

WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, SALE AND SUPPORT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. WE

REGULARLY INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS THAT PURSUE ADVANCEMENTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES; EXECUTION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF INTERNAL AND SUPPLIER-PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS

AND SUBCONTRACTORS; ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FACTORS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THESE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING

OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES PRATT & WHITNEY OR ITS AFFILIATES WILL PRODUCE AIRCRAFT ENGINES CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED

CERTIFICATIONS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION AND LEGAL

COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE

RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LITIGATION CONCERNING PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN EXPORT LAWS,

COMPETITION LAWS AND SALES AND TRADING PRACTICES. WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF SUCH LITIGATION. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS, OTHER DAMAGES (IN

CERTAIN CASES, TREBLE DAMAGES), OR SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. INDEPENDENTLY, FAILURE OF US OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE EXPORT AND TRADE PRACTICE LAWS COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND

SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF EXPORT PRIVILEGES. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE THESE RISKS, THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL

CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. AS REQUIRED BY

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE ESTIMATE MATERIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND ESTABLISH RESERVES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF CONTINGENCIES WHERE LIABILITY IS DEEMED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

KNOWN TO US AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. IF THERE IS A RANGE OF ESTIMATES AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THAT RANGE IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THAN ANOTHER, THEN WE ACCRUE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT. SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY AFFECT OUR

ASSESSMENT AND ESTIMATES OF THE LOSS CONTINGENCY RECORDED AS A LIABILITY OR AS A RESERVE AGAINST ASSETS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD BE

RECOGNIZED OR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH DAMAGES WOULD BE PAID. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THIS FORM 10-K.
