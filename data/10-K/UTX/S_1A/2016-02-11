RISK FACTORS

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW, ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM RECENT RESULTS OR FROM OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR GLOBAL GROWTH MAY BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC, CAPITAL MARKET AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS.

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS, INCLUDING CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, LEVELS OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, COMMODITY PRICES, EXCHANGE RATES, LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND DEFICITS, POLITICAL CONDITIONS, ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED DEFAULT ON SOVEREIGN DEBT AND OTHER CHALLENGES THAT COULD AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  THESE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AFFECT BUSINESSES SUCH AS OURS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THE TIGHTENING OF CREDIT IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES AND OPERATIONS AND COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS. SIMILARLY, THIS TIGHTENING OF CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SUPPLIER BASE AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR ONE OR MORE OF OUR SUPPLIERS TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR BANKRUPTCY. OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DECREASES IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, SUCH AS DECREASES IN BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SPENDING, AIR TRAVEL, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF AIRLINES AND BUSINESS JET OPERATORS, AND GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY

52

PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SALES IN

2015

, ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, REGULATORY CHANGES, INTEREST RATES, LABOR COSTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS, GLOBAL CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER GLOBAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SLOWDOWN IN BUILDING AND REMODELING ACTIVITY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OTIS AND UTC CLIMATE, CONTROLS & SECURITY. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF UTC CLIMATE, CONTROLS & SECURITY CAN ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT AND, PARTICULARLY IN ITS RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS, WEATHER CONDITIONS.

THE RESULTS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AEROSPACE BUSINESSES, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 48 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SALES IN

2015

, ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION AND DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE CYCLICAL IN NATURE. ALTHOUGH THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CURRENTLY FACED BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, UNCERTAINTY CONTINUES TO EXIST. IN ADDITION, CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEMAND FOR AIRCRAFT ENGINES, AEROSPACE PRODUCTS AND COMPONENT AFTERMARKET PARTS AND SERVICE BY COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, AIRCRAFT OPERATORS AND AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS ARE INFLUENCED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND PREDICTED TRAFFIC LEVELS, LOAD FACTORS, AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICING, LABOR ISSUES, WORLDWIDE AIRLINE PROFITS, AIRLINE CONSOLIDATION, BANKRUPTCIES, COMPETITION, THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT, REGULATORY CHANGES, TERRORISM AND RELATED SAFETY CONCERNS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CORPORATE PROFITABILITY, COST REDUCTION EFFORTS AND BACKLOG LEVELS.  ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE THE SALES AND MARGINS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES. OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIONS, PANDEMIC HEALTH ISSUES OR MAJOR NATURAL DISASTERS, COULD ALSO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE SALES AND MARGINS OF OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE CUSTOMERS IS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND

2016

, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST THAT FIRM ORDERS BE RESCHEDULED OR CANCELED. AT TIMES, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ALSO ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO BEAR COST OVERRUNS RELATED TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL AND DESIGN CHALLENGES THAT ARISE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND SPARE PARTS.  SPARE PARTS SALES AND AFTERMARKET SERVICE TRENDS ARE AFFECTED BY SIMILAR FACTORS, INCLUDING USAGE, PRICING, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, REGULATORY CHANGES AND THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER AIRCRAFT. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE LENGTHY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLE INVOLVED IN BRINGING PRODUCTS IN THESE BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO MARKET, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WILL EXIST WHEN ANY NEW PRODUCT IS COMPLETE. A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION OR DEFENSE INDUSTRIES COULD HAVE

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY A CHANGING GLOBAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUED PRESSURE ON U.S. AND GLOBAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN MILITARY FLIGHT OPERATIONS. U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFICIT REDUCTION MEASURES, CONGRESSIONAL DISPUTES OVER BUDGETS AND DEBT CEILINGS AND THE IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION HAVE INCREASED MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR MILITARY BUSINESSES.  SHOULD THESE FACTORS CONTINUE AND OVERALL U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE SPENDING DECLINE, IT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, CASH FLOW, PROFIT AND BACKLOG FOR OUR MILITARY BUSINESSES.  ONE OR MORE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY SUPPORT OR ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING COULD BE PHASED-OUT OR TERMINATED.  REDUCTIONS IN THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS, UNLESS OFFSET BY OTHER PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING RISKS.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT, EITHER FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONTRACT. IF TERMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR DEFAULT, WE COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS THE GOVERNMENT INCURS IN ACQUIRING UNDELIVERED GOODS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES IT SUFFERS. WE ARE NOW, AND BELIEVE THAT IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE, THE SUBJECT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN OF OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. SUCH U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OFTEN TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE AND COULD RESULT IN ADMINISTRATIVE, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITIES, INCLUDING REPAYMENTS, FINES, TREBLE AND OTHER DAMAGES, FORFEITURES, RESTITUTION OR PENALTIES, OR COULD LEAD TO SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR OF EXPORT PRIVILEGES.  FOR INSTANCE, IF  WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS WERE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF ANY U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING VIOLATION OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR EXPORT LAWS, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW), THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD SUSPEND US FROM BIDDING ON OR RECEIVING AWARDS OF NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS PENDING THE COMPLETION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD FINE AND DEBAR US FROM NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED THREE YEARS. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DEBAR A CONTRACTOR FROM RECEIVING NEW GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FRAUDULENT, CRIMINAL OR OTHER SERIOUSLY IMPROPER CONDUCT.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COULD VOID ANY CONTRACTS FOUND TO BE TAINTED BY FRAUD.  OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS. LIKE MANY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, WE HAVE RECEIVED AUDIT REPORTS, WHICH RECOMMEND THAT CERTAIN CONTRACT PRICES SHOULD BE REDUCED TO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, INCLUDING BECAUSE COST OR PRICING DATA WE SUBMITTED IN NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT PRICES OR COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES MAY NOT HAVE CONFORMED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, OR THAT CERTAIN PAYMENTS BE DELAYED OR WITHHELD.  SOME OF THESE AUDIT REPORTS INVOLVED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ECONOMIC RISK AS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL BASIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY

62

PERCENT OF OUR

2015

TOTAL SEGMENT SALES DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING U.S. EXPORT SALES. CHANGES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES, MAY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND AND REPORTED PROFITS IN OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS (ESPECIALLY THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES AND P&W CANADA), WHERE TRANSACTIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY AFFECT THE PRICES WE PAY SUPPLIERS FOR MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING MARGINS ALSO MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WORLDWIDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS FOR CERTAIN CROSS BORDER TRANSACTIONS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. ACCORDINGLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY ALSO GIVE RISE TO TRANSLATION GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NON-U.S. OPERATING UNITS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES ARE NON-U.S. BASED, A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MAJORITY OF SALES IN THE AEROSPACE BUSINESSES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHILE THE MAJORITY OF COSTS AT LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE INCURRED IN THE APPLICABLE LOCAL CURRENCY (PRINCIPALLY THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, AND THE POLISH ZLOTY). FOR OPERATING UNITS WITH U.S. DOLLAR SALES AND LOCAL CURRENCY COSTS, THERE IS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE APPLICABLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES. TO MANAGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES, WE EMPLOY LONG-TERM HEDGING STRATEGIES ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. DOLLAR SALES. SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2015

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS, INVESTMENTS, TAXATION, EXCHANGE CONTROLS, CAPITAL CONTROLS, EMPLOYMENT REGULATIONS, AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AS WELL AS TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE INCREASED FINANCIAL AND LEGAL RISKS DUE TO DIFFERING LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CUSTOMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. FOR

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXAMPLE, AS A CONDITION OF SALE OR AWARD OF A CONTRACT, SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE US TO AGREE TO OFFSET ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN-COUNTRY PURCHASES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS. THE CONTRACT MAY PROVIDE FOR PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OFFSET REQUIREMENTS.

IN ADDITION, AS PART OF OUR GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE INVESTED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, INDONESIA, MEXICO, POLAND, RUSSIA, SOUTH AFRICA AND COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT CARRY HIGH LEVELS OF CURRENCY, POLITICAL, COMPLIANCE AND ECONOMIC RISK.  WE EXPECT THAT SALES TO EMERGING MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES AS OUR BUSINESS EVOLVES AND AS THESE AND OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS AND REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCREASE THEIR DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.  EMERGING MARKET OPERATIONS CAN PRESENT MANY RISKS, INCLUDING CULTURAL DIFFERENCES (SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS PRACTICES), VOLATILITY IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, ECONOMIC AND GOVERNMENT INSTABILITY, AND THE IMPOSITION OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CAPITAL CONTROLS.  WHILE THESE FACTORS AND THEIR IMPACT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THEM COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE USE A VARIETY OF RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIER-PROVIDED PARTS, COMPONENTS, SUB-SYSTEMS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SERVICES IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR PRICE INCREASES COULD INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR RELIANCE ON SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS) AND COMMODITY MARKETS TO SECURE RAW MATERIALS, PARTS, COMPONENTS AND SUB-SYSTEMS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSES US TO VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS. IN MANY INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY, MANUFACTURING, LOGISTICS SUPPORT OR ASSEMBLY OR PARTICIPATE IN COMMODITY MARKETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF LIMITED SUPPLIES BY SUPPLIERS. A DISRUPTION IN DELIVERIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS, CLOSING OR BANKRUPTCY OF OUR SUPPLIERS, PRICE INCREASES, OR DECREASED AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS OR COMMODITIES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPLY MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTION PRACTICES ARE BASED ON AN APPROPRIATE BALANCING OF THE FORESEEABLE RISKS AND THE COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. NONETHELESS, PRICE INCREASES, SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, SUPPLIER PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS OR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RAW MATERIALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, AND MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WITH, OR DISPOSING OF DIVESTED BUSINESSES FROM, OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES.

WE SEEK TO GROW THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN ADDITION TO INTERNAL GROWTH. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE MADE VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES, AND EXPECT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. OUR DUE DILIGENCE REVIEWS MAY NOT IDENTIFY ALL OF THE MATERIAL ISSUES NECESSARY TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE COST AND POTENTIAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, INCLUDING POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO REGULATORY SANCTIONS RESULTING FROM AN ACQUISITION TARGETS PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED COSTS, EXPENSES OR OTHER LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF AN ACQUISITION TARGETS VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAWS, SUCH AS THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA) OR SIMILAR WORLDWIDE ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.  WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING POST-CLOSING ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ELIMINATING DUPLICATE FACILITIES, LITIGATION, AND OTHER LIABILITIES. WE ALSO MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING ACQUISITIONS WITH OUR OPERATIONS, APPLYING OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS PROCESSES TO THESE ACQUISITIONS, OR IN MANAGING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE WHEN WE FIRST ENTER INTO A TRANSACTION. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT TO EXPENSE CERTAIN ACQUISITION COSTS AS INCURRED, MAY CAUSE US TO INCUR GREATER EARNINGS VOLATILITY AND GENERALLY LOWER EARNINGS DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE ACQUIRE NEW BUSINESSES. FURTHERMORE, WE MAKE STRATEGIC DIVESTITURES FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS OR CONTINUED SUPPLY AND SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NONPERFORMANCE BY THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD RESULT IN OBLIGATIONS BEING IMPOSED ON US AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE SUCCESS OF FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES WILL DEPEND ON THE SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO, AND CONSUMMATION OF, THE PENDING TRANSACTIONS, THE TIMING OF CONSUMMATION OF THESE PENDING TRANSACTIONS, AND THE ABILITY OF THE PARTIES TO SECURE ANY REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

OUR DEBT LEVELS AND RELATED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES; OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR OUTLOOK OR OUR CREDIT RATINGS.

WE HAVE OUTSTANDING DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY.  OUR DEBT LEVEL AND RELATED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS.



REQUIRING US TO DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR DEBT, WHICH WOULD REDUCE FUNDS WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS AND REINVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESSES;



REDUCING OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR OR REACTING TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND MARKET CONDITIONS; AND



EXPOSING US TO INTEREST RATE RISK BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE AT VARIABLE RATES.

WE DEPEND, IN PART, UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS. IF WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN ORDER TO FUND OUTSTANDING FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR MEET OTHER BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, OUR MARKET LIQUIDITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.  A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR INCREASED BORROWING COSTS AND TO HAVE GREATER DIFFICULTY ACCESSING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKETS FOR DEBT, INCLUDING DISRUPTIONS OR DECLINES IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND/OR A DECLINE IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS.

QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED OR MODIFIED, ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES AND MAY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM CONSTITUTE COMPONENTS OF OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY, WHICH WE FUND WITH FREE OPERATING CASH FLOW, BORROWINGS AND DIVESTITURES. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS OR MAKE ANY SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED, ACCELERATED, SUSPENDED OR DELAYED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. EVEN IF NOT DISCONTINUED, THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES MAY BE CHANGED, AND THE AMOUNT, TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF SUCH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES MAY VARY FROM HISTORICAL PRACTICE OR FROM THE COMPANYS STATED EXPECTATIONS. DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL BE BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO DISCONTINUE, LIMIT, SUSPEND, INCREASE OR DELAY OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS OR SHARE REPURCHASES INCLUDE MARKET CONDITIONS, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, THE NATURE AND TIMING OF OTHER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THE TERMS OF OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, OUR OUTLOOK AS TO THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING AT ATTRACTIVE RATES, THE IMPACT ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF DOMESTIC CASH.

THE REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF OUR CASH DIVIDEND OR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  ADDITIONALLY, REPURCHASES OF OUR SHARES WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SHARE REPURCHASES WILL ENHANCE SHAREHOLDER VALUE BECAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE BELOW THE LEVELS AT WHICH WE REPURCHASED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. ALTHOUGH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE, SHORT-TERM STOCK PRICE FLUCTUATIONS COULD REDUCE THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS.

SEE ITEM 5, "MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES"  IN THIS FORM 10-K FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND PAST SHARE REPURCHASES, INCLUDING OUR PRIOR AND PENDING ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (ASR) TRANSACTIONS.

WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SERVICE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES; THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVES RISKS AND WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED.

WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE GROWTH THROUGH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, SALE AND SUPPORT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. THE PRODUCT, PROGRAM AND SERVICE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGE AND EVOLVE REGULARLY, AND WE INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO PURSUE ADVANCEMENTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OF PARTICULAR NOTE, PRATT & WHITNEY IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THE PUREPOWER PW1000G GEARED TURBOFAN ENGINE TO POWER VARIOUS AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING THE A320NEO FAMILY OF AIRCRAFT, WHICH ENTERED INTO SERVICE IN JANUARY 2016. THE LEVEL OF ORDERS RECEIVED FOR THE PUREPOWER FAMILY OF ENGINES COUPLED WITH A REQUIREMENT TO ACHIEVE MATURE PRODUCTION LEVELS IN A VERY SHORT TIMEFRAME ARE NECESSITATING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN CAPACITY. IF OUR PRODUCTION RAMP-UP EFFORTS ARE DELAYED OR IF SUPPLIERS CANNOT TIMELY DELIVER OR PERFORM TO OUR STANDARDS, WE MAY NOT MEET CUSTOMERS PRODUCTION SCHEDULES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS, INCLUDING PENALTIES THAT COULD BE ASSESSED UNDER EXISTING CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, CERTIFICATION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL SCHEDULES; EXECUTION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

PERFORMANCE PLANS; AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIER AND INTERNALLY-PRODUCED PARTS AND MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS; HIRING AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; ACHIEVING COST AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES; IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS IN OUR TARGET END-MARKETS; VALIDATION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES; THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS; AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE TECHNOLOGIES WE DEVELOP. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN OF OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO LARGER SYSTEMS AND END PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  THESE SYSTEMS AND END PRODUCTS MAY INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES MANUFACTURED BY THIRD PARTIES AND INVOLVE ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AS A RESULT, THE PERFORMANCE AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE LARGER SYSTEMS AND END PRODUCTS COULD AFFECT THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER INTEREST AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.

ANY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS DIVERT RESOURCES FROM OTHER POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AS FULLY AS COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE OUR TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT DEVELOP OR GROW AS WE ANTICIPATE. WE OR OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS OR SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY NOT REALIZE THE DEGREE OR TIMING OF BENEFITS INITIALLY ANTICIPATED OR MAY OTHERWISE SUFFER SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES. DUE TO THE DESIGN COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN COMPLETING THE DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS. ANY DELAYS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED DEVELOPMENT COSTS OR DEFLECT RESOURCES FROM OTHER PROJECTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER, WHEN AND IN WHAT QUANTITIES OUR AEROSPACE BUSINESSES WILL PRODUCE AND SELL AIRCRAFT ENGINES, AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT OR PENDING REQUIRED CERTIFICATIONS. OUR CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY AWARDED ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE COST TO PROVIDE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. TO GENERATE AN ACCEPTABLE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE CONTRACTS, WE MUST BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE OUR COSTS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND DELIVER THE PRODUCTS REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE OUR COSTS OR THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A CONTRACT, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM AND DELIVER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS AND SCHEDULE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY FACE CUSTOMER DIRECTED COST REDUCTION TARGETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS.  FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR COMPETITORS WILL NOT DEVELOP COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE IN ADVANCE OF OR INSTEAD OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGY OR OFFERINGS THAT MIGHT CAUSE OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS TO BECOME OBSOLETE. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

EXPORTS OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS EXPORT CONTROL REGULATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE A LICENSE FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE OR THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY.

AS AN EXPORTER, WE MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE EXPORT OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY FROM THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVING JURISDICTION OVER OUR OPERATIONS. IN THE U.S., THESE LAWS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE U.S. EXPORT ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS (EAR) ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, BUREAU OF INDUSTRY AND SECURITY, THE INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ARMS REGULATIONS (ITAR) ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, DIRECTORATE OF DEFENSE TRADE CONTROLS (DDTC), AND TRADE SANCTIONS, REGULATIONS AND EMBARGOES ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL. CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE MILITARY OR STRATEGIC APPLICATIONS AND ARE ON THE MUNITIONS LIST OF THE ITAR, OR REPRESENT SO-CALLED "DUAL USE" ITEMS GOVERNED BY THE EAR. AS A RESULT, THESE PRODUCTS REQUIRE INDIVIDUAL VALIDATED LICENSES IN ORDER TO BE EXPORTED TO CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. ANY FAILURES TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES, FINES, INVESTIGATIONS, ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO EXPORT OUR PRODUCTS, AND REPEAT FAILURES COULD CARRY MORE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES.   ANY CHANGES IN EXPORT REGULATIONS MAY FURTHER RESTRICT THE EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED BY THE LICENSING PROCESSES CAN VARY, POTENTIALLY DELAYING THE SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE CORRESPONDING REVENUE. ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT LINES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL, PRODUCT SAFETY AND OTHER LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, POSSIBLE LIABILITY RELATING TO PRODUCT SAFETY, PERSONAL INJURIES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONTRACT-RELATED CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS, COMPETITION LAWS AND LAWS GOVERNING IMPROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE OR ONE OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS COULD BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING AS A RESULT OF SUCH MATTERS. IF CONVICTED OR FOUND LIABLE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, REPAYMENTS, OTHER DAMAGES (IN CERTAIN CASES, TREBLE DAMAGES). AS A GLOBAL BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THOSE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE INTERPRETED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THEY MAY ALSO CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AS MAY RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER GUIDANCE. CHANGES IN LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EXPENSES AND PAYMENTS, AND

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO LAWS OR REGULATIONS MAY ALSO AFFECT HOW WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AND STRUCTURE OUR INVESTMENTS AND COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS. CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, INCLUDING LAWS RELATING TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD LEAD TO NEW OR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN PRODUCT DESIGNS AND COULD INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE EXPENDITURES. CHANGES IN CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS, OR IN THE REGULATION OF SUCH CONCERNS, INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, COULD SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS COSTS.

AT TIMES WE ARE INVOLVED IN DISPUTES WITH PRIVATE PARTIES OVER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, INCLUDING LITIGATION OVER ALLOCATION OF CLEANUP COSTS, ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES AND ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGES. PERSONAL INJURY LAWSUITS MAY INVOLVE INDIVIDUAL AND PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGING THAT CONTAMINANTS ORIGINATING FROM OUR OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES CURRENT OR FORMER OPERATING FACILITIES CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CANCERS INCURRED BY EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES OR RESIDENTS IN THE AREA AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE OR DIMINUTION OF REAL ESTATE VALUES.  EVEN IN LITIGATION WHERE WE BELIEVE OUR LIABILITY IS REMOTE, THERE IS A RISK THAT A NEGATIVE FINDING OR DECISION IN A MATTER INVOLVING MULTIPLE PLAINTIFFS OR A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS IN REGIONS WHERE WE HAVE, OR PREVIOUSLY HAD, SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS. PRODUCT RECALLS AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS (INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SAFETY OR RELIABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS) ALSO CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS, INCLUDING FINES, AS WELL AS NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, MANAGEMENT DISTRACTION AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION THAT COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN IN THIS FORM 10-K AND NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2015 ANNUAL REPORT.

IN ADDITION, THE FCPA AND OTHER ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS GENERALLY PROHIBIT COMPANIES AND THEIR INTERMEDIARIES FROM MAKING IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO NON-U.S. OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING OR RETAINING BUSINESS. THE FCPA APPLIES TO COMPANIES, INDIVIDUAL DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. UNDER THE FCPA, U.S. COMPANIES MAY BE HELD LIABLE FOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY STRATEGIC OR LOCAL PARTNERS OR REPRESENTATIVES. THE FCPA ALSO IMPOSES ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS ON PUBLICLY TRADED U.S. CORPORATIONS AND THEIR FOREIGN AFFILIATES, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PREVENT THE DIVERSION OF CORPORATE FUNDS TO THE PAYMENT OF BRIBES AND OTHER IMPROPER PAYMENTS. CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. ARE WITH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND ARE THEREFORE SUBJECT TO THE FCPA AND FOREIGN AND OTHER ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS. OUR POLICIES MANDATE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS. DESPITE MEANINGFUL MEASURES THAT WE UNDERTAKE TO SEEK TO ENSURE LAWFUL CONDUCT, WHICH INCLUDE TRAINING AND INTERNAL CONTROL POLICIES, THESE MEASURES MAY NOT ALWAYS PREVENT OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS FROM VIOLATING THE FCPA OR SIMILAR LAWS. AS A RESULT, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PENALTIES, DISGORGEMENT, FURTHER CHANGES OR ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR PROCEDURES, POLICIES AND CONTROLS, PERSONNEL CHANGES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS, OR ALLEGATIONS OF SUCH VIOLATIONS, COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT DISTRACTION AND RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE OR ADDITIONAL TAX EXPOSURES COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS.  CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES AND CONFLICTS IN RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND OTHER TAX GUIDANCE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR TAX RECEIVABLES AND LIABILITIES AND OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATIONS BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING TAX AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION TO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS LAUNCHED IN THE FUTURE BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, AND EXISTING INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE EXPANDED. THE GLOBAL AND DIVERSE NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS MEANS THAT THESE RISKS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES WILL ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME. OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATION OR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY.

SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2015

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON INCOME TAXES AND RELATED CONTINGENCIES.

OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISK THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INTEREST RATES CAN IMPACT OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN EXPENSES AND FUNDING OBLIGATIONS.  SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE OR INVESTMENT LOSSES ON PLAN ASSETS MAY INCREASE OUR FUNDING OBLIGATIONS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR

2015

ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON PENSION PLANS AND RELATED OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REALIZE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM OUR COST REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS AND OUR PROFITABILITY MAY BE HURT OR OUR BUSINESS OTHERWISE MIGHT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ORDER TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND CONTROL COSTS, WE ANNOUNCE FROM TIME TO TIME RESTRUCTURING PLANS, WHICH INCLUDE WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS GLOBAL FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS AND OTHER COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. THESE PLANS ARE INTENDED TO

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GENERATE OPERATING EXPENSE SAVINGS THROUGH DIRECT COST AND INDIRECT OVERHEAD EXPENSE REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SAVINGS. WE MAY UNDERTAKE FURTHER WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS OR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE. THESE TYPES OF COST REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES ARE COMPLEX. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR CURRENT RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, OR ANY OTHER RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES THAT WE MAY UNDERTAKE IN THE FUTURE, EXPECTED EFFICIENCIES AND BENEFITS MIGHT BE DELAYED OR NOT REALIZED, AND OUR OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS COULD BE DISRUPTED. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIONS AND OTHER WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES INCLUDE UNFORESEEN DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTICIPATED WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS, ADDITIONAL UNEXPECTED COSTS, ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EMPLOYEE MORALE AND THE FAILURE TO MEET OPERATIONAL TARGETS DUE TO THE LOSS OF EMPLOYEES, ANY OF WHICH MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED COST REDUCTIONS OR MAY OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ATTACKS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER CYBER-BASED AND BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY DISRUPTIONS, INCLUDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ("IT") ATTACKS OR FAILURES, THREATS TO PHYSICAL SECURITY, AS WELL AS DAMAGING WEATHER OR OTHER ACTS OF NATURE, PANDEMICS OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. CYBER-BASED RISKS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE EVOLVING AND INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, BOTH ATTACKS TO OUR IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ATTACKS TO THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIRD PARTIES IN ATTEMPTS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, OR INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES.  CYBER-BASED RISKS COULD ALSO INCLUDE ATTACKS TARGETING THE SECURITY, INTEGRITY AND/OR RELIABILITY OF THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INSTALLED IN OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING AFTER THE PURCHASE OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND WHEN THEY ARE INCORPORATED INTO THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, FACILITIES OR INFRASTRUCTURE.  SUCH ATTACKS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS TO SYSTEMS (OUR OWN OR THAT OF THIRD PARTIES), UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHERWISE PROTECTED INFORMATION AND CORRUPTION OF DATA (OUR OWN OR THAT OF THIRD PARTIES). WE HAVE EXPERIENCED CYBER-BASED ATTACKS AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THEM GOING FORWARD, POTENTIALLY WITH MORE FREQUENCY. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL RISKS TO OUR TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND OPERATIONS FROM THESE POTENTIAL ATTACKS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE TIMING, NATURE AND SCOPE OF SUCH ATTACKS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCTION DOWNTIMES, OPERATIONAL DELAYS, OTHER DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS OR ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, THE COMPROMISING OF CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHERWISE PROTECTED INFORMATION, MISAPPROPRIATION, DESTRUCTION OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, SECURITY BREACHES, OTHER MANIPULATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR OR THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS, NETWORKS OR PRODUCTS, FINANCIAL LOSSES FROM REMEDIAL ACTIONS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR POTENTIAL LIABILITY, AND/OR DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE DEPEND ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS; INFRINGEMENT OR FAILURE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE GROWTH AND SUCCESS.

WE RELY ON A COMBINATION OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY SYSTEMS, INTERNAL CONTROLS AND COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS AND OTHER MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE ALSO RELY ON NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY SYSTEMS AND OTHER MEASURES TO PROTECT CERTAIN CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER INFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION OR TO WHICH WE HAVE ACCESS. OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS TO US, THAT PATENTS ISSUED TO OR LICENSED BY US IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED OR CIRCUMVENTED BY COMPETITORS, OR THAT THESE PATENTS WILL BE FOUND TO BE VALID OR SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PRECLUDE OUR COMPETITORS FROM INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGIES SIMILAR TO THOSE COVERED BY OUR PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS.  OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S.  IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE THE TARGET OF COMPETITOR OR OTHER THIRD PARTY PATENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS SEEKING SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES OR SEEKING TO PREVENT OUR SALE AND MARKETING OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS, LOSSES AND LIABILITY RESULTING FROM VARIOUS CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FAILURES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ANY OF THESE EVENTS OR FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, SUBJECT US TO JUDGMENTS, PENALTIES AND SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION COSTS OR TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY DISRUPT OUR SALES AND MARKETING OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
