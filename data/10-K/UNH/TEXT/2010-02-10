GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE REGULATED BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. THIS

REGULATION CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO ENACT AND CONSIDER

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, INCLUDING PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH

INSURANCE AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS. THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE PERIODICALLY. NEW LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES, OR CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES, COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES. IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, OR FAIL TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO

HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND FREQUENT CHANGES IN FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS

RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEVELS OF FEDERAL REGULATION. CMS REGULATES OVATIONS AND AMERICHOICE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID BUSINESSES. CMS HAS THE RIGHT TO AUDIT

PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CMS CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE GIVEN TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. OUR HEALTH BENEFITS REPORTING SEGMENT, THROUGH AMERICHOICE AND OVATIONS, ALSO HAS MEDICAID AND SCHIP CONTRACTS THAT ARE

SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE MANY REGULATIONS SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COMPLIANCE. WHEN WE CONTRACT WITH

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE AWARD, ADMINISTRATION AND PERFORMANCE OF U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, THE PORTION OF INGENIXS BUSINESS THAT INCLUDES CLINICAL RESEARCH IS SUBJECT

TO REGULATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION, ANTI-FRAUD AND ABUSE, ANTI-KICKBACKS, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST ALSO AFFECT US.

HIPAA, GLBA AND OTHER PRIVACY AND SECURITY REGULATION.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND

ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996, AS AMENDED (HIPAA), APPLY TO BOTH THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING SELF-FUNDED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. HIPAA REQUIRES GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS AND CERTAIN ELIGIBLE

INDIVIDUALS. IT ALSO REQUIRES GUARANTEED RENEWABILITY FOR EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS AND LIMITS EXCLUSIONS BASED ON PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. FEDERAL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO HIPAA INCLUDE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND

CODE SETS, AND FOR THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. THE HIPAA PRIVACY REGULATIONS DO NOT PREEMPT MORE STRINGENT STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY ALSO APPLY TO US.

FEDERAL PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE FREQUENTLY BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS AND JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. FOR EXAMPLE,

THE U.S. CONGRESS ENACTED THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA) WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDS, AND ADDS NEW, PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS TO HIPAA AND IMPOSES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON USES AND DISCLOSURES OF HEALTH INFORMATION.

AARA INCLUDES NEW CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HIPAA BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENTS; EXTENDS PARTS OF HIPAA PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS TO BUSINESS ASSOCIATES; ADDS NEW FEDERAL DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR COVERED ENTITIES AND

BUSINESS ASSOCIATES AND NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS) AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) AND, IN SOME CASES, TO THE LOCAL MEDIA; STRENGTHENS ENFORCEMENT AND IMPOSES HIGHER FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR

HIPAA VIOLATIONS AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, IMPOSES CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES. IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY ACT, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AS EITHER A COVERED ENTITY OR A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE. FEDERAL CONSUMER

PROTECTION LAWS MAY ALSO APPLY IN SOME INSTANCES TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES RELATED TO PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES IS ALSO REGULATED IN SOME INSTANCES BY

OTHER FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) OR STATE STATUTES IMPLEMENTING GLBA, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE INSURERS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH NOTICE REGARDING HOW THEIR NON-PUBLIC PERSONAL HEALTH AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS USED

AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF CERTAIN DISCLOSURES BEFORE THE INSURER SHARES SUCH INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY, AND WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE SAFEGUARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK

FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH HIPAA, GLBA AND OTHER PRIVACY-RELATED REGULATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ERISA.

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), REGULATES HOW

GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A SET OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC INTERPRETATION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL) AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL COURTS.

ERISA PLACES CONTROLS ON HOW OUR BUSINESS UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MAINTAIN SELF-FUNDED PLANS. REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE DOL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RULES FOR CLAIMS

PAYMENT AND MEMBER APPEALS UNDER HEALTH CARE PLANS GOVERNED BY ERISA. ADDITIONALLY, SOME STATES REQUIRE LICENSURE OR REGISTRATION OF COMPANIES PROVIDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FOR HEALTH CARE PLANS.

FDIC.

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) HAS FEDERAL REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER OPTUMHEALTH BANK AND PERFORMS

ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION TO SUCH ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS, THE FDIC PERFORMS PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE BANKS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

FEDERAL BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND AGENCY GUIDELINES. IN THE EVENT OF UNFAVORABLE EXAMINATION RESULTS, THE BANK COULD BE SUBJECT TO INCREASED OPERATIONAL EXPENSES, GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT AND MONETARY PENALTIES.

STATE LAWS AND REGULATION

HEALTH

CARE REGULATION.

OUR INSURANCE AND HMO SUBSIDIARIES MUST BE LICENSED BY THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS. ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER INSURANCE AND HMO PRODUCTS REGULATE THOSE PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS.

THESE STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ESTABLISH MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. WITH THE AMENDMENT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTING MODEL REGULATION BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS TO

ADOPT ELEMENTS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, WE EXPECT THAT THESE STATES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL ACTIVITIES OF HMOS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES.

HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ALSO REGULATED UNDER STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRE

REGISTRATION WITH APPLICABLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE INSURANCE HOLDING

COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE REGULATED COMPANIES AND THEIR PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES OR AFFILIATES. THESE LAWS MAY

RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR BUSINESS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT

TO OTHER HEALTH CARE-RELATED REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PPO, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION (MCO), UTILIZATION REVIEW (UR) OR THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR-RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER FROM STATE TO

STATE, BUT MAY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING, PRODUCT AND RATE, AND FINANCIAL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES, PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, ADEQUACY OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL

NETWORKS, FRAUD PREVENTION, PROTECTION OF CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION, PRICING AND UNDERWRITING PRACTICES, AND COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES. STATE HEALTH CARE ANTI-FRAUD AND ABUSE PROHIBITIONS ENCOMPASS A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING

KICKBACKS FOR REFERRAL OF MEMBERS, BILLING UNNECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES, AND IMPROPER MARKETING. OUR AMERICHOICE AND OVATIONS MEDICAID BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE THE PROVISION OF BENEFITS BY

AMERICHOICE TO ITS MEDICAID AND SCHIP BENEFICIARIES AND BY OVATIONS TO ITS MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES. WE ALSO CONTRACT WITH STATE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE AWARD, ADMINISTRATION AND PERFORMANCE

OF STATE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

PHARMACY REGULATION.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MUST BE LICENSED TO DO

BUSINESS AS A PHARMACY IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MUST ALSO REGISTER WITH THE U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION AND INDIVIDUAL STATE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AUTHORITIES TO DISPENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. IN

MANY OF THE STATES WHERE OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES DELIVER PHARMACEUTICALS THERE ARE LAWS AND

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE OUT-OF-STATE MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES TO REGISTER WITH THAT STATES BOARD OF PHARMACY OR SIMILAR REGULATORY BODY. THESE STATES GENERALLY PERMIT THE PHARMACY TO FOLLOW

THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE MAIL ORDER PHARMACY IS LOCATED, ALTHOUGH SOME STATES REQUIRE THAT WE ALSO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN LAWS IN THAT STATE. OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MAINTAIN CERTAIN MEDICARE AND STATE MEDICAID PROVIDER NUMBERS AS

PHARMACIES PROVIDING SERVICES UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRES THE PHARMACIES TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROVIDER RULES AND REGULATIONS. OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR MAIL ORDER

PHARMACIES INCLUDE FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE LABELING, PACKAGING, ADVERTISING AND ADULTERATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND DISPENSING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE RISKS RELATED TO OUR PBM BUSINESSES.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS.

STATES HAVE ADOPTED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS OF

THE GLBA. LIKE HIPAA, GLBA ALLOWS STATES TO ADOPT MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING PRIVACY PROTECTION. A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE ALSO ADOPTED OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES, FOR EXAMPLE, STATE LAWS

THAT GOVERN THE USE, DISCLOSURE AND PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES INCREASINGLY FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS FROM IDENTITY THEFT, WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STATES ENACTING LAWS REQUIRING

BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS OF SECURITY BREACHES INVOLVING PERSONAL INFORMATION. STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS MAY ALSO APPLY TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES RELATED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION RELATED TO

CONSUMERS AND CARE PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO STATE PRIVACY AND INSURANCE REGULATION AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES IN THE DIFFERENT STATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO STANDARDIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS

STATE LINES. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH STATE PRIVACY-RELATED REGULATIONS.

UDFI.

IN ADDITION, THE UTAH STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (UDFI) HAS STATE REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER OPTUMHEALTH BANK AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS PERFORMS ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS TO

ENSURE THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION TO SUCH ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS, THE UDFI IN CONJUNCTION WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS PERFORMS PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE BANKS COMPLIANCE WITH

APPLICABLE STATE BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND AGENCY GUIDELINES. IN THE EVENT OF UNFAVORABLE EXAMINATION RESULTS, THE BANK COULD BE SUBJECTED TO INCREASED OPERATIONAL EXPENSES, GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT AND MONETARY PENALTIES.

COMMITMENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PACIFICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC. (PACIFICARE) AND SIERRA HEALTH SERVICES, INC. (SIERRA) ACQUISITIONS, WHICH

CLOSED IN DECEMBER 2005 AND FEBRUARY 2008, RESPECTIVELY, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO VARIOUS COMMITMENTS WITH STATE REGULATORY DEPARTMENTS, PRINCIPALLY IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA. MANY OF THE PACIFICARE COMMITMENTS IN CALIFORNIA

EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 19, 2009. WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THE REMAINING COMMITMENTS IN ANY OF THE AFFECTED STATES WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE HAVE BEEN AND ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF

PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. SUCH GOVERNMENT

ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. SEE NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR DETAILS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF ANY ADVERSE INVESTIGATION, AUDIT RESULTS OR SANCTIONS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RETAIN OUR CURRENT

BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

SOME OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, INCLUDING INGENIXS I3 BUSINESS, HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING VARIOUS TAX,

TARIFF AND TRADE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY, AND INVESTMENT RULES AND LAWS.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES COMPANY, WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, HMOS, TPAS AND BUSINESS

SERVICES OUTSOURCING COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE FORMED NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS OR WITH CMS, SPECIALTY BENEFIT PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, DISEASE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AND VARIOUS HEALTH INFORMATION AND

ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. FOR OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., CVS

CAREMARK CORPORATION AND EXPRESS SCRIPTS, INC. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND INGENIX REPORTING SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A BROAD AND DIVERSE SET OF OTHER BUSINESSES. NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THESE

MARKETS, ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES RELATE TO THE SALES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CONSUMER SATISFACTION;

THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; CARE DELIVERY; NETWORK CAPABILITIES; MARKET SHARE; PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS; FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION. IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE

EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK

FACTORS, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION.

PROPOSED HEALTH CARE REFORMS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, FINANCIAL POSITION AND OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS HAVE RECENTLY PASSED BILLS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE REFORM, WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN

RECONCILED WITH EACH OTHER AND SIGNED INTO LAW. EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSALS INCLUDE POLICY CHANGES THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING HAVING THE FEDERAL OR ONE OR MORE STATE GOVERNMENTS ASSUME A LARGER

ROLE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SUCH AS COMPETING WITH PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS, IMPOSING NEW AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON HEALTH INSURERS AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, GUARANTEED COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, ELIMINATION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITION

EXCLUSIONS OR ANNUAL LIFETIME MAXIMUM LIMITS, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, OR RESTRUCTURING THE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID PROGRAMS, INCLUDING REDUCING PAYMENTS TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE

ADVANTAGE OVER THE INTERMEDIATE TERM. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED VARIOUS FORMS OF MANAGED CARE REFORM LEGISLATION, WHICH, IF ADOPTED, COULD FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF COVERAGE DECISIONS UNDER ERISA.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS LEGISLATIVE INTEREST IN MODIFYING ERISAS PREEMPTIVE EFFECT ON STATE LAWS. IF ADOPTED, SUCH LIMITATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR LIABILITY EXPOSURE AND COULD PERMIT GREATER STATE REGULATION OF OUR OPERATIONS.

A NUMBER OF STATE LEGISLATURES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, NEW YORK, OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA, HAVE CONTEMPLATED BUT HAVE NOT ENACTED

SIGNIFICANT REFORM OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. OTHER STATES ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIDER SIGNIFICANT REFORM OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS AS WELL AS MORE MODEST REFORMS AIMED AT EXPANDING MEDICAID AND/OR SCHIP ELIGIBILITY AND NEW

COVERAGE OPTIONS FOR THOSE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE PROVISIONS AFFECTING BOTH PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND PRIVATELY FINANCED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. STATES ALSO ARE CONSIDERING PROPOSALS THAT

WOULD REFORM THE UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING PRACTICES OF INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS BY, FOR EXAMPLE, PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON RATING AND PRICING AND MANDATING MINIMUM MEDICAL BENEFIT COST RATIOS.

THE ENACTMENT OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL MAY AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS,

HOSPITALS AND/OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; MEDICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER COSTS; PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT METHODS AND PAYMENT RATES; PREMIUM RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; MANDATED BENEFITS; MINIMUM MEDICAL EXPENDITURES; CLAIM

PAYMENTS AND PROCESSING; DRUG UTILIZATION AND PATIENT SAFETY EFFORTS; COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, MAINTENANCE AND DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION; PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS; CONSUMER-DRIVEN HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH SAVINGS

ACCOUNTS AND INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS; AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS.

WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME

LAW, OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS OR THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO SUCH LAWS WILL BE. ANY HEALTH CARE REFORMS ENACTED MAY BE PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT, IF ENACTED, COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES, INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO

EXPANDED LIABILITY AND REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL,

AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH CHANGES.

IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY ESTIMATE, PRICE FOR AND MANAGE OUR

MEDICAL COSTS, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COULD DECLINE AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

UNDER OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. WE GENERALLY USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO 85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO

PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MEDICAL COSTS.

WE MANAGE MEDICAL COSTS THROUGH UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, PRODUCT DESIGN, NEGOTIATION

OF FAVORABLE PROVIDER CONTRACTS AND CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM REVENUE ON COMMERCIAL POLICIES IS TYPICALLY FIXED FOR A

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. OUR REVENUE ON MEDICARE POLICIES IS BASED ON BIDS SUBMITTED IN JUNE THE YEAR BEFORE THE CONTRACT YEAR. WE

BASE THE PREMIUMS WE CHARGE AND OUR MEDICARE BIDS ON OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAL COSTS OVER THE FIXED CONTRACT PERIOD; HOWEVER, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, REGULATION AND OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND

REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS OR BIDS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED USE OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES, CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER

REGULATORY CHANGES, INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. AS A MEASURE OF THE IMPACT OF MEDICAL COSTS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL

COSTS OR UTILIZATION RATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED BY 1% WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL CHANGE IN RELATED REVENUES FOR COMMERCIAL INSURED PRODUCTS, OUR

ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2009 WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY

PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR WHICH CLAIMS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE AN EXTENSIVE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO LOW, THEY WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE

RESULTS.

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLY REGULATED; NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THEIR

ENFORCEMENT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT

THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2009, CMS IMPLEMENTED A REDUCTION IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

REIMBURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY 5% FOR 2010. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ADJUSTED MEMBERS BENEFITS AND PREMIUMS ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, TERMINATED BENEFIT PLANS IN CERTAIN COUNTIES, AND INTENSIFIED BOTH OUR MEDICAL AND OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT IN RESPONSE

TO THESE RATE REDUCTIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY ON THESE OR OTHER STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH REDUCTIONS.

THE BROAD LATITUDE THAT IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR

BUSINESS, AS WELL AS FUTURE LAWS AND RULES, COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND

STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN OCTOBER 2008 CONGRESS ENACTED THE PAUL WELLSTONE AND PETE DOMENICI MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2008 (MHPAEA), WHICH REQUIRES

INSURERS TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER BENEFITS UNDER TERMS THAT ARE NO MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THOSE APPLIED TO MEDICAL AND SURGICAL BENEFITS. THE MHPAEA SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED THE SECRETARIES OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

AND THE TREASURY TO ISSUE REGULATIONS TO EFFECTUATE THE LEGISLATION. ALTHOUGH REGULATIONS REGARDING HOW THE MHPAEA WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WERE ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2010 IN THE FORM OF AN INTERIM FINAL RULE, FINAL REGULATIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

PUBLISHED. BECAUSE OF THE BROAD RANGE OF TREATMENT LIMITATIONS TO WHICH PARITY IS EXPECTED TO APPLY UNDER THE REGULATIONS, THE REGULATIONS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH INSURED AND SELF-INSURED PLANS FOR

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND SERVICES AND IMPACT OUR MARKET FOR CARVE-OUT HEALTH BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.

WE MUST ALSO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, INCLUDING

INTEGRATION OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. DELAYS IN OBTAINING APPROVALS OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

IN AUGUST 2007, WE ENTERED INTO A MULTI-STATE NATIONAL AGREEMENT WITH REGULATORY OFFICES IN 39 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RELATING TO UNITEDHEALTHCARES FULLY INSURED COMMERCIAL BUSINESS

ADMINISTERED ON THE

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORGANIZATIONS MAIN PROCESSING PLATFORMS. THE AGREEMENT COVERS SEVERAL KEY AREAS OF REVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CLAIMS PAYMENT ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, APPEALS AND

GRIEVANCES RESOLUTION TIMELINESS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL NETWORK/SERVICE, UTILIZATION REVIEW, EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS ACCURACY, AND OVERSIGHT AND DUE DILIGENCE OF CONTRACTED ENTITIES AND VENDOR PERFORMANCE. THE AGREEMENT ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED

PAST REGULATORY MATTERS RELATED TO THE AREAS OF REVIEW PRIOR TO AUGUST 2007 AND ESTABLISHES A TRANSPARENT FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING AND REGULATING PERFORMANCE THROUGH DECEMBER 2010. THE AGREEMENT IS SIMILAR TO A CUSTOMER PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE,

WHEREBY WE SELF REPORT QUARTERLY AND ANNUALLY OUR CURRENT OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ON A SET OF NATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AGREED TO BY THE PARTICIPATING STATES. WE MUST PERFORM TO THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, OR BE SUBJECT TO FINES

AND PENALTIES.

WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ROUTINE,

REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, U.S.

CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE IRS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2007, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE EXAMINED OUR PACIFICARE HEALTH

INSURANCE PLAN IN CALIFORNIA. THE EXAMINATION FINDINGS RELATED TO CLAIMS PROCESSING ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INTEREST PAYMENTS, TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF PROVIDER CONTRACTS, TIMELY, ACCURATE PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND OTHER

RELATED MATTERS. THE MATTER IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF OUR ADMINISTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WITH

RESPECT TO ERISA COMPLIANCE. REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS SORT CAN LEAD TO GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE

WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, INCLUDING NEGATIVE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ROUTINE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK

PRICE, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND RESULT IN INCREASED REGULATION AND LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES, WHICH MAY FURTHER INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY BY ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, REQUIRING US TO CHANGE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR INCREASING THE REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES, SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE CURRENT RECESSIONARY U.S. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT

RATES AND SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT LAYOFFS AND DOWNSIZINGS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO LEAD TO LOWER ENROLLMENT IN OUR EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS, LOWER ENROLLMENT IN OUR NON-EMPLOYER INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND A HIGHER NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OPTING OUT OF OUR

EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS. ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE EMPLOYERS TO STOP OFFERING CERTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OR ELECT TO OFFER THIS COVERAGE ON A VOLUNTARY, EMPLOYEE-FUNDED BASIS AS A MEANS

TO REDUCE THEIR OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EMPLOYER GROUP RENEWAL PROSPECTS AND OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PREMIUMS AND COULD RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY OUR

CUSTOMERS. ALL OF THESE COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN OUR MEMBERSHIP LEVELS AND PREMIUM AND FEE REVENUES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF

HOSPITALS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS AND THEREFORE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONTRACTED RATES WITH THESE PARTIES AND INCREASE OUR MEDICAL COSTS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, RESULTING IN

REDUCED REIMBURSEMENTS OR PAYMENTS IN OUR FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND SCHIP. A REDUCTION IN STATE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PAYMENTS ALREADY

NEGOTIATED AND/OR RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETARY PRESSURES COULD CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE NEW OR A HIGHER LEVEL OF TAXES OR

ASSESSMENTS FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND SURCHARGES ON SELECT FEE-FOR-SERVICE AND CAPITATED MEDICAL CLAIMS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES PROVIDING PBM SERVICES FACE REGULATORY AND OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PBM INDUSTRY THAT MAY DIFFER

FROM THE RISKS OF OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING MANAGED CARE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

WE PROVIDE PBM SERVICES THROUGH OUR PRESCRIPTION

SOLUTIONS AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES. EACH BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE ANTI-KICKBACK AND OTHER LAWS THAT GOVERN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE

LEGISLATURES REGULARLY CONSIDER NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OR REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR PBM BUSINESSES.

OUR PBM

BUSINESSES PROVIDE SERVICES TO SPONSORS OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ERISA. THE DOL, WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT ENFORCES ERISA, COULD ASSERT THAT THE FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE APPLY TO SOME OR ALL OF THE SERVICES

PROVIDED BY OUR PBM BUSINESSES EVEN WHERE OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO ASSUME FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS. IN THE EVENT A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS APPLY TO OUR PBM BUSINESSES IN CONNECTION WITH SERVICES

FOR WHICH OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO ASSUME FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS OR ENTERING INTO CERTAIN PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS ALSO CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS A MAIL ORDER PHARMACY, WHICH SUBJECTS IT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE

FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. FURTHER, PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS IS SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARDS, WHICH IS A MULTIFACETED

SECURITY STANDARD THAT INCLUDES REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT, POLICIES, PROCEDURES, NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE DESIGN AND OTHER CRITICAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES TO PROTECT CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DATA AS MANDATED BY THE CREDIT CARD BRANDS. THE

FAILURE TO ADHERE TO SUCH STANDARDS COULD EXPOSE PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS TO LIABILITY OR IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, OUR PBM BUSINESSES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO CONTRACT ON FAVORABLE TERMS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND COULD FACE POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED ERRORS BY OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES,

INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. DISRUPTIONS AT ANY OF OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES DUE TO FAILURE OF TECHNOLOGY OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OR DISRUPTION TO

THESE SYSTEMS OR TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE DUE TO FIRE, ELECTRICAL OUTAGE, NATURAL DISASTER, ACTS OF TERRORISM OR SOME OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND DISPENSE PRESCRIPTIONS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO

CUSTOMERS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN

BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT

THE UNITED STATES AND FACE COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES ON THE BASIS OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICE OF BENEFITS OFFERED AND COST AND RISK OF ALTERNATIVES, LOCATION AND CHOICE OF

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE,

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPREHENSIVENESS OF COVERAGE OFFERED, REPUTATION FOR QUALITY CARE, FINANCIAL STABILITY AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR OUR HEALTH BENEFITS REPORTING SEGMENT, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA

INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HEALTH NET, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE, WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND

OTHER ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKET SEGMENTS SUCH AS MEDICARE SPECIALTY SERVICES. FOR OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, COMPETITORS INCLUDE MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., CVS/CAREMARK CORPORATION AND EXPRESS

SCRIPTS, INC. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND INGENIX REPORTING SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A BROAD AND DIVERSE SET OF OTHER BUSINESSES.

WE BELIEVE THAT

BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN MANY MARKETS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL, SO THE ADDITION OF NEW COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CUSTOMERS ENJOY SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS. IN PARTICULAR MARKETS, COMPETITORS MAY HAVE

CAPABILITIES OR RESOURCES THAT GIVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. GREATER MARKET SHARE, ESTABLISHED REPUTATION, SUPERIOR SUPPLIER OR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER FACTORS ALL CAN PROVIDE A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR TO THEIR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BOTH AS TO OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND OTHER CARE PROFESSIONALS) IN THESE INDUSTRIES. CONSOLIDATION MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS, TO

IMPROVE THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, OR TO MAINTAIN OR ADVANCE PROFITABILITY. IF WE DO NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR MARKETS, IF WE SET RATES TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, IF WE DO NOT DESIGN AND PRICE

OUR PRODUCTS PROPERLY AND COMPETITIVELY, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INNOVATE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT DEMONSTRATE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IF WE DO NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY LEVEL OF SERVICES, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DOES

NOT INCREASE AS WE EXPECT, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DECLINES, OR IF WE LOSE ACCOUNTS WITH MORE PROFITABLE PRODUCTS WHILE RETAINING OR INCREASING MEMBERSHIP IN ACCOUNTS WITH LESS PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AS A PAYER IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAM FUNDING, ENROLLMENTS, PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS AND AUDITS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING AS A PAYER IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, VARIOUS MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP, AND RECEIVE

REVENUES FROM THESE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR

ADMINISTRATIVE OR MEDICAL COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, CMS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED A REDUCTION IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REIMBURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY 5% FOR 2010. SUCH CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND WILLINGNESS

TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICARE

ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, AND VARIOUS MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP OCCURS THROUGH BIDS THAT ARE SUBMITTED PERIODICALLY. REVENUES FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PERIODIC FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND

ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING THROUGH VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS. FUNDING FOR THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AT THE FEDERAL OR APPLICABLE

STATE LEVEL, AND GENERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AND PRIORITIES. A REDUCTION OR LESS THAN EXPECTED INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS OR CHANGE IN ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CMS USES VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING DETERMINING PAYMENTS BY CONSIDERING THE RISK STATUS

OF OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS AS SUPPORTED BY PROVIDER MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENTATION. FEDERAL REGULATORS AUDIT THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS AND CAN REVISE PAYMENTS BASED ON THE AUDIT FINDINGS. CMS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 THAT IT WILL PERFORM AUDITS OF SELECTED

MEDICARE HEALTH PLANS EACH YEAR TO

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALIDATE THE CODING PRACTICES OF AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MAINTAINED BY CARE PROVIDERS. THESE AUDITS INVOLVE A REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS MAINTAINED BY PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AND OUT OF

NETWORK, AND MAY RESULT IN PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO HEALTH PLANS PURSUANT TO CMS MEDICARE CONTRACTS. CERTAIN OF OUR PLANS HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR AUDIT. THE FIRST AUDITS FOCUSED ON MEDICAL RECORDS SUPPORTING RISK

ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR 2006 THAT WERE USED TO DETERMINE 2007 PAYMENT AMOUNTS. THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR HHS IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF OUR RISK ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR TWO PLANS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE AUDITS. HOWEVER, ANY

MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ACQUIRE MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND

SCHIP ENROLLEES IS IMPACTED BY BIDS AND PLAN DESIGNS SUBMITTED BY OUR COMPETITORS AND US. UNDER THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM, STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES ARE PERIODICALLY REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO SEEK BIDS FROM ELIGIBLE HEALTH PLANS TO CONTINUE

THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACUTE CARE MEDICAID HEALTH PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING RENEWALS OF STATE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS THAT WERE ENROLLED IN THOSE MEDICAID PLANS. UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D

PROGRAM, TO QUALIFY FOR AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME MEMBERS, OUR BIDS MUST RESULT IN AN ENROLLEE PREMIUM BELOW A THRESHOLD, WHICH IS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER OUR BIDS ARE SUBMITTED. IF THE ENROLLEE PREMIUM IS NOT BELOW THE GOVERNMENT

THRESHOLD, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS WHO WERE AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LOST APPROXIMATELY 650,000 OF OUR AUTO-ENROLLED LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY MEMBERS IN 2008 BECAUSE CERTAIN OF OUR

BIDS EXCEEDED THRESHOLDS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN GENERAL, OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT, UTILIZATION, MEDICAL COSTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MATERIALLY INCORRECT OR OUR

COMPETITORS BIDS AND POSITIONING ARE DIFFERENT THAN ANTICIPATED, EITHER AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.

IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND

OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THESE COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN

SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, WHETHER IN-NETWORK OR OUT-OF-NETWORK, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS

FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET

POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART. IN ADDITION, PHYSICIAN OR PRACTICE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WHICH AGGREGATE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND MARKETING LEVERAGE, MAY COMPETE

DIRECTLY WITH US. IF THESE PROVIDERS REFUSE TO CONTRACT WITH US, USE THEIR MARKET POSITION TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE CONTRACTS OR PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET PRODUCTS OR TO BE PROFITABLE IN THOSE AREAS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDER THE

TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER RECEIVES A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM TO COVER ALL OR A DEFINED PORTION OF THE MEDICAL COSTS PROVIDED TO THE CAPITATED MEMBER. UNDER SOME CAPITATED ARRANGEMENTS, THE PROVIDER MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL

COMPENSATION FROM RISK SHARING AND OTHER INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS. CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS, BUT EXPOSE US TO RISK RELATED TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL CARE RESOURCES OF THE

PROFESSIONAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT A CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION FACES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID HEALTH CARE CLAIMS

THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PAID THE PROVIDER UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT. FURTHER, PAYMENT OR OTHER DISPUTES BETWEEN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND SPECIALISTS WITH

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHOM THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A DISRUPTION IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS OR A REDUCTION IN THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR MEMBERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH WHOM WE CONTRACT WILL PROPERLY MANAGE THE COSTS OF SERVICES, MAINTAIN FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OR AVOID DISPUTES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR

MEMBERS AND OUR OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, SOME PROVIDERS THAT RENDER SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE CONTRACTS WITH US. IN THOSE

CASES, WE DO NOT HAVE A PRE-ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PROVIDER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT IS DUE TO THE PROVIDER FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO OUR MEMBERS. IN SOME STATES, THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION DUE TO THESE OUT-OF-NETWORK

PROVIDERS IS DEFINED BY LAW OR REGULATION, BUT IN MOST INSTANCES, IT IS EITHER NOT DEFINED OR IT IS ESTABLISHED BY A STANDARD THAT IS NOT CLEARLY TRANSLATABLE INTO DOLLAR TERMS. IN SOME INSTANCES, PROVIDERS MAY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE UNDERPAID

FOR THEIR SERVICES AND MAY EITHER LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTE WITH US OR TRY TO RECOVER FROM OUR MEMBERS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE PAID THEM AND THE AMOUNT THEY CHARGED US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION WITH

OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN LEGAL MATTERS IN NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT,

RETAIN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN PART THROUGH

INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS WHO ASSIST IN THE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING OF BUSINESS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS, WHO GENERALLY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO US AND WHO

TYPICALLY ALSO RECOMMEND AND/OR MARKET HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF OUR COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, WE MUST COMPETE INTENSELY FOR THEIR SERVICES AND ALLEGIANCE. OUR SALES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN

INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS OR IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SUPPORT, TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO THEM REGARDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS COMPLEX, OR IF OUR SALES STRATEGY IS NOT APPROPRIATELY ALIGNED ACROSS DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS AND AGENTS SELLING HEALTH

CARE PRODUCTS AND THE PAYMENTS THEY RECEIVE. THESE HAVE RESULTED IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AND BROKERS AND AGENTS MARKETING AND SELLING THESE COMPANIES PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, CMS AND STATE DEPARTMENTS OF

INSURANCE HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS AND AGENTS WHO MARKET MEDICARE PRODUCTS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES AND THE IMPOSITION OF

CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND/OR CHANGES TO INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH RESTRICTIONS ON PATIENT PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHO OBTAIN ACCESS TO SENSITIVE PATIENT INFORMATION MAINTAIN ITS CONFIDENTIALITY AND

SECURITY, OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE, PROTECTION, USE,

TRANSMISSION, DISCLOSURE AND DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES ARE REGULATED AT THE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS ADDRESS THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS IN THE FEDERAL GLBA AND IN HIPAA.

HIPAA NOW REQUIRES BUSINESS ASSOCIATES AS WELL AS COVERED ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY

LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES.

EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS

ASSOCIATES AND IN CERTAIN CASES ASSESS OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES SECURITY CONTROLS, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRACTICES. PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ARE ALSO IMPOSED ON US THROUGH CONTROLS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE SECURITY MEASURES

WE HAVE IN PLACE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND RULES, OUR FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES, ACTS OF VANDALISM OR THEFT, COMPUTER VIRUSES, MISPLACED OR LOST

DATA, PROGRAMMING AND/OR HUMAN ERRORS OR OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. COMPLIANCE WITH NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW REGULATIONS, SUCH AS ARRA, WILL RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES (INCLUDING FURTHER

IMPLEMENTATION OF ENCRYPTION AND OTHER DATA PROTECTION STANDARDS), NEW LIMITATIONS OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR BUSINESS MODELS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, AND

INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND FINES AND PENALTIES. THEY ALSO MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND USE OF PATIENT IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT IS HOUSED IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES.

NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PRIVACY OR SECURITY LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR ANY SECURITY BREACH INVOLVING THE MISAPPROPRIATION, LOSS OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE

OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL MEMBER INFORMATION, WHETHER BY US OR BY ONE OF OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING MANDATORY DISCLOSURE TO THE MEDIA, SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND COST OF MANAGING AND REMEDIATING DATA SECURITY INCIDENTS, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, MATERIAL FINES AND PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, AND STATUTORY DAMAGES, LITIGATION, CONSENT ORDERS REGARDING OUR

PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES, ADVERSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR LICENSES TO DO BUSINESS, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP IS

IMPORTANT AND THE LOSS OF SUCH RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS

WITH AARP, WE PROVIDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE, HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS AND MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS TO AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS. ONE OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP EXPANDS

THE RELATIONSHIP TO INCLUDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS FOR AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS. OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP CONTAIN COMMITMENTS REGARDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, DIVERSITY AND MEASURES INTENDED TO

IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE FOR CONSUMERS. THE AARP AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED EARLY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, DEPENDING ON THE AGREEMENT, A MATERIAL BREACH BY EITHER PARTY, INSOLVENCY OF EITHER PARTY, A MATERIAL

ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAMS, MATERIAL HARM TO AARP CAUSED BY THE COMPANY, AND BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO

SERVICE AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COMPETITIVELY, MEET OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND DIVERSITY COMMITMENTS, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND

STATE REGULATORY CHANGES. THE LOSS OF OUR AARP RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LITIGATION ACTIONS, WHICH, IF RESOLVED UNFAVORABLY, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES AND/OR MONETARY DAMAGES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

PERIODICALLY, WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF LEGAL ACTIONS THAT CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS

EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER SUITS, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE

ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE AND PAYMENT (INCLUDING DISPUTES WITH ENROLLEES,

CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTED AND NON-CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS), TORT, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO PARTY TO CERTAIN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

BROUGHT BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS.

WE ARE LARGELY SELF-INSURED WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION RISKS. ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN EXCESS

LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH OUTSIDE INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS PUNITIVE

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DAMAGES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES WILL EXCEED THE LIABILITIES RECORDED.

A DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IS

INCLUDED IN NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE ACTIONS WITH CERTAINTY, AND WE ARE INCURRING EXPENSES IN RESOLVING THESE MATTERS. THEREFORE, THESE LEGAL ACTIONS COULD FURTHER INCREASE OUR

COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY

SUFFER LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME OR EQUITY MARKETS

COULD IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTS OUR INTEREST INCOME AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES OF VARYING MATURITIES, WHICH COMPRISE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS BY ISSUERS, PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHO FAIL TO PAY OR PERFORM ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS, COULD REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES AS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

WE ALSO INVEST A SMALL PROPORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS WILL PRODUCE TOTAL POSITIVE RETURNS OR THAT WE WILL NOT SELL INVESTMENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT ASSETS, AS A RESULT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ILLIQUIDITY OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN ADDITION, IF IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ON

AN ACCELERATED BASIS, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF THE VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MATERIALLY

IMPAIRED, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND DEBT RATINGS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE $23.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, REPRESENTING 39% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY BE

IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE A CHARGE TO EARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ENACTMENT OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES, AS ANY PASSED

LEGISLATION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES. ANY FUTURE EVALUATIONS REQUIRING AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY COULD, IN TURN, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DEBT RATINGS OR POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS.

LARGE-SCALE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL COSTS AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LARGE-SCALE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES CAN TAKE MANY FORMS AND CAN CAUSE WIDESPREAD ILLNESS AND DEATH. SUCH

EMERGENCIES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER, BIOTERRORISM ATTACK, PANDEMIC OR OTHER EXTREME EVENTS, WE COULD FACE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL COSTS AND INCREASED USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ANY SUCH DISASTER OR SIMILAR EVENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OR AVAILABILITY OF OUR DATA OR TO STRATEGICALLY IMPLEMENT

NEW OR UPGRADE OR CONSOLIDATE EXISTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO

ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES AND RECENTLY ENACTED REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO CONSOLIDATE AND INTEGRATE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE

UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN, PROTECT AND ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES

IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING SYSTEMS AND REGULATORY STANDARDS, AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PATTERNS. IF THE INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WERE FOUND TO BE INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OR PROTECT OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE DIFFICULTY PREVENTING,

DETECTING AND CONTROLLING FRAUD, HAVE DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, HAVE REGULATORY SANCTIONS OR PENALTIES IMPOSED, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT OUR PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATING THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE, UPGRADING AND EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES, PROTECTING AND ENHANCING OUR SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPING NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN

INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS ISSUES WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE AND INTEGRATE OUR SYSTEMS SUCCESSFULLY COULD RESULT IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED COSTS AND DIVERSION OF

MANAGEMENTS TIME AND ENERGY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE

NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES COULD BE HINDERED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND OUR TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT

OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE

EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD HINDER OUR

ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO

OBTAIN FUNDS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IS RESTRICTED AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

BECAUSE WE OPERATE AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON DIVIDENDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR

OBLIGATIONS. THESE SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY ARE REGULATED BY STATES DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY LAW TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIC PRESCRIBED MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE LEVELS OF CAPITALIZATION REQUIRED

DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON THE VOLUME OF PREMIUM REVENUES GENERATED. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PREMIUM VOLUME WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITALIZATION FROM US. IN MOST STATES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK PRIOR APPROVAL BY THESE STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

BEFORE WE TRANSFER MONEY OR PAY DIVIDENDS FROM THESE SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. IN ADDITION, WE NORMALLY NOTIFY THE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE PRIOR TO MAKING PAYMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE APPROVAL. AN INABILITY OF OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES COULD IMPACT THE SCALE TO WHICH WE COULD REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR ABILITY TO REPAY

OUR DEBT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY FAILURE BY US TO MANAGE AND COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS SUCCESSFULLY

COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH

THIRD PARTIES REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES, AND OUTSOURCING TRANSACTIONS AND OFTEN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS RELATING TO SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND COMPLETE

SUCCESSFULLY TRANSACTIONS THAT FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY INTERNALLY, WE MAY BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE MARKET

PERCEPTIONS, ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. FOR ACQUISITIONS, SUCCESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT UPON EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AND GROW THESE ACQUISITIONS AND TO REALIZE CONTEMPLATED REVENUE SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

DOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AND CREDIT RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATING ORGANIZATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE

POSITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. RATINGS INFORMATION IS BROADLY DISSEMINATED AND GENERALLY USED THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE OUR CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS TO CERTAIN

OF OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR DEBT RATINGS IMPACT BOTH THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS. EACH OF THE RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATINGS PERIODICALLY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT RATINGS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. OUR

RATINGS REFLECT EACH RATING AGENCYS OPINION OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO MEET OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS. DOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009,

PERFORMANCE

GRAPHS

THE FOLLOWING TWO PERFORMANCE GRAPHS COMPARE THE COMPANYS TOTAL RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH INDEXES OF OTHER SPECIFIED

COMPANIES AND THE S&P 500 INDEX. THE FIRST GRAPH COMPARES THE CUMULATIVE FIVE-YEAR TOTAL RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS ON UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS COMMON STOCK RELATIVE TO THE CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS OF THE S&P 500 INDEX AND A CUSTOMIZED PEER

GROUP (THE 

FORTUNE 50

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

GENERAL

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP IS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING COMPANY, SERVING MORE THAN 70 MILLION AMERICANS. OUR FOCUS IS ON IMPROVING THE OVERALL HEALTH

AND WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM. WE WORK WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER KEY PARTNERS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE. WE HELP PEOPLE GET THE CARE

THEY NEED AT AN AFFORDABLE COST, SUPPORT THE PHYSICIAN/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP, AND EMPOWER PEOPLE WITH THE INFORMATION, GUIDANCE AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO MAKE PERSONAL HEALTH CHOICES AND DECISIONS.

THROUGH OUR DIVERSIFIED FAMILY OF BUSINESSES, WE LEVERAGE CORE COMPETENCIES IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY-BASED TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES; HEALTH CARE DATA,

KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION; AND HEALTH CARE RESOURCE ORGANIZATION AND CARE FACILITATION TO MAKE HEALTH CARE WORK BETTER. THESE CORE COMPETENCIES ARE FOCUSED IN TWO MARKET AREAS, HEALTH BENEFITS AND HEALTH SERVICES. HEALTH BENEFITS ARE OFFERED IN THE

INDIVIDUAL AND EMPLOYER MARKETS AND THE PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS THROUGH OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE, OVATIONS AND AMERICHOICE BUSINESSES. HEALTH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM ITSELF, RANGING FROM EMPLOYERS AND HEALTH

PLANS TO PHYSICIANS AND LIFE SCIENCES COMPANIES THROUGH OUR OPTUMHEALTH, INGENIX AND PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES. IN AGGREGATE, THESE BUSINESSES HAVE MORE THAN TWO DOZEN DISTINCT BUSINESS UNITS THAT ADDRESS SPECIFIC END MARKETS. EACH OF THESE

BUSINESS UNITS FOCUSES ON THE KEY GOALS IN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: ACCESS, AFFORDABILITY, QUALITY AND SIMPLICITY AS THEY APPLY TO THEIR SPECIFIC MARKET.

REVENUES

OUR REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PREMIUMS DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH

INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS FIXED, TYPICALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND WE ASSUME THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING OUR CUSTOMERS HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE ALSO GENERATE REVENUES FROM SERVICES

PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE HEALTH CARE COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES DEPENDANTS. FOR BOTH RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED HEALTH CARE BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS, WE PROVIDE COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES;

TRANSACTION PROCESSING; HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WE ALSO GENERATE SERVICE REVENUES FROM INGENIX HEALTH INTELLIGENCE AND CONTRACT RESEARCH

BUSINESSES. PRODUCT REVENUES ARE MAINLY COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS AND SALES OF INGENIX PUBLISHING AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. WE DERIVE INVESTMENT INCOME PRIMARILY FROM INTEREST EARNED

ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENT INCOME ALSO INCLUDES GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD, OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

OPERATING COSTS

MEDICAL COSTS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON

OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY ESTIMATE, PRICE FOR AND MANAGE OUR MEDICAL COSTS THROUGH UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, PRODUCT DESIGN, NEGOTIATION OF FAVORABLE PROVIDER CONTRACTS AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. CONTROLLING MEDICAL COSTS REQUIRES A

COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED APPROACH TO ORGANIZE AND ADVANCE THE FULL RANGE OF INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG PATIENTS/CONSUMERS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL/TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS.

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEDICAL COSTS INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED

CONSUMERS FOR WHICH WE NEITHER HAVE RECEIVED NOR PROCESSED CLAIMS, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL

COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS.

OUR MEDICAL CARE RATIO, CALCULATED AS MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF

PREMIUM REVENUES, REFLECTS THE COMBINATION OF PRICING, BENEFIT DESIGNS, CONSUMER HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE FACILITATION EFFORTS. WE SEEK TO SUSTAIN A STABLE MEDICAL CARE RATIO FOR AN EQUIVALENT MIX OF BUSINESS, HOWEVER, CHANGES

IN BUSINESS MIX, SUCH AS EXPANDING PARTICIPATION IN COMPARATIVELY HIGHER MEDICAL CARE RATIO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PUBLIC SECTOR PROGRAMS, WILL CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF OUR RESULTS.

OPERATING COSTS.

OPERATING COSTS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF COSTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AGENT AND BROKER COMMISSIONS, PREMIUM TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS, PROFESSIONAL

FEES, ADVERTISING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.

CASH FLOWS

WE GENERATE CASH PRIMARILY FROM PREMIUMS, SERVICE REVENUES AND INVESTMENT INCOME, AS WELL AS PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OR MATURITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS. OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE FOR PAYMENTS OF MEDICAL

CLAIMS, PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR CASH FLOWS, SEE LIQUIDITY BELOW.

BUSINESS TRENDS

OUR BUSINESSES PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. HEALTH ECONOMY, WHICH COMPRISES

APPROXIMATELY 17% OF U.S. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND WHICH HAS GROWN CONSISTENTLY FOR MANY YEARS. WE EXPECT OVERALL SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE IN THE U.S. TO CONTINUE TO RISE IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON INFLATION, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS IN THE U.S. POPULATION

AND NATIONAL INTEREST IN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE RATE OF MARKET GROWTH MAY BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PROPOSED HEALTH CARE REFORMS, WHICH COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE CURRENT U.S. RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAS IMPACTED DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

FOR EXAMPLE, DECREASES IN EMPLOYMENT HAVE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF WORKERS AND DEPENDANTS OFFERED HEALTH CARE BENEFITS BY OUR EMPLOYER CUSTOMERS, PUTTING PRESSURE ON TOP LINE GROWTH FOR OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND OPTUMHEALTH BUSINESSES. THIS WORKPLACE

ATTRITION CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN HALF OF THE 7% DECREASE IN UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL MEMBERSHIP DURING 2009, AND THIS ATTRITION TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT A GENERALLY ELEVATED LEVEL UNTIL NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT STABILIZES. IN CONTRAST,

OUR AMERICHOICE BUSINESS IS EXPERIENCING GROWTH IN ITS STATE MEDICAID OFFERINGS AS EMPLOYMENT RATES FALL. IF THE RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS MAY DECREASE FUNDING FOR VARIOUS

HEALTH CARE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE AND/OR IMPOSE NEW OR HIGHER LEVELS OF TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS. OUR REVENUES ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY U.S. MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY. IN RESPONSE TO RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE

HAS MAINTAINED THE TARGET FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT A RANGE OF ZERO TO 25 BASIS POINTS. CHANGES IN FEDERAL MONETARY POLICY HAVE REDUCED THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT INCOME RECEIVED ON OUR PORTFOLIO ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.

IN TOTAL, WE BELIEVE THAT ECONOMIC RECESSIONS WILL SLOW OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE AND COULD IMPACT OUR OPERATING PROFITABILITY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT

GOVERNMENT FUNDING PRESSURE, COUPLED WITH RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WILL IMPACT THE FINANCIAL POSITIONS OF HOSPITALS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS AND COULD THEREFORE INCREASE MEDICAL COST TRENDS EXPERIENCED BY OUR BUSINESSES. FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING HOW THE ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT.

OUR BUSINESSES MAY BENEFIT FROM ELEMENTS OF THE

FEDERAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT WAS ENACTED IN RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT RECESSION. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE EXPANSION OF FUNDING TO STATE PROGRAMS, WHICH COULD MITIGATE FUNDING PRESSURE FOR AMERICHOICE MEDICAID OFFERINGS AT THE STATE LEVEL, AND

FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD EXPAND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR INGENIX.

PROPOSED HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND

REIMBURSEMENT CHANGES.

BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS HAVE RECENTLY PASSED BILLS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE REFORM, WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN RECONCILED WITH EACH OTHER AND SIGNED INTO LAW. EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSALS INCLUDE POLICY CHANGES

THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING HAVING THE FEDERAL OR ONE OR MORE STATE GOVERNMENTS ASSUME A LARGER ROLE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SUCH AS COMPETING WITH PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS, IMPOSING NEW AND POTENTIALLY

SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON HEALTH INSURERS AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, GUARANTEED COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, ELIMINATION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS OR ANNUAL LIFETIME MAXIMUM LIMITS, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR

UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, OR RESTRUCTURING THE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID PROGRAMS, INCLUDING REDUCING PAYMENTS OVER THE INTERMEDIATE TERM TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME LAW,

OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS OR THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO SUCH LAWS WILL BE. ANY HEALTH CARE REFORMS ENACTED MAY BE PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS, BUT, IF ENACTED, COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES, INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO

EXPANDED LIABILITY AND REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL, AND

CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH CHANGES.

THE ADMINISTRATION AND VARIOUS CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HAVE ADVANCED

PROPOSALS TO REDUCE PAYMENTS OVER THE INTERMEDIATE TERM TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. FURTHER, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) IMPLEMENTED A REDUCTION IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REIMBURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY 5% FOR

2010. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ADJUSTED MEMBERS BENEFITS AND PREMIUMS ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, TERMINATED BENEFIT PLANS IN CERTAIN COUNTIES, AND INTENSIFIED BOTH OUR MEDICAL AND OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THESE RATE REDUCTIONS, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY ON THESE OR OTHER STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM. OUR OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE

REDUCTIONS. IF INDUSTRY-WIDE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MEMBERSHIP DECLINES, THERE IS LIKELY TO BE INCREASED DEMAND FOR MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE AND PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, AND IN BOTH CATEGORIES OVATIONS IS A MARKET LEADER.

WE OPERATE A DIVERSIFIED SET OF HEALTH CARE FOCUSED BUSINESSES; THIS BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A MULTITUDE OF MARKET

SECTORS. THEREFORE, WE COULD SEE SIMULTANEOUS INCREASES AND DECREASES IN DEMAND FOR OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE, SHAPE AND TIMING OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF REFORM DISCUSSIONS WITH

PRECISION OVER THE MID- TO LONG-TERM TIME HORIZON. FOR DISCUSSIONS REGARDING OUR RISKS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE REFORMS, SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS.

ACQUISITIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS

REVENUES

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR 2009 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE HEALTH

BENEFITS REPORTING SEGMENT. THE INCREASE IN PREMIUM REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH IN RISK-BASED OFFERINGS IN OUR PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS BUSINESSES AND PREMIUM RATE INCREASES IN RESPONSE TO GROWTH IN UNDERLYING MEDICAL COSTS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. THE EFFECT OF 2008 HEALTH BENEFITS ACQUISITIONS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN PREMIUM REVENUES DURING 2009.

MEDICAL COSTS

MEDICAL COSTS FOR

2009 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS RISK-BASED BUSINESSES, ELEVATED MEDICAL COSTS DUE TO THE H1N1 INFLUENZA VIRUS, UNEMPLOYMENT-RELATED BENEFIT CONTINUATION PROGRAMS DUE TO AN INCREASED LEVEL OF NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT,

MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES.

FOR EACH PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF REVISIONS

IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS. CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO PRIOR PERIODS, RESULTING FROM MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS REPORTED FOR THE

OF WHICH WAS IN LIEU OF STATE INCOME TAXES IN ONE OF THE STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

35

MEDICARE ADVANTAGE BUSINESS IN NEVADA IN MAY 2008.

INCOME TAX RATE

OUR INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2009 DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS HISTORICAL STATE INCOME TAX MATTERS AND THE CHANGE TO A PREMIUM

TAX IN LIEU OF AN INCOME TAX IN ONE OF THE STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND DECREASED INCOME TAXES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HEALTH BENEFITS

REVENUE GROWTH IN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OUR PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS BUSINESSES AND PREMIUM RATE INCREASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME DRIVEN BY LOWER SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT YIELDS. UNITEDHEALTHCARE REVENUES OF $40.8 BILLION FOR 2009 DECREASED BY $1.0 BILLION, OR 2%, COMPARED TO

2008, AS THE REDUCTION IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PREMIUM RATE INCREASES. OVATIONS REVENUES OF $32.1 BILLION FOR 2009 INCREASED BY $4.1 BILLION, OR 15%, OVER 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH

MEDICARE PART D, MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND STANDARDIZED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT OFFERINGS, AS WELL AS PREMIUM RATE INCREASES. AMERICHOICE GENERATED REVENUES OF $8.4 BILLION FOR 2009, AN INCREASE OF $2.4 BILLION, OR 40%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2008 PERIOD,

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICAID PLANS AND PREMIUM RATE INCREASES AS WELL AS THE FULL YEAR IMPACT FROM THE MID-2008 UNISON ACQUISITION.

THE DECREASE IN HEALTH BENEFITS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $166 MILLION REDUCTION IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME AND A DECREASE IN COMMERCIAL BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE GROWTH IN LOWER MARGIN PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS BUSINESSES. THE 2009 UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICAL CARE RATIO INCREASED TO 84.0% FROM 83.5% IN 2008, LARGELY DUE TO ELEVATED MEDICAL COSTS RELATED TO THE H1N1 INFLUENZA VIRUS AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF

PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING CARE UNDER UNEMPLOYMENT-RELATED BENEFIT CONTINUATION PROGRAMS. HEALTH BENEFITS OPERATING MARGINS DECREASED DUE TO THE FACTORS THAT DECREASED EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.

OPTUMHEALTH

INCREASED OPTUMHEALTH

REVENUES FOR 2009 WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN LARGE-SCALE PUBLIC SECTOR CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR STATE CLIENTS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, OPTUMHEALTH PROVIDED SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY 58 MILLION AND 60 MILLION CONSUMERS, RESPECTIVELY.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGINS FOR 2009 DECREASED DUE TO THE DECREASE IN COMMERCIAL MEMBERSHIP DESCRIBED ABOVE, START-UP COSTS FOR NEW LARGE CONTRACTS AND LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EARNINGS GROWTH FROM

EXPANDING SERVICES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND DISCIPLINED OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT.

INGENIX

IMPROVEMENTS IN INGENIX REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR 2009 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN THE PAYER BUSINESS, NEW

INTERNAL SERVICE OFFERINGS AND THE EFFECT OF 2009 ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASES IN OPERATING MARGINS FOR 2009 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN SERVICES OFFERINGS, INCLUDING OUTSOURCING SERVICES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL CUSTOMERS AND COSTS FOR

INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION, HOSPITAL REVENUE CYCLE MANAGEMENT AND DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS

THE INCREASED PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS REVENUES FOR 2009 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN CUSTOMERS SERVED THROUGH MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS BY

OUR OVATIONS BUSINESS, WHICH IS THE LARGEST CUSTOMER OF THIS REPORTING SEGMENT. INTERSEGMENT REVENUES ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION WERE $12.6 BILLION AND $11.0 BILLION FOR 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR 2009 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO PRESCRIPTION VOLUME GROWTH, STRONG SUCCESS UNDER PERFORMANCE-BASED

PURCHASING ARRANGEMENTS, GAINS IN MAIL SERVICE DRUG FULFILLMENT AND A CONTINUING FAVORABLE MIX SHIFT TO GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2008 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2007 RESULTS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS

REVENUES

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR 2008 INCREASED FROM 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN PREMIUM REVENUE IN THE

HEALTH BENEFITS REPORTING SEGMENT. THE PREMIUM REVENUE GROWTH GENERATED BY OUR HEALTH BENEFITS REPORTING SEGMENT WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER IN THE CONSOLIDATED PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASE. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY

PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS BUSINESSES, PREMIUM RATE INCREASES FOR MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH BOTH UNITEDHEALTHCARE RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND MEDICARE PART D

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME.

THE DECREASE IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER INVESTMENT YIELDS PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASED AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES RELATED TO LOWER OPERATING CASH FLOWS, DECREASED DEPOSITS HELD FOR CERTAIN GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS AND

INCREASED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE DISRUPTION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

MEDICAL COSTS

MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2008 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO MEDICAL COST INFLATION, ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008 AND GROWTH IN OVATIONS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND

MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH BOTH UNITEDHEALTHCARE RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS. FOR 2008 AND 2007, MEDICAL COSTS INCLUDED $230 MILLION

AND $420 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF NET FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS.

OPERATING COSTS

THE OPERATING COST RATIO INCREASED IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN EXPENSES AS DESCRIBED IN 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED

TO 2008 RESULTS ABOVE, ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008, COSTS FOR ANTICIPATED REVENUE GROWTH THAT DID NOT FULLY MATERIALIZE AND A CHANGE IN BUSINESS MIX TOWARDS SERVICE REVENUES FROM FEE-BASED BUSINESSES.

OPERATING COSTS FOR 2007 INCLUDE $176 MILLION OF EXPENSES RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 RELATED TO APPLICATION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES UNDER

SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (SECTION 409A) TO OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THE $176 MILLION SECTION 409A CHARGE INCLUDES $87 MILLION OF EXPENSES FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPTIONHOLDERS TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR

STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED IN 2006 AND EARLY 2007 AND $89 MILLION OF EXPENSES FOR THE MODIFICATION RELATED TO INCREASING THE EXERCISE PRICE OF UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES AND THE RELATED CASH PAYMENTS. FOR AN

EXPANDED DISCUSSION OF OUR SECTION 409A CHARGES, SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.

INCOME TAX RATE

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER EARNINGS RESULTING IN AN INCREASED PROPORTION OF TAX-FREE INVESTMENT INCOME TO TOTAL EARNINGS.

REPORTING SEGMENTS

HEALTH BENEFITS

THE REVENUE GROWTH IN HEALTH BENEFITS FOR 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OUR PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS GROUP, PREMIUM RATE INCREASES FOR MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND THE 2008 ACQUISITIONS OF SIERRA, FISERV HEALTH, AND UNISON, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN ORGANIC DECLINE IN

INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND MEDICARE PART D PRODUCTS AND A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME. UNITEDHEALTHCARE REVENUES OF $41.8 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED OVER THE COMPARABLE 2007 PERIOD BY $1.6 BILLION, OR 4%. THE

UNITEDHEALTHCARE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE SAME FACTORS AS DISCUSSED FOR HEALTH BENEFITS IN 2008. OVATIONS REVENUES OF $28.1 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED OVER THE COMPARABLE 2007 PERIOD BY $1.6 BILLION, OR 6%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO AN INCREASE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH THE STANDARDIZED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS GAINED THROUGH BOTH ORGANIC GROWTH AND THE SIERRA ACQUISITION AND PREMIUM RATE INCREASES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET ORGANIC

DECREASE OF 675,000 STAND-ALONE MEDICARE PART D MEMBERS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REASSIGNMENT BY CMS OF CERTAIN DUAL-ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME BENEFICIARIES BASED ON ANNUAL PRICE BIDS. AMERICHOICE GENERATED REVENUES OF $6.0 BILLION IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF

$1.5 BILLION, OR 34%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2007 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICAID PLANS, PREMIUM RATE INCREASES AND THE ACQUISITION OF UNISON IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008.

THE DECREASE IN HEALTH BENEFITS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRESSURE ON ENROLLMENT AND GROSS MARGINS IN THE UNITEDHEALTHCARE RISK-BASED

BUSINESS AND PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS IN MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ACQUISITIONS. THE UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICAL CARE RATIO INCREASED TO 83.5% IN 2008 FROM 82.6% IN 2007. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE

EFFECTS OF A COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT WHERE PRICE INCREASES, NET OF CUSTOMER BENEFIT PACKAGE CHANGES, DID NOT FULLY MATCH THE RISE IN MEDICAL COSTS, AND AN INCREASED MIX OF NATIONAL ACCOUNT PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT BUSINESS, WHICH TYPICALLY

CARRIES A HIGHER MEDICAL CARE RATIO. HEALTH BENEFITS OPERATING MARGIN WAS 6.7% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, A DECREASE FROM 9.3% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS INCREASED DUE TO ACQUISITIONS, WHICH INCLUDED THE ADDITION OF 1,315,000 FEE-BASED MEMBERS FROM

FISERV HEALTH AND THE ADDITION OF 310,000 RISK-BASED INDIVIDUALS GAINED THROUGH THE SIERRA ACQUISITION. THESE ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS OF 805,000, OR 3%, FROM DECEMBER 31,

2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND THE IMPACT OF A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRICING ENVIRONMENT. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCREASED THROUGH THE ADDITION OF 60,000 SENIORS FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SIERRA AND ORGANIC GROWTH OF 95,000 SENIORS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DIVESTITURE OF 30,000 INDIVIDUALS IN NEVADA RELATED TO THE SIERRA ACQUISITION.

MEDICAID ENROLLMENT GREW DUE TO THE ADDITION OF 320,000 AND 60,000 INDIVIDUALS FROM OUR UNISON AND SIERRA ACQUISITIONS, RESPECTIVELY, AND STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH OF 425,000 INDIVIDUALS.

OPTUMHEALTH

INCREASED REVENUES IN OPTUMHEALTH WERE DRIVEN BY RATE INCREASES FOR

MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND AN INCREASED NUMBER OF CONSUMERS SERVED BY THIS SEGMENT. OPTUMHEALTH PROVIDED SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY 60 MILLION CONSUMERS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION INDIVIDUALS

YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN DECREASED DUE TO THE INCREASED COSTS FOR RISK-BASED BEHAVIORAL AND SPECIALTY

BENEFITS BUSINESSES AND THE MIX OF CONTINUED GROWTH IN LOWER MARGIN BUSINESS.

INGENIX

THE IMPROVEMENT IN INGENIX REVENUES WAS DUE TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN ITS HEALTH INTELLIGENCE AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES AS WELL AS FROM BUSINESS

ACQUISITIONS. THE DECREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS STAFFING COSTS DURING 2008 FOR CERTAIN RESEARCH PROJECTS, WHICH WERE CANCELLED, AS WELL AS LOWER DEMAND FOR CERTAIN CONSULTING SERVICES DUE TO

THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS

THE DECREASED PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED RELATED TO THE REASSIGNMENT OF DUAL-ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES DESCRIBED ABOVE THROUGH

MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS BY OUR OVATIONS BUSINESS, AND A SHIFT FROM NAME BRAND PHARMACEUTICALS TOWARDS GENERIC UTILIZATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES RELATED TO THE FISERV HEALTH ACQUISITION AND GROWTH IN BUSINESS WITH UNAFFILIATED

CLIENTS. INTERSEGMENT REVENUES ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION WERE $11.0 BILLION AND $12.4 BILLION FOR 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

PRESCRIPTION

SOLUTIONS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FISERV HEALTH ACQUISITION, GAINS IN MAIL SERVICE DRUG FULFILLMENT, AND A CONTINUING FAVORABLE MIX SHIFT TO GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS.

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY

INTRODUCTION

WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY. WE CONTINUALLY FORECAST AND MANAGE OUR CASH, INVESTMENTS,

WORKING CAPITAL BALANCES AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS WHILE MAINTAINING LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE PRINCIPALLY FROM EARNINGS BEFORE

DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NON-CASH EXPENSES. AS A RESULT, ANY FUTURE DECLINE IN OUR PROFITABILITY MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. THE DIVERSITY OF OUR BUSINESSES, OUR GEOGRAPHIC AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY AND OUR DISCIPLINED

UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROCESSES FOR OUR RISK-BASED BUSINESSES, WHICH SEEK TO MATCH PREMIUM RATE INCREASES WITH FUTURE EXPECTED MEDICAL COSTS, PARTIALLY MITIGATES THE RISK OF RISING MEDICAL AND OPERATING COSTS.

OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. A MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS HELD BY OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE IN THE FORM OF

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS. AFTER CONSIDERING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE GENERALLY INVEST CASH OF REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTED SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS IN LONGER TERM, INVESTMENT-GRADE, MARKETABLE

DEBT SECURITIES TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT RETURN. WE MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS PURSUANT TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED INVESTMENT POLICY, WHICH FOCUSES ON PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, CREDIT QUALITY, DIVERSIFICATION, INCOME AND DURATION.

THE POLICY ALSO GENERALLY GOVERNS RETURN OBJECTIVES, REGULATORY LIMITATIONS, TAX IMPLICATIONS AND RISK TOLERANCES.

OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES

ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES OF DOMICILE. MOST OF THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS CONFORM TO THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF

EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS, THESE STANDARDS GENERALLY PERMIT DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID FROM STATUTORY UNASSIGNED SURPLUS OF THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARY AND ARE LIMITED BASED ON THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL

AND SURPLUS. THESE DIVIDENDS ARE REFERRED TO AS ORDINARY DIVIDENDS AND GENERALLY CAN BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF THE DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DIVIDENDS PAID WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED

STATUTORY LIMIT OR IS PAID FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN EARNED SURPLUS, IT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AN EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDEND AND MUST RECEIVE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL.

IN 2009, BASED ON THE 2008 STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVELS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ORDINARY DIVIDENDS THAT COULD BE PAID WAS $3.1 BILLION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES PAID THEIR PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF $4.2 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.5 BILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES PAID THEIR PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF

$4.2 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.2 BILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS. THE INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS TO TOTAL DIVIDENDS IN 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE ACCELERATION OF DIVIDEND TIMING, AS WELL AS THE SIZE OF SPECIFIC DIVIDENDS

BEYOND ORDINARY LEVELS. GIVEN EXPECTED STATUTORY CAPITAL LEVELS, WE ANTICIPATE LOWER OVERALL REGULATED SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS IN 2010.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR NON-REGULATED BUSINESSES ALSO GENERATE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE. CASH FLOWS

GENERATED BY THESE ENTITIES, COMBINED WITH DIVIDENDS FROM OUR REGULATED ENTITIES AND FINANCING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXPANDING OUR SERVICES THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, REPAYING DEBT AND/OR REPURCHASING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK,

DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

2009 CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO 2008 CASH FLOWS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $1.4 BILLION, OR 33%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENT IN 2008 OF $573 MILLION, NET OF TAXES, FOR THE SETTLEMENT

OF TWO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATED TO OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, THE 2009 INCREASE IN MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE DRIVEN BY MEMBERSHIP GROWTH IN RISK-BASED PRODUCTS IN THE PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS BUSINESSES, AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES TO

OUR RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE BALANCES WITH CMS RELATED TO MEDICARE PART D. ADDITIONALLY, WE PAID LESS TAXES IN 2009 DUE TO TAX LAW CHANGES THAT TOOK EFFECT IN 2008. OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN 2008 INCLUDED PAYMENT OF 2007 TAXES DUE UNDER THE PRIOR TAX

LAW, WHILE THE 2009 PAYMENT DID NOT INCLUDE PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS. WE ANTICIPATE LOWER CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2010 AS COMPARED TO 2009 AS A RESULT OF AN ANTICIPATED DECREASE IN NET EARNINGS, THE TIMING OF CERTAIN CMS PAYMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF A

LEGISLATED CHANGE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR MEDICARE PART D CLAIMS.

CASH FLOWS USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $4.1 BILLION, OR

81%, PRIMARILY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008 AND DECREASES IN THE USAGE OF CASH IN 2009 FOR PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE 2009 DECREASES IN SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS.

CASH FLOWS USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $1.7 BILLION DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2008 AND THE EFFECT OF OUR CHANGE IN INTENT WITH

RESPECT TO OFFSETTING CASH BALANCES IN EXCESS OF BANK DEPOSITS IN 2008. SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL OF OUR POLICY ON OFFSETTING CASH BALANCES. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES IN 2009 AND THE 2009 PROCEEDS FROM OUR TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2008 CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO 2007 CASH FLOWS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $1.6 BILLION, OR 28%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN NET EARNINGS, WHICH INCLUDED PAYMENTS FOR THE

SETTLEMENT OF TWO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

CASH FLOWS USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $925 MILLION, OR 22%, PRIMARILY

DUE TO ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008 AND INCREASES IN THE USAGE OF CASH IN 2008 FOR PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS OFFSET BY THE 2008 DECREASES IN SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS.

CASH FLOWS USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $2.6 BILLION, OR 81%, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES IN 2008 OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF OUR CHANGE IN INTENT WITH RESPECT TO

OFFSETTING CASH BALANCES IN EXCESS OF BANK DEPOSITS IN 2008.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENT AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT BALANCES OF $24.2 BILLION INCLUDED $9.8 BILLION OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS (WHICH INCLUDED $2.3 BILLION HELD BY NON-REGULATED ENTITIES), $13.8 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES AND $577 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO HELD IN CASH EQUIVALENTS, WE

DO NOT ANTICIPATE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. THE USE OF DIFFERENT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS OR VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, PRIMARILY USED IN VALUING OUR LEVEL 3 EQUITY

SECURITIES, MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS OF OUR INVESTMENTS. DUE TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, THE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE ACTUAL EXIT PRICE IF WE HAD SOLD THE INVESTMENT AT THE MEASUREMENT

DATE. OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, PRIMARILY FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, REDUCE THE NEED TO SELL INVESTMENTS IN ADVERSE MARKETS. SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE DURATION OF 2.1 YEARS AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF AA AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009. INCLUDED IN THE DEBT SECURITIES BALANCE WERE $3.0 BILLION OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE GUARANTEED BY THIRD PARTIES. A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GUARANTORS GUARANTEE THE SECURITIES, AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY

SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE GUARANTOR (NEITHER INDIRECT THROUGH THE GUARANTEES, NOR DIRECT THROUGH INVESTMENT IN THE GUARANTOR). FURTHER, DUE TO THE HIGH UNDERLYING CREDIT RATING OF THE ISSUERS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THESE

SECURITIES BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT THE GUARANTEE IS AA AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND USES OF LIQUIDITY

IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AT OUR REGULATED AND UNREGULATED ENTITIES, OUR

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

COMMERCIAL PAPER.

WE MAINTAIN A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH

FACILITATES THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT SOLD ON A DISCOUNT BASIS WITH MATURITIES OF UP TO 270 DAYS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM IS SUPPORTED BY THE $2.5 BILLION BANK CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW. WE

DID NOT HAVE ANY COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

BANK CREDIT FACILITY.

WE HAVE A FIVE-YEAR

REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITY WITH 23 BANKS, WHICH MATURES IN MAY 2012. THIS FACILITY SUPPORTS OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009. THE INTEREST RATE IS VARIABLE BASED ON TERM AND AMOUNT AND IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) PLUS A SPREAD. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE INTEREST RATE ON THIS FACILITY, HAD IT BEEN DRAWN, WOULD HAVE RANGED

FROM 0.4% TO 0.7%.

OUR BANK CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS VARIOUS COVENANTS, THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A

DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO BELOW 50%. OUR DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO, CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WAS 32.1% AND 38.1% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND DECEMBER 31, 2008, RESPECTIVELY. WE COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING IN THE FORM OF DEBT OR EQUITY IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING

OUR PROFITABILITY, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, DEBT LEVELS, CREDIT RATINGS, DEBT COVENANTS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR

CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING FOR US OR LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL. WE HAVE THEREFORE ADOPTED STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS TOWARD MAINTAINING FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH FACTORS ON OUR

ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL.

DEBT TENDER.

IN FEBRUARY 2010, WE COMPLETED CASH TENDER OFFERS FOR $775 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF CERTAIN OF OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES. WE BELIEVE THIS DEBT REPURCHASE WILL IMPROVE THE MATCHING OF FLOATING RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AND REDUCE OUR DEBT SERVICE COST. WE USED CASH ON HAND TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE

NOTES.

SHARE REPURCHASES.

UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, WE MAINTAIN A COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES IN THE OPEN MARKET. IN 2009, WE REPURCHASED 74.3 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $24 PER SHARE AND AN AGGREGATE COST OF $1.8 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, WE HAD BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 28.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE BOARD RENEWED AND INCREASED OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND AUTHORIZED US TO REPURCHASE UP TO

120 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

TO THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING PAYMENT TIMING, OBLIGATIONS FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS THEREAFTER.

WE DO NOT HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR COMMITMENTS THAT REQUIRE CASH RESOURCES; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO

EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS. THIS INCLUDES INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS, AND MAY INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE OR KNOWINGLY SEEK TO PARTICIPATE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERATE

RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN ANY SPE TRANSACTIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) NO. 2009-13, MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS (ASU 2009-13). THIS UPDATE REMOVES THE CRITERION THAT ENTITIES MUST USE OBJECTIVE AND RELIABLE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE IN SEPARATELY ACCOUNTING FOR

DELIVERABLES AND PROVIDES ENTITIES WITH A HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THE NEW GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES ENTITIES TO ALLOCATE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO THE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING

BASED ON THE DELIVERABLES RELATIVE SELLING PRICE. THE PROVISIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED IN OUR FISCAL YEAR 2011 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT

OF THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2009-13.

WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT ALL OTHER RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OR DO NOT APPLY TO OUR OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE THOSE ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CHALLENGING, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE THEY MUST

ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVE JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE AND MAY RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS

UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.

MEDICAL COSTS

EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE EITHER NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED OR PROCESSED AND

FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES INCURRED BUT

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT,

CLAIM BACKLOGS, SEASONAL VARIANCES IN MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE UTILIZATION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS, MEMBERSHIP VOLUME AND DEMOGRAPHICS, BENEFIT PLAN CHANGES, AND BUSINESS MIX

CHANGES RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHY. DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND TYPE OF SERVICE, THE TYPICAL BILLING LAG FOR SERVICES CAN BE UP TO 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO MEDICAL CARE

SERVICES ARE KNOWN AND SETTLED WITHIN NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. WE ESTIMATE LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION

AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES.

EACH PERIOD, WE RE-EXAMINE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM

SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES AND INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS

IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS. IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS LESS

THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL DECREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL INCREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN

THE CURRENT PERIOD (UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). MEDICAL COSTS IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, INCLUDED NET FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR PERIODS OF $310 MILLION, $230 MILLION AND $420 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES, WE APPLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATION METHODS DEPENDING ON THE MONTH FOR WHICH INCURRED CLAIMS ARE BEING

ESTIMATED. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ACTUARIALLY CALCULATE COMPLETION FACTORS USING AN ANALYSIS OF CLAIM ADJUDICATION PATTERNS OVER THE MOST RECENT 36-MONTH PERIOD. A COMPLETION FACTOR IS AN ACTUARIAL ESTIMATE, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, OF THE

PERCENTAGE OF INCURRED CLAIMS DURING A GIVEN PERIOD THAT HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED BY US AT THE DATE OF ESTIMATION. FOR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE APPLY THE COMPLETION FACTORS TO ACTUAL CLAIMS ADJUDICATED-TO-DATE TO ESTIMATE THE

EXPECTED AMOUNT OF ULTIMATE INCURRED CLAIMS FOR THOSE MONTHS. FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE ESTIMATE CLAIM COSTS INCURRED PRIMARILY BY APPLYING OBSERVED MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS TO THE AVERAGE PER MEMBER PER MONTH (PMPM) MEDICAL COSTS

INCURRED IN PRIOR MONTHS FOR WHICH MORE COMPLETE CLAIM DATA IS AVAILABLE, SUPPLEMENTED BY A REVIEW OF NEAR-TERM COMPLETION FACTORS. MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS ARE DEVELOPED THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF CLAIMS INCURRED IN PRIOR MONTHS AND BY

REVIEWING A BROAD SET OF HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION INDICATORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PHARMACY UTILIZATION TRENDS, INPATIENT HOSPITAL CENSUS DATA AND INCIDENCE DATA FROM THE NATIONAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENTLY

APPLIED FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

COMPLETION FACTORS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS WE USE IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES

FOR OLDER PERIODS, GENERALLY PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE FACTORS AND THE ESTIMATED POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR THOSE PERIODS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THE ANALYSES ABOVE INCLUDE OUTCOMES THAT ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY LIKELY BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE ESTIMATING LIABILITIES FOR INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED BENEFIT CLAIMS.

OUR ESTIMATE OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE REPRESENTS

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR LIABILITY FOR UNPAID MEDICAL COSTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, DEVELOPED USING CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACTUARIAL METHODS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE IS REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE TO

COVER OUR LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009; HOWEVER, ACTUAL CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES. ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL 1% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR DECEMBER 31, 2009 ESTIMATES OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE AND

ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, EXCLUDING AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE, 2009 NET EARNINGS WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BY $52 MILLION AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BY $0.04 PER SHARE.

THE CURRENT NATIONAL HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION RATE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE GENERAL INFLATION RATE. WE USE VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO LESSEN THE EFFECTS OF

HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION. THESE INCLUDE COORDINATING CARE WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND RATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE

PROFESSIONALS, WE EMPHASIZE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE, APPROPRIATE USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, EDUCATION AND CLOSING GAPS IN CARE.

WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES, NEW HEALTH CARE AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, DEMANDS FROM PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS, MAJOR EPIDEMICS, AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE IMPACT OF HEALTH

CARE COST INFLATION. BECAUSE OF THE NARROW OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST TRENDS THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED IN ESTABLISHING PREMIUM RATES CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

REVENUES

REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY DERIVED

FROM HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS. WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY BILLED MONTHLY AT A CONTRACTED RATE PER ELIGIBLE PERSON MULTIPLIED BY THE

TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES, AS RECORDED IN OUR RECORDS. EMPLOYER GROUPS GENERALLY PROVIDE US WITH CHANGES TO THEIR ELIGIBLE POPULATION ONE MONTH IN ARREARS. EACH BILLING INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT FOR PRIOR PERIOD CHANGES IN

ELIGIBILITY STATUS THAT WERE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR PREVIOUS BILLING. WE ESTIMATE AND ADJUST THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ACCORDINGLY. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS, PREMIUMS BILLED, THE LEVEL OF CONTRACT

RENEWAL ACTIVITY AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. WE REVISE ESTIMATES OF REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS EACH PERIOD AND RECORD CHANGES IN THE PERIOD THEY BECOME KNOWN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CMS DEPLOYS A RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL, WHICH APPORTIONS PREMIUMS PAID TO ALL HEALTH PLANS ACCORDING TO HEALTH

SEVERITY AND CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. THE CMS RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL PAYS MORE FOR MEMBERS WHOSE MEDICAL HISTORY INDICATES THEY HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS. UNDER THIS RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY, CMS CALCULATES THE RISK ADJUSTED PREMIUM

PAYMENT USING DIAGNOSIS DATA FROM HOSPITAL INPATIENT, HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT AND PHYSICIAN TREATMENT SETTINGS. WE AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COLLECT, CAPTURE, AND SUBMIT THE NECESSARY AND AVAILABLE DIAGNOSIS DATA TO CMS WITHIN PRESCRIBED

DEADLINES. WE ESTIMATE RISK ADJUSTMENT REVENUES BASED UPON THE DIAGNOSIS DATA SUBMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CMS.

GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO

THE UNDERLYING IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED, WE PERFORM A TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. IN THE FIRST STEP OF THE TEST, THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE COMPARED TO THEIR AGGREGATE

CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED AND NO FURTHER TESTING IS REQUIRED. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING

AMOUNT, WE WOULD PROCEED TO STEP TWO OF THE TEST. IN STEP TWO OF THE TEST, THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED BY A HYPOTHETICAL ALLOCATION OF THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATED IN STEP ONE TO ALL OF THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF THAT REPORTING UNIT (INCLUDING ANY RECOGNIZED AND UNRECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSETS) AS IF THE REPORTING UNIT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND THE FAIR VALUE WAS REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE PAID TO ACQUIRE THE REPORTING UNIT.

THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS, IF ANY, OF THE CALCULATED FAIR VALUE AFTER HYPOTHETICAL ALLOCATION TO THE REPORTING UNITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IS GREATER THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF THE GOODWILL AT THE ANALYSIS DATE, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED AND THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. IF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL AT THE ANALYSIS DATE, GOODWILL IS DEEMED IMPAIRED BY THE AMOUNT OF

THAT VARIANCE.

WE CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES WE MUST

MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS INCLUDE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF FREE CASH FLOW (INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

AND INCOME TAXES), LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES FOR DETERMINING TERMINAL VALUE, AND DISCOUNT RATES. WHERE AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE RESULTS OF OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TEST.

WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AS OF JANUARY 1, 2010 AND DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. ALTHOUGH

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS USED ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THOSE PROJECTIONS. THAT UNCERTAINTY IS INCREASED BY POTENTIAL HEALTH CARE REFORMS AS DISCUSSED IN

PROPOSED HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND REIMBURSEMENT CHANGES ABOVE, AS ANY PASSED LEGISLATION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE FORECASTS AND LONG-TERM GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR SOME OR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND ARE ASSETS THAT REPRESENT FUTURE EXPECTED

BENEFITS BUT LACK PHYSICAL SUBSTANCE (E.G., CUSTOMER LISTS AND TRADEMARKS). WE DO NOT HAVE MATERIAL HOLDINGS OF INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES AND ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT A FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OR ASSET GROUPS) CARRYING VALUE MAY EXCEED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE RECORDED.

WE CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE

USE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE UTILITY TO ESTIMATE CASH FLOWS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING THE CURRENT YEAR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD INVESTMENTS WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $14.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY HELD IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND

ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. WE EXCLUDE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS FROM EARNINGS AND REPORT NET UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE

CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR INVESTMENTS HAD GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS OF $493 MILLION AND GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $50 MILLION. WE EVALUATE INVESTMENTS FOR

IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE

ISSUER AND OUR INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY OR THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF WE INTEND TO EITHER SELL OR DETERMINE THAT WE WILL BE MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL A DEBT SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OR MATURITY OF THE DEBT SECURITY, WE RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE IMPAIRMENT IN EARNINGS. IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY AND WE DETERMINE THAT WE WILL

NOT BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE IMPAIRMENT IS BIFURCATED INTO THE AMOUNT ATTRIBUTED TO THE CREDIT LOSS, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, AND ALL

OTHER CAUSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, WE RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IF WE EXPECT TO HOLD THE EQUITY SECURITY UNTIL FAIR VALUE INCREASES TO AT LEAST THE EQUITY

SECURITYS COST BASIS AND WE EXPECT THAT INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE TO OCCUR IN A REASONABLY FORECASTED PERIOD. IF WE INTEND TO SELL THE EQUITY SECURITY OR IF WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE TO COST WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE NEAR TERM, WE

RECOGNIZE THE IMPAIRMENT IN NET EARNINGS. NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE THESE JUDGMENTS. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR MARKET SECTOR, AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES; STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES; MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF INVESTMENT GRADE QUALITY. SECURITIES DOWNGRADED BELOW POLICY MINIMUMS AFTER PURCHASE WILL BE DISPOSED

OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT POLICY.

INCOME TAXES

OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS REFLECT OUR ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED FUTURE TAXES TO BE PAID ON ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS FOR TAX PURPOSES.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A NET VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF FUTURE BENEFITS IS UNCERTAIN. AFTER

APPLICATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WE ANTICIPATE THAT NO LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY WITH RESPECT TO UTILIZATION OF ANY OF THE OTHER NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES FOR THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS AND TAX CONTINGENCY RESERVES ARE APPROPRIATE BASED ON CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

ACCORDING TO U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (GAAP), A TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION MAY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTIONS OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON

THE TECHNICAL MERITS.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND NON-U.S. INCOME TAX EXPOSURES THAT ARISE AND MEET THE

CRITERIA FOR ACCRUAL UNDER U.S. GAAP. WE PREPARE AND FILE TAX RETURNS BASED ON OUR INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND RECORD ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE JUDGMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, OUR TAX RETURNS ARE

SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES. SUCH EXAMINATIONS MAY RESULT IN FUTURE TAX AND INTEREST ASSESSMENTS BY THESE TAXING AUTHORITIES. INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN ESTIMATES OF TAX CONTINGENCIES DUE TO CHANGES IN TAX LAW RESULTING

FROM LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR AS CONCLUDED THROUGH THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS TAX COURT SYSTEMS.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR ULTIMATE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN EACH YEAR. A HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE OR DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 1% ON OUR 2009 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES TO CHANGE BY $58 MILLION.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

BECAUSE OF THE

NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE ROUTINELY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS DISPUTES, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS. OUR ESTIMATES ARE

DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, IF APPROPRIATE, AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERING OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR SUCH

MATTERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS.

LEGAL MATTERS

A DESCRIPTION OF OUR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 14 OF

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY SUBJECT US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

RISK. OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE MANAGED UNDER AN INVESTMENT POLICY AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS POLICY LIMITS THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE INVESTED IN ANY ONE ISSUER AND GENERALLY LIMITS OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE LIMITED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYER GROUPS THAT CONSTITUTE

OUR CUSTOMER BASE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE $2.0 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF OUR GOLDEN RULE FINANCIAL CORPORATION LIFE AND ANNUITY BUSINESS IN 2005. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORD THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AMOUNTS ARE DEEMED PROBABLE OF RECOVERY. CURRENTLY, THE REINSURER IS RATED BY A.M. BEST AS A. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WERE NO OTHER

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR PRIMARY MARKET RISKS ARE EXPOSURES TO (A) CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED-RATE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS

AND DEBT AND (B) CHANGES IN EQUITY PRICES THAT IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009,

$9.8 BILLION OF OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON WHICH INTEREST RATES RECEIVED VARY WITH MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT INCOME. ALSO, $750 MILLION OF OUR DEBT AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS AT INTEREST RATES THAT VARY WITH MARKET RATES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED-RATE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS

AND DEBT ALSO VARIES WITH MARKET INTEREST RATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, $14.0 BILLION OF OUR INVESTMENTS WERE FIXED-RATE DEBT SECURITIES AND $10.4 BILLION OF OUR DEBT WAS FIXED-RATE TERM DEBT. AN INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES DECREASES

THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-RATE DEBT. CONVERSELY, A DECREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-RATE DEBT.

WE MANAGE EXPOSURE TO MARKET INTEREST RATES BY DIVERSIFYING INVESTMENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT FIXED INCOME MARKET SECTORS AND DEBT ACROSS MATURITIES AND INTEREST RATE INDICES, AS WELL AS ENDEAVORING TO MATCH

OUR FLOATING RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OVER TIME IN NORMAL MARKETS, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTRACTS. AS PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, WE MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF MARKET INTEREST RATES ON INTEREST EXPENSE.

IN JANUARY 2009, WE TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH $4.9 BILLION IN NOTIONAL VALUE TO LOCK-IN THE BENEFIT OF LOW MARKET INTEREST RATES. THIS GAIN WILL BE REALIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE APPLICABLE HEDGED FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A

REDUCTION TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACT OF A HYPOTHETICAL

CHANGE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES BY 1% OR 2% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 ON OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE PER ANNUM, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND DEBT (IN MILLIONS).

GIVEN THE LOW ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF SHORT-TERM MARKET RATES ON OUR FLOATING RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE ASSUMED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN

INTEREST RATES HAS BEEN FLOORED AT ZERO AND DOES NOT REFLECT THE FULL 1% POINT REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAD $577 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, A PORTION OF WHICH WERE INVESTED IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND RELATED

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE OR TECHNOLOGY STOCKS WILL LIKEWISE IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT

WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED (ALSO REFERRED TO AS UNITEDHEALTH

GROUP AND THE COMPANY) IS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING COMPANY DEDICATED TO MAKING HEALTH CARE WORK BETTER. THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND IMPROVING THE OVERALL HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE IT SERVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE COMPANY HELPS PEOPLE GET THE CARE THEY NEED AT AN AFFORDABLE COST; SUPPORTS THE PHYSICIAN/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP; AND EMPOWERS PEOPLE WITH THE INFORMATION, GUIDANCE AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO

MAKE PERSONAL HEALTH CHOICES AND DECISIONS.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BY SIMPLIFYING THE

ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENTS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY, PROMOTING EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE AS THE STANDARD FOR CARE, AND PROVIDING RELEVANT, ACTIONABLE DATA THAT PHYSICIANS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, CONSUMERS, EMPLOYERS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN HEALTH

CARE CAN USE TO MAKE BETTER, MORE INFORMED DECISIONS.

THROUGH ITS DIVERSIFIED FAMILY OF BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY LEVERAGES CORE COMPETENCIES

IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY-BASED TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES; HEALTH CARE DATA, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION; AND HEALTH CARE RESOURCE ORGANIZATION AND CARE FACILITATION TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES, SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE

EXPERIENCE, PROMOTE QUALITY AND MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE.

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE COMPANY HAS PREPARED THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDING TO U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND HAS INCLUDED THE ACCOUNTS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THE COMPANY HAS ELIMINATED INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THROUGH FEBRUARY 10,

2010, THE DATE THIS FORM 10-K WAS FILED WITH THE SEC. OTHER THAN THE DEBT TENDER THAT IS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE CHANGE TO THE COMPANYS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 OF

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, NO MATERIAL SUBSEQUENT EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2009 THAT REQUIRED RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANYS MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO MEDICAL COSTS, MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, REVENUES, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

INVESTMENTS, INCOME TAXES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND WILL LIKELY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE

IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS ADJUSTED.

REVENUES

PREMIUM REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS FIXED, TYPICALLY FOR A

ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND THE COMPANY ASSUMES THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING ITS CUSTOMERS HEALTH CARE AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE

HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. THE COMPANY RECORDS HEALTH CARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM ITS CUSTOMERS IN ADVANCE OF THE SERVICE PERIOD AS UNEARNED REVENUES.

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) DEPLOYS A RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL THAT APPORTIONS

PREMIUMS PAID TO ALL HEALTH PLANS ACCORDING TO HEALTH SEVERITY AND CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. THE CMS RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL PAYS MORE FOR MEMBERS WHOSE MEDICAL HISTORY INDICATES THEY HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS. UNDER THIS RISK ADJUSTMENT

METHODOLOGY, CMS CALCULATES THE RISK ADJUSTED PREMIUM PAYMENT USING DIAGNOSIS DATA FROM HOSPITAL INPATIENT, HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT AND PHYSICIAN TREATMENT SETTINGS. THE COMPANY AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COLLECT, CAPTURE, AND SUBMIT THE NECESSARY AND

AVAILABLE DIAGNOSIS DATA TO CMS WITHIN PRESCRIBED DEADLINES. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES RISK ADJUSTMENT REVENUES BASED UPON THE DIAGNOSIS DATA SUBMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CMS.

SERVICE REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FEES DERIVED FROM SERVICES PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE HEALTH CARE COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES DEPENDANTS. UNDER SERVICE FEE

CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED BASED UPON THE FEE CHARGED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CUSTOMERS RETAIN THE RISK OF FINANCING HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES DEPENDANTS,

AND THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMER FUNDS TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS FROM CUSTOMER-FUNDED BANK ACCOUNTS. SINCE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER THE OBLIGATION FOR FUNDING THE HEALTH CARE COSTS, NOR THE RESPONSIBILITY

FOR PROVIDING THE MEDICAL CARE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUE AND MEDICAL COSTS FOR THESE CONTRACTS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR BOTH RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES; TRANSACTION PROCESSING; CUSTOMER, CONSUMER AND CARE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES;

AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.

THROUGH THE COMPANYS PRESCRIPTION

SOLUTIONS PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT (PBM) BUSINESS, REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH A CONTRACTED NETWORK OF RETAIL PHARMACIES, AND FROM ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS PROCESSING AND FORMULARY DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT.

PRODUCT REVENUES INCLUDE INGREDIENT COSTS (NET OF REBATES), A NEGOTIATED DISPENSING FEE AND CUSTOMER CO-PAYMENTS FOR DRUGS DISPENSED THROUGH THE COMPANYS MAIL-SERVICE PHARMACY. IN RETAIL PHARMACY TRANSACTIONS, REVENUES RECOGNIZED ALWAYS

EXCLUDE THE MEMBERS APPLICABLE CO-PAYMENT. PRODUCT REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON SALE OR SHIPMENT BASED ON CONTRACT TERMS. SERVICE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRESCRIPTION CLAIM IS ADJUDICATED. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO RETAIL SERVICE

CONTRACTS IN WHICH IT IS PRIMARILY OBLIGATED TO PAY ITS NETWORK PHARMACY PROVIDERS FOR BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS REGARDLESS IF THE COMPANY IS PAID. THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING THE PRICES CHARGED BY RETAIL PHARMACIES,

DETERMINING WHICH DRUGS WILL BE INCLUDED IN FORMULARY LISTINGS AND SELECTING WHICH RETAIL PHARMACIES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE NETWORK OFFERED TO PLAN SPONSORS MEMBERS. AS A RESULT, REVENUES ARE REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS. PRODUCT REVENUES ALSO

INCLUDE SALES OF INGENIX PUBLISHING AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE UPON SHIPMENT.

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS

PAYABLE

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT

HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EITHER NOT YET RECEIVED OR PROCESSED CLAIMS, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL

COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, CARE PROFESSIONAL

CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF

LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH PERIOD, THE COMPANY RE-EXAMINES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE LIABILITY ESTIMATES RECORDED IN

PRIOR PERIODS BECOME MORE EXACT, THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES, AND

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

INCLUDES THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE

COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

INVESTMENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. THE FAIR

VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES THEIR CARRYING VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT MATURITY OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAD CHECKS

OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF BANK DEPOSITS OF $1.2 BILLION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED AS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND HAVE BEEN REFLECTED AS CHECKS OUTSTANDING

WITHIN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS INTENT WITH RESPECT TO OFFSETTING CASH BALANCES, WHICH AFFECTED ITS BALANCES IN CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF BANK

DEPOSITS FOR CERTAIN CASH BALANCES. THERE WERE NO CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF BANK DEPOSITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

INVESTMENTS

WITH MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. BECAUSE OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MATURITY DATE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THESE INVESTMENTS AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTS THEM AT AMORTIZED COST. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE.

THE COMPANY EXCLUDES UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES FROM EARNINGS AND REPORTS THEM, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS,

AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANY EVALUATES INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT BY CONSIDERING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE

ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER AND THE COMPANYS INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY OR THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE

AMORTIZED COST. FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF THE COMPANY INTENDS TO EITHER SELL OR DETERMINES THAT IT WILL BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL A SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OR MATURITY OF THE SECURITY, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES THE ENTIRE IMPAIRMENT IN EARNINGS. IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY AND IT DETERMINES THAT IT WILL NOT BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BUT IT DOES NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED

COST BASIS, THE IMPAIRMENT IS BIFURCATED INTO THE AMOUNT ATTRIBUTED TO THE CREDIT LOSS, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, AND ALL OTHER CAUSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

IMPAIRMENTS IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IF IT EXPECTS TO HOLD THE SECURITY UNTIL FAIR VALUE INCREASES TO AT LEAST THE SECURITYS COST BASIS AND IT EXPECTS THAT INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE TO OCCUR IN A REASONABLY FORECASTED PERIOD. IF THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO SELL THE EQUITY SECURITY OR IF IT BELIEVES THAT RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE TO COST WILL NOT OCCUR IN A REASONABLY FORECASTED PERIOD, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE IMPAIRMENT IN NET EARNINGS. NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE

THESE JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR MARKET SECTOR, AND LARGELY LIMITS ITS INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES; STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES; MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES; AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF INVESTMENT GRADE QUALITY. SECURITIES DOWNGRADED BELOW POLICY MINIMUMS AFTER PURCHASE WILL BE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT POLICY. TO CALCULATE REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY USES THE SPECIFIC COST OR AMORTIZED COST OF EACH INVESTMENT SOLD.

ASSETS UNDER

MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AARPS INSURANCE PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 13 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). PURSUANT TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENT, AARP ASSETS ARE MANAGED SEPARATELY

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

FROM ITS GENERAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT THE COMPANYS DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED

BY AARP. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND, UPON TRANSFER OF THE AARP CONTRACT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSFER CASH EQUAL IN AMOUNT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE OF

TRANSFER TO THAT ENTITY. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THESE ASSETS IS TO FUND THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, THE RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF) LIABILITIES AND OTHER RELATED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP CONTRACT, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE CLASSIFIED

AS CURRENT ASSETS, CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE LIABILITIES. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF. ACCORDINGLY, THEY ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS EARNINGS.

OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES

OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES INCLUDE AMOUNTS DUE FROM PHARMACY REBATES, CMS FOR MEDICARE PART D, REINSURANCE AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS AMOUNTS DUE TO THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS PBM BUSINESSES CONTRACT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, SOME OF WHOM PROVIDE REBATES BASED ON USE OF THE

MANUFACTURERS PRODUCTS BY ITS PBM BUSINESSES AFFILIATED AND NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES REBATES AS THEY ARE EARNED BY ITS CLIENTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTS, HISTORICAL DATA AND

CURRENT ESTIMATES. THE PBM BUSINESSES BILL THESE REBATES TO THE MANUFACTURERS ON A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS DEPENDING ON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE PBM BUSINESSES RECORD REBATES ATTRIBUTABLE TO AFFILIATED CLIENTS AS A REDUCTION TO MEDICAL COSTS.

REBATES ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS ARE ACCRUED AS REBATES RECEIVABLE AND A REDUCTION OF COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD WITH A CORRESPONDING PAYABLE FOR THE AMOUNTS OF THE REBATES TO BE REMITTED TO NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR

CONTRACTS AND RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS A REDUCTION OF PRODUCT REVENUE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECEIVES REBATES BETWEEN TWO TO FIVE MONTHS AFTER BILLING.

FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPANYS MEDICARE PART D RECEIVABLES SEE MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT BELOW.

FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE SEE FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES BELOW.

MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT

THE COMPANY SERVES AS A PLAN SPONSOR

OFFERING MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDER CONTRACTS WITH CMS. UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, THERE ARE SIX SEPARATE ELEMENTS OF PAYMENT RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PLAN YEAR. THESE PAYMENT ELEMENTS ARE AS

FOLLOWS.



CMS PREMIUM.

CMS PAYS A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM PER MEMBER TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.



MEMBER PREMIUM.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN MEMBERS PAY A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.



LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY.

FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS SOME OR ALL OF THE MEMBERS MONTHLY PREMIUMS TO THE COMPANY ON THE

MEMBERS BEHALF.



CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY

. CMS PAYS THE COMPANY A COST REIMBURSEMENT ESTIMATE MONTHLY TO FUND THE CMS OBLIGATION TO PAY APPROXIMATELY 80%

OF THE COSTS INCURRED BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS IN EXCESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM. A SETTLEMENT IS MADE WITH CMS BASED ON ACTUAL COST EXPERIENCE, AFTER THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)



LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY.

FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS ON THE MEMBERS BEHALF SOME OR ALL OF A MEMBERS

COST SHARING AMOUNTS, SUCH AS DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE. THE COST SHARING SUBSIDY IS FUNDED BY CMS THROUGH MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS AND PAYS THE SUBSIDIZED PORTION OF THE CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CMS, AND A SETTLEMENT

PAYMENT IS MADE BETWEEN CMS AND THE COMPANY BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS AND PREMIUM EXPERIENCE, AFTER THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.



CMS RISK-SHARE.

PREMIUMS FROM CMS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK CORRIDOR PROVISIONS THAT COMPARE COSTS TARGETED IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BIDS TO

ACTUAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, LIMITED TO ACTUAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED UNDER THE STANDARD COVERAGE AS DEFINED BY CMS. VARIANCES OF MORE THAN 5% ABOVE OR BELOW THE ORIGINAL BID SUBMITTED BY THE COMPANY MAY RESULT IN CMS MAKING

ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY OR REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REFUND TO CMS A PORTION OF THE PREMIUMS IT RECEIVED. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES AND RECOGNIZES AN ADJUSTMENT TO PREMIUM REVENUES RELATED TO THE RISK CORRIDOR PAYMENT SETTLEMENT BASED UPON

PHARMACY CLAIMS EXPERIENCE. THE ESTIMATE OF THE SETTLEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISK CORRIDOR PROVISIONS REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO CONSIDER FACTORS THAT MAY NOT BE CERTAIN, INCLUDING MEMBER ELIGIBILITY STATUS DIFFERENCES WITH CMS. THE COMPANY RECORDS

RISK-SHARE ADJUSTMENTS TO PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES OR OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE CMS PREMIUM, THE MEMBER PREMIUM, AND THE LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY REPRESENT PAYMENTS FOR THE COMPANYS INSURANCE RISK COVERAGE UNDER THE MEDICARE

PART D PROGRAM AND THEREFORE ARE RECORDED AS PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. PREMIUM REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS. THE

COMPANY RECORDS PREMIUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE APPLICABLE SERVICE PERIOD IN UNEARNED REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY AND THE LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY REPRESENT COST REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM. THE COMPANY IS FULLY REIMBURSED BY CMS FOR COSTS INCURRED FOR THESE CONTRACT ELEMENTS AND,

ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO INSURANCE RISK TO THE COMPANY. AMOUNTS RECEIVED FOR THESE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT REFLECTED AS PREMIUM REVENUES, BUT RATHER ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED FOR THESE

SUBSIDIES WERE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS INCURRED FOR THESE CONTRACT ELEMENTS; THEREFORE, THE COMPANY RECORDED A RECEIVABLE IN OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RELATED CASH FLOWS ARE PRESENTED AS CUSTOMER FUNDS

ADMINISTERED WITHIN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS UNDER

THE CONTRACT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN MEDICAL COSTS AND OPERATING COSTS, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE FINAL 2009 RISK-SHARE AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2010, AND IS SUBJECT TO THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS WITH CMS.

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2010, CERTAIN CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE BY CMS,

INCLUDING.



THE INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT INCREASED TO $2,830 FROM $2,700 IN 2009.



THE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE BEGINS AT $6,440 AS COMPARED TO $6,154 IN 2009.



THE ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM INCREASED TO $4,550 FROM $4,350 IN 2009.

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE STATED AT COST, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE CONSISTS OF CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING EXTERNAL

DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND PAYROLL COSTS OF EMPLOYEES DEVOTED TO SPECIFIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE FOR EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT WE MIGHT

NOT RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED.

THE

COMPANY CALCULATES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE USEFUL LIVES FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE.

FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

3 TO 7 YEARS

BUILDINGS

35 TO 40 YEARS

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

SHORTER OF USEFUL LIFE OR REMAINING LEASE TERM

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

3 TO 5 YEARS

GOODWILL

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO THE UNDERLYING IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO AN

ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED, THE

COMPANY PERFORMS A TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. IN THE FIRST STEP OF THE TEST, THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE COMPARED TO THEIR AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED AND NO FURTHER TESTING IS REQUIRED. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE COMPANY WOULD PROCEED TO STEP TWO OF THE TEST. IN STEP TWO OF THE TEST, THE IMPLIED FAIR

VALUE OF THE GOODWILL OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED BY A HYPOTHETICAL ALLOCATION OF THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATED IN STEP ONE TO ALL OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THAT REPORTING UNIT (INCLUDING ANY RECOGNIZED AND UNRECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSETS)

AS IF THE REPORTING UNIT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND THE FAIR VALUE WAS REFLECTIVE OF THE PRICE PAID TO ACQUIRE THE REPORTING UNIT. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS, IF ANY, OF THE CALCULATED FAIR VALUE AFTER

HYPOTHETICAL ALLOCATION TO THE REPORTING UNITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IS GREATER THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE GOODWILL AT THE ANALYSIS DATE, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED AND THE ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE.

IF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL AT THE ANALYSIS DATE, GOODWILL IS DEEMED IMPAIRED BY THE AMOUNT OF THAT VARIANCE.

THE COMPANY CALCULATES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES THE COMPANY MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS INCLUDE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF FREE CASH FLOW (INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND INCOME TAXES), LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES FOR DETERMINING

TERMINAL VALUE, AND DISCOUNT RATES. WHERE AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE, COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE RESULTS OF OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TEST.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL AS OF JANUARY 1, 2010 AND DETERMINED THAT

NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS USED ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR ALL OF ITS REPORTING UNITS, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THOSE PROJECTIONS. THAT UNCERTAINTY

IS INCREASED BY POTENTIAL HEALTH CARE REFORMS, AS ANY PASSED LEGISLATION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE FORECASTS AND LONG-TERM GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR SOME OR ALL OF ITS REPORTING UNITS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

FINITE LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND ARE ASSETS THAT REPRESENT FUTURE EXPECTED BENEFITS BUT LACK PHYSICAL SUBSTANCE (E.G., CUSTOMER LISTS AND TRADEMARKS). THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL HOLDINGS OF INDEFINITE LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES AND ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT A FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS (OR ASSET GROUPS) CARRYING VALUE MAY

EXCEED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE RECORDED.

THE COMPANY

CALCULATES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS USING UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE

UTILITY TO ESTIMATE CASH FLOWS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS OF FINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING THE CURRENT YEAR.

OTHER

POLICY LIABILITIES

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES INCLUDE THE RSF ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 13 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DEPOSITS, DEPOSITS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM (SEE MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT ABOVE), AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS. CUSTOMER BALANCES REPRESENT

EXCESS CUSTOMER PAYMENTS AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS UNDER EXPERIENCE-RATED CONTRACTS. AT THE CUSTOMERS OPTION, THESE BALANCES MAY BE REFUNDED OR USED TO PAY FUTURE PREMIUMS OR CLAIMS UNDER ELIGIBLE CONTRACTS.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND LAWS. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT GENERALLY REFLECTS THE NET

CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING THE YEAR, EXCLUDING ANY DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION REFLECTS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES CURRENTLY

TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE ON VARIOUS INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEAR REPORTED.

FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES

FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS REPRESENT ACCOUNT BALANCES THAT ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS, EXCLUDING SURRENDER CHARGES, FOR UNIVERSAL

LIFE AND INVESTMENT ANNUITY PRODUCTS AND HEALTH POLICIES SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS FOR WHICH SOME OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVED IN THE EARLIER YEARS IS INTENDED TO PAY BENEFITS TO BE INCURRED IN FUTURE YEARS. AS A RESULT OF THE 2005 SALE OF THE LIFE AND ANNUITY

BUSINESS WITHIN THE COMPANYS GOLDEN RULE FINANCIAL CORPORATION (GOLDEN RULE) SUBSIDIARY UNDER AN INDEMNITY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED A LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REINSURED CONTRACTS, AS IT REMAINS PRIMARILY LIABLE

TO THE POLICYHOLDERS, AND HAS RECORDED A CORRESPONDING REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE PURCHASER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE $2.0 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE, OF WHICH $139 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT

RECEIVABLES AND $1.9 BILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE $2.0 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE, OF WHICH $154 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND $1.9 BILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER

ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORDS THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT OF PROBABLE RECOVERY.

POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACTS

TYPICALLY HAVE A ONE-YEAR TERM AND MAY BE CANCELLED BY THE CUSTOMER WITH AT LEAST 31 DAYS NOTICE. COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND RENEWAL OF COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER CONTRACTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUES OF THE AWARDS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION VESTS.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

THE

COMPANY COMPUTES BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. THE COMPANY DETERMINES DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD, ADJUSTED FOR POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK, USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD ASSUMES EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND

VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK, WITH THE ASSUMED PROCEEDS USED TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK AT THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE FOR THE PERIOD. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF SHARES ASSUMED ISSUED AND NUMBER OF SHARES ASSUMED PURCHASED REPRESENTS THE

DILUTIVE SHARES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) NO. 168, THE FASB

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION AND THE HIERARCHY OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  A REPLACEMENT OF FAS 162. THE NEW STANDARD ESTABLISHES ONLY TWO LEVELS OF U.S. GAAP, AUTHORITATIVE AND NONAUTHORITATIVE. THE FASB ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) BECAME THE SINGLE SOURCE OF AUTHORITATIVE, NONGOVERNMENTAL U.S. GAAP, EXCEPT FOR RULES AND INTERPRETIVE RELEASES OF THE SEC, WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BE SOURCES OF AUTHORITATIVE U.S. GAAP FOR SEC REGISTRANTS. ALL OTHER

NON-GRANDFATHERED, NON-SEC ACCOUNTING LITERATURE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ASC BECAME NONAUTHORITATIVE UPON ADOPTION. THE NEW GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS THIRD QUARTER OF 2009. SINCE THE NEW STANDARD DID NOT CHANGE U.S. GAAP, THERE

WAS NO CHANGE TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER THAN TO UPDATE ALL REFERENCES TO U.S. GAAP TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE ASC.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC NO. 820, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES (ASC 820) AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE PROVISIONS WERE ADOPTED FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2009. THESE PROVISIONS DEFINE FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPAND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE CODIFIED INTO ASC TOPIC NO. 805, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH REPLACED PREVIOUS BUSINESS

COMBINATION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE NEW GUIDANCE REVISES HOW AN ACQUIRER

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES, ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AND THE GOODWILL ACQUIRED. THE GUIDANCE AS

AMENDED INCLUDES RECOGNITION PROVISIONS FOR ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED THAT ARISE FROM CONTINGENCIES AND THE TREATMENT OF CONTINGENT PURCHASE PRICE. IT ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS INTENDED TO ENABLE USERS TO

EVALUATE THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2009, AND APPLIED THE PROVISIONS PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL NEW ACQUISITIONS CLOSING ON OR AFTER THAT DATE. THE ADOPTION DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE

FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) NO. 2009-13, MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS (ASU 2009-13). THIS UPDATE REMOVES THE CRITERION THAT ENTITIES MUST USE OBJECTIVE AND RELIABLE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE IN SEPARATELY

ACCOUNTING FOR DELIVERABLES AND PROVIDES ENTITIES WITH A HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THE NEW GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES ENTITIES TO ALLOCATE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO THE SEPARATE UNITS OF

ACCOUNTING BASED ON THE DELIVERABLES RELATIVE SELLING PRICE. THE PROVISIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED IN THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR 2011 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2009-13.

THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT ALL OTHER RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OR DO NOT APPLY TO ITS OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

THE UNREALIZED LOSSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE GENERATED FROM APPROXIMATELY 1,500 POSITIONS OUT

OF A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 12,000 POSITIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL COLLECT ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DUE ON ALL INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE AN AMORTIZED COST IN EXCESS OF FAIR VALUE. THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT

AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE PRIMARILY CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND NOT BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES IMPAIRMENT AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD FOR SECURITIES WHERE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN ITS AMORTIZED COST. THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS ARE GUARANTEED BY EITHER THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AN AGENCY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE SECURITIES WOULD NOT BE SETTLED AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY OF THE

ISSUERS AND THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND THE CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS, NOTING NEITHER A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION SINCE PURCHASE NOR OTHER FACTORS LEADING TO AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI). THE UNREALIZED

LOSSES ON MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 WERE PRIMARILY CAUSED BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES IN THE MARKETPLACE, REFLECTING THE HIGHER PERCEIVED RISK ASSIGNED BY FIXED-INCOME INVESTORS TO COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

5.    FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. THE COMPANY OBTAINS ONE PRICE FOR EACH

SECURITY PRIMARILY FROM A THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE), WHICH GENERALLY USES QUOTED OR OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE PRICING SERVICE NORMALLY DERIVES THE SECURITY PRICES THROUGH RECENTLY REPORTED

TRADES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR SECURITIES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE REPORTING DATE BASED UPON AVAILABLE OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. FOR SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED, THE PRICING SERVICE MAY USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF COMPARABLE

INSTRUMENTS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES, INCORPORATING INPUTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKETS FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES. INPUTS THAT ARE OFTEN USED IN THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, NON-BINDING BROKER

QUOTES, BENCHMARK YIELDS, CREDIT SPREADS, DEFAULT RATES AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. AS THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, IT PERFORMS QUARTERLY ANALYSES ON THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

PRICES ARE REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE TO PRICES REPORTED BY ITS CUSTODIAN, ITS INVESTMENT CONSULTANT AND THIRD PARTY INVESTMENT ADVISORS. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANY COMPARES CHANGES IN THE REPORTED MARKET VALUES AND RETURNS TO RELEVANT MARKET INDICES TO TEST THE REASONABLENESS OF THE REPORTED PRICES. BASED ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL PRICE VERIFICATION PROCEDURES AND REVIEW OF FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY

DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HISTORICALLY ADJUSTED THE PRICES OBTAINED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE.

IN INSTANCES IN WHICH THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FALL INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR ITEM TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE CONSIDERATION OF INPUTS SPECIFIC TO THE ASSET.

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1

 QUOTED (UNADJUSTED) PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 2

 OTHER

OBSERVABLE INPUTS, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, INCLUDING.



QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS;



QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS IN NON-ACTIVE MARKETS (E.G., FEW TRANSACTIONS, LIMITED INFORMATION, NON-CURRENT PRICES, HIGH VARIABILITY

OVER TIME, ETC.);



INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, VOLATILITIES, DEFAULT RATES, ETC.); AND



INPUTS THAT ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED BY OTHER OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

LEVEL 3

 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AS MATURITIES

ARE LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. FAIR VALUES OF CASH EQUIVALENT INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT TRADE ON A REGULAR BASIS IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

DEBT SECURITIES.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF DEBT SECURITIES HELD AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND/OR OTHER MARKET DATA FOR THE SAME OR COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS AND

EQUITY SECURITIES.

EQUITY SECURITIES ARE HELD AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATES FOR LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND/OR OTHER MARKET DATA FOR THE SAME OR COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS IN ESTABLISHING THE PRICES. THE FAIR VALUES OF LEVEL 3

INVESTMENTS IN VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIOS ARE ESTIMATED USING MARKET MODELING APPROACHES THAT RELY HEAVILY ON MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS AND QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS. THESE INVESTMENTS TOTALED $282 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE COMPUTED USING LIMITED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS OF ACTIVITY FOR SIMILAR COMPANIES IN THE CURRENT MARKET. THE KEY INPUTS UTILIZED IN THE COMPANYS MARKET MODELING

INCLUDE, AS APPLICABLE, TRANSACTIONS FOR COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN SIMILAR INDUSTRIES AND HAVING SIMILAR REVENUE AND GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS; SIMILAR PREFERENCES IN THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE; DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS; LIQUIDATION VALUES AND MILESTONES

ESTABLISHED AT INITIAL FUNDING; AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE VALUES OF THE COMPANYS VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS CAN BE INFERRED FROM THESE INPUTS. THE COMPANYS REMAINING LEVEL 3 EQUITY SECURITIES HOLDINGS OF $30 MILLION MAINLY CONSIST OF

PREFERRED STOCK FOR WHICH THERE IS NO ACTIVE MARKET.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST RATE SWAPS

WERE ESTIMATED USING THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET YIELD CURVES. BECAUSE THE SWAPS WERE UNIQUE AND WERE NOT ACTIVELY TRADED, THE FAIR VALUES WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 ESTIMATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD

NO OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF

INSURED CONSUMERS, BUT FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE EITHER NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED OR PROCESSED, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN

ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE

CONSUMPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH

PERIOD, THE COMPANY RE-EXAMINES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS DEVELOP, THE

COMPANY ADJUSTS THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES AND INCLUDES THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED.

NONE OF THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE WERE INDIVIDUALLY MATERIAL TO THE NET FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2009, 2008 AND 2007.

BANK CREDIT FACILITIES

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $750 MILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITY. THE COMPANY TERMINATED THIS FACILITY ON JULY 31, 2009 IN ADVANCE OF ITS MATURITY.

THERE IS CURRENTLY $2.5 BILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THE COMPANYS FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH MATURES IN MAY 2012. THE INTEREST RATE IS

VARIABLE BASED ON TERM AND AMOUNT AND IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) PLUS A SPREAD. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE INTEREST RATE ON THIS FACILITY, HAD IT BEEN DRAWN, WOULD HAVE RANGED FROM 0.4% TO 0.7%. THIS

FACILITY SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY.

LONG-TERM DEBT

IN FEBRUARY 2010,

THE COMPANY COMPLETED CASH TENDER OFFERS FOR $775 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CERTAIN OF ITS OUTSTANDING NOTES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS DEBT REPURCHASE WILL IMPROVE THE MATCHING OF FLOATING RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON ITS BALANCE

SHEET AND REDUCE ITS DEBT SERVICE COST. THE COMPANY USED CASH ON HAND TO FUND THE PURCHASE OF THE NOTES.

IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY ISSUED

A TOTAL OF $3.0 BILLION IN SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, WHICH INCLUDED: $250 MILLION OF FLOATING-RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2011, $550 MILLION OF 4.9% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2013, $1.1 BILLION OF 6.0% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2018 AND $1.1

BILLION OF 6.9% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2038. THE FLOATING-RATE NOTES ARE BENCHMARKED TO THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) AND HAD AN INTEREST RATE OF 1.6% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500 MILLION OF ZERO COUPON NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2022. THESE ZERO COUPON NOTES ARE ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT NOTES WITH AN

AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT DUE AT MATURITY OF $1.1 BILLION AND AN ACCRETION YIELD OF 5.3%. THESE NOTES HAVE A PUT FEATURE THAT ALLOWS A NOTE HOLDER TO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT THE ACCRETED VALUE AT CERTAIN ANNUAL DATES IN THE

FUTURE, BEGINNING ON NOVEMBER 15, 2010; THEREFORE, THESE NOTES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED WITH THE CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.6 BILLION IN SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, WHICH INCLUDED: $250 MILLION OF 5.1% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER

2010, $450 MILLION OF 5.5% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2012, $250 MILLION OF 6.0% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2017 AND $650 MILLION OF 6.6% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2037. THESE NOTES WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION

THEN-EXISTING NOTEHOLDERS EXCHANGED EACH SERIES OF THESE NOTES FOR A NEW ISSUE OF SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL DEBT SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER THE 1933 ACT.

DEBT COVENANTS

THE COMPANYS BANK CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS VARIOUS COVENANTS,

THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO, CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, BELOW 50%. THE COMPANY WAS

IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS DEBT COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

IN JANUARY 2009, THE COMPANY TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH $4.9 BILLION IN NOTIONAL VALUE TO LOCK-IN THE BENEFIT OF LOW MARKET INTEREST RATES.

AS OF THE SWAP CONTRACTS TERMINATION DATE, THE CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT WAS $513 MILLION, WHICH IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 3.5 YEARS AS A REDUCTION TO INTEREST EXPENSE. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD NO OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE $622 MILLION WITH $7 MILLION CLASSIFIED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF HISTORICAL STATE INCOME TAX MATTERS RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE GROSS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX

POSITIONS AS INCOME TAXES WITHIN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NET TAX BENEFIT OF $7 MILLION GENERATED FROM THE REDUCTION IN INTEREST ACCRUED FROM THE RELEASE OF

PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAX MATTERS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $23 MILLION OF NET INTEREST EXPENSE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY HAD $44 MILLION AND $65 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ACCRUED

INTEREST FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, WHICH WERE REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECONCILIATION ABOVE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS $101 MILLION.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY FILES INCOME TAX

RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION, VARIOUS STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED EXAMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND PRIOR. THE COMPANYS 2008 AND 2009

TAX RETURNS ARE UNDER ADVANCE REVIEW BY THE IRS UNDER ITS COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROGRAM. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW STATES, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS PRIOR TO 2003 IN MAJOR STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL DECREASE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS BY $92 MILLION OR LESS AS A RESULT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS IN CERTAIN MAJOR JURISDICTIONS.

11.    SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

THE COMPANYS REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES OF DOMICILE. MOST OF THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS CONFORM TO THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF

EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS, THESE STANDARDS GENERALLY PERMIT DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID FROM STATUTORY UNASSIGNED SURPLUS OF THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARY AND ARE LIMITED BASED ON THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL

AND SURPLUS. THESE DIVIDENDS ARE REFERRED TO AS ORDINARY DIVIDENDS AND GENERALLY CAN BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF THE DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DIVIDENDS PAID WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED

STATUTORY LIMIT OR IS PAID FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN EARNED SURPLUS, IT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AN EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDEND AND MUST RECEIVE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL.

IN 2009, BASED ON THE 2008 STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVELS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ORDINARY DIVIDENDS THAT COULD BE PAID WAS $3.1 BILLION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANYS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES PAID THEIR PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF $4.2 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.5 BILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANYS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES PAID THEIR

PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF $4.2 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.2 BILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS. THE INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS TO TOTAL DIVIDENDS IN 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE ACCELERATION OF DIVIDEND TIMING, AS WELL AS

THE SIZE OF SPECIFIC DIVIDENDS BEYOND ORDINARY LEVELS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, $2.3 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS $24.4 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED ENTITIES.

THE COMPANYS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES HAD AGGREGATE STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH

EXCEEDS AGGREGATE MINIMUM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

UNDER ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (REPURCHASE PROGRAM). THE OBJECTIVES OF THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ARE TO OPTIMIZE THE COMPANYS CAPITAL

STRUCTURE AND COST OF CAPITAL, THEREBY IMPROVING RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS, AS WELL AS TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES IN THE OPEN MARKET. DURING 2009, THE COMPANY

REPURCHASED 74.3 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $24 PER SHARE AND AN AGGREGATE COST OF $1.8 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL

28.7 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK. IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE BOARD RENEWED AND INCREASED THE COMPANYS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND AUTHORIZED THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO 120 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK.

12.    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANYS 2002 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (PLAN), AS AMENDED AND RESTATED MAY 15, 2002, IS INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, OFFER THEM INCENTIVES TO PUT FORTH

MAXIMUM EFFORTS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND AFFORD THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE A PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE COMPANY. THE PLAN ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK,

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS OR OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. THE PLAN INCORPORATES THE FOLLOWING PRIOR PLANS: 1991 STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN, 1998 BROAD-BASED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AND

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN. ALL OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE PRIOR PLANS SHALL REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE PLANS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ISSUED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD 63.5 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS UNDER ITS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

PLAN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCENTIVE OR NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), AND UP TO 15.3 MILLION OF AWARDS IN RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (COLLECTIVELY, RESTRICTED SHARES).

THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING SHARE-BASED AWARDS CONSIST MAINLY OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, SARS AND RESTRICTED SHARES.

STOCK

TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS, THE FAIR VALUE

OF EACH AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL. FOR PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND SAR GRANTS, THE COMPANY USES A BINOMIAL MODEL. THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS THE

VOLATILITIES ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AND THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY FROM EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. BEGINNING IN 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE WEIGHTING OF HISTORICAL AND

IMPLIED VOLATILITIES USED IN THE CALCULATION OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY TO 90% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY. BEFORE THE CHANGE, THE COMPANY HAD WEIGHTED HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY EQUALLY. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC TURBULENCE AND RESULTING

INSTABILITY OF THE EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTIONS THROUGHOUT 2008, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS COMMON STOCK OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF ITS OPTIONS AND SARS. THE CHANGE HAD NO IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS REPORTED NET EARNINGS NOR EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OPTION AND SAR EXERCISES AND FORFEITURES WITHIN THE VALUATION MODEL. THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OPTIONS AND SARS GRANTED REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF

TIME THAT THE AWARDS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING BASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE PATTERNS.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE

OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS GRANTED FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS APPROXIMATELY $10 PER SHARE, $9 PER SHARE AND $14 PER SHARE. THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS EXERCISED DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $282 MILLION, $244 MILLION AND

$1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTED SHARES

RESTRICTED SHARES GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER TWO TO FIVE YEARS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED SHARES IS BASED ON THE SHARE PRICE ON DATE OF GRANT. RESTRICTED SHARE ACTIVITY FOR THE YEAR

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (ESPP) IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT TO THE GOALS OF THE COMPANY, BY PROVIDING A MEANS OF ACHIEVING STOCK OWNERSHIP AT ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS TO

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS STOCK AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE, WHICH IS 85% OF THE LOWER MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT THE BEGINNING OR AT THE END OF THE SIX-MONTH

PURCHASE PERIOD. DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, 3.7 MILLION SHARES, 2.9 MILLION SHARES AND 1.9 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, WERE PURCHASED UNDER THE ESPP. THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE

AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED AND DISCUSSED BELOW. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WERE 9.3 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE ESPP.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, SARS AND RESTRICTED SHARES, ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD (GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD) OF THE AWARD, OR TO AN EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT DATE UNDER THE AWARD

AGREEMENT, IF EARLIER. BEGINNING WITH SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED IN 2009, THE COMPANYS EQUITY AWARD PROGRAM INCLUDES A RETIREMENT PROVISION THAT TREATS ALL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE AGE 55 OR OLDER WITH AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF RECOGNIZED EMPLOYMENT WITH

THE COMPANY AS RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE. FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO ITS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OF $334 MILLION ($220 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS), $305 MILLION ($202 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS)

AND $505 MILLION ($325 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS), RESPECTIVELY. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING COSTS IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WAS $490 MILLION OF

TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO SHARE AWARDS THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.4 YEARS. FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007, THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM SHARE-BASED AWARD EXERCISES WAS $94 MILLION,

$106 MILLION AND $399 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED IN THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS

$176 MILLION ($112 MILLION NET OF TAX BENEFIT) OF EXPENSES RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 RELATED TO APPLICATION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES UNDER SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (SECTION 409A) TO THE COMPANYS

HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. AS PART OF ITS REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME OF GRANT

WERE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE THAT WAS LOWER THAN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENT DATE, SUBJECTING THESE INDIVIDUALS TO ADDITIONAL TAX UNDER SECTION 409A. THE COMPANY ELECTED

TO PAY THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR THE ADDITIONAL TAX COSTS RELATING TO SUCH STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED IN 2006 AND EARLY 2007. FOR ANY OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TAX UNDER SECTION 409A THAT WERE GRANTED TO NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER

EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE EXERCISE PRICE AND COMMITTED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THESE OPTIONHOLDERS FOR THEIR VESTED OPTIONS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL STOCK OPTION PRICE AND THE REVISED INCREASED STOCK OPTION PRICE.

PAYMENTS OF $142 MILLION WERE MADE FROM JANUARY 2008 THROUGH JANUARY 2010 FOR OPTIONS VESTED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009. IF THE MODIFIED STOCK OPTIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY EXERCISED, THE COMPANY WILL RECOVER THESE CASH PAYMENTS AT THAT TIME FROM

EXERCISE PROCEEDS AT THE REVISED INCREASED STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PRICES.

THE $176 MILLION SECTION 409A CHARGE INCLUDES $87 MILLION OF

EXPENSE ($55 MILLION NET OF TAX BENEFIT) FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPTIONHOLDERS TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED IN 2006 AND EARLY 2007 AND $89 MILLION OF EXPENSE ($57 MILLION NET OF TAX BENEFIT) FOR THE MODIFICATION RELATED TO

INCREASING THE EXERCISE PRICE OF UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES AND THE RELATED CASH PAYMENTS. THESE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT.

THE PROGRAM INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICARE BENEFITS (AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE), HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE, INCLUDING INSURANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN 50 TO 64 YEARS OF AGE, AND OTHER RELATED PRODUCTS.

IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, THAT AMENDED ITS EXISTING AARP ARRANGEMENTS. THESE

AGREEMENTS EXTENDED THE COMPANYS ARRANGEMENTS WITH AARP ON THE PROGRAM TO DECEMBER 31, 2017, EXTENDED THE COMPANYS ARRANGEMENT WITH AARP ON THE MEDICARE PART D BUSINESS TO DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND GAVE THE COMPANY AN EXCLUSIVE

RIGHT TO USE THE AARP BRAND ON THE COMPANYS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OFFERINGS UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2014, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCLUSIONS.

UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY IS COMPENSATED FOR TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND OTHER SERVICES, AS WELL AS FOR ASSUMING UNDERWRITING RISK. THE COMPANY IS ALSO ENGAGED IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO COMPLEMENT THE INSURANCE OFFERINGS.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE BUSINESS ARE DIRECTLY RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE PREMIUM REVENUE, MEDICAL

COSTS, INVESTMENT INCOME, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, MEMBER SERVICE EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. UNDERWRITING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF AND ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP

POLICYHOLDERS, UNLESS CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES WERE TO EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF. TO THE EXTENT UNDERWRITING LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, LOSSES WOULD BE BORNE BY THE COMPANY. DEFICITS MAY BE RECOVERED BY UNDERWRITING GAINS IN FUTURE

PERIODS OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FUND ANY UNDERWRITING DEFICITS. THE RSF BALANCE IS REPORTED IN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CHANGES IN THE RSF ARE REPORTED IN MEDICAL COSTS IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. IN JANUARY 2008, $127 MILLION IN CASH WAS TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE RSF TO AN EXTERNAL INSURANCE ENTITY THAT OFFERS AN AARP BRANDED AGE 50 TO 64 COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE PRODUCT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE RSF

BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER POTENTIAL FUTURE UNDERWRITING AND OTHER RISKS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT.

THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM ALSO ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF BALANCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE

EFFECT OF SUCH CHANGES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

UNDER THE COMPANYS AGREEMENT WITH AARP, THE COMPANY SEPARATELY

MANAGES THE ASSETS THAT SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE HELD AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT THE COMPANYS DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED BY THE

PROGRAM AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF INVESTMENT RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND UPON ANY TRANSFER OF THE PROGRAM TO ANOTHER ENTITY, THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSFER CASH IN AN AMOUNT

EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF AND, THUS, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

THE COMPANYS EARNINGS. INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO THE AARP RSF AND WERE $99 MILLION, $82 MILLION AND $108 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY ELECTED TO MEASURE THE ENTIRETY OF THE AARP ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT FAIR VALUE, PURSUANT TO THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY IS FREQUENTLY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS AND REGULATORY INQUIRIES RELATED TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF ITS SERVICE OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR ITS ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS WHERE APPROPRIATE. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATING TO HEALTH

LITIGATION

MATTERS

MDL LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN 1999, A SERIES OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY BY HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS ALLEGING VARIOUS CLAIMS RELATING TO THE COMPANYS REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES, INCLUDING ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED CORRUPT ORGANIZATION ACT (RICO) AND STATE PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS. MANY

OF THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN A MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF FLORIDA (MDL). IN THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT, THE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR CERTAIN OF THE

RICO CLAIMS. IN 2006, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED ALL OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT, AND THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS LATER AFFIRMED THAT DISMISSAL, LEAVING ELEVEN RELATED LAWSUITS THAT HAD BEEN STAYED DURING THE

LITIGATION OF THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT. IN AUGUST 2008, THE TRIAL COURT, APPLYING ITS RULINGS IN THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT, DISMISSED SEVEN OF THE 11 RELATED LAWSUITS, AND ALL BUT ONE CLAIM IN AN EIGHTH LAWSUIT. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THESE DISMISSALS

TO THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT. THE TRIAL COURT ORDERED THE FINAL CLAIM IN THE EIGHTH LAWSUIT TO ARBITRATION. IN DECEMBER 2008, AT THE PLAINTIFFS REQUEST, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE ONE OF THE THREE REMAINING LAWSUITS. THE COURT ALSO

DENIED THE PLAINTIFFS REQUEST TO REMAND THE REMAINING TWO LAWSUITS TO STATE COURT AND A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE JUDGE RECOMMENDED DISMISSAL OF THOSE SUITS. ON APRIL 16, 2009, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE LAST TWO SUITS FILED AMENDED CLASS ACTION

COMPLAINTS ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS PARTY TO A NUMBER OF ARBITRATIONS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS INVOLVING SIMILAR CLAIMS. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING AGAINST THE REMAINING CLAIMS IN THESE CASES.

AMA LITIGATION.

ON MARCH 15, 2000, A GROUP OF PLAINTIFFS INCLUDING THE AMERICAN

MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (AMA) FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE COURT IN NEW YORK, WHICH WAS REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT. THE COMPLAINT AND SUBSEQUENT AMENDED COMPLAINTS ASSERTED ANTITRUST CLAIMS AND CLAIMS BASED ON THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), AS WELL AS BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES, AND TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY

REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BY THE COMPANYS AFFILIATES. ON JANUARY 14, 2009, AFTER ALMOST NINE YEARS OF LITIGATION AND MANY RULINGS FROM THE COURT ON VARIOUS MOTIONS, THE PARTIES ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO

SETTLE THE LAWSUIT, ALONG WITH A SIMILAR CASE FILED IN 2008 IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW JERSEY. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATED ENTITIES WILL BE RELEASED FROM CLAIMS RELATING TO THEIR OUT-OF-NETWORK

REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES FROM MARCH 15, 1994 THROUGH THE DATE OF FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY WILL PAY A TOTAL OF $350 MILLION TO FUND THE SETTLEMENT FOR HEALTH PLAN MEMBERS AND OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS IN CONNECTION WITH

OUT-OF-NETWORK PROCEDURES PERFORMED SINCE MARCH 15, 1994. THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS SUBJECT TO FINAL COURT APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE SETTLEMENT IF A

CERTAIN NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS ELECT TO OPT-OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT. A SPLINTER GROUP OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IS CHALLENGING THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT. THE COURT GRANTED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF CERTAIN

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL ON DECEMBER 1, 2009, AND A FINAL APPROVAL HEARING FOLLOWING NOTICE TO MEMBERS OF THE CLASS IS SCHEDULED FOR JULY 2010. OTHER LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS RELATING TO THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY

REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REMAIN PENDING AGAINST A NUMBER OF HEALTH INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY.

NYAG INVESTIGATION.

ON FEBRUARY 13, 2008, THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (NYAG) ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS CONDUCTING AN INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATION INTO OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT

PRACTICES OF HEALTH INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, AND SERVED THE COMPANY WITH A NOTICE OF INTENT TO INITIATE LITIGATION. ON JANUARY 13, 2009, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NYAG REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION. UNDER

PRODUCTS OWNED BY INGENIX, INC. BOTH PRODUCTS ARE USED BY A NUMBER OF HEALTH PLANS AND EMPLOYERS AS TOOLS THAT HELP DETERMINE THE AMOUNT TO REIMBURSE MEMBERS WHO RECEIVE PHYSICIAN SERVICES OUTSIDE THEIR MANAGED CARE NETWORKS. WHEN THE NEW DATABASE

PRODUCT IS READY, THE COMPANY WILL CEASE USING THE PHCS AND MDR DATABASES AND WILL USE THE NEW DATABASE FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST FIVE YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK REIMBURSEMENT IN THOSE BENEFIT PLANS THAT EMPLOY A REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY

STANDARD FOR OUT-OF-NETWORK REIMBURSEMENTS. ON OCTOBER 2, 2009, THE COMPANY PAID THE $50 MILLION REQUIRED UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT INTO AN ACCOUNT DESIGNATED BY THE NYAG. FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NYAG SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT

MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, WE USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT AND THOSE CRITERIA, WE

BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE COMPANYS

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS AUDITED THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS STATED IN THE REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, APPEARING UNDER

ITEM 9A, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE

SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS

OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF

COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON

THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORTS DATED FEBRUARY 10, 2010 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE.
