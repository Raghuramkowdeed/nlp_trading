description of business segments   uniprise
uniprise delivers health care and well-being services nationwide to large
national employers, individual consumers and other health care organizations through three related business units: uniprise strategic solutions (uss), definity health and exante financial services (exante). each business unit works with other
unitedhealth group businesses to deliver a complementary and integrated array of services. uss delivers strategic health and well-being solutions to large national employers. definity health provides consumer-driven health plans and services to
employers and their employees. as of december 31, 2004, uss and definity health served approximately 9.9 million individuals. exante delivers health-care-focused financial services for consumers, employers and providers. most uniprise products and
services are delivered through its licensed affiliates. uniprise provides administrative and customer care services for certain other businesses of unitedhealth group. uniprise also offers transactional processing services to various intermediaries
and health care entities.   uniprise specializes in large-volume transaction
management, large-scale benefit design and innovative technology solutions designed to promote evidence-based medicine and facilitate effective, efficient health care delivery by transforming complex administrative processes into simpler, efficient,
high quality automated processes. uniprises core administrative services include the processing of more than 220 million medical benefit claims each year and live or automated servicing of more than 75 million telephone calls annually. this
includes comprehensive operational services for independent health plans and third party administrators representing approximately 2 million consumers, as well as approximately 8 million of the commercial health plan consumers outside of uniprise
who are served by unitedhealthcare. uniprise maintains internet-based administrative and financial applications for physician inquiries and transactions, customer-specific data analysis for employers, and consumer access to personal health care
information and services.   uss   uss provides comprehensive and customized administrative, benefits and service solutions for
large employers and other organizations with more than 5,000 employees in multiple locations. uss customers may also access unitedhealth groups network-based medical, insurance and specialty services, through a wide variety of product
arrangements. uss customers generally retain the risk of financing the medical benefits of their employees and their dependents, and uss provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; consumer and care provider
services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals for a fixed service fee per individual served. as of december 31, 2004, uss served over 350 employers, including approximately 160 of the
fortune 500 companies.   definity health
definity health provides innovative consumer health care solutions that enable consumers
to take ownership and control of their health care benefits. definity healths products include high deductible consumer-directed benefit plans coupled with health reimbursement accounts or health savings accounts, and discount cards for
services generally not covered by high deductible health plans. definity health is the national leader in consumer-directed health benefit programs. as of december 31, 2004, definity health provides health benefits to approximately 85 employers,

health reimbursement accounts (hras).   health care services
our health care services segment consists of our unitedhealthcare, ovations and
americhoice businesses.   unitedhealthcare   unitedhealthcare offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and
services for local, small and mid-sized employers and individuals nationwide. unitedhealthcare provides health care services on behalf of approximately 11 million americans as of december 31, 2004. with its risk-based product offerings,
unitedhealthcare assumes the risk of both medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate for a one-year period. unitedhealthcare also provides administrative and other
management services to customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents, for which unitedhealthcare receives a fixed service fee per individual served. these customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits
for their employees, and unitedhealthcare administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care providers from customer-funded bank accounts. small employer groups are more likely to purchase risk-based products because they
are generally unable or unwilling to bear a greater potential liability for health care expenditures.   unitedhealthcare offers its products through affiliates that are usually licensed as insurance companies or as health maintenance organizations, depending upon a variety of factors, including state regulations.
unitedhealthcares product strategy centers on several fundamentals: consumer choice, actionable information, better outcomes and greater affordability. unitedhealthcares products include wellness programs and services that help
individuals make informed decisions, maintain a healthy lifestyle and maximize the success of inpatient and outpatient treatments by coordinating access to care services and providing personalized, targeted education and information services.
unitedhealthcare arranges for discounted access to care through more than
460,000 physicians and other care providers, and 4,200 hospitals across the united states. the consolidated purchasing power represented by the individuals unitedhealthcare serves makes it possible for unitedhealthcare to contract for cost-effective
access to a large number of conveniently located care providers. directly or through unitedhealth groups family of companies, unitedhealthcare offers:
a broad range of benefit plans integrating medical, ancillary and alternative care products so customers can choose benefits that are right for them;
affordability by leveraging the economic benefits of the purchasing power of millions of people;
access to broad and diverse numbers of physicians and other care providers through benefit plans that give customers direct access to specialists without obtaining referrals;
innovative clinical outreach programsbuilt around evidence-based medicinethat promote care quality and patient safety and provide incentives for physicians who
demonstrate consistency of clinical care against best practice standards;
national access to proven high-quality and efficient centers of excellence for cardiac, cancer and orthopedic care through the unitedhealth premium program;
care facilitation services that use proprietary predictive technology to identify individuals with significant gaps in care and unmet needs or risk for potential health problems and
then facilitate timely and appropriate interventions;
table of contents
unique disease and condition management programs to help individuals address significant, complex disease states;
convenient self-service for customer transactions, pharmacy services and health information;
clinical information that physicians can use in working with their patients; and
simplified electronic transactions for customers.   unitedhealthcares regional and national access to broad, affordable and quality networks of care has advanced significantly in the past 12 months with acquisitions
and/or expansions enhancing services in connecticut, delaware, maryland, new jersey, new york, pennsylvania and wisconsin. unitedhealthcare has also organized health care alliances with select regional not-for-profit health plans to facilitate
greater customer access and affordability.   we believe that
unitedhealthcares innovation distinguishes its product offerings from the competition. unitedhealthcare designs consumer-oriented health benefits and services that value individual choice and control in accessing health care. unitedhealthcare
has programs that provide health education; admission counseling before hospital stays; care advocacy to help avoid delays in patients stays in the hospital; support for individuals at risk of needing intensive treatment and care coordination
for people with chronic conditions. unitedhealthcare offers comprehensive and integrated pharmaceutical management services that achieve lower costs by using formulary programs that drive better unit costs for drugs, benefit designs that encourage
consumers to use drugs that offer the best value, and physician and consumer programs that support the appropriate use of drugs based on clinical evidence.   unitedhealthcares distribution system consists primarily of insurance producers in the small employer group and producers and other consultant-based or direct sales
in the large employer and public sector groups. unitedhealthcares direct distribution operations are relatively limited and apply only in the maryland, washington, d.c. and virginia markets, as well as to portions of the large employer
commercial market (which is generally self-funded) and to cross-selling of specialty products to existing customers. unitedhealthcares external distribution network includes approximately 30,000 active insurance producers as well as
opportunities presented to it by benefits consultants.   ovations
ovations provides health and well-being services for individuals age 50
and older, addressing their unique needs for preventative and acute health care services, as well as for services dealing with chronic disease and other specialized issues for older individuals. ovations is one of few enterprises fully dedicated to
this market segment, providing products and services in all 50 states, the district of columbia, puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands through licensed affiliates. ovations is focused on meeting the needs of its beneficiaries, rather than on
providing a particular offering or product. ovations wide array of offerings and products includes medicare supplement and medicare advantage coverage and prescription discount cards, as well as disease management and chronic care

significant medicare changes as it adds a prescription drug benefit and increases the diversity of its offerings. we believe that these changes will both
table of contents
expand and produce new opportunities for well-organized and focused companies to serve older americans. we believe that ovations is well-positioned to
respond to these opportunities. ovations is unique in its national participation in the medicare program across the broad spectrum of medicare productsoffering medigap products that supplement traditional fee-for-service coverage, more
traditional health plan-type programs under medicare advantage, prescription drug discount offerings, and special offerings for chronically ill and dual-eligible beneficiaries. ovations currently is participating in new product options available
following the medicare reform legislation. ovations is one of the nations leading providers of medicare prescription drug discount cards. ovations is preparing to participate in the medicare part d prescription drug benefit program. ovations
intends to proceed with potential market opportunities in a disciplined, deliberate way.   ovations insurance solutions   ovations

traditional medicare. ovations operates the nations largest medicare supplement business, providing medicare supplement and hospital indemnity insurance, from its insurance company affiliates, to approximately 3.8 million aarp members.
ovations services also include an expanded aarp nurse healthline service which provides 24-hour access to health information from nurses for certain lines of business. ovations also developed a lower cost medicare supplement offering that
provides consumers with a hospital network and 24-hour access to health care information. in 2004, ovations continued to pilot a new health insurance program focused on persons between 50 and 64 years of age.   ovations pharmacy solutions   ovations pharmacy solutions addresses one of the most significant cost problems facing older
americansprescription drug costs. with approximately 1.8 million users, the program provides access to discounted retail and mail order pharmacy services, and a complimentary health and well-being catalog offering. ovations also offers three
different medicare-endorsed discount drug cards under the medicare modernization act. these cards offer cost savings for retail and mail order prescription drugs. there are a total of approximately 640,000 cardholders who participate in the
medicare-endorsed drug card programs offered by ovations.   ovations senior & retiree services   ovations senior
& retiree services division provides health care coverage for the seniors market primarily through the medicare advantage (formerly medicare+choice) program administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services. in the fourth quarter of
2004, ovations senior retiree services began offering rural medicare advantage private fee for service coverage, servicing 169 rural counties in iowa, nebraska, south dakota and wisconsin. under these programs, ovations provides health
insurance coverage to eligible medicare beneficiaries in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from cms that varies based on the geographic areas in which the members reside. through these programs, 330,000 individual medicare
beneficiaries and hundreds of employer retiree groups were served as of december 31, 2004.   evercare   through its evercare
division, ovations is one of the nations leaders in offering complete, individualized care planning and care benefits for aging, vulnerable and chronically ill individuals, serving approximately 70,000 persons across the nation in nursing
homes, community-based settings and private homes. in 2004, evercares care management program for frail elderly nursing home residents was designated as a special needs plan, converting it from a demonstration project to a permanent program
under contract with the medicare program. evercare offers other services through innovative programs such as evercare choice, evercare select and evercare connections. evercare choice is a medicare product that offers enhanced medical coverage to
frail, elderly and chronically ill populations in both nursing homes and community settings. these services are
table of contents
provided primarily through nurse practitioners, physicians assistants and physicians. evercare select is a medicaid, long-term health care product for
elderly, physically disabled and other needy individuals. evercare connections is a comprehensive eldercare service program providing service coordination, consultation, claim management and information resources nationwide. proprietary, automated
medical record software enables evercare geriatric care teams to capture and track patient data and clinical encounters in nursing home, hospital and home care settings. evercare has begun extending its complex care management services to
end-of-life situations. in 2004, evercare began offering community-based hospice programs in two states.   americhoice   americhoice provides
network-based health and well-being services to state medicaid, childrens health insurance program (chip), and other government-sponsored health care programs and the beneficiaries of those programs. americhoice provides services to nearly 1.3
million individuals, an expansion of approximately 155,000 individuals in 2004, in 13 states across the country. the individuals americhoice serves generally live in areas that are medically underserved and where a consistent relationship with the
medical community or a care provider is less likely. americhoices population also tends to face significant social and economic challenges. americhoice offers government agencies a broad menu of separate management servicesincluding
clinical care, consulting and management, pharmacy benefit services and administrative and technology servicesto help them effectively administer their distinct health care delivery systems for individuals in these programs.   americhoices approach is founded in its belief that health care cannot be provided
effectively without consideration of all of the factorssocial, economic, environmental and physicalthat affect a persons life. americhoice coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers and government
and community-based agencies and organizations to provide continuous and effective care. for members, this means that the unique americhoice personal care model offers them a holistic approach to health care, emphasizing practical programs to
improve their living circumstances as well as quality medical care and treatment in accessible, culturally-sensitive, community-oriented settings. americhoices programs focus on high-prevalence and debilitating illnesses such as hypertension
and cardiovascular disease, asthma, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, cancer and high-risk pregnancy. americhoice utilizes specific disease management programs for asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, sickle cell anemia, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, pneumonia, special needs, hiv and high-risk obstetrical and maternal management. in addition, americhoices healthy first steps program is based on the premise that early identification and assessment of high-risk pregnancies
and subsequent care by an obstetrician will help minimize premature deliveries and complications with premature babies.   for physicians, the americhoice personal care model means assistance with coordination of their patients care. americhoice utilizes sophisticated telemedicine tools
in inner city, public sector health care programs to support care management. this technology enables nurses and physicians to monitor important vital signs, check medication use, assess patient status and facilitate overall care. distinctive
outreach and education programs developed by americhoice with the help of leading researchers and clinicians are used to target and intervene in the illnesses most common among individuals served by americhoice, and are intended to ensure preventive
interventions and well-child care. americhoice utilizes advanced and unique pharmacy servicesincluding benefit design, generic drug incentive programs, drug utilization review and preferred drug list developmentto help optimize the use
of pharmaceuticals and concurrently contain pharmacy expenditures to levels appropriate to the specific clinical situations. for state customers, the americhoice personal care model means increased access to care and improved quality, in a
measurable system that reduces their administrative burden and lowers their costs. americhoice uses advanced technology applications to support efficient, reliable and scalable business processes.   americhoice considers a variety of factors in determining in which state programs to
participate, including the states experience and consistency of support for its medicaid program in terms of service innovation and
table of contents
funding, the population base in the state, the willingness of the physician/provider community to participate with the americhoice personal care model and
the presence of community-based organizations americhoice can work with to meets the needs of individuals. using these criteria, americhoice entered one new market in 2004 and is examining several other markets. conversely, during the past three
years, americhoice has exited several markets because of reimbursement issues or lack of consistent direction and support.   specialized care services   the specialized care services (scs) companies offer a comprehensive platform of specialty health and wellness and ancillary benefits, services and resources
to specific customer markets nationwide. these products and services include employee benefit offerings, provider networks and related resources focusing on behavioral health and substance abuse, dental, vision, disease management, complex and

government regulation   most of our health and
well-being services are regulated. this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. changes in
applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically.   federal regulation   our health care services segment, which includes unitedhealthcare, ovations, and americhoice, is subject to federal regulation. ovations has medicare advantage contracts that are regulated by cms. cms has the right to
audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members. our health care services segment also has medicaid and state childrens health insurance program contracts that are
subject to federal and state regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees, payment for those services, and other aspects of these programs. there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance. in addition,
because a portion of ingenixs business includes clinical research, it is subject to regulation by the fda. we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations.

regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material inter-company transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates. in addition, some of our business
and related activities may be subject to preferred provider organization (ppo), managed care organization (mco) or tpa-related regulations and licensure requirements. these regulations differ from state to state, but
generally contain network, contracting, product and rate, financial and reporting requirements. there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services, payment of claims, protection of consumer health information and
covered benefits and services. additionally, states have begun to focus their anti-fraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. some states now require filing and approval of anti-fraud plans and may monitor compliance
as part of a market conduct examination. we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations.   hipaa   the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, as amended (hipaa), apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets,
including self-funded employee benefit plans. federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective. these regulations include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of protected
health information. we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations. new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being implemented by regulators. we have been and intend to remain
in compliance in all material respects with these regulations. additionally, different approaches to hipaas provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products
and services across state lines.   erisa   the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended (erisa),
regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer-sponsored health benefit plans. erisa is a set of laws and regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the
federal courts. erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain self-funded plans. we believe that we are in compliance in all material
respects with applicable erisa regulations.   audits and investigations
we typically have and are currently involved in various governmental
investigations, audits, and reviews. these include routine, regular and special investigations, audits, and reviews by cms, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the office of the inspector general, the
office of personnel management, the office of civil rights, the department of justice and u.s. attorneys. such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of
licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations, audits or reviews, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

international regulation
our ingenix, uniprise and health care services segments have limited international operations. these international operations are subject to different legal and
regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions, including various tax, tariff and trade regulations, as well as employment, intellectual property and investment rules and laws. we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with
applicable laws.
competition   as a diversified health and
well-being services company we operate in highly competitive markets. our competitors include managed health care companies, insurance companies, third party administrators and business services outsourcing companies, health care providers that have
formed networks to directly contract with employers, specialty benefit providers, government entities, and various information and consulting companies. for our uniprise and health care services businesses, competitors include aetna inc., cigna
corporation, coventry health care, inc., humana inc., pacificare health systems, inc., wellchoice, inc., and wellpoint, inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association
and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas. our specialized care services and ingenix business segments also compete with a number of businesses. new entrants into the markets in which we compete, as well as consolidation
within these markets, also contribute to a competitive environment. we believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales and pricing of our products and services; product innovation; consumer satisfaction;
the level and quality of products and services; care delivery; network capabilities; market share; product distribution systems; efficiency of administration operations; financial strength and marketplace reputation.
employees   as of december 31, 2004, we employed
approximately 40,000 individuals. we believe our employee relations are positive.

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   business overview   unitedhealth group is a diversified health and well-being company, serving approximately 55 million americans. our focus is on improving the american health care system
by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery; promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care; and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care providers, consumers, employers and other
participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions.   through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and informatics; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to
make health care work better. we provide individuals with access to quality, cost-effective health care services and resources. we promote the delivery of care, consistent with the best available evidence for effective health care. we provide
employers with superb value, service and support, and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth, profitability and capital discipline.   2004 financial performance highlights   unitedhealth group had an excellent year in 2004. the company achieved diversified growth
across its business segments and generated net earnings of $2.6 billion and operating cash flows of $4.1 billion, representing increases of 42% and 38%, respectively, over 2003. other financial performance highlights include:
diluted net earnings per common share of $3.94, representing an increase of 33% over 2003.
revenues of $37.2 billion, a 29% increase over 2003. excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased 8% over 2003.
operating earnings of more than $4.1 billion, up 40% over 2003.
consolidated operating margin of 11.0%, up from 10.2% in 2003, driven primarily by improved margins on risk-based products, revenue mix changes and operational and productivity
improvements.
return on shareholders equity of 31.4%.   unitedhealth group acquired oxford health plans, inc. (oxford) in july 2004 for total consideration of approximately $5.0 billion and acquired mid atlantic medical
services, inc. (mamsi) in february 2004 for total consideration of approximately $2.7 billion. the results of operations and financial condition of oxford and mamsi have been included in unitedhealth groups consolidated financial statements
since the respective acquisition dates.   2004 results compared to 2003
results   consolidated financial results   revenues   revenues are comprised of premium revenues from risk-based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management,
administrative and consulting services; and investment and other income.   premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care services and
related administrative costs. service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. for both premium risk-based and fee-based customer
arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals.

consolidated revenues increased by $8.4 billion, or 29%, in 2004 to $37.2 billion, primarily as a result of revenues from
businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003. excluding the impact of these acquisitions, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004 as a result of rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth across business
segments. following is a discussion of 2004 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components.   premium revenues consolidated premium revenues in 2004 totaled $33.5 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 32%, over 2003. excluding the impact of
acquisitions, premium revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004. this increase was due in part to average net premium rate increases of approximately 9% on unitedhealthcares renewing commercial risk-based business, partially offset by a
slight decrease in the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcares commercial risk-based products and changes in the commercial product benefit and customer mix. in addition, ovations premium revenues increased largely due to
increases in the number of individuals it serves through medicare advantage products and changes in product mix related to medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on all of these products. premium revenues from americhoices
medicaid programs and specialized care services businesses also increased due to advances in the number of individuals served by those businesses.   service revenues service revenues in 2004 totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $217 million, or 7%, over 2003. the increase in service revenues was driven
primarily by aggregate growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by uniprise and unitedhealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. in addition, ingenix service
revenues increased due to new business growth in the health information and clinical research businesses.   investment and other income investment and other income totaled $388 million, representing an increase of $131 million over 2003. interest income increased by $134 million in 2004, principally due to the
impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments during the year from the acquisitions of oxford, mamsi and golden rule financial corporation (golden rule), which was acquired in november 2003. net capital gains on sales of
investments were $19 million in 2004, a decrease of $3 million from 2003.   medical costs   the combination of pricing, benefit designs,
consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues).   the consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 81.4% in 2003 to 80.6% in 2004. excluding the aarp business1, the medical care ratio decreased 50 basis points from 80.0% in 2003 to 79.5% in 2004. the medical care ratio decrease resulted
primarily from net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in product, business and customer mix.   each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. changes in medical cost estimates related to
prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior
fiscal years. medical costs for 2003 include approximately $150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years.
management believes disclosure of the medical care ratio excluding the aarp business is meaningful since underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp business
accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders through a rate stabilization fund (rsf). although the company is at risk for underwriting losses to the extent cumulative net losses exceed the balance in the rsf, we have not been required to
fund any underwriting deficits to date, and management believes the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract during the foreseeable future.
table of contents
on an absolute dollar basis, 2004 medical costs increased $6.3 billion, or 30%, over 2003 principally due to the impact
of the acquisitions of oxford, mamsi and golden rule. excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 8% driven primarily by medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption.   operating costs   the operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2004 was 15.4%, down from 16.9% in 2003. this decrease was
driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. the existence of premium revenues within our risk-based products cause them to have lower operating cost ratios
than fee-based products, which have no premium revenues. additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives.   on an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2004 increased $868 million, or 18%, over
2003 primarily due to the acquisitions of oxford, mamsi and golden rule. excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 3%. this increase was driven by a more than 3% increase in the total number of individuals
served by health care services and uniprise in 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives.   depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization in 2004 was $374 million, an increase of $75 million, or 25%,
over 2003. approximately $42 million of this increase is related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions in 2004. the remaining increase of $33 million is due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer
equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003.   income taxes   our effective income tax rate was 34.9% in 2004, compared to 35.7% in 2003. the decrease was driven mainly by favorable settlements of prior year income tax returns.   business segments   the following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended december 31 (in millions):

health care services   the health care services segment consists of the unitedhealthcare, ovations and americhoice businesses. unitedhealthcare coordinates network-based health and well-being
services on behalf of multistate, mid-sized and local employers and consumers. ovations delivers health and well-being services to americans over the age of 50, including the administration of supplemental health insurance coverage on behalf of
aarp. americhoice facilitates and manages health care services for state-sponsored medicaid programs and their beneficiaries.   health care services had revenues of $32.7 billion in 2004, representing an increase of $7.9 billion, or 32%, over 2003, driven primarily by acquisitions since the
beginning of 2003. excluding the impact of acquisitions, health care services revenues increased by approximately $1.9 billion, or 8%, over 2003. unitedhealthcare accounted for approximately $850 million of this increase, driven by average premium
rate increases of approximately 9% on renewing commercial risk-based business and growth in the number of individuals served by fee-based products, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcares
commercial risk-based products. ovations contributed approximately $770 million to the revenue advance over 2003 driven by growth in the number of individuals served by ovations medicare advantage products and changes in product mix related to
medicare supplement products it provides to aarp members, as well as rate increases on all of these products. the remaining increase in health care services revenues is attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by americhoices
medicaid programs and medicaid premium rate increases.   health care services
earnings from operations in 2004 were $2.8 billion, representing an increase of $945 million, or 51%, over 2003. this increase primarily resulted from ovations and unitedhealthcares revenue growth, improved gross margins on
unitedhealthcares commercial risk-based products and the impact of the acquisitions of oxford, mamsi and golden rule. unitedhealthcares commercial medical care ratio improved to 79.0% in 2004 from 80.0% in 2003. the decrease in the
commercial medical care ratio was primarily driven by net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in business and customer mix. health care services 2004 operating margin was 8.6%, an
increase of 110 basis points over 2003. this increase was principally driven by a combination of the improved commercial medical care ratio and changes in business and customer mix.   the following table summarizes the number of individuals served by health care services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as

served by ovations medicare advantage products increased by 30,000, or 13%, from 2003. americhoices medicaid enrollment increased by 155,000, or 14%, due to organic growth in the number of individuals served and the acquisition of a
medicaid health plan in michigan in february 2004, resulting in the addition of approximately 95,000 individuals served.   uniprise   uniprise provides network-based health and well-being services, business-to-business transaction processing services, consumer connectivity and technology support services to large employers and health plans, and
provides health-related consumer and financial transaction products and services. uniprise revenues in 2004 were $3.4 billion, representing an increase of 8% over 2003. this increase was driven primarily by growth of 4% in the number of individuals
served by uniprise, excluding the impact of the acquisition of definity health corporation (definity) in december 2004, and annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers. uniprise served 9.9 million individuals and 9.1 million
individuals as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   uniprise earnings
from operations in 2004 were $677 million, representing an increase of 11% over 2003. operating margin for 2004 improved to 20.1% from 19.6% in 2003. uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process
improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. additionally, uniprises infrastructure can be
scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses.   specialized care services   specialized care services is a portfolio of specialty health and wellness companies, each serving a specialized market need with a unique offering of benefits, networks,
services and resources. specialized care services revenues during 2004 of $2.3 billion increased by $417 million, or 22%, over 2003. this increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by united behavioral health,
its behavioral health benefits business, dental benefit providers, its dental services business, and spectera, its vision care benefits business; rate increases related to these businesses; and incremental revenues related to businesses acquired
since the beginning of 2003 of approximately $100 million.   earnings from
operations in 2004 of $485 million increased $100 million, or 26%, over 2003. specialized care services operating margin increased to 21.1% in 2004, up from 20.5% in 2003. this increase was driven primarily by operational and productivity
improvements within specialized care services businesses and consolidation of the production and service operation infrastructure to enhance productivity and efficiency and to improve the quality and consistency of service, partially offset by
a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products.   ingenix
ingenix is a leader in the field of health care data analysis and
application, serving pharmaceutical companies, health insurers and other payers, physicians and other health care providers, large employers, and governments. ingenix revenues in 2004 of $670 million increased by $96 million, or 17%, over 2003. this
was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information and clinical research businesses.   earnings from operations in 2004 were $129 million, up $54 million, or 72%, from 2003. operating margin was 19.3% in 2004, up from 13.1% in 2003. the increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was
primarily due to growth and improving gross margins in the health information and clinical research businesses.

2003 results compared to 2002 results   consolidated financial results   revenues   consolidated revenues increased by $3.8 billion, or 15%, in 2003 to $28.8 billion. consolidated revenues increased by approximately 11% as a result of rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth
across business segments, and 4% as a result of revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2002. following is a discussion of 2003 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components.   premium revenues consolidated premium revenues in 2003 totaled $25.4 billion,
an increase of $3.5 billion, or 16%, over 2002. unitedhealthcare premium revenues increased by $1.8 billion, driven primarily by average premium rate increases of 12% to 13% on renewing commercial risk-based business. premium revenues from medicaid
programs also increased by approximately $1.0 billion over 2002. approximately 70% of this increase resulted from the acquisition of americhoice on september 30, 2002, with the remaining 30% driven by growth in the number of individuals served by
our americhoice medicaid programs since the acquisition date. the remaining premium revenue growth in 2003 was primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served by ovations medicare supplement products provided to aarp members and
its evercare business, along with growth in several of specialized care services businesses.   service revenues service revenues in 2003 totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of $224 million, or 8%, over 2002. the increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 7% in the
number of individuals served by uniprise and unitedhealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2003.   investment and other income investment and other income totaled $257 million, representing an increase of $37 million over 2002, due primarily to increased capital gains on sales of investments. net
capital gains on sales of investments were $22 million in 2003, compared with net capital losses of $18 million in 2002. interest income decreased by $3 million in 2003, driven by lower yields on investments, partially offset by the impact of
increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments.   medical costs
the consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 83.0% in 2002 to 81.4%
in 2003. excluding the aarp business, the medical care ratio decreased 140 basis points from 81.4% in 2002 to 80.0% in 2003. the medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from net premium rate increases that exceeded overall medical benefit
cost increases and changes in product, business and customer mix.   each period,
our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical
costs reported for the current fiscal year. medical costs for 2003 include approximately $150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. medical costs for 2002 include approximately $70 million of favorable medical
cost development related to prior fiscal years.   on an absolute dollar basis,
2003 medical costs increased $2.5 billion, or 14%, over 2002. the increase was driven primarily by a rise in medical costs of approximately 10% to 11% due to medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption, and incremental
medical costs related to businesses acquired since the beginning of 2002.   operating costs   the operating cost ratio for 2003 was 16.9%,
down from 17.5% in 2002. this decrease was driven primarily by revenue mix changes, with greater growth from premium revenues than from service revenues, and productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. our
premium-based products have
table of contents
lower operating cost ratios than our fee-based products. the impact of operating cost efficiencies in 2003 was partially offset by the continued incremental
costs associated with the development, deployment, adoption and maintenance of new technology releases.   on an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2003 increased $488 million, or 11%, over 2002. this increase was driven by a 6% increase in total individuals served by health care services and uniprise during 2003,
increases in broker commissions and premium taxes due to increased revenues, general operating cost inflation, and additional operating costs associated with change initiatives and acquired businesses.   depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization in 2003 was $299 million, an increase of $44 million over
2002. this increase was due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2002.
income taxes   our effective income tax rate was 35.7% in 2003, compared to 35.5% in 2002. the change from
2002 was due to changes in business and income mix among states with differing income tax rates.   business segments   the following

nm - not meaningful   health care services   health care services had revenues of $24.8 billion in 2003, representing an increase of $3.3 billion, or 15%, over 2002. the majority of the
increase resulted from an increase of $1.9 billion in unitedhealthcare revenues, an increase of 14% over 2002. the increase in unitedhealthcare revenues was driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 12% to 13% on renewing commercial
risk-based business and 8% growth in the number of individuals served by fee-based products during 2003. revenues from medicaid programs in 2003 increased by
table of contents
$1.0 billion over 2002. approximately 70% of this increase resulted from the acquisition of americhoice on september 30, 2002, with the remaining 30% driven
by growth in the number of individuals served by americhoice medicaid programs since the acquisition date. ovations revenues increased by $319 million, or 5%, primarily due to increases in the number of individuals served by both its medicare
supplement products provided to aarp members and by its evercare business.   health care services earnings from operations in 2003 were nearly $1.9 billion, representing an increase of $537million, or 40%, over 2002. this increase primarily resulted from revenue growth and improved gross margins on
unitedhealthcares risk-based products, growth in the number of individuals served by unitedhealthcares fee-based products, and the acquisition of americhoice on september 30, 2002. unitedhealthcares commercial medical care ratio
improved to 80.0% in 2003 from 81.8% in 2002. the decrease in the commercial medical care ratio was driven primarily by the decrease in net premium rate increases that exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in business and
customer mix. health care services 2003 operating margin was 7.5%, an increase of 130 basis points over 2002. this increase was driven by a combination of improved medical care ratios and a shift in commercial product mix from risk-based
products to higher-margin, fee-based products.   the following table summarizes

excludes individuals served by ovations medicare supplement products provided to aarp
members.   the number of individuals served by
unitedhealthcares commercial business as of december 31, 2003, increased by 510,000, or 7%, over the prior year. this included an increase of 180,000, or 7%, in the number of individuals served with fee-based products, driven by new customer
relationships and existing customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products. in addition, the number of individuals served by risk-based products increased by 330,000. this increase was driven by the acquisition of golden rule in
november 2003, which resulted in the addition of 430,000 individuals served, partially offset by customers converting to self-funded, fee-based arrangements and unitedhealthcares targeted withdrawal of risk-based offerings from unprofitable
arrangements with customers using multiple benefit carriers.   ovations
year-over-year medicare advantage enrollment remained relatively stable, with 230,000 individuals served as of december 31, 2003. medicaid enrollment increased by 75,000, or 7%, due to strong growth in the number of individuals served by americhoice
over the past year.   uniprise   uniprise revenues in 2003 were $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 14% over 2002. this
increase was driven primarily by growth of 6% in the number of individuals served by uniprise during 2003, annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers, and a change in customer funding mix during 2002. uniprise served 9.1 million
individuals and 8.6 million individuals as of december 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
table of contents
uniprise earnings from operations in 2003 were $610 million, representing an increase of 18% over 2002. operating margin
for 2003 improved to 19.6% from 19.0% in 2002. uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and
occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions.   specialized care services   specialized
care services revenues during 2003 of $1.9 billion increased by $369 million, or 24%, over 2002. this increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by united behavioral health, its behavioral health benefits
business; dental benefit providers, its dental services business; and spectera, its vision care benefits business; as well as rate increases related to these businesses.   earnings from operations in 2003 of $385 million increased $99 million, or 35%, over 2002. specialized care services operating margin
increased to 20.5% in 2003, up from 19.0% in 2002. this increase was driven primarily by operational and productivity improvements at united behavioral health.
ingenix   ingenix revenues in 2003 of $574 million increased by $83 million, or 17%, over 2002. this was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information business. earnings from operations in 2003 were $75
million, up $20 million, or 36%, from 2002. operating margin was 13.1% in 2003, up from 11.2% in 2002. the increase in the operating margin was primarily due to growth in the health information business.   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources at december 31, 2004
liquidity and capital resources   we manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short- and
long-term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. we forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. a
majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our
short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors approved investment policy,
regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. our long-term investments are also available for sale to meet short-term liquidity and other needs. cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated
entities are paid to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations.   our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. cash flows generated by these
entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long-term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses
in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions.   cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are
principally from net earnings, excluding depreciation and amortization. as a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative
table of contents
impact on our liquidity. the level of profitability of our risk-based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for
health care and operating cost increases. this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match
premium rate increases with future health care costs. in 2004, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $105 million.   the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors,
including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial
flexibility mitigate much of this risk.   cash and investments
cash flows from operating activities were $4.1 billion in 2004,
representing an increase over 2003 of $1.1 billion, or 38%. this increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of $871 million in net income excluding depreciation, amortization and other noncash items. additionally, operating
cash flows increased by $261 million due to cash generated by working capital changes, driven in part by improved cash collections leading to decreases in accounts receivable and increases in unearned premiums, and an increase in medical costs
payable. as premium revenues and related medical costs increase, we generate incremental operating cash flows because we collect premium revenues in advance of the claim payments for related medical costs.   we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with cash and investments
of $12.3 billion at december 31, 2004. total cash and investments increased by $2.8 billion since december 31, 2003, primarily due to $2.4 billion in cash and investments acquired in the oxford and mamsi acquisitions and strong operating cash flows,
partially offset by common stock repurchases, cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures.   as further described under regulatory capital and dividend restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions
that may be paid to their parent companies. at december 31, 2004, approximately $227 million of our $12.3 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries. of this amount, approximately $37 million was segregated for future
regulatory capital needs and the remainder was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases.   financing and investing activities   in addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities, we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility. as of
december 31, 2004 and 2003, we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately $4.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 27.3% and 27.8% as of december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, respectively.
we believe the prudent use of debt leverage optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity.   on july 29, 2004, our health care services business segment acquired oxford. under the terms of the purchase agreement, oxford shareholders received 0.6357 shares of
unitedhealth group common stock and $16.17 in cash for each share of oxford common stock they owned. total consideration issued was approximately $5.0 billion, comprised of approximately 52.2 million shares of unitedhealth group common stock (valued
at approximately $3.4 billion based upon the average of unitedhealth groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of april 26, 2004), approximately $1.3 billion in cash and
unitedhealth group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of $240 million issued in exchange for oxfords outstanding vested common stock options.   on february 10, 2004, our health care services business segment acquired mamsi. under the terms of the purchase agreement, mamsi
shareholders received 0.82 shares of unitedhealth group common stock and
table of contents
$18in cash for each share of mamsi common stock they owned. total consideration issued was approximately $2.7 billion, comprised of 36.4 million shares
of unitedhealth group common stock (valued at $1.9 billion based upon the average of unitedhealth groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of october 27, 2003) and
approximately $800 million in cash.   on december 10, 2004, our uniprise
business segment acquired definity. under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $305 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of definity. available cash and commercial paper issuance financed the definity purchase price.
in july 2004, we issued $1.2 billion of commercial paper to fund the cash
portion of the oxford purchase price. in august 2004, we refinanced the commercial paper by issuing $550 million of 3.4% fixed-rate notes due august 2007, $450 million of 4.1% fixed-rate notes due august 2009 and $500 million of 5.0% fixed-rate
notes due august 2014.   in february 2004, we issued $250 million of 3.8%
fixed-rate notes due february 2009 and $250 million of 4.8% fixed-rate notes due february 2014. we used the proceeds from the february 2004 borrowings to finance a majority of the cash portion of the mamsi purchase price as described above.
in december and march 2003, we issued $500 million of four-year, fixed-rate
notes and $450 million of 10-year, fixed-rate notes with interest rates of 3.3% and 4.9%, respectively. we used the proceeds from the 2003 borrowings to repay commercial paper and maturing term debt, and for general corporate purposes including
working capital, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and share repurchases.   we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert our interest exposure on a majority of these 2003 and 2004 borrowings from a fixed to a variable rate. the interest rate swap agreements on these borrowings have aggregate notional
amounts of $2.9 billion. at december 31, 2004, the rate used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 2.3% to 3.3%. the differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the
life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.   in june 2004, we executed a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility to support our commercial paper program. this credit facility replaced our existing $450 million revolving facility that was set to expire
in july 2005, and our $450 million, 364-day facility that was set to expire in july 2004. as of december 31, 2004, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility. commercial paper increased from $79 million at december 31, 2003, to $273
million at december 31, 2004.   our debt arrangements and credit facility
contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders equity) below 45%
and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels. we are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants.   our senior debt is rated a by standard & poors (s&p) and fitch, and a3 with a positive outlook by moodys. our commercial paper
is rated a-1 by s&p, f-1 by fitch, and p-2 with a positive outlook by moodys. consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the a range, we intend to maintain our
debt-to-total-capital ratio at approximately 30% or less. a significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs.   under our board of directors authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. repurchases may be made from time to time
at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. during 2004, we repurchased 51.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $68 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $3.5 billion. as of
december 31, 2004, we had board of directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 54.6 million shares of our common stock. our common stock repurchase program
table of contents
is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. we repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital. a decision by
the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility.   under our s-3 shelf registration statement (for common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities), the remaining issuing capacity of all covered
securities is $500 million. we intend to file a new s-3 shelf registration statement during the first half of 2005 to increase our remaining issuing capacity. we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at
the time of offering. under our s-4 acquisition shelf registration statement, we have remaining issuing capacity of 24.3 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities. we filed separate s-4 registration statements for
the 36.4million shares issued in connection with the february 2004 acquisition of mamsi and for the 52.2 million shares issued in connection with the july 2004 acquisition of oxford described previously.   contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments   the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december 31, 2004,

includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments.   currently, we do not have any other material contractual obligations, off-balance sheet
arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. this includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions.
aarp   in january 1998, we entered into a 10-year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp. these products and
services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare. under the terms of the contract, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. we are also engaged in
product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program. premium revenues from our portion of the aarp insurance offerings were approximately $4.5 billion in 2004, $4.1 billion in 2003 and $3.7 billion in 2002.
the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp business are directly
recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (rsf). the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member services expenses, marketing expenses
and premium taxes. underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the
table of contents
rsf. to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf, we would have to fund the deficit. any deficit we fund could be recovered by
underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. to date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. as further described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the rsf balance is reported in other policy
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract.   regulatory capital and dividend restrictions   we conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the national association
of insurance commissioners (naic). these standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions
that may be paid to their parent companies. generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory
net income and statutory capital and surplus. the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings. consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the a
range, we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require. as of december 31, 2004, our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of
approximately $4.1 billion, which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements.   critical accounting policies and estimates   critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in
subsequent periods. critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. we believe our most critical accounting
policies are those described below. for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.   medical costs   each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for
liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. the actuarial
models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and
demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. depending on the health care provider and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of
service. substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to 12 months from the date of service. we estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of
potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies.   each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact, we
increase or decrease the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely
developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable

development). historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than one-half of 1% of annual medical costs, less than 4% of annual
earnings from operations and less than 3% of medical costs payable.   in order
to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in
subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations (in millions).

(c)
not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2005 will change as our december 31, 2004 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2005.
our estimate of medical costs payable represents
managements best estimate of the companys liability for unpaid medical costs as of december 31, 2004, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and
adequate to cover the companys liability for unpaid claims as of december 31, 2004; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our december 31, 2004 estimates of medical
costs payable and actual costs payable, excluding the aarp business, 2004 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $46 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by approximately $0.05 per share.
long-lived assets   as of december 31, 2004, we had long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible
assets, property, equipment and capitalized software, of $11.8 billion. we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances
indicate we might not recover their carrying value. to determine the fair value of the respective assets and assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including
estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record
impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs.   investments   as of december 31, 2004, we had approximately $8.3 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. our investments are principally classified as
available for sale and are recorded at fair value. we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders equity. we
continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. as of december 31, 2004, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $215 million and gross unrealized losses of $11 million. if any of our investments
experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations. management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a
decline in an investments fair value is other than temporary. new information and the
table of contents
passage of time can change these judgments. we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at
that time. we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to u.s. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are
investment grade.   revenues    revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. we recognize premium
revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as
recorded in our records. employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous
billing. we estimate and adjust the current periods revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. we revise
estimates of revenue adjustments each period, and record changes in the period they become known.   contingent liabilities   because
of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. our estimates
are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages, if any, for such matters. we do not
believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or
annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions.   inflation   the current national health care cost inflation
rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with
physicians and other health care providers. through contracts with physicians and other health care providers, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and
closing gaps in care.   we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of
health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. however, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other
health care providers and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost
trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results.   legal matters   because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design, management and offerings of our services. we record liabilities for our estimates of probable
costs resulting from these matters. these matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices.
following the events of september 11, 2001, the cost of business insurance coverage increased significantly. as a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business.

in re: managed care litigation: mdl no. 1334. beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed
against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. in december 2000, a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates in the southern district court of
florida, miami division. generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits. other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws
and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered. the consolidated suits seek injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. the trial
court granted the health care providers motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals. the eleventh circuit affirmed the class action status of the rico claims, but reversed as to the
breach of contract, unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims. through a series of motions and appeals, all direct claims against unitedhealthcare have been compelled to arbitration. the trial court has denied unitedhealthcares further
motion to compel the secondary rico claims to arbitration and the eleventh circuit affirmed that order. a trial date has been set for september 2005. the trial court has ordered that the trial be bifurcated into separate liability and damage
proceedings.   the american medical association et al. v. metropolitan life
insurance company, united healthcare services. inc. and unitedhealth group. on march 15, 2000, the american medical association filed a lawsuit against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york, county of new york. on april 13,
2000, we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york. the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa, as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive
acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. the suit seeks declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest
payments. an amended complaint was filed on august 25, 2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an erisa class and a non-erisa class. after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association, a
third amended complaint was filed. on october 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. on may 21, 2003, we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations
against the american medical association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff. on may 26, 2004, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and
parties based, in part, due to lack of standing. on july 16, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking to assert rico violations.   although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or
pending, including those described above, will, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks   market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices.
the companys primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long-term debt.   approximately $12.0 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at december 31, 2004 were debt securities. assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or
decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed-income investment portfolio at december 31, 2004, the fair value of our fixed-income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $355 million. we manage our investment portfolio to limit
our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to u.s. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade.   to mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest
rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long-term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short-term
table of contents
investments. including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $3.2 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of
interest and $825 million had fixed rates as of december 31, 2004. a hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt.   at december 31, 2004, we had $207 million of equity investments, primarily held by our
unitedhealth capital business in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will
likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio.   concentrations of credit
risk   investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities
and accounts receivable may subject unitedhealth group to concentrations of credit risk. our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors. this policy limits the amounts that may be
invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to u.s. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts
receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. as of december 31, 2004, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.   cautionary statements   the statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
(the pslra). when used in this annual report on form 10-k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or
with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases believes, anticipates, expects, plans, seeks, intends, will likely result,
estimates, projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from
the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.   the following
discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. this discussion is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra. except to the extent otherwise
required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may
have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. in addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future
results. any or all forward-looking statements in this form 10-k and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and
uncertainties. many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior
communications.   we must effectively manage our health care costs.
under our risk-based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both
medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. premium revenues from risk-based products (excluding aarp) have typically comprised approximately 75% to 80% of our total consolidated revenues. we generally use
approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers. the profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict, price for, and effectively
manage health care costs. total health care costs are affected by the number of
table of contents
individual services rendered and the cost of each service. our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month period and is generally priced one
to four months before contract commencement. services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences. although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period,
inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. these factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the
introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our
financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. if medical costs increased by 1 percent without a proportional
change in related revenues for unitedhealthcares commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2004 would have been reduced by approximately $105 million. in addition, the financial results we report for any particular period
include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which we have not received the underlying claims or for which we have received the claims but not yet processed them. if these estimates prove too high or too low, the effect of the change in
estimate will be included in future results. that change can be either positive or negative to our results.   we face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors.   our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate. for our uniprise and health care services
segments, competitors include aetna inc., cigna corporation, coventry health care, inc., humana inc., pacificare health systems, inc., wellchoice, inc., and wellpoint, inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under
licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas. our specialized care services and ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses. the addition of new competitors
for at least the short-term can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. in particular markets, competitors may have capabilities that give them a competitive advantage. greater market
share, established reputation, superior supplier arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. in addition, significant merger and acquisition
activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries. consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business
with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability.   our
relationship with aarp is important   under our 10-year contract with
aarp, which commenced in 1998, we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members. as of december 31, 2004, our portion of aarps insurance program represented approximately $4.5 billion in
annual net premium revenue from approximately 3.8 million aarp members. the aarp contract may be terminated early by us or aarp under certain circumstances, including a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse
change in the financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement. the success of our aarp arrangement depends, in part, on our ability to service aarp and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and
services competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes.   the favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in medicare are uncertain.   the medicare changes being implemented as a result of the medicare modernization act of 2003 are complex and wide-ranging. there are numerous changes that will influence
our business. we have invested considerable resources analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with the changes that may arise. in january 2005, the centers for medicare and medicaid services released detailed regulations on
major aspects of
table of contents
the legislation, however, some important requirements related to the implementation of the new product offerings, including the part d prescription drug
benefit and the regional medicare advantage preferred provider organizations, have not yet been released by the federal government, thus creating challenges for planning and implementation. we believe the increased funding provided in the
legislation will increase the number of competitors in the seniors health services market.   our business is subject to government scrutiny, and we must respond quickly and appropriately to changes in government regulations.   our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. the laws and rules governing our business and
interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and
enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. we must obtain and maintain
regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions. delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our
revenue or increase our costs.   we participate in federal, state and local
government health care coverage programs. these programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our
administrative or health care costs under such programs. such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future.   state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues. legislative and
regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage
determinations; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; and government-sponsored programs. we cannot predict if
any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation, or, if enacted, what their terms will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct
business or put us at risk for loss of business.   we typically have and are
currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. these include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by cms, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the
office of the inspector general, the office of personnel management, the office of civil rights, the department of justice and u.s. attorneys. such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or
other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs.   important relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers.   we contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices.
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices. a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care
professionals from federal and state antitrust laws. in any particular market, these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less
desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. in some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have
significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part.
table of contents
the nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks, and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to
cover some of the costs associated with litigation.   periodically, we
become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual
property-related litigation. in addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design, management and offerings of our services. these matters include, but are not limited
to, claims related to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. in 1999, a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all
major entities in the health benefits business. the suits are purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes, including the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa) and the
racketeer influenced corrupt organization act (rico). in march 2000, the american medical association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network
providers. although the expenses which we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action lawsuits and the american medical association lawsuit have not been material to our business, we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of
these lawsuits and other matters, even if they are without merit.   following
the events of september 11, 2001, the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly. as a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. we believe
that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance; however, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by insurance. we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from
self-insured matters. although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded.   our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems.
our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and
efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. as a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. we have been taking
steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain
effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician
and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences.   we use or employ independent third parties, such as international business machines corporation (ibm), with whom we have entered into agreements, for significant portions
of our data center operations. even though we have appropriate provisions in our agreements, including provisions with respect to specific performance standards, covenants, warranties, audit rights, indemnification, and other provisions, our
dependence on these third parties makes our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately under the contracts, due to internal or external factors. although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size, scale and
capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services, we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms. a change in service providers, however, could result in a decline in service quality and
effectiveness or less favorable contract terms.   we have intangible
assets, whose values may become impaired.   due largely to our recent
acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $10.7 billion as of december 31, 2004,
table of contents
representing approximately 38% of our total assets. if we make additional acquisitions, it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our
books. we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. any future evaluations
requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. a material decrease in shareholders equity
could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.   we must comply with emerging restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates who
obtain access to sensitive patient information when providing services to us.   the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. various state laws address
the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data. most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm-leach-bliley act and hipaa. hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates (as this term is
defined in the hipaa regulations). even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. compliance with these proposals, requirements,
and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. they also may impose further restrictions on
our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases.   our knowledge and information-related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products.   we rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to
protect our proprietary rights. these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. in addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and
we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our
ability to market and sell products and services.   the effects of the war
on terror and future terrorist attacks could impact the health care industry.   the terrorist attacks launched on september 11, 2001, the war on terrorism, the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the u.s.
economy in general and our industry specifically. depending on the governments actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies, future acts of terrorism and bio-terrorism could lead to, among other things,
increased use of health care services including, without limitation, hospital and physician services; loss of membership in health benefit programs we administer as a result of lay-offs or other reductions of employment; adverse effects upon the
financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees; disruption of our information and payment systems; increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of
risk, such as acts of terrorism; and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general.

table of contents
notes to the consolidated financial statements   1. description of business   unitedhealth group incorporated (also referred to as unitedhealth group, the company, we, us, and our) is a
diversified health and well-being company dedicated to making health care work better. through strategically aligned, market-defined businesses, we design products, provide services and apply technologies that improve access to health and well-being
services, simplify the health care experience, promote quality and make health care more affordable.   2. summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   we have prepared the consolidated
financial statements according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have included the accounts of unitedhealth group and its subsidiaries. we have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and
transactions.   use of estimates   these consolidated financial statements include certain amounts that are based on our best
estimates and judgments. these estimates require us to apply complex assumptions and judgments, often because we must make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and will change in subsequent periods. the most
significant estimates relate to medical costs, medical costs payable, contingent liabilities, intangible asset valuations, asset impairments and revenues. we adjust these estimates each period, as more current information becomes available. the
impact of any changes in estimates is included in the determination of earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.   revenues   premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers
health care services and related administrative costs. we recognize premium revenues in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. we record health care premium payments we receive from our customers in
advance of the service period as unearned premiums.   service revenues consist
primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. under service fee contracts, we recognize revenue in the period the related services are performed based upon
the fee charged to the customer. the customers retain the risk of financing medical benefits for their employees and their employees dependents, and we administer the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care providers from
customer-funded bank accounts. because we do not have the obligation for funding the medical expenses, nor do we have responsibility for delivering the medical care, we do not recognize gross revenue and medical costs for these contracts in our
consolidated financial statements.   for both premium risk-based and fee-based
customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care
professionals.   medical costs and medical costs payable   medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical
care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which we have either not yet received or processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. we develop estimates for medical
costs
table of contents
incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. the actuarial models consider factors
such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, provider contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on
actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact, we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs
in the period in which the change is identified. in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods.   cash, cash equivalents and investments   cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that generally have an original
maturity of three months or less. the fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. we may
sell investments classified as long-term before their maturities to fund working capital or for other purposes. because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. we
classify these investments as held to maturity and report them at amortized cost. all other investments are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.   we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and
report it, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of shareholders equity. we continually monitor the difference between the cost and estimated fair value of our investments. if any of our investments experiences a decline in value
that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in investment and other income in our consolidated statements of operations. to calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of
investments, we use the specific cost or amortized cost of each investment sold.   assets under management   we administer certain aspects of
aarps insurance program (see note 11). pursuant to our agreement, aarp assets are managed separately from our general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the aarp program. these assets are invested at our discretion,
within investment guidelines approved by aarp. we do not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon transfer of the aarp contract to another entity, we would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at
the date of transfer to that entity. because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (rsf) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with the aarp contract, assets under management are
classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders through the rsf. as such, they
are not included in our earnings.   property, equipment and capitalized
software   property, equipment and capitalized software is stated at cost,
net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and payroll costs of employees devoted
to specific software development.   we calculate depreciation and amortization
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the useful lives for property, equipment and capitalized software are: from three to seven years for furniture, fixtures and equipment; from 35 to 40 years for buildings;
the shorter of the useful life or remaining lease term for leasehold improvements; and from three to nine years for capitalized software. the weighted-average useful life of property, equipment and capitalized software at december 31, 2004, was
approximately five years. the net book value of property and equipment was $543 million and $503 million as of
table of contents
december 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the net book value of capitalized software was $596 million and $529 million as of december 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.   goodwill and other intangible assets   goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price and transaction costs of
businesses we have acquired exceed the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets of these businesses. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested
at least annually for impairment. intangible assets with discrete useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.   long-lived assets   we review long-lived assets, including property, equipment, capitalized software and intangible assets, for events or changes in circumstances that would indicate we might not recover their carrying value. we consider
many factors, including estimated future utility and cash flows associated with the assets, to make this decision. an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which an assets carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. we record
assets held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less any costs for the final settlement.   other policy liabilities   other policy liabilities include the rsf associated with the aarp program (see note 11), customer balances related to experience-rated insurance products and the current
portion of future policy benefits for life insurance and annuity contracts. customer balances represent excess customer payments and deposit accounts under experience-rated contracts. at the customers option, these balances may be refunded or
used to pay future premiums or claims under eligible contracts.   income
taxes   deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. the deferred income tax provision or benefit generally reflects the net change in deferred income tax assets and
liabilities during the year, excluding any deferred income tax assets and liabilities of acquired businesses. the current income tax provision reflects the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income
tax returns for the year reported.   future policy benefits for life and
annuity contracts   future policy benefits for life insurance and annuity
contracts represents account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products.   policy acquisition costs   for our health insurance contracts, costs related to the acquisition and renewal of customer contracts are charged to expense as incurred. our health insurance contracts
typically have a one-year term and may be cancelled upon 30 days notice by either the company or the customer.   stock-based compensation   we account
for activity under our stock-based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no. 25, accounting for stock issued to employees. accordingly, we do not recognize
compensation expense in connection with employee stock option grants because we grant stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.

information on our stock-based
compensation plans and data used to calculate compensation expense in the table above are described in more detail in note 9.   net earnings per common share   we compute basic net earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. we determine
diluted net earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares that might be issued upon exercise of common stock options.   derivative financial instruments   as part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to
manage our exposure to interest rate risk. the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of
operations. our existing interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of our interest rate exposure from a fixed to a variable rate and are accounted for as fair value hedges. additional information on our existing interest rate swap agreements
is included in note 7.   recently issued accounting standards
in december 2004, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 123
(revised 2004), share-based payment (fas no. 123(r)), which amends fasb statement nos. 123 and 95. fas no. 123(r) requires all companies to measure compensation expense for all share-based payments (including employee stock options) at
fair value and recognize the expense over the related service period. additionally, excess tax benefits, as defined in fas no. 123(r), will be recognized as an addition to paid-in capital and will be reclassified from operating cash flows to
financing cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. fas no. 123(r) will be effective for the third quarter of 2005. we are currently evaluating the effect that fas no. 123(r) will have on our financial position, results of operations
and operating cash flows. we have included information regarding the effect on net earnings and net earnings per common share had we applied the fair value expense recognition provisions of the original fas no. 123 within the stock-based
compensation heading in this note.
table of contents
in march 2004, the fasb issued eitf issue no. 03-1 (eitf 03-1), the meaning of other-than-temporary
impairment and its application to certain investments. eitf 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its
carrying value. in september 2004, the fasb delayed the effective date beyond 2004 for the measurement and recognition provisions until the issuance of additional implementation guidance. the delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize
impairment losses as required by existing authoritative literature. we will evaluate the impact of this new accounting standard on our process for determining other-than-temporary impairments of applicable debt and equity securities upon final
issuance.   3. acquisitions   on july 29, 2004, our health care services business segment acquired oxford health plans,
inc. (oxford). oxford provides health care and benefit services for individuals and employers, principally in new york city, northern new jersey and southern connecticut. this merger strengthened our market position in this region and provided
substantial distribution opportunities in this region for our other unitedhealth group businesses. under the terms of the purchase agreement, oxford shareholders received 0.6357 shares of unitedhealth group common stock and $16.17 in cash for each
share of oxford common stock they owned. total consideration issued was approximately $5.0 billion, comprised of approximately 52.2 million shares of unitedhealth group common stock (valued at approximately $3.4 billion based upon the average of
unitedhealth groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of april 26, 2004), approximately $1.3 billion in cash and unitedhealth group vested common stock options with an
estimated fair value of $240 million issued in exchange for oxfords outstanding vested common stock options. the purchase price and costs associated with the acquisition exceeded the preliminary estimated fair value of the net tangible assets
acquired by approximately $4.2 billion. pending completion of an independent valuation analysis, we have preliminarily allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired to finite-lived intangible assets of
$735 million and associated deferred tax liabilities of $277 million, and goodwill of approximately $3.7 billion. the finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of member lists and health care physician and hospital networks, with an estimated
weighted-average useful life of 15 years. the acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. our preliminary estimate of the fair value of the tangible assets/(liabilities) as of the acquisition date, which is subject to further
refinement, is as follows:

on february 10, 2004, our health care
services business segment acquired mid atlantic medical services, inc. (mamsi). mamsi offers a broad range of health care coverage and related administrative services for individuals and employers in the mid-atlantic region of the united states.
this merger strengthened unitedhealthcares market position in the mid-atlantic region and provided substantial distribution opportunities for other unitedhealth group businesses in this region. under the terms of the purchase agreement, mamsi
shareholders received 0.82 shares of unitedhealth group common stock and $18 in cash for each share of mamsi common stock they owned. total consideration issued was approximately $2.7 billion, comprised of 36.4 million shares of unitedhealth group
common stock (valued at $1.9 billion based on the average of unitedhealth groups share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of october 27, 2003) and $800 million in cash. the
purchase price and costs associated with the acquisition exceeded the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by approximately $2.1billion. based on managements consideration of fair value, which included an independent
valuation
table of contents
analysis, we have allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired to finite-lived intangible assets of
approximately $280 million and associated deferred tax liabilities of approximately $100 million, and goodwill of approximately $1.9 billion. the finite-lived intangible assets consist of member lists, health care physician and hospital networks,
and trademarks, with an estimated weighted-average useful life of 17 years. the acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. our estimate of the fair value of the tangible assets/(liabilities) as of the acquisition date is as

the results of operations and
financial condition of oxford and mamsi have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. the unaudited pro forma financial information presented below assumes that the acquisitions of oxford and mamsi had
occurred as of the beginning of each respective period presented below. the pro forma adjustments include the pro forma effect of unitedhealth group shares issued in the acquisitions, the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets arising from
the purchase price allocations, interest expense related to financing the cash portion of the purchase price and the associated income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments. because the unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared
based on estimates of fair values, the actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the oxford purchase price allocation may differ from the information presented below. the unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes
only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the oxford and mamsi acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the respective periods.

on december 10, 2004, our uniprise
business segment acquired definity health corporation (definity). definity is the national market leader in consumer-driven health benefit programs. this acquisition strengthened our position in the emerging consumer-driven health benefits
marketplace. we paid $305 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of definity. the purchase price and costs associated with the acquisition exceeded the preliminary estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired by
approximately $263 million. we have preliminarily allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired to finite-lived intangible assets of $60 million and associated deferred tax liabilities of
$21million, and goodwill of $224 million. the finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of member lists, with an estimated weighted-average useful life of 15 years. the acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. the
results of operations and financial condition of definity have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. the pro forma effects of the definity acquisition on our consolidated financial statements were not
material. our preliminary estimate of the acquired net tangible assets of $42 million, which is subject to further refinement, consisted mainly of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, property and equipment and other assets partially offset
by current liabilities.   for the year ended december 31, 2004, aggregate
consideration paid or issued for smaller acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method was $158 million. these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements.

obligations. at december 31, 2004, we held $619 million in debt securities with maturities of less than one year, $2,431 million in debt securities with maturities of one to five years, $2,734 million in debt securities with maturities of five to 10
years and $2,271 million in debt securities with maturities of more than 10 years.   as of december 31, 2004, we had no investments in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater. gross unrealized losses of $11 million were largely due to interest rate increases and relate to debt securities with an
aggregate fair value of $1.8 billion at december 31, 2004.   we recorded
realized gains and losses on sales of investments, excluding the unitedhealth capital disposition described below, as follows:

estimated based on third-party quoted market prices for the same or similar issues   as of december 31, 2004, our outstanding commercial paper had interest rates ranging from 2.3% to 2.4%.   we have interest rate swap agreements that qualify as fair value hedges to convert the
majority of our interest rate exposure from a fixed to a variable rate. the interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of $2.9 billion with variable rates that are benchmarked to the six-month libor (london interbank offered
rate). at december 31, 2004, the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 2.3% to 3.3%. the differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the
agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.   in june 2004, we executed a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility to support our commercial paper program. this credit facility replaced our $450 million revolving facility that was set to expire in july
2005, and our $450 million, 364-day facility that was set to expire in july 2004. as of december 31, 2004, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility.   our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a
debt-to-total-capital ratio below 45% and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels. we are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants.   maturities of commercial paper and debt for the years ending december 31 are as follows: $673 million in 2005, $950 million in 2007, $500
million in 2008, $700 million in 2009, and $1,200 million thereafter.   we made
cash payments for interest of $100 million, $94 million and $86 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

8. shareholders equity   regulatory capital and dividend restrictions   we conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the national association
of insurance commissioners (naic). these standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions
that may be paid to their parent companies. generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory
net income and statutory capital and surplus. at december 31, 2004, approximately $227 million of our $12.3 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries. of this amount, approximately $37 million was segregated for future
regulatory capital needs and the remainder was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases.   the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings. consistent with our intent to maintain our senior
debt ratings in the a range, we maintain an aggregate statutory capital and surplus level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require. as of december 31, 2004, our regulated
subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $4.1 billion, which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements.   stock repurchase program   under our board of directors authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject
to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. during 2004, we repurchased 51.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $68 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $3.5 billion. as of december 31, 2004, we had board of
directors authorization to purchase up to an additional 54.6 million shares of our common stock.   preferred stock   at december 31, 2004,
we had 10 million shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock authorized for issuance, and no preferred shares issued and outstanding.   9. stock-based compensation plans   as of december 31, 2004, we had approximately 49.2 million shares available for future grants of stock-based awards under our stock-based compensation plan including, but
not limited to, incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock.   stock options are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. they generally vest ratably over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of
grant. activity under our stock option plan is summarized in the tables below (shares in millions):

we also maintain a 401(k) plan and an
employee stock purchase plan. activity related to these plans was not significant in relation to our consolidated financial results in 2004, 2003 and 2002.   to determine compensation expense related to our stock-based compensation plans under the fair value method, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date
of grant using an option-pricing model. for purposes of estimating the fair value of our employee stock option grants, we utilized a black-scholes model during 2002 and a binomial model during 2003 and 2004. the principal assumptions we used in
applying the option pricing models were as follows:
risk-free interest rate

valuation allowances are provided when
it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. the valuation allowances primarily relate to future tax benefits on certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. federal net operating loss
carryforwards expire beginning in 2017 through 2023, and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2005 through 2024.   we made cash payments for income taxes of $898 million in 2004, $783 million in 2003 and $458 million in 2002. we increased additional paid-in capital and reduced income
taxes payable by $358 million in 2004, $222million in 2003, and by $133 million in 2002 to reflect the tax benefit we received upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options.   internal revenue service examinations for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 have been completed and the resulting settlements have been
included in our 2004 consolidated operating results.   11. aarp
in january 1998, we entered into a 10-year contract to provide health
insurance products and services to members of aarp. these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare. under the terms of the contract, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services
as well as for assuming underwriting risk. we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program. premium revenues from our portion of the aarp insurance offerings were approximately $4.5
billion in 2004, $4.1 billion in 2003 and $3.7 billion in 2002.   the
underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (rsf). the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income,
administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders, unless cumulative
net losses were to exceed the balance in the rsf. to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf, we would have to fund the deficit. any
table of contents
deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. to date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting
deficits. the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract.
the following aarp program-related assets and liabilities are included in our
consolidated balance sheets:

the effects of changes in balance
sheet amounts associated with the aarp program accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders through the rsf balance. accordingly, we do not include the effect of such changes in our consolidated statements of cash flows.   pursuant to our agreement, aarp assets under management are managed separately from our
general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the aarp program. these assets are invested at our discretion, within investment guidelines approved by aarp. we do not guarantee any rates of investment return on these
investments and, upon transfer of the aarp contract to another entity, we would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to that entity. interest earnings and realized investment gains and losses
on these assets accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders through the rsf. as such, they are not included in our earnings. interest income and realized gains and losses related to assets under management are recorded as an increase to
the aarp rsf and were $103 million, $101 million and $102 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. assets under management are reported at their fair market value, and unrealized gains and losses are included directly in the rsf associated with
the aarp program. as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of cash, cash equivalents and investments associated with the aarp insurance program, included in assets under management, were

12. commitments and contingencies   leases   we lease facilities, computer hardware and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2025. rent expense
under all operating leases was $137million in 2004, $133 million in 2003 and $132 million in 2002.   at december 31, 2004, future minimum annual lease payments, net of sublease income, under all noncancelable operating leases were as follows: $126 million in 2005, $116 million in 2006, $106 million in 2007, $78
million in 2008, $62 million in 2009, and $149 million thereafter.   service
agreements   we have noncancelable contracts for certain data center
operations and support, network and voice communication services, and other services, which expire on various dates through 2009. expenses incurred in connection with these agreements were $265 million in 2004, $256 million in 2003 and $264 million
in 2002. at december 31, 2004, future minimum obligations under our noncancelable contracts were as follows: $103 million in 2005, $55 million in 2006, $14 million in 2007, $9 million in 2008, and $3 million in 2009.   legal matters   because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design, management and
offerings of our services. we record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters. these matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract
disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. following the events of september 11, 2001, the cost of business insurance coverage increased significantly. as a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we
self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business.   beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. in december 2000, a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving
unitedhealth group and our affiliates in the southern district court of florida, miami division. generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize
profits. other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered. the consolidated suits seek injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief
as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. the trial court granted the health care providers motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals. the eleventh circuit affirmed the
class action status of the rico claims, but reversed as to the breach of contract, unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims. through a series of motions and appeals, all direct claims against unitedhealthcare have been compelled to arbitration.
the trial court has denied unitedhealthcares further motion to compel the secondary rico claims to arbitration and the eleventh circuit affirmed that order. a trial date has been set for september 2005. the trial court has ordered that the
trial be bifurcated into separate liability and damage proceedings.   on march
15, 2000, the american medical association filed a lawsuit against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york, county of new york. on april 13, 2000, we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district
of new york. the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa, as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and
customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. the suit seeks declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest payments. an amended complaint was filed on august 25, 2000, which alleged two classes of
plaintiffs, an erisa class and a non-erisa class. after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by
table of contents
the american medical association, a third amended complaint was filed. on october 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to
dismiss the third amended complaint. on may 21, 2003, we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the american medical association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an
individual provider plaintiff. on may 26, 2004, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based, in part, due to lack of standing. on july 16, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file
an amended complaint, seeking to assert rico violations.   although the results
of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described above, will, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.    government regulation   our business is regulated at federal, state, local and international levels. the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. broad latitude is
given to the agencies administering those regulations. state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues as the subject of proposed legislation. existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business,
restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions.
further, we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products.   we typically have and are currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits, and reviews. these include routine, regular and special investigations, audits, and reviews by cms, state insurance and
health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the office of the inspector general, the office of personnel management, the office of civil rights, the department of justice, and u.s. attorneys. such government actions can result in
assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. we record liabilities for our estimate of probable costs resulting from these
matters. although the results of pending matters are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations, audits or reviews, currently threatened or pending, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.   other contingencies   in 2002, oxford, which we acquired on
july 29, 2004, entered into agreements with two insurance companies that guaranteed cost reduction targets related to certain orthopedic medical services. in 2003, the insurers sought to rescind or terminate the agreements claiming various
misrepresentations and material breaches of the agreements by oxford. pursuant to the agreements, oxford filed claims to recover approximately $50 million of costs incurred and expensed in excess of the cost reduction targets for the period from
november 2002 to october 2004. an arbitration hearing with the insurance company holding a large majority of the coverage under the policies was held in january 2005, and a decision was issued on february 22, 2005, denying the insurers ability
to rescind or terminate its agreement. as a result of the decision, oxford was awarded approximately $30 million in net recoveries. the insurer has not yet indicated whether it will appeal this decision. oxford will not record the net recoveries
until all contingencies have been resolved. we believe that the remaining insurers claims are also without merit, and we will vigorously seek to enforce our rights.   13. segment financial information   factors used in determining our reportable business segments include the nature of operating activities, existence of separate senior management teams, and the type of
information presented to the companys chief operating decision-maker to evaluate our results of operations.
table of contents
our accounting policies for business segment operations are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies (see note 2). transactions between business segments principally consist of customer service and transaction processing services that uniprise provides to health care services, certain product offerings sold to uniprise and
health care services customers by specialized care services, and sales of medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling to health care services and uniprise by ingenix. these transactions are recorded at
managements best estimate of fair value, as if the services were purchased from or sold to third parties. all intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. assets and liabilities that are jointly used are assigned to each segment
using estimates of pro-rata usage. cash and investments are assigned such that each segment has minimum specified levels of regulatory capital or working capital for non-regulated businesses. the corporate and eliminations column also
includes eliminations of intersegment transactions.   substantially all of our
operations are conducted in the united states. in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, segments with similar economic characteristics may be combined. the financial results of unitedhealthcare,
ovations and americhoice have been combined in the health care services segment column in the following tables because these businesses have similar economic characteristics and have similar products and services, types of customers, distribution
methods and operational processes, and operate in a similar regulatory environment, typically within the same legal entity.

report of independent registered public accounting firm   to the board of directors and shareholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and
subsidiaries:   we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries (the company) as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended december 31, 2004. these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting
oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.   we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting
oversight board (united states), the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in internal controlthe integrated framework issued by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 28, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial

controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of december 31, 2004, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934). based upon that evaluation, the
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it
files or submits under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms.   internal control over financial reporting   report of management   the management of unitedhealth group is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the securities exchange act of 1934. the companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.   because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004. in making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal controlintegrated framework. based on our assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of december 31, 2004, the company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm   to the board of directors and shareholders of unitedhealth group incorporated and
subsidiaries:   we have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying report of management, that unitedhealth group incorporated and subsidiaries (the company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in
internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.   we conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   in our opinion, managements assessment that the company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the
treadway commission. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in internal control-integrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.   we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2004 of the
company and our report dated february 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.   /s/deloitte & touche llp  minneapolis, minnesota  february 28, 2005
