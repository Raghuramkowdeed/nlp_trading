TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANY OF OUR CONTRACT RESEARCH SERVICES, CONSULTING ARRANGEMENTS AND SOFTWARE AND RELATED INFORMATION SERVICES ARE

PERFORMED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, OFTEN SEVERAL YEARS. WE MAINTAIN AN ORDER BACKLOG TO TRACK ANTICIPATED REVENUES YET TO BE EARNED FOR WORK THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN PERFORMED UNDER THESE LONG-TERM ARRANGEMENTS. OUR BACKLOG GENERALLY CONSISTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE REGULATED BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. THIS REGULATION CAN VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO ENACT AND CONSIDER VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, INCLUDING PROPOSALS TO

ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS. THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE PERIODICALLY. NEW LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES, OR CHANGES IN THE

INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES. IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATIONS, OR FAIL TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND FREQUENT CHANGES IN FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE

ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

FEDERAL LAWS

AND REGULATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEVELS OF FEDERAL REGULATION. OVATIONS AND AMERICHOICE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID BUSINESSES ARE REGULATED BY CMS.

CMS HAS THE RIGHT TO AUDIT PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CMS CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE BEING GIVEN TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING SEGMENT, THROUGH AMERICHOICE AND OVATIONS, ALSO HAS

MEDICAID AND SCHIP CONTRACTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE MANY REGULATIONS SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND

MEDICAID COMPLIANCE. WHEN WE CONTRACT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE AWARD, ADMINISTRATION AND PERFORMANCE OF U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, THE PORTION OF INGENIXS BUSINESS

THAT INCLUDES CLINICAL RESEARCH IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION, ANTI-FRAUD AND ABUSE, ANTI-KICKBACKS, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, SECURITIES

AND ANTITRUST.

HIPAA, GLBA AND OTHER PRIVACY AND SECURITY REGULATION.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE

PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996, AS AMENDED (HIPAA), APPLY TO BOTH THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING SELF-FUNDED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. HIPAA REQUIRES GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS AND

CERTAIN ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. IT ALSO REQUIRES GUARANTEED RENEWABILITY FOR EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS AND LIMITS EXCLUSIONS BASED ON PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. FEDERAL REGULATIONS

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO HIPAA INCLUDE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND CODE SETS, AND FOR THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF PROTECTED HEALTH

INFORMATION. THE HIPAA PRIVACY REGULATIONS DO NOT PREEMPT MORE STRINGENT STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY ALSO APPLY TO US.

FEDERAL PRIVACY AND

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE FREQUENTLY AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS AND JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. THE U.S. CONGRESS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY LEGISLATION. SOME OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES INCLUDE: NEW

CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HIPAA BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENTS; NEW AGREEMENTS FOR COVERED ENTITIES LOGGING DISCLOSURES FOR TREATMENT, PAYMENT AND HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS; HIPAA BUSINESS ASSOCIATES BEING SUBJECT TO MOST PARTS OF THE HIPAA

SECURITY RULE; AND CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON RECEIVING DIRECT OR INDIRECT REMUNERATION FOR THE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION. FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS MAY ALSO APPLY IN SOME INSTANCES TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES RELATED TO PERSONAL

IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES IS ALSO REGULATED IN SOME INSTANCES BY OTHER FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) OR STATE STATUTES IMPLEMENTING GLBA,

WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE INSURERS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH NOTICE REGARDING HOW THEIR NON-PUBLIC PERSONAL HEALTH AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS USED AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF CERTAIN DISCLOSURES BEFORE THE INSURER SHARES SUCH

INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY, AND WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE SAFEGUARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH HIPAA, GLBA AND OTHER

PRIVACY-RELATED REGULATIONS.

ERISA.

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), REGULATES HOW GOODS AND

SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A SET OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC INTERPRETATION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL COURTS. ERISA PLACES

CONTROLS ON HOW OUR BUSINESS UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MAINTAIN SELF-FUNDED PLANS. REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RULES FOR

CLAIMS PAYMENT AND MEMBER APPEALS UNDER HEALTH CARE PLANS GOVERNED BY ERISA. RECENT FINAL AND PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO EMPLOYERS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF INDIRECT COMPENSATION WE RECEIVE. ADDITIONALLY, SOME STATES

REQUIRE LICENSURE OR REGISTRATION OF COMPANIES PROVIDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FOR HEALTH CARE PLANS.

FDIC.

THE FEDERAL

DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) HAS FEDERAL REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER OPTUMHEALTH BANK AND PERFORMS ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REQUIREMENTS. IN

ADDITION TO SUCH ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS, THE FDIC PERFORMS PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE BANKS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND AGENCY GUIDELINES. IN THE EVENT OF UNFAVORABLE EXAMINATION RESULTS, THE BANK COULD

BE SUBJECTED TO INCREASED OPERATIONAL EXPENSES, GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT AND MONETARY PENALTIES.

STATE LAWS AND REGULATION

HEALTH CARE REGULATION.

OUR INSURANCE AND HMO SUBSIDIARIES MUST BE LICENSED BY THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS. ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH

OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER INSURANCE AND HMO PRODUCTS REGULATE THOSE PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THESE STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ESTABLISH MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. WITH THE AMENDMENT OF THE ANNUAL

FINANCIAL REPORTING MODEL REGULATION BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS TO INCORPORATE ELEMENTS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, WE EXPECT THAT THESE STATES WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE REGULATIONS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND

INTERNAL CONTROL ACTIVITIES OF HMOS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES.

HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ALSO REGULATED UNDER STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY

REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRE REGISTRATION WITH APPLICABLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL

BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE REGULATED COMPANIES AND THEIR PARENT

HOLDING COMPANIES OR AFFILIATES. THESE LAWS MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR BUSINESS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO OTHER HEALTH CARE-RELATED REGULATIONS AND

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PPO, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION (MCO), UTILIZATION REVIEW (UR) OR THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR-RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER FROM STATE TO STATE, BUT MAY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING,

PRODUCT AND RATE, AND FINANCIAL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES, PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, ADEQUACY OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS, FRAUD PREVENTION, PROTECTION OF

CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION, PRICING AND UNDERWRITING PRACTICES, AND COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES. STATE HEALTH CARE ANTI-FRAUD AND ABUSE PROHIBITIONS ENCOMPASS A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING KICKBACKS FOR REFERRAL OF MEMBERS, BILLING

UNNECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES, AND IMPROPER MARKETING. OUR AMERICHOICE AND OVATIONS MEDICAID BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE THE PROVISION OF BENEFITS BY AMERICHOICE TO ITS MEDICAID AND SCHIP BENEFICIARIES

AND BY OVATIONS TO ITS MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES. WE ALSO CONTRACT WITH STATE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE AWARD, ADMINISTRATION AND PERFORMANCE OF STATE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

PHARMACY REGULATION.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MUST BE LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS AS A PHARMACY IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE

LOCATED. OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MUST ALSO REGISTER WITH THE U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION AND INDIVIDUAL STATE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AUTHORITIES IN ORDER TO DISPENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. MANY OF THE STATES WHERE OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES

DELIVER PHARMACEUTICALS HAVE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE OUT-OF-STATE MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES TO REGISTER WITH THAT STATES BOARD OF PHARMACY OR SIMILAR REGULATORY BODY. THESE STATES GENERALLY PERMIT THE PHARMACY TO FOLLOW THE LAWS OF THE

STATE IN WHICH THE MAIL ORDER PHARMACY IS LOCATED, ALTHOUGH SOME STATES REQUIRE THAT WE ALSO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN LAWS IN THAT STATE. OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MAINTAIN CERTAIN MEDICARE AND STATE MEDICAID PROVIDER NUMBERS AS PHARMACIES PROVIDING

SERVICES UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE THE PHARMACIES TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROVIDER RULES AND REGULATIONS. OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES INCLUDE FEDERAL

AND STATE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS GOVERN THE LABELING, PACKAGING, ADVERTISING AND ADULTERATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND DISPENSING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO OUR

PBM BUSINESSES.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS.

STATES HAVE ADOPTED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE GLBA. LIKE HIPAA, GLBA ALLOWS

STATES TO ADOPT MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING PRIVACY PROTECTION. A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE ALSO ADOPTED OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES, FOR EXAMPLE, STATE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE USE, DISCLOSURE,

AND PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS FROM IDENTITY THEFT, WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STATES ENACTING LAWS REQUIRING BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY

INDIVIDUALS OF SECURITY BREACHES INVOLVING PERSONAL INFORMATION. STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS MAY ALSO APPLY TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES RELATED TO PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO STATE PRIVACY AND

INSURANCE REGULATION AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES IN THE DIFFERENT STATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO STANDARDIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS STATE LINES. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS

RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH STATE PRIVACY-RELATED REGULATIONS.

UDFI.

IN ADDITION, THE UTAH STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (UDFI)

HAS STATE REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER OPTUMHEALTH BANK AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS PERFORMS ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION

TO SUCH ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS, THE UDFI IN CONJUNCTION WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS PERFORMS PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE BANKS COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND AGENCY GUIDELINES. IN THE EVENT OF UNFAVORABLE

EXAMINATION RESULTS, THE BANK COULD BE SUBJECTED TO INCREASED OPERATIONAL EXPENSES, GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT AND MONETARY PENALTIES.

COMMITMENTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PACIFICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC. (PACIFICARE) AND SIERRA HEALTH SERVICES, INC. (SIERRA) ACQUISITIONS, WHICH CLOSED IN DECEMBER 2005 AND FEBRUARY 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AS TYPICALLY OCCURS IN CONNECTION WITH COMPARABLE

SIZED TRANSACTIONS, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO VARIOUS COMMITMENTS WITH STATE REGULATORY DEPARTMENTS, PRINCIPALLY IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA. WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE HAVE BEEN AND ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS,

STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. SUCH GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. SEE NOTE 15 OF

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF ANY ADVERSE INVESTIGATION, AUDIT RESULTS OR SANCTIONS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RETAIN OUR CURRENT BUSINESS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

SOME OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, INCLUDING INGENIXS I3 BUSINESS, HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS,

INCLUDING VARIOUS TAX, TARIFF AND TRADE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY, AND INVESTMENT RULES AND LAWS.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES COMPANY, WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR COMPETITORS

INCLUDE MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATORS AND BUSINESS SERVICES OUTSOURCING COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE FORMED NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS OR WITH CMS, SPECIALTY

BENEFIT PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, DISEASE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AND VARIOUS HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONSULTING COMPANIES. FOR OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC.,

HEALTH NET, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE, WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC

AREAS. FOR OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., CVS/CAREMARK CORPORATION, AND EXPRESS SCRIPTS, INC. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND INGENIX REPORTING SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BUSINESSES.

NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THESE MARKETS, ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES RELATE TO THE SALES,

MARKETING AND PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CONSUMER SATISFACTION; THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; CARE DELIVERY; NETWORK CAPABILITIES; MARKET SHARE; PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY OF

ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS; FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION. IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS, FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION.

EMPLOYEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 75,000 INDIVIDUALS. WE BELIEVE OUR EMPLOYEE

RELATIONS ARE GENERALLY POSITIVE.

RISK-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.

WE GENERALLY USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO 85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND

EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HEALTH CARE COSTS.

WE MANAGE HEALTH CARE COSTS THROUGH UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, PRODUCT DESIGN, NEGOTIATION OF FAVORABLE PROVIDER

CONTRACTS AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. TOTAL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM REVENUE ON COMMERCIAL POLICIES IS TYPICALLY FIXED FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS

GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. OUR REVENUE ON MEDICARE POLICIES IS BASED ON BIDS SUBMITTED IN JUNE THE YEAR BEFORE THE CONTRACT YEAR. WE BASE THE PREMIUMS WE CHARGE AND OUR MEDICARE BIDS ON OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE

HEALTH CARE COSTS OVER THE FIXED CONTRACT PERIOD; HOWEVER, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, REGULATION AND OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS OR BIDS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED USE OF

SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES, CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES, INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. AS A MEASURE OF THE IMPACT OF MEDICAL COST ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS OR UTILIZATION RATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED BY 1% WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL CHANGE IN RELATED REVENUES FOR COMMERCIAL INSURED PRODUCTS, OUR ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2008 WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR WHICH CLAIMS ARE STILL

OUTSTANDING. THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE AN EXTENSIVE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO LOW, THEY WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, OR FAIL TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND FREQUENT CHANGES IN FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES

GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. THE BROAD LATITUDE THAT IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS FUTURE LAWS AND RULES, COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO

BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER

ACTIONS. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES.

WE MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION OF

CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. DELAYS IN OBTAINING APPROVALS OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BY CONGRESS AND STATE LEGISLATURES AND ARE CURRENTLY PENDING AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE POLICY CHANGES THAT

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF OUR INDUSTRY, SUCH AS HAVING THE FEDERAL OR ONE OR MORE STATE GOVERNMENTS ASSUME A LARGER ROLE IN THE HEALTH CARE

INDUSTRY OR A FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID PROGRAMS. THESE PROPOSALS MAY ALSO AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND/OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; PHYSICIAN

REIMBURSEMENT METHODS AND PAYMENT RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; MANDATED BENEFITS; MINIMUM MEDICAL EXPENDITURES; CLAIM PAYMENTS AND PROCESSING; DRUG UTILIZATION AND PATIENT SAFETY EFFORTS; COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, MAINTENANCE AND DISPOSAL OF

INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION; PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS; CONSUMER-DRIVEN HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS; AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND VARIOUS CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HAVE SIGNALED THEIR INTEREST IN REDUCING PAYMENTS TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT AND PHASING OF THESE POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS, THE NUMBER OF SENIORS PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND THE INDUSTRY-WIDE EARNINGS DERIVED FROM THESE PLANS MAY FALL. IN ADDITION, MASSACHUSETTS HAS ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE

REFORM, INCLUDING AN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH COVERAGE MANDATE COUPLED WITH AN EMPLOYER MANDATE AND A NEW STATE CONNECTOR AUTHORITY. A NUMBER OF OTHER STATE LEGISLATURES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, NEW YORK, OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA, HAVE

CONTEMPLATED BUT HAVE NOT ENACTED SIGNIFICANT REFORM OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. OTHER STATES ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIDER THESE TYPES OF REFORMS AS WELL AS MORE MODEST REFORMS AIMED AT EXPANDING MEDICAID AND/OR SCHIP ELIGIBILITY AS WELL AS

NEW COVERAGE OPTIONS FOR THOSE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE PROVISIONS AFFECTING BOTH PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND PRIVATELY FINANCED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. STATES ALSO ARE

CONSIDERING PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REFORM THE UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING PRACTICES OF INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS BY, FOR EXAMPLE, PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON RATING AND PRICING AND MANDATING MINIMUM MEDICAL

BENEFIT COST RATIOS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED VARIOUS FORMS OF MANAGED CARE REFORM LEGISLATION WHICH IF ADOPTED, COULD FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF COVERAGE DECISIONS UNDER ERISA. ADDITIONALLY,

THERE IS LEGISLATIVE INTEREST IN MODIFYING ERISAS PREEMPTIVE EFFECT ON STATE LAWS. IF ADOPTED, SUCH LIMITATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR LIABILITY EXPOSURE AND COULD PERMIT GREATER STATE REGULATION OF OUR OPERATIONS.

WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME LAW, OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS OR THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO SUCH LAWS WILL BE,

BUT THEIR ENACTMENT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO EXPANDED LIABILITY AND REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

SUCH CHANGES EVEN IF WE CORRECTLY PREDICT THEIR OCCURRENCE.

IN ADDITION, THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY MAY

RESULT IN INCREASED REGULATION AND LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES, WHICH MAY FURTHER INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY BY: ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;

REQUIRING US TO CHANGE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; OR INCREASING THE REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE.

IN AUGUST 2007, WE ENTERED INTO A

MULTI-STATE NATIONAL AGREEMENT WITH REGULATORY OFFICES IN 39 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RELATING TO THE LEGACY UNITEDHEALTHCARE FULLY INSURED COMMERCIAL BUSINESS. THE AGREEMENT COVERS SEVERAL KEY AREAS OF REVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING CLAIMS PAYMENT ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES RESOLUTION TIMELINESS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL NETWORK/SERVICE, UTILIZATION REVIEW, EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS ACCURACY, AND OVERSIGHT AND DUE DILIGENCE OF CONTRACTED ENTITIES

AND VENDOR PERFORMANCE. THE AGREEMENT ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED PAST REGULATORY MATTERS RELATED TO THE AREAS OF REVIEW PRIOR TO AUGUST 2007 AND ESTABLISHES A TRANSPARENT FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING AND REGULATING PERFORMANCE THROUGH DECEMBER 2010. ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS, THE AGREEMENT IS SIMILAR TO A CUSTOMER PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE, WHEREBY WE WILL SELF REPORT QUARTERLY AND ANNUALLY OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ON A SET OF NATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AGREED TO BY THE PARTICIPATING STATES. WE MUST

PERFORM TO THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, OR BE SUBJECT TO FINES AND PENALTIES.

WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS,

AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE IRS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2007, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE EXAMINED THE COMPANYS PACIFICARE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN

IN CALIFORNIA. THE EXAMINATION FINDINGS RELATED TO CLAIMS PROCESSING ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INTEREST PAYMENTS, TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF PROVIDER CONTRACTS, TIMELY, ACCURATE PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND OTHER RELATED

MATTERS. TO DATE, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS NOT LEVIED A FINANCIAL PENALTY RELATED TO ITS FINDINGS. THE COMPANY IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES ARISING FROM THE FINDINGS OF ITS EXAMINATION.

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF OUR ADMINISTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WITH RESPECT TO ERISA COMPLIANCE. REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS SORT CAN LEAD TO GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, WHICH CAN RESULT

IN THE ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, AND COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN ADDITION, PUBLIC PERCEPTION OR PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ROUTINE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

ADVERSE

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND EXTREME DISRUPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS WIDELY REPORTED, WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING EXTREME DISRUPTION, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF SECURITIES AND SEVERELY DIMINISHED

LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT. THESE EXTREME EVENTS, ALONG WITH A RECESSION, INFLATION OR OTHER UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT LAYOFFS AND DOWNSIZINGS COULD LEAD TO LOWER ENROLLMENT IN OUR EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS, LOWER ENROLLMENT IN

OUR NON-EMPLOYER INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND A HIGHER NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OPTING OUT OF OUR EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS. THE ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO CAUSE EMPLOYERS TO STOP OFFERING CERTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OR ELECT TO

OFFER THIS COVERAGE ON A VOLUNTARY, EMPLOYEE-FUNDED BASIS AS A MEANS TO REDUCE THEIR OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EMPLOYER GROUP RENEWAL PROSPECTS AND OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PREMIUMS AND COULD

RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY OUR CUSTOMERS. ALL OF THESE COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN OUR MEMBERSHIP LEVELS AND PREMIUM AND FEE REVENUES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, A PROLONGED ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF HOSPITALS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS AND THEREFORE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONTRACTED RATES WITH THESE PARTIES AND INCREASE OUR MEDICAL COSTS.

DURING A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, RESULTING IN REDUCED REIMBURSEMENTS OR PAYMENTS IN OUR FEDERAL AND STATE

GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND SCHIP. A REDUCTION IN STATE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PAYMENTS ALREADY NEGOTIATED AND/OR RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, THE STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETARY PRESSURES COULD CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE NEW OR A HIGHER LEVEL OF TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES ON

HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND SURCHARGES ON SELECT FEE-FOR-SERVICE AND CAPITATED MEDICAL CLAIMS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS IS CAUSING CONTRACTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT IN THE MARKETPLACE. WHILE OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS HAVE BEEN A SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY FOR US AND WE CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER, ALTHOUGH AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES AS A RESULT OF THE DIMINISHED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF SHORT-TERM FINANCING. IF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS ARE UNAVAILABLE OR NOT COST EFFECTIVE, WE WOULD USE

CASH ON HAND AND/OR DRAW ON OUR CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES TO REFINANCE THE COMMERCIAL PAPER WHEN IT MATURES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, UNDER EXTREME MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH SOURCES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR

SUFFICIENT.

IN ADDITION, IF THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE, INCLUDING IF MORE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMPANIES FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

PROTECTION, OR ARE TAKEN OVER BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AND IF THE PRICES OF SECURITIES CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE AND EXPERIENCE EXTREME VOLATILITY, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE IMPACTED. SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD FURTHER EXPERIENCE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING US TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR

BUSINESSES PROVIDING PBM SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PBM INDUSTRY AND IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE PROVIDE PBM SERVICES THROUGH OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES. EACH BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL

AND STATE ANTI-KICKBACK AND OTHER LAWS THAT GOVERN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATURES REGULARLY CONSIDER NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OR REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR PBM BUSINESSES.

IN THE EVENT A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT ONE OF OUR PBM BUSINESSES ACTS AS A FIDUCIARY UNDER ERISA, WE COULD

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF FORMULARIES, PREFERRED DRUG LISTINGS AND DRUG MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, CONTRACTING NETWORK PRACTICES, SPECIALTY DRUG DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. OUR PBM

BUSINESSES ALSO CONDUCT BUSINESS AS MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES, WHICH SUBJECTS THEM TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE OUR PBM SUBSIDIARIES TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL

PENALTIES.

IN ADDITION, WE WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO CONTRACT ON FAVORABLE TERMS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND COULD FACE

POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED ERRORS BY OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. FURTHER, OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARDS, WHICH IS A MULTIFACETED SECURITY STANDARD THAT INCLUDES REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT, POLICIES, PROCEDURES, NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE DESIGN AND OTHER CRITICAL

PROTECTIVE MEASURES TO PROTECT CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DATA AS MANDATED BY THE CREDIT CARD BRANDS. THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO SUCH STANDARDS COULD EXPOSE OUR PBM SUBSIDIARIES TO LIABILITY OR IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN BUSINESSES PROVIDING

HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND FACE

COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES ON THE BASIS OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICE OF BENEFITS OFFERED AND COST AND RISK OF ALTERNATIVES, LOCATION AND CHOICE OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS,

QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, COMPREHENSIVENESS OF COVERAGE OFFERED, REPUTATION FOR QUALITY CARE, FINANCIAL STABILITY AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING SEGMENT, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA

CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HEALTH NET, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE, WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER

ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKET SEGMENTS SUCH AS MEDICARE SPECIALTY SERVICES. FOR OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, COMPETITORS INCLUDE MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., CVS/ CAREMARK CORPORATION AND EXPRESS SCRIPTS,

INC. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND INGENIX REPORTING SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BUSINESSES.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THAT BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN MANY MARKETS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL, SO THE ADDITION OF NEW COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR

RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CUSTOMERS ENJOY SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS. IN PARTICULAR MARKETS, COMPETITORS MAY HAVE CAPABILITIES OR RESOURCES THAT GIVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. GREATER MARKET SHARE, ESTABLISHED REPUTATION,

SUPERIOR SUPPLIER OR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER FACTORS ALL CAN PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR TO THEIR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BOTH AS TO OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING

HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND OTHER CARE PROFESSIONALS) IN THESE INDUSTRIES. CONSOLIDATION MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS, TO IMPROVE THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, OR TO MAINTAIN OR

ADVANCE PROFITABILITY. IF WE DO NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR MARKETS, IF WE SET RATES TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, IF WE DO NOT DESIGN AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS PROPERLY AND COMPETITIVELY, IF WE DO NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY

LEVEL OF SERVICES, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DOES NOT INCREASE AS WE EXPECT, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DECLINES, OR IF WE LOSE ACCOUNTS WITH MORE PROFITABLE PRODUCTS WHILE RETAINING OR INCREASING MEMBERSHIP IN

ACCOUNTS WITH LESS PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AS A PAYER IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT

HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAM FUNDING, ENROLLMENTS, PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS AND AUDITS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING AS A PAYER IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, VARIOUS

MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP, AND RECEIVE REVENUES FROM THESE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR

PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. SUCH CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, AND VARIOUS MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP OCCURS THROUGH BIDS THAT ARE SUBMITTED PERIODICALLY. REVENUES

FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PERIODIC FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING THROUGH VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS. FUNDING FOR THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS

OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AT THE FEDERAL OR APPLICABLE STATE LEVEL, AND GENERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AND PRIORITIES. A REDUCTION OR LESS THAN EXPECTED INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS OR CHANGE IN

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CMS USES VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE

PROGRAMS, INCLUDING DETERMINING PAYMENTS BY CONSIDERING THE RISK STATUS OF OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS AS SUPPORTED BY PROVIDER MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENTATION. FEDERAL REGULATORS AUDIT THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS AND CAN REVISE PAYMENTS BASED ON THE AUDIT

FINDINGS. CMS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 THAT IT WILL PERFORM AUDITS OF SELECTED MEDICARE HEALTH PLANS EACH YEAR TO VALIDATE THE CODING PRACTICES OF AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MAINTAINED BY CARE PROVIDERS. THESE AUDITS INVOLVE A REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS

MAINTAINED BY PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AND OUT OF NETWORK, AND MAY RESULT IN RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO HEALTH PLANS PURSUANT TO CMS MEDICARE CONTRACTS. CERTAIN OF OUR PLANS HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR AUDIT. THE

FIRST AUDITS FOCUSED ON MEDICAL RECORDS SUPPORTING RISK ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR 2006 THAT WERE USED TO DETERMINE 2007 PAYMENT AMOUNTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE AUDITS. HOWEVER, A MATERIAL ADJUSTMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ACQUIRE MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND SCHIP ENROLLEES IS IMPACTED BY BIDS AND PLAN DESIGNS SUBMITTED BY US AND OUR

COMPETITORS. UNDER THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM, STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES ARE PERIODICALLY REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO SEEK BIDS FROM ELIGIBLE HEALTH PLANS TO CONTINUE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACUTE CARE MEDICAID HEALTH PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE NOT

SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING RENEWALS OF STATE MEDICAID MANAGED

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARE CONTRACTS, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS THAT WERE ENROLLED IN THOSE MEDICAID PLANS. UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, TO QUALIFY FOR AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT

OF LOW INCOME MEMBERS, OUR BIDS MUST RESULT IN AN ENROLLEE PREMIUM BELOW A THRESHOLD, WHICH IS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER OUR BIDS ARE SUBMITTED. IF THE ENROLLEE PREMIUM IS NOT BELOW THE GOVERNMENT THRESHOLD, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS WHO WERE

AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LOST APPROXIMATELY 650,000 OF OUR AUTO-ENROLLED LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY MEMBERS IN 2008 BECAUSE OUR BIDS EXCEEDED THRESHOLDS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN

GENERAL, OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT, UTILIZATION, MEDICAL COSTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MATERIALLY INCORRECT OR OUR COMPETITORS BIDS AND POSITIONING ARE DIFFERENT THAN

ANTICIPATED, EITHER AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.

IF WE

FAIL TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY

DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THESE COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, WHETHER IN-NETWORK OR OUT-OF-NETWORK, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER

ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL

ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART. IN ADDITION, PHYSICIAN OR PRACTICE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WHICH AGGREGATE

PHYSICIAN PRACTICES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND MARKETING LEVERAGE, MAY COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH US. IF THESE PROVIDERS REFUSE TO CONTRACT WITH US, USE THEIR MARKET POSITION TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE CONTRACTS OR PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE

DISADVANTAGE, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET PRODUCTS OR TO BE PROFITABLE IN THOSE AREAS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS

WITH SOME PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDER THE TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER RECEIVES A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM TO COVER ALL OR A DEFINED PORTION OF THE MEDICAL COSTS PROVIDED TO THE CAPITATED MEMBER.

UNDER SOME CAPITATED ARRANGEMENTS, THE PROVIDER MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FROM RISK SHARING AND OTHER INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS. CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS, BUT EXPOSE US TO RISK

RELATED TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL CARE RESOURCES OF THE PROFESSIONAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT A CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION FACES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID HEALTH CARE CLAIMS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PAID THE PROVIDER UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT.

FURTHER, PAYMENT OR OTHER DISPUTES BETWEEN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND SPECIALISTS WITH WHOM THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A DISRUPTION IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS OR A REDUCTION IN THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR

MEMBERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH WHOM WE CONTRACT WILL PROPERLY MANAGE THE COSTS OF SERVICES, MAINTAIN FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OR AVOID DISPUTES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS AND OUR OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, SOME PROVIDERS THAT RENDER SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE CONTRACTS WITH

US. IN THOSE CASES, WE DO NOT HAVE A PRE-ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PROVIDER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT IS DUE TO THE PROVIDER FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO OUR MEMBERS. IN SOME STATES, THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION DUE TO THESE

OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS IS DEFINED BY LAW OR REGULATION, BUT IN MOST INSTANCES IT IS EITHER NOT DEFINED OR IT IS ESTABLISHED BY A STANDARD THAT IS NOT CLEARLY TRANSLATABLE INTO DOLLAR TERMS. IN SOME INSTANCES, PROVIDERS MAY BELIEVE THAT THEY

ARE UNDERPAID FOR THEIR SERVICES AND MAY EITHER LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTE WITH US OR TRY TO RECOVER FROM OUR MEMBERS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE PAID THEM AND THE AMOUNT THEY CHARGED US. FOR EXAMPLE,

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN LEGAL MATTERS IN NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE OUT-OF-NETWORK HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY BROKERS, CONSULTANTS

AND AGENTS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN PART THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS WHO ASSIST IN THE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING OF

BUSINESS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS, WHO GENERALLY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO US AND WHO FREQUENTLY ALSO RECOMMEND AND/OR MARKET HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF OUR

COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, WE MUST COMPETE INTENSELY FOR THEIR SERVICES AND ALLEGIANCE. OUR SALES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS OR IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE

SUPPORT, TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO THEM REGARDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS COMPLEX, OR IF OUR SALES STRATEGY IS NOT APPROPRIATELY ALIGNED ACROSS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS AND AGENTS SELLING HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND THE PAYMENTS THEY RECEIVE. THESE HAVE RESULTED IN ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS AGAINST COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AND BROKERS AND AGENTS MARKETING AND SELLING THESE COMPANIES PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, CMS AND STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS

AND AGENTS WHO MARKET MEDICARE PRODUCTS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES AND THE IMPOSITION OF CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND/OR CHANGES TO INDUSTRY PRACTICE WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH RESTRICTIONS ON PATIENT PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING

TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHO OBTAIN ACCESS TO SENSITIVE PATIENT INFORMATION MAINTAIN ITS CONFIDENTIALITY, OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE, USE, DISCLOSURE AND DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES ARE REGULATED AT THE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL AND STATE

LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS ADDRESS THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN

THOSE CONTAINED IN THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS IN THE FEDERAL GLBA AND IN HIPAA. HIPAA ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE IMPOSE PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS ON OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE HIPAA REGULATIONS). SEE

ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES.

EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND PRACTICES. PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

INFORMATION ARE ALSO IMPOSED ON US THROUGH CONTROLS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE SECURITY MEASURES WE HAVE IN PLACE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND RULES, OUR FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS, AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDERS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES, ACTS OF VANDALISM OR THEFT, COMPUTER VIRUSES, MISPLACED OR LOST DATA, PROGRAMMING AND/OR HUMAN ERRORS OR OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. CONGRESS AND MANY STATES ARE CONSIDERING NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY

REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD APPLY TO OUR BUSINESS. COMPLIANCE WITH NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES, NEW LIMITATIONS OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR BUSINESS MODELS, THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, AND THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. THEY ALSO MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND USE OF PATIENT IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT ARE HOUSED IN ONE

OR MORE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PRIVACY LAWS OR ANY SECURITY BREACH INVOLVING THE MISAPPROPRIATION, LOSS OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL MEMBER INFORMATION, WHETHER BY US OR BY ONE OF OUR

VENDORS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING: MATERIAL FINES AND PENALTIES; COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, AND STATUTORY DAMAGES; CONSENT ORDERS REGARDING OUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY

PRACTICES; ADVERSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR LICENSES TO DO BUSINESS; AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP IS IMPORTANT AND THE LOSS OF SUCH RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP, WE PROVIDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE, HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE AND

OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS AND MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS TO AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS. ONE OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP EXPANDS THE RELATIONSHIP TO INCLUDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS FOR AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS.

OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP CONTAIN COMMITMENTS REGARDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, DIVERSITY AND MEASURES INTENDED TO IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE FOR CONSUMERS. THE AARP AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED

EARLY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, DEPENDING ON THE AGREEMENT, A MATERIAL BREACH BY EITHER PARTY, INSOLVENCY OF EITHER PARTY, A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAMS,

MATERIAL HARM TO AARP CAUSED BY THE COMPANY, AND BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

COMPETITIVELY, MEET OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND DIVERSITY COMMITMENTS, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY CHANGES. THE LOSS OF OUR AARP RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LITIGATION ACTIONS, WHICH, IF RESOLVED

UNFAVORABLY, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES AND/OR MONETARY DAMAGES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

PERIODICALLY, WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF LEGAL ACTIONS THAT CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER SUITS,

AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHERS, CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE AND PAYMENT (INCLUDING DISPUTES WITH ENROLLEES, CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTED AND NON-CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS), MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT

DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO PARTY TO CERTAIN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS.

WE ARE LARGELY SELF-INSURED WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION RISKS. ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN EXCESS LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH OUTSIDE INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH

AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES MAY EXCEED THE

LIABILITIES RECORDED.

A DESCRIPTION OF MATERIAL LEGAL ACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE ACTIONS WITH CERTAINTY, AND WE ARE INCURRING EXPENSES IN RESOLVING THESE MATTERS. THEREFORE, THESE LEGAL ACTIONS COULD FURTHER INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

MATTERS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, INCLUDING

REGULATORY INQUIRIES, LITIGATION MATTERS, AND POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL CASH AND NONCASH CHARGES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

IN

EARLY 2006, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INITIATED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES FROM 1994 TO 2005. THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED BY AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF THREE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY (INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE) WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING ADVISORS. ON OCTOBER 15, 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE HAD

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPLETED THEIR REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND REPORTED THE FINDINGS TO THE NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. AS A

RESULT OF OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, WE RESTATED OUR PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE INCURRED CERTAIN CASH AND NON-CASH CHARGES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND LITIGATION MATTERS, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

FURTHER REGULATORY INQUIRIES, LITIGATION MATTERS, AND CASH AND NONCASH CHARGES, THE OUTCOME OF ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A MORE DETAILED

DESCRIPTION OF THESE REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND LITIGATION MATTERS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER LOSSES WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME OR EQUITY MARKETS COULD IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. VOLATILITY IN INTEREST

RATES AFFECTS OUR INTEREST INCOME, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF, OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIXED INCOME DEBT SECURITIES OF VARYING MATURITIES, WHICH COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS BY

ISSUERS, PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHO FAIL TO PAY OR PERFORM ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS, COULD REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES AS WE MAY

BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

WE ALSO INVEST A

SMALL PROPORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS WILL PRODUCE TOTAL POSITIVE

RETURNS OR THAT WE WILL NOT SELL INVESTMENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT ASSETS, AS A RESULT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ILLIQUIDITY OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE A

NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN ADDITION, IF IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF THE VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MATERIALLY IMPAIRED, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND DEBT RATINGS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

DUE LARGELY TO OUR PAST ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR ASSETS. GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY $22.4 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. IF WE MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS, IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON OUR BOOKS. WE

PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY NO LONGER BE RECOVERABLE, IN WHICH CASE A CHARGE TO EARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY. ANY FUTURE EVALUATIONS REQUIRING AN

ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY COULD, IN

TURN, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DEBT RATINGS OR POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS.

LARGE-SCALE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES MAY RESULT

IN SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE COSTS AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LARGE-SCALE

MEDICAL EMERGENCIES CAN TAKE MANY FORMS AND CAN CAUSE WIDESPREAD ILLNESS AND DEATH. SUCH EMERGENCIES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL

DISASTER, BIOTERRORISM ATTACK, PANDEMIC OR OTHER EXTREME EVENTS, WE COULD FACE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE COSTS AND INCREASED USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ANY SUCH DISASTER OR SIMILAR EVENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OR AVAILABILITY OF OUR DATA OR TO STRATEGICALLY IMPLEMENT NEW OR UPGRADE

OR CONSOLIDATE EXISTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES,

CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO CONSOLIDATE AND INTEGRATE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN, PROTECT AND ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING SYSTEMS AND

REGULATORY STANDARDS, AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PATTERNS. IF THE INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WERE FOUND TO BE INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE

EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, HAVE REGULATORY

PROBLEMS, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATING THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE, UPGRADING AND EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES,

PROTECTING AND ENHANCING OUR SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPING NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS ISSUES WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE AND

INTEGRATE OUR SYSTEMS SUCCESSFULLY COULD RESULT IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED COSTS AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS TIME AND ENERGY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES

COULD BE HINDERED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES,

AND OUR TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION AND

MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUNDS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IS RESTRICTED AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

BECAUSE WE OPERATE AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON DIVIDENDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM SOME OF

OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS. THESE SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY ARE REGULATED BY STATES DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY LAW TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIC PRESCRIBED MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE LEVELS

OF CAPITALIZATION REQUIRED DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON THE VOLUME OF PREMIUM REVENUES GENERATED. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PREMIUM VOLUME WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITALIZATION FROM US. IN MOST STATES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK PRIOR APPROVAL BY THESE STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES BEFORE WE TRANSFER MONEY OR PAY DIVIDENDS FROM THESE SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. IN ADDITION, WE NORMALLY NOTIFY THE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE PRIOR TO MAKING PAYMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE APPROVAL. AN

INABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES COULD IMPACT THE SCALE TO WHICH WE COULD REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

AND OUR ABILITY TO REPAY OUR DEBT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY FAILURE BY US TO MANAGE AND COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS SUCCESSFULLY COULD HARM OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS, BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES REGARDING POSSIBLE

INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES, AND OUTSOURCING TRANSACTIONS AND OFTEN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS RELATING TO SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSACTIONS THAT FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY INTERNALLY, WE MAY BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE MARKET PERCEPTIONS, ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

DOWNGRADES IN OUR DEBT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AND DEBT RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATING ORGANIZATIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. RATINGS INFORMATION IS BROADLY DISSEMINATED AND GENERALLY USED THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE OUR CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS TO CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR DEBT RATINGS IMPACT BOTH THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS. EACH OF THE RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATINGS PERIODICALLY AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT RATINGS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. OUR RATINGS REFLECT EACH RATING AGENCYS OPINION OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND ABILITY TO MEET OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS.

DOWNGRADES IN OUR RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PROPERTIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE OWNED AND/OR LEASED

REAL PROPERTIES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 15.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES (NET OF APPROXIMATELY 0.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE SUBLEASED TO THIRD PARTIES). OF THIS

TOTAL, WE OWNED APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION AGGREGATE SQUARE FEET OF SPACE AND LEASED THE REMAINDER. OUR LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2028. OUR FACILITIES ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR VARIOUS

REPORTING SEGMENTS USE THESE FACILITIES FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESS PURPOSES, AND WE BELIEVE THESE CURRENT FACILITIES ARE SUITABLE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE USES AND ARE ADEQUATE FOR OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE NEEDS.

DURING 2008, WE COMPLETED A SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTION FOR SIX PROPERTIES RESULTING IN GROSS PROCEEDS OF $185 MILLION, AND PRE-TAX GAINS OF $72 MILLION THAT HAVE BEEN

DEFERRED AND WILL BE AMORTIZED STRAIGHT-LINE AGAINST RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE UNDERLYING LEASES OF 12.5 YEARS.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP IS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING COMPANY, SERVING MORE THAN 70 MILLION AMERICANS. OUR FOCUS IS ON ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

HEALTH SYSTEM AND IMPROVING THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE WORK WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER KEY PARTNERS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE. WE HELP PEOPLE GET THE CARE THEY

NEED AT AN AFFORDABLE COST, SUPPORT THE PHYSICIAN/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP, AND EMPOWER PEOPLE WITH THE INFORMATION, GUIDANCE AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO MAKE PERSONAL HEALTH CHOICES AND DECISIONS.

THROUGH OUR DIVERSIFIED FAMILY OF BUSINESSES, WE LEVERAGE CORE COMPETENCIES IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY-BASED TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES; HEALTH CARE DATA, KNOWLEDGE AND

INFORMATION; AND HEALTH CARE RESOURCE ORGANIZATION AND CARE FACILITATION TO MAKE HEALTH CARE WORK BETTER. WE PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS TO QUALITY, COST-EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND RESOURCES. WE PROVIDE EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMERS WITH

EXCELLENT VALUE, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AND WE DELIVER VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY EXECUTING A BUSINESS STRATEGY FOUNDED UPON A COMMITMENT TO BALANCED GROWTH, PROFITABILITY AND CAPITAL DISCIPLINE.

BUSINESS TRENDS

OUR BUSINESSES PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S. HEALTH

ECONOMY, WHICH COMPRISES APPROXIMATELY 16% OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND WHICH HAS GROWN CONSISTENTLY FOR MANY YEARS. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS OVERALL SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE IN THE U.S. TO CONTINUE TO RISE IN THE FUTURE, BASED ON INFLATION, DEMOGRAPHIC

TRENDS IN THE U.S. POPULATION AND NATIONAL INTEREST IN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE RATE OF GROWTH MAY BE IMPACTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PROPOSED HEALTH CARE REFORMS, WHICH COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

THE CURRENT

U.S. RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAS IMPACTED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, DECREASES IN EMPLOYMENT HAVE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF WORKERS AND DEPENDANTS OFFERED HEALTH CARE BENEFITS BY OUR EMPLOYER CUSTOMERS AND

WILL PRESSURE TOP LINE GROWTH FOR OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESS. IN CONTRAST, OUR AMERICHOICE BUSINESS HAS SEEN INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN ITS STATE MEDICAID OFFERINGS AS EMPLOYMENT RATES FALL. IF THE RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES FOR

A PROLONGED PERIOD, FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS MAY DECREASE FUNDING FOR VARIOUS HEALTH CARE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE AND/OR IMPOSE NEW OR HIGHER LEVELS OF TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS. IN TOTAL, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ECONOMIC

RECESSIONS WILL SLOW OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE AND COULD IMPACT OUR OPERATING PROFITABILITY. MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT GOVERNMENT FUNDING PRESSURE, COUPLED WITH RECESSIONARY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WILL IMPACT THE FINANCIAL POSITIONS OF HOSPITALS,

PHYSICIANS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS AND COULD THEREFORE INCREASE MEDICAL COST TRENDS EXPERIENCED BY OUR BUSINESSES. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING HOW A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1A, RISK

FACTORS.

PROPOSED FEDERAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE

IN THE SHORT TERM, OUR BUSINESSES MAY BENEFIT IF PROPOSED ELEMENTS OF THE FEDERAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE RESPONDING TO THE CURRENT RECESSION ARE SIGNED INTO LAW. THESE INCLUDE EXPANSION OF FUNDING TO STATE PROGRAMS,

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH COULD MITIGATE FUNDING PRESSURE FOR AMERICHOICE MEDICAID OFFERINGS AT THE STATE LEVEL, EXPANSION OF COVERAGE FOR RECENTLY UNEMPLOYED WORKERS THROUGH

THEIR FORMER EMPLOYERS PLANS, WHICH COULD ENHANCE PARTICIPATION IN UNITEDHEALTHCARE BENEFIT PROGRAMS, AND FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD EXPAND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR INGENIX.

PROPOSED HEALTH CARE REFORMS

THERE IS REGULAR DIALOGUE ABOUT HEALTH

CARE REFORMS AT BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS, DUE TO THE SIZE OF AND NATIONAL INTEREST IN THE HEALTH ECONOMY. EXAMPLES OF THESE HEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSALS INCLUDE POLICY CHANGES THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY, SUCH AS

HAVING THE FEDERAL OR ONE OR MORE STATE GOVERNMENTS ASSUME A LARGER ROLE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OR A FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID PROGRAMS.

THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND VARIOUS CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HAVE SIGNALED THEIR INTEREST IN REDUCING PAYMENTS TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT AND PHASING OF THESE POTENTIAL

REDUCTIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NUMBER OF SENIORS PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND THE INDUSTRY-WIDE EARNINGS DERIVED FROM THESE PLANS MAY FALL. HOWEVER, IF PAYMENT RATES DO COME DOWN, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

ADJUSTMENTS WE CAN MAKE TO OUR OPERATIONS ANNUALLY, WHICH MAY PARTIALLY OFFSET ANY EARNINGS IMPACT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN ADJUST MEMBERS BENEFITS, WE CAN DECIDE ON A COUNTY-BY-COUNTY BASIS WHICH GEOGRAPHIES TO PARTICIPATE IN, AND WE CAN SEEK TO

INTENSIFY OUR MEDICAL AND OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT. ANY PAYMENT REDUCTIONS MAY BE PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. IF INDUSTRY-WIDE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MEMBERSHIP REDUCES, THERE IS LIKELY TO BE INCREASED DEMAND FOR MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE

AND PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, AND IN BOTH CATEGORIES OVATIONS IS ALSO A MARKET LEADER.

WE OPERATE A DIVERSIFIED SET OF HEALTH CARE FOCUSED

BUSINESSES; THIS BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A MULTITUDE OF MARKET SECTORS. THEREFORE, WE COULD SEE SIMULTANEOUS INCREASES AND DECREASES IN DEMAND FOR VARIOUS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE, SHAPE

AND TIMING OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF REFORM DISCUSSIONS WITH PRECISION OVER THE MID- TO LONG-TERM TIME HORIZON. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING OUR RISKS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE REFORMS, SEE ITEM 1A,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS

REVENUES

REVENUES CONSIST OF PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS; SERVICE REVENUES, WHICH PRIMARILY INCLUDE FEES FOR MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATIVE AND

CONSULTING SERVICES; PRODUCT REVENUES; AND INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME.

PREMIUM REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS FIXED, TYPICALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND WE ASSUME THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING OUR CUSTOMERS HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. SERVICE REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FEES DERIVED

FROM SERVICES PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE MEDICAL COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDANTS. FOR BOTH PREMIUM RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, WE PROVIDE COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES;

TRANSACTION PROCESSING; HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. THROUGH OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS PBM BUSINESS, REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM BOTH PRODUCTS SOLD

AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. PRODUCT REVENUES ALSO INCLUDE SALES OF INGENIX PUBLISHING AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR 2008 INCREASED

FROM 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN PREMIUM REVENUE IN THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING SEGMENT. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR EACH OF OUR REVENUE COMPONENTS.

PREMIUM REVENUES.

THE PREMIUM REVENUE GROWTH GENERATED BY OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING SEGMENT WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER IN THE CONSOLIDATED PREMIUM

REVENUES INCREASE. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OUR PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS GROUP, PREMIUM RATE INCREASES FOR MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS

SERVED THROUGH BOTH UNITEDHEALTHCARE RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS.

SERVICE REVENUES.

THE INCREASE IN

SERVICE REVENUES FOR 2008 WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY FEE-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS IN THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING SEGMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FISERV HEALTH ACQUISITION. IN ADDITION, OUR INGENIX REPORTING

SEGMENT GENERATED SERVICE REVENUE GROWTH FROM ITS HEALTH INTELLIGENCE AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES AS WELL AS FROM BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.

PRODUCT REVENUES.

PRODUCT REVENUES FOR 2008 INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED PRESCRIPTION VOLUME AT OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS REPORTING SEGMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FISERV HEALTH ACQUISITION.

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME.

THE DECREASE IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME IN 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

INVESTMENT YIELDS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASED AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES RELATED TO LOWER OPERATING CASH FLOWS, DECREASED DEPOSITS HELD FOR CERTAIN GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS AND

INCREASED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE DISRUPTION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

MEDICAL COSTS

MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2008 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO MEDICAL COST INFLATION, ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008 AND GROWTH IN OVATIONS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT

PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH BOTH UNITEDHEALTHCARE RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS.

THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO, CALCULATED AS MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES, REFLECTS THE COMBINATION OF PRICING, BENEFIT DESIGNS, CONSUMER HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE FACILITATION

EFFORTS. OUR CONSOLIDATED MEDICAL CARE RATIO INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PREMIUM RATES ADVANCING MORE SLOWLY THAN MEDICAL COSTS IN 2008 FOR CERTAIN RISK-BASED PRODUCTS IN THE COMMERCIAL, SENIOR AND BEHAVIORAL CARE MARKETS.

FOR EACH PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF REVISIONS IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS. CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED

TO PRIOR PERIODS, RESULTING FROM MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS REPORTED FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2008 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $230 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE

MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2007 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $420 MILLION OF NET FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS.

OPERATING COSTS

THE OPERATING COST RATIO, CALCULATED AS

OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES, INCREASED IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN EXPENSES AS DISCUSSED BELOW, ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2008, COSTS FOR ANTICIPATED REVENUE GROWTH THAT DID NOT FULLY MATERIALIZE AND A CHANGE IN BUSINESS

MIX TOWARDS SERVICE REVENUES FROM FEE-BASED BUSINESSES.

OPERATING COSTS FOR 2008 INCLUDE $882 MILLION FOR THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS OF TWO CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS RELATED TO OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND RELATED LEGAL COSTS, NET OF EXPECTED INSURANCE PROCEEDS, AND $350 MILLION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION RELATED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUT-OF-NETWORK MEDICAL SERVICES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $185 MILLION REDUCTION IN EXPENSES FOR PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND MEMBERSHIP OF OUR INDIVIDUAL MEDICARE ADVANTAGE HMO PLANS IN CLARK AND NYE COUNTIES, NEVADA RELATING TO THE SIERRA ACQUISITION. THESE AMOUNTS

HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS, SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING COSTS FOR 2007 INCLUDE $176 MILLION OF EXPENSES RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 RELATED TO APPLICATION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES UNDER SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (SECTION 409A) TO OUR HISTORICAL

STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THE $176 MILLION SECTION 409A CHARGE INCLUDES $87 MILLION OF EXPENSES FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPTIONHOLDERS TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED IN 2006 AND EARLY 2007 AND $89 MILLION OF EXPENSES FOR THE

MODIFICATION RELATED TO INCREASING THE EXERCISE PRICE OF UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES AND THE RELATED CASH PAYMENTS. THESE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT. FOR AN EXPANDED DISCUSSION OF OUR

SECTION 409A CHARGES, SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED PRESCRIPTION VOLUME AT OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS REPORTING SEGMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FISERV HEALTH ACQUISITION.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER

LEVELS OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO RECENT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.

INTEREST EXPENSE

INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN OUR DEBT OUTSTANDING, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES ON OUR FLOATING-RATE DEBT.

INCOME TAXES

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EARNINGS RESULTING IN AN INCREASED PROPORTION OF TAX-FREE INVESTMENT

INCOME TO TOTAL EARNINGS.

HEALTH CARE SERVICES

THE REVENUE GROWTH IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OUR PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS GROUP, PREMIUM RATE INCREASES FOR MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND THE 2008 ACQUISITIONS OF

SIERRA, FISERV HEALTH, AND UNISON, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN ORGANIC DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED THROUGH COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND MEDICARE PART D PRODUCTS AND A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME. UNITEDHEALTHCARE REVENUES OF $41.8 BILLION IN

2008 INCREASED OVER THE COMPARABLE 2007 PERIOD BY $1.6 BILLION, OR 4%. THE UNITEDHEALTHCARE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE SAME FACTORS AS DISCUSSED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN 2008. OVATIONS REVENUES OF $28.1 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED OVER

THE COMPARABLE 2007 PERIOD BY $1.6 BILLION, OR 6%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH THE STANDARDIZED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS GAINED THROUGH BOTH ORGANIC GROWTH AND THE SIERRA

ACQUISITION AND PREMIUM RATE INCREASES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET ORGANIC DECREASE OF 675,000 STAND-ALONE MEDICARE PART D MEMBERS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REASSIGNMENT BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) OF CERTAIN

DUAL-ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME BENEFICIARIES BASED ON ANNUAL PRICE BIDS. AMERICHOICE GENERATED REVENUES OF $6.0 BILLION IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF $1.5 BILLION, OR 34%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2007 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICAID PLANS, PREMIUM RATE INCREASES AND THE ACQUISITION OF UNISON IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008.

THE DECREASE IN HEALTH CARE

SERVICES EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRESSURE ON ENROLLMENT AND GROSS MARGINS IN THE UNITEDHEALTHCARE RISK-BASED BUSINESS AND PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS IN MEDICARE PART D

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ACQUISITIONS. THE UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICAL CARE RATIO INCREASED TO 83.5% IN 2008 FROM 82.6% IN 2007. THIS

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE EFFECTS OF A COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT WHERE PRICE INCREASES, NET OF CUSTOMER BENEFIT PACKAGE CHANGES, DID NOT FULLY MATCH THE RISE IN MEDICAL COSTS, AND AN INCREASED MIX OF NATIONAL ACCOUNT PHARMACEUTICAL

BENEFIT BUSINESS, WHICH TYPICALLY CARRIES A HIGHER MEDICAL CARE RATIO. HEALTH CARE SERVICES OPERATING MARGIN WAS 6.7% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, A DECREASE FROM 9.3% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS INCREASED DUE TO ACQUISITIONS, WHICH INCLUDED THE

ADDITION OF 1,315,000 FEE-BASED MEMBERS FROM FISERV HEALTH AND THE ADDITION OF 310,000 RISK-BASED INDIVIDUALS GAINED THROUGH THE SIERRA ACQUISITION. THESE ADDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL

PRODUCTS OF 805,000, OR 3%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND THE IMPACT OF A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRICING ENVIRONMENT. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED

BY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 INCREASED THROUGH THE ADDITION OF 60,000 SENIORS FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SIERRA AND ORGANIC GROWTH OF 95,000 SENIORS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DIVESTITURE OF 30,000 INDIVIDUALS IN NEVADA

RELATED TO THE SIERRA ACQUISITION. MEDICAID ENROLLMENT GREW DUE TO THE ADDITION OF 320,000 AND 60,000 INDIVIDUALS FROM OUR UNISON AND SIERRA ACQUISITIONS, RESPECTIVELY, AND STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH OF 425,000 INDIVIDUALS.

OPTUMHEALTH

INCREASED REVENUES IN OPTUMHEALTH WERE DRIVEN BY

RATE INCREASES FOR MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND AN INCREASED NUMBER OF CONSUMERS SERVED BY THIS SEGMENT. OPTUMHEALTH PROVIDED SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY 60 MILLION CONSUMERS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION

INDIVIDUALS YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN DECREASED DUE TO THE INCREASED COSTS FOR RISK-BASED BEHAVIORAL AND SPECIALTY

BENEFITS BUSINESSES AND THE MIX OF CONTINUED GROWTH IN LOWER MARGIN BUSINESS.

INGENIX

THE IMPROVEMENT IN INGENIX REVENUES WAS DUE TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN ITS HEALTH INTELLIGENCE AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES AS WELL AS FROM BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS. THE

DECREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS STAFFING COSTS DURING 2008 FOR CERTAIN RESEARCH PROJECTS WHICH WERE CANCELLED, AS WELL AS LOWER DEMAND FOR CERTAIN CONSULTING SERVICES DUE TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS

THE

DECREASED PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED RELATED TO THE REASSIGNMENT OF DUAL-ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES DESCRIBED ABOVE THROUGH MEDICARE PART D

2007, RESPECTIVELY.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FISERV HEALTH ACQUISITION, GAINS IN MAIL SERVICE DRUG

PREMIUM REVENUES.

CONSOLIDATED PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO PREMIUM RATE INCREASES, PARTIALLY

PREMIUM REVENUES FOR UNITEDHEALTHCARE IN 2007 TOTALED

$36.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $623 MILLION, OR 2%, OVER 2006. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AVERAGE NET PREMIUM RATE INCREASES OF 7% TO 8% ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RENEWING COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND DUE TO PREMIUMS FROM BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 4% DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INTERNAL PRICING DECISIONS IN A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED

PRICING ENVIRONMENT AND THE CONVERSION OF CERTAIN GROUPS TO COMMERCIAL FEE-BASED PRODUCTS. OVATIONS PREMIUM REVENUES IN 2007 TOTALED $26.0 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.7 BILLION, OR 7%, OVER 2006. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN

INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY STANDARDIZED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND EVERCARE PRODUCTS, AND RATE INCREASES ON MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM. AMERICHOICE PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY $732 MILLION, OR

20%, OVER 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICAID PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES. THE REMAINING PREMIUM REVENUE INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM MEMBERSHIP GROWTH AND RATE INCREASES AT OPTUMHEALTH, WHICH

CONTRIBUTED A PREMIUM REVENUE INCREASE OF 11% OVER 2006.

SERVICE REVENUES.

THE 2007 INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED SERVICE REVENUES WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY A 38% INCREASE IN INGENIX SERVICE REVENUES DUE TO NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES AND FROM BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006. IN ADDITION, UNITEDHEALTHCARE SERVICE REVENUES

INCREASED DUE TO A 3% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED UNDER COMMERCIAL FEE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS DURING 2007, AS WELL AS ANNUAL RATE INCREASES.

PRODUCT REVENUES.

THE 2007 INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED PRODUCT REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY PHARMACY SALES GROWTH AT PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROVIDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT SERVICES TO AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION

OVATIONS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND PART D MEMBERS.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME.

INTEREST INCOME INCREASED BY $239 MILLION IN 2007, DRIVEN BY

INCREASED LEVELS OF CASH AND FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS, DUE IN PART TO DEPOSITS HELD FOR CERTAIN GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS DURING 2007 AND THE LACK OF SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST TWO AND ONE HALF MONTHS OF 2007. NET REALIZED GAINS ON

SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE $38 MILLION IN 2007 AND $4 MILLION IN 2006.

MEDICAL COSTS

THE CONSOLIDATED MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO RELATING TO OVATIONS WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE

COMMERCIAL MEDICAL CARE RATIO RESULTING FROM OUR

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNAL PRICING DECISIONS IN A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRICING ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS A SHIFT FROM FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT FOR

UNITEDHEALTHCARE DURING 2006 TO UNFAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT DURING 2007.

MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2007 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $420 MILLION OF FAVORABLE

MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2006 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION OF FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS.

MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2007 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ANNUAL MEDICAL COST TREND OF 7% TO 8% ON COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED BUSINESS DUE TO MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND INCREASED UTILIZATION, AS WELL AS GROWTH IN OVATIONS

MEDICARE PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS.

OPERATING COSTS

THE OPERATING COST RATIO FOR 2007 WAS CONSISTENT WITH 2006. THE OPERATING COST RATIO REFLECTED PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND OTHER COST

MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES, OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS MIX CHANGE AS FEE-BASED BUSINESSES SUCH AS INGENIX INCREASE IN SIZE AND IMPACT, AS WELL AS INCREASED INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY, SERVICE AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS; INCREMENTAL MARKETING AND

ADVERTISING COSTS FOR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS; AND EXPENSES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICATION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES UNDER SECTION 409A TO OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, AS DESCRIBED IN 2008

RESULTS COMPARED TO 2007 RESULTS ABOVE.

THE INCREASE IN OPERATING COSTS IN 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GENERAL OPERATING COST INFLATION AND WAS ALSO

IMPACTED BY THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD INCREASED IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PHARMACY SALES AT PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS AS A RESULT OF PROVIDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT SERVICES TO AN ADDITIONAL FOUR

MILLION OVATIONS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND PART D MEMBERS IN 2007.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN 2007 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY

ENHANCEMENTS, BUSINESS GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006, AS WELL AS SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006.

REPORTING SEGMENTS

HEALTH CARE SERVICES

UNITEDHEALTHCARE REVENUES OF $40.3 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED BY $821 MILLION, OR 2%, OVER 2006. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY AVERAGE NET PREMIUM RATE INCREASES OF

7% TO 8% ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RENEWING COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY COMMERCIAL FEE-BASED PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 4%

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INTERNAL PRICING DECISIONS IN A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRICING ENVIRONMENT AND THE CONVERSION OF CERTAIN GROUPS TO COMMERCIAL

FEE-BASED PRODUCTS. OVATIONS REVENUES OF $26.5 BILLION IN 2007 INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION, OR 7%, OVER 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY STANDARDIZED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND EVERCARE

PRODUCTS, AND RATE INCREASES ON MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM. THE REMAINING HEALTH CARE SERVICES REVENUE INCREASE

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN AMERICHOICE REVENUES OF $750 MILLION, OR 20%, OVER 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY

MEDICAID PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES.

THE INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2007 WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN

THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO FOR OVATIONS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST TRENDS AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY CERTAIN MEDICARE PRODUCTS AND RELATED RATE INCREASES DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN

INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND AN INCREASE IN THE RELATED MEDICAL CARE RATIO. THE UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICAL CARE RATIO INCREASED TO 82.6% IN 2007 FROM 80.5% IN 2006. THIS INCREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO OUR INTERNAL PRICING

DECISIONS IN A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRICING ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS A SHIFT FROM FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT FOR UNITEDHEALTHCARE DURING 2006 TO UNFAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT DURING 2007, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY COSTS

FROM HIGHER BENEFIT UTILIZATION IN DECEMBER 2006 PRIMARILY RELATING TO HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE RISK-BASED PRODUCTS. THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES OPERATING MARGIN FOR 2007 WAS 9.3%, AN INCREASE FROM 8.6% IN 2006, WHICH REFLECTED PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM

TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND DISCIPLINED OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED

WITH COMMERCIAL FEE-BASED PRODUCTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS DRIVEN BY NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CUSTOMERS CONVERTING FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS TO FEE-BASED PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EMPLOYMENT ATTRITION AT CONTINUING CUSTOMERS. THE

NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT AND THE CONVERSION OF INDIVIDUALS TO FEE-BASED PRODUCTS.

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN PARTICIPATION IN PRIVATE-FEE-FOR-SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHILE INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY

STANDARDIZED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS INCREASED DUE TO NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. MEDICAID ENROLLMENT INCREASED IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW CUSTOMER GAINS, INCLUDING 180,000 INDIVIDUALS SERVED UNDER THE TENNCARE PROGRAM IN TENNESSEE.

OPTUMHEALTH

THE OPTUMHEALTH REVENUES INCREASE

WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY SEVERAL OF ITS SPECIALTY BENEFIT BUSINESSES AND RATE INCREASES RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES.

OPTUMHEALTH EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MEMBERSHIP GROWTH AND RATE INCREASES. THE OPTUMHEALTH OPERATING MARGIN DECLINED FROM 18.6% IN 2006 TO 18.2% IN 2007 DUE TO A CONTINUED

BUSINESS MIX SHIFT TOWARD HIGHER REVENUE, LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EFFECTIVE OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT.

INGENIX

THE INGENIX REVENUES INCREASE IN 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES AS

WELL AS FROM BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006.

THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE HEALTH

INFORMATION AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES, BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006 AND EFFECTIVE OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT. THE OPERATING MARGIN WAS 20.4% IN 2007, UP FROM 18.4% IN 2006. THIS INCREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN WAS LARGELY

DRIVEN BY BUSINESS GROWTH AND OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS

THE PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS REVENUES INCREASE IN 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PROVIDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT SERVICES TO AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION OVATIONS MEDICARE

ADVANTAGE AND STAND-ALONE PART D MEMBERS.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERSEGMENT REVENUES WERE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION AND AMOUNTED TO $12.4 BILLION AND $3.4 BILLION FOR 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED LARGELY DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES TO MEDICARE PART D MEMBERS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE OPERATING MARGIN WAS

2.0% IN 2007, A DECREASE FROM 3.4% IN 2006. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN REFLECTED THE COMPARATIVELY LOWER MARGIN EARNED IN THE HIGH VOLUME OVATIONS MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG SERVICE CONTRACTS.

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

WE MANAGE OUR CASH, INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS OF OUR

BUSINESS WHILE MAINTAINING LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. WE FORECAST, ANALYZE AND MONITOR OUR CASH FLOWS TO ENABLE PRUDENT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND FINANCING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR FINANCIAL STRATEGY.

OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. A MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS HELD BY OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE IN THE FORM OF CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS. AFTER CONSIDERING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE GENERALLY INVEST CASH OF REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEEDS OUR EXPECTED SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS IN LONGER TERM, INVESTMENT-GRADE, MARKETABLE DEBT

SECURITIES TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT RETURN. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE PURSUANT TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED INVESTMENT POLICY, WHICH GENERALLY GOVERNS RETURN OBJECTIVES, REGULATORY LIMITATIONS, TAX IMPLICATIONS AND RISK

TOLERANCES, WHICH FOCUSES ON PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, DIVERSIFICATION AND DURATION. CASH IN EXCESS OF THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR REGULATED ENTITIES IS PAID TO THEIR NON-REGULATED PARENT COMPANIES, TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE USE, WHEN AND AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.

OUR NON-REGULATED BUSINESSES ALSO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE USE. CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THESE ENTITIES, COMBINED WITH DIVIDENDS FROM OUR REGULATED ENTITIES AND FINANCING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES,

FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESSES BY MAKING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXPANDING OUR SERVICES THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND REPURCHASING SHARES OF OUR COMMON

STOCK, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, ARE PRINCIPALLY FROM NET EARNINGS,

PRIOR TO DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NON-CASH EXPENSES. AS A RESULT, ANY FUTURE DECLINE IN OUR PROFITABILITY MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. THE LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED BUSINESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR

ABILITY TO ACCURATELY PREDICT AND PRICE FOR HEALTH CARE AND OPERATING COST INCREASES. THIS RISK IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY THE DIVERSITY OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, THE GEOGRAPHIC AND CUSTOMER DIVERSITY OF OUR RISK-BASED BUSINESS AND OUR DISCIPLINED

UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROCESSES, WHICH SEEK TO MATCH PREMIUM RATE INCREASES WITH FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS.

NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $1.6 BILLION IN 2008, OR 28%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN

NET EARNINGS OF $1.7 BILLION WHICH INCLUDED PAYMENTS OF $573 MILLION, NET OF TAXES, FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF TWO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATED TO OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. FOR DETAIL ON THESE SETTLEMENTS, SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENT AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT BALANCES OF $21.4 BILLION

INCLUDED $7.4 BILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, $13.5 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES AND $477 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO HELD IN CASH EQUIVALENTS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. THE USE OF DIFFERENT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS OR VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, PRIMARILY USED IN VALUING OUR LEVEL 3 EQUITY SECURITIES, MAY HAVE AN

EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS OF OUR INVESTMENTS. DUE TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, THE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE ACTUAL EXIT PRICE IF THE INVESTMENT WAS SOLD AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. OTHER SOURCES OF

LIQUIDITY, PRIMARILY FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, REDUCE THE NEED TO SELL INVESTMENTS IN ADVERSE MARKETS. SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS A RELATIVELY SHORT AVERAGE DURATION AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF AA AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. INCLUDED IN THE

DEBT SECURITIES BALANCE IS $3.3 BILLION OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE GUARANTEED BY THIRD PARTIES. THE SECURITIES ARE GUARANTEED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GUARANTORS, AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE

GUARANTOR (NEITHER INDIRECT THROUGH THE GUARANTEES, NOR DIRECT THROUGH INVESTMENT IN THE GUARANTOR). FURTHER, DUE TO THE HIGH UNDERLYING CREDIT RATING OF THE ISSUERS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THESE SECURITIES BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT THE

GUARANTEE IS AA AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 FOR THE SECURITIES FOR WHICH SUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

COMMERCIAL PAPER.

COMMERCIAL PAPER CONSISTED OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT SOLD ON A DISCOUNT BASIS WITH MATURITIES UP TO 270 DAYS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD $101 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER WITH INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 5.1% TO 7.1%.

THIS RANGE IN RATES REFLECTS INCREASES IN THE MARKET RATES FOR TIER-2 CREDIT-RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER.

SHARE REPURCHASES.

UNDER OUR BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, WE MAINTAIN A COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES. DURING 2008, WE REPURCHASED 72 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $37 PER SHARE AND

AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 103 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL RESOURCES

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HAD COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING OF $12.8 BILLION AND $11.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING IN THE FORM OF DEBT OR EQUITY IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR PROFITABILITY, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, DEBT LEVELS, CREDIT RATINGS, DEBT COVENANTS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS AND ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING FOR US OR LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL. WE HAVE THEREFORE ADOPTED

STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS TOWARD MAINTAINING FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH FACTORS ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL.

CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS.

WE MAINTAINED A HIGHLY LIQUID POSITION, WITH CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS OF $21.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED UNDER DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS, MANY OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS THAT RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $865 MILLION OF OUR

$21.6 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND WAS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

SHELF REGISTRATION.

IN FEBRUARY 2008, WE FILED A UNIVERSAL S-3 SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) REGISTERING AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES.

DEBT COVENANTS.

OUR DEBT ARRANGEMENTS AND CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS, THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRE US TO

MAINTAIN A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO BELOW 50%. OUR DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO (CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) WAS 38.1% AND 35.4% AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, RESPECTIVELY. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN AUGUST 2006, WE RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF DEFAULT FROM PERSONS CLAIMING TO HOLD

OUR 5.8% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2036 ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THOSE DEBT SECURITIES. THIS FOLLOWED OUR ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WOULD DELAY FILING OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED

JUNE 30, 2006. SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEEDING REGARDING THE PURPORTED DEFAULT.

BANK CREDIT FACILITIES.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A $750 MILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITY WHICH REPLACED OUR $1.5 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITY ENTERED INTO IN NOVEMBER 2007. THE INTEREST

RATE IS VARIABLE BASED ON TERM AND AMOUNT AND IS CALCULATED BASED ON LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE INTEREST RATE RANGED FROM 2.9% TO 4.3%.

IN MAY 2007, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR $1.3 BILLION FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITY WHICH INCLUDED INCREASING THE CAPACITY. THERE IS CURRENTLY $2.5 BILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THIS CREDIT FACILITY WHICH MATURES IN MAY 2012. THE

INTEREST RATE IS VARIABLE BASED ON TERM AND AMOUNT AND IS CALCULATED BASED ON LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE INTEREST RATE RANGED FROM 0.6% TO 2.0%.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE CREDIT FACILITIES SUPPORT OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS.

WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES OF DOMICILE. MOST OF THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS CONFORM TO THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE

PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A REGULATED SUBSIDIARY, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS LIMITED BASED ON THE ENTITYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME

AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS.

AN INABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES COULD IMPACT THE SCALE TO WHICH

WE COULD REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, AN INABILITY TO PAY REGULATED DIVIDENDS COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO REPAY OUR DEBT; HOWEVER, OUR

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF OUR UNREGULATED BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS LIQUIDITY AT THE PARENT LEVEL IN THE FORM OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER OR BANK FUNDING, MITIGATE THIS RISK. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR RISKS RELATED TO DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

IN 2008, BASED ON THE 2007 STATUTORY NET INCOME AND

STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVELS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS WHICH COULD BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL WAS $3.0 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES HAVE PAID THEIR PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF $4.2

BILLION, INCLUDING $1.2 BILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS APPROVED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS. IN 2007, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS WHICH COULD BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL WAS $2.5 BILLION. IN 2007, $2.9 BILLION WAS PAID TO

THEIR PARENT COMPANIES, INCLUDING $400 MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS APPROVED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATE TO THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48). SINCE THE TIMING OF FUTURE SETTLEMENTS IS

(G)

INCLUDES FUTURE PAYMENTS TO OPTIONHOLDERS RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF SECTION 409A, AS WELL AS OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND CHARITABLE

CONTRIBUTIONS RELATED TO THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION DISCUSSED BELOW, WHICH HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS THEREAFTER DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING PAYMENT TIMING.

WE DO NOT HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR COMMITMENTS THAT REQUIRE CASH RESOURCES; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS. THIS INCLUDES INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS, AND MAY INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE OR KNOWINGLY SEEK TO PARTICIPATE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS

ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN ANY SPE TRANSACTIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION FAS 142-3, DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3 AMENDS THE FACTORS

TO BE CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING RENEWAL AND EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER FAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FSP 142-3 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

OUR FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF FSP 142-3 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 141 (REVISED 2007), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (FAS 141R), WHICH REPLACES FAS

NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. FAS 141R ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR HOW AN ACQUIRER RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED, ANY NONCONTROLLING

INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AND THE GOODWILL ACQUIRED. THE STATEMENT ALSO ESTABLISHES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL ENABLE USERS TO EVALUATE THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. FAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR

2009 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL NEW ACQUISITIONS CLOSING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. EARLY ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT PERMITTED. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF FAS 141R WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AN

AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 REQUIRES THAT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS BE RECHARACTERIZED AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CLASSIFIED AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE

46

STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF FAS 160 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE THOSE ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CHALLENGING, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE THEY MUST ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND

MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVE JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE AND MAY RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.

MEDICAL COSTS

EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR

MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE EITHER NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED OR PROCESSED AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR

MEDICAL CARE SERVICES INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS,

SEASONAL VARIANCES IN MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE UTILIZATION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS, MEMBERSHIP VOLUME AND DEMOGRAPHICS, BENEFIT PLAN CHANGES, AND BUSINESS MIX CHANGES RELATED TO

PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHY. DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND TYPE OF SERVICE, THE TYPICAL BILLING LAG FOR SERVICES CAN BE UP TO 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO MEDICAL CARE SERVICES ARE KNOWN

AND SETTLED WITHIN NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. WE ESTIMATE LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT

STRATEGIES.

EACH PERIOD, WE RE-EXAMINE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES AND INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR

OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS. IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL

DECREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL INCREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (UNFAVORABLE

DEVELOPMENT). HISTORICALLY, THE NET IMPACT OF ESTIMATE DEVELOPMENTS HAS REPRESENTED LESS THAN 1% OF ANNUAL MEDICAL COSTS, LESS THAN 5% OF ANNUAL EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND LESS THAN 4% OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE.

IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES, WE APPLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATION METHODS DEPENDING ON THE MONTH FOR WHICH INCURRED CLAIMS ARE BEING ESTIMATED. FOR

EXAMPLE, WE ACTUARIALLY CALCULATE COMPLETION FACTORS USING AN ANALYSIS OF CLAIM ADJUDICATION PATTERNS OVER THE MOST RECENT 36-MONTH PERIOD. A COMPLETION FACTOR IS AN ACTUARIAL ESTIMATE, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, OF THE PERCENTAGE OF INCURRED

CLAIMS DURING A GIVEN PERIOD THAT HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED BY US AT THE DATE OF ESTIMATION. FOR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE APPLY THE COMPLETION FACTORS TO ACTUAL CLAIMS ADJUDICATED-TO-DATE IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED AMOUNT

OF ULTIMATE INCURRED CLAIMS FOR THOSE MONTHS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COMPLETION FACTORS ARE A RELIABLE BASIS FOR ESTIMATING CLAIMS INCURRED FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS AS THERE IS TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT CLAIM DATA AVAILABLE FOR THOSE MONTHS TO

CALCULATE CREDIBLE COMPLETION FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE ESTIMATE CLAIM COSTS INCURRED PRIMARILY BY APPLYING OBSERVED MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS TO THE AVERAGE PER MEMBER PER MONTH (PMPM) MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED IN

PRIOR MONTHS FOR WHICH MORE COMPLETE CLAIM DATA IS AVAILABLE, SUPPLEMENTED BY A REVIEW OF NEAR-TERM COMPLETION FACTORS. MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS ARE DEVELOPED THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF CLAIMS INCURRED IN PRIOR MONTHS FOR WHICH MORE

COMPLETE CLAIM DATA IS AVAILABLE AND BY REVIEWING A BROAD SET OF HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION INDICATORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PHARMACY UTILIZATION TRENDS, INPATIENT HOSPITAL CENSUS DATA AND INCIDENCE DATA FROM THE NATIONAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTROL, AS WELL AS THROUGH A REVIEW OF NEAR-TERM COMPLETION FACTORS. THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

COMPLETION FACTORS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS WE USE IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR OLDER PERIODS, GENERALLY PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MOST

RECENT THREE MONTHS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE FACTORS AND THE ESTIMATED POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR THOSE PERIODS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE ANALYSES ABOVE INCLUDE THOSE OUTCOMES THAT ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY LIKELY BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE

ESTIMATING LIABILITIES FOR INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED BENEFIT CLAIMS.

IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES FOR ANY

PARTICULAR DISCRETE PERIOD, ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BOTH THE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD PERTAINING TO PRIOR PERIODS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS PERTAINING TO THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE ACCOMPANYING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR ESTIMATE OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR LIABILITY FOR UNPAID MEDICAL

COSTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, DEVELOPED USING CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACTUARIAL METHODS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE IS REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

HOWEVER, ACTUAL CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES. ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL 1% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR DECEMBER 31, 2008 ESTIMATES OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, EXCLUDING AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT

INSURANCE, 2008 NET EARNINGS WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BY $48 MILLION AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BY $0.04 PER SHARE.

THE CURRENT NATIONAL HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION RATE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE GENERAL INFLATION RATE. WE USE VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO LESSEN THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION. THESE INCLUDE SETTING COMMERCIAL PREMIUMS BASED ON

ANTICIPATED HEALTH CARE COSTS, COORDINATING CARE WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND RATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, WE

EMPHASIZE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE, APPROPRIATE USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, EDUCATION AND CLOSING GAPS IN CARE.

WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, NEW HEALTH CARE

AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, DEMANDS FROM PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS, MAJOR EPIDEMICS, AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION. BECAUSE

OF THE NARROW OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST TRENDS THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED IN ESTABLISHING PREMIUM RATES CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

REVENUES

REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY DERIVED FROM HEALTH CARE INSURANCE

PREMIUMS. WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY BILLED MONTHLY AT A CONTRACTED RATE PER ELIGIBLE PERSON MULTIPLIED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE

ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES, AS RECORDED IN OUR RECORDS. EMPLOYER GROUPS GENERALLY PROVIDE US WITH CHANGES TO THEIR ELIGIBLE POPULATION ONE MONTH IN ARREARS. EACH BILLING INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT FOR PRIOR PERIOD CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY STATUS THAT

WERE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR PREVIOUS BILLING. WE ESTIMATE AND ADJUST THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ACCORDINGLY. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS, PREMIUMS BILLED, THE LEVEL OF CONTRACT RENEWAL ACTIVITY AND

OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. WE REVISE ESTIMATES OF REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS EACH PERIOD AND RECORD CHANGES IN THE PERIOD THEY BECOME KNOWN.

WE ESTIMATE RISK

ADJUSTMENT REVENUES BASED UPON THE DIAGNOSIS DATA SUBMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CMS. CMS DEPLOYS A RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL WHICH APPORTIONS PREMIUMS PAID TO ALL HEALTH PLANS ACCORDING TO HEALTH SEVERITY AND CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. THE

CMS RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL PAYS MORE FOR MEMBERS WHOSE MEDICAL HISTORY WOULD INDICATE ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS. UNDER THIS RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY, CMS CALCULATES THE RISK ADJUSTED PREMIUM PAYMENT USING DIAGNOSIS DATA FROM

HOSPITAL INPATIENT, HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT AND PHYSICIAN TREATMENT SETTINGS. NECESSARY AND AVAILABLE DIAGNOSIS DATA COLLECTED AND CAPTURED BY US AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IS SUBMITTED TO CMS WITHIN PRESCRIBED DEADLINES.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, OF $24.6 BILLION. WE REVIEW OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, AND WE

REVIEW OUR REMAINING LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE WE MIGHT NOT RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ASSESS THEIR RECOVERABILITY, WE MUST MAKE

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE UTILITY AND ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IN TURN ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR

THEIR RELATED ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

INVESTMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $14.1 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY HELD IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY CLASSIFIED

AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. WE EXCLUDE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS FROM EARNINGS AND REPORT NET UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT IN

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, OUR INVESTMENTS HAD GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS OF $312 MILLION AND GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $349

MILLION. IF ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, BASED ON ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT FACTORS, WE RECORD A REALIZED LOSS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT

IS INVOLVED IN EVALUATING WHETHER A DECLINE IN AN INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. WE ANALYZE RELEVANT FACTORS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN

COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT TIME IN ORDER TO

ENABLE RECOVERY OF OUR COST. NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE THESE JUDGMENTS. WE REVISE IMPAIRMENT JUDGMENTS WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN OR WHEN WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HOLDING THE INVESTMENT UNTIL RECOVERY AND RECORD ANY

RESULTING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AT THAT TIME. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR MARKET SECTOR, AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES,

ASSET-BACKED, AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF INVESTMENT GRADE QUALITY. IF SECURITIES ARE DOWNGRADED BELOW POLICY MINIMUMS, SUBSEQUENT TO PURCHASE, THEY WILL BE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT POLICY.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES,

WE ARE ROUTINELY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS DISPUTES, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS. OUR ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH

OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL, IF APPROPRIATE, AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERING OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR SUCH MATTERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO OUR PENDING REGULATORY

INQUIRIES AND LITIGATION.

LEGAL MATTERS

A

DESCRIPTION OF OUR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY SUBJECT

US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE MANAGED UNDER AN INVESTMENT POLICY AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS POLICY LIMITS THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE INVESTED IN ANY ONE ISSUER AND GENERALLY LIMITS OUR

INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE LIMITED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYER GROUPS THAT CONSTITUTE OUR CUSTOMER BASE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE $2.0 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF OUR GOLDEN RULE FINANCIAL CORPORATION LIFE AND ANNUITY BUSINESS IN 2005. WE REGULARLY

EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORD THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AMOUNTS ARE DEEMED PROBABLE OF RECOVERY. CURRENTLY, THE REINSURER IS RATED BY A.M. BEST AS A. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR

PRIMARY MARKET RISKS ARE EXPOSURES TO (A) CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND EXPENSE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED-RATE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND DEBT AND (B) CHANGES IN EQUITY PRICES THAT IMPACT

THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $7.4 BILLION OF OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON WHICH INTEREST RATES RECEIVED VARY WITH MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT INCOME. ALSO, APPROXIMATELY $7.2 BILLION OF OUR DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS AT INTEREST RATES THAT VARY WITH

MARKET RATES, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED-RATE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND DEBT ALSO VARIES WITH MARKET INTEREST RATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $13.7 BILLION OF OUR INVESTMENTS WERE FIXED-RATE DEBT SECURITIES, AND APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION

OF OUR DEBT WAS FIXED-RATE TERM DEBT WITH NO RELATED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. AN INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES DECREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-RATE DEBT. CONVERSELY, A DECREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES

INCREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-RATE DEBT.

WE MANAGE EXPOSURE TO MARKET INTEREST RATES BY DIVERSIFYING INVESTMENTS ACROSS

DIFFERENT FIXED INCOME MARKET SECTORS AND DEBT ACROSS MATURITIES AND INTEREST RATE INDICES, AS WELL AS ENDEAVORING TO MATCH OUR FLOATING RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OVER TIME, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. AS

PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF MARKET INTEREST RATES ON INTEREST EXPENSE. THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE FIXED RATES RECEIVED AND THE VARIABLE RATES

PAID IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENTS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR SWAP AGREEMENTS CONVERTED A MAJORITY OF OUR INTEREST EXPENSE FROM A FIXED TO VARIABLE RATES TO

BETTER OFFSET THE IMPACT OF MARKET RATES ON OUR VARIABLE RATE CASH EQUIVALENT INVESTMENTS. IN JANUARY 2009, WE TERMINATED $4.9 BILLION NOTIONAL OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO LOCK-IN THE BENEFIT OF CURRENT LOW MARKET

INTEREST RATES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 9 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACT OF A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES BY 1% OR 2% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 ON OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE PER ANNUM, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS

AND DEBT (IN MILLIONS).

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE HAD $477 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, A PORTION OF WHICH

WERE HELD IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE OR TECHNOLOGY STOCKS WILL LIKEWISE IMPACT THE VALUE

OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED (ALSO REFERRED TO AS UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND THE COMPANY) IS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING COMPANY

DEDICATED TO MAKING HEALTH CARE WORK BETTER. THE COMPANY EMPHASIZES ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND IMPROVING THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE IT SERVES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE COMPANY HELPS PEOPLE GET THE CARE

THEY NEED AT AN AFFORDABLE COST, SUPPORTS THE PHYSICIAN/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP, AND EMPOWERS PEOPLE WITH THE INFORMATION, GUIDANCE AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO MAKE PERSONAL HEALTH CHOICES AND DECISIONS.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BY SIMPLIFYING THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENTS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY, PROMOTING EVIDENCE-BASED

MEDICINE AS THE STANDARD FOR CARE, AND PROVIDING RELEVANT, ACTIONABLE DATA THAT PHYSICIANS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, CONSUMERS, EMPLOYERS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN HEALTH CARE CAN USE TO MAKE BETTER, MORE INFORMED DECISIONS.

THROUGH ITS DIVERSIFIED FAMILY OF BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY LEVERAGES CORE COMPETENCIES IN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY-BASED TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITIES; HEALTH CARE DATA,

KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION; AND HEALTH CARE RESOURCE ORGANIZATION AND CARE FACILITATION TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES, SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE, PROMOTE QUALITY AND MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE.

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE COMPANY HAS PREPARED THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDING TO U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND HAS INCLUDED THE ACCOUNTS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION. THE COMPANY HAS ELIMINATED

INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS, OFTEN

BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND WILL LIKELY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE COMPANYS MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO MEDICAL COSTS, MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, REVENUES, GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

INVESTMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THESE ESTIMATES EACH PERIOD, AS MORE CURRENT INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IS INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE

ESTIMATE IS ADJUSTED.

REVENUES

PREMIUM

REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS FIXED, TYPICALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND THE COMPANY ASSUMES THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING ITS CUSTOMERS HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND RELATED

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE COMPANY RECORDS HEALTH CARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM ITS CUSTOMERS IN ADVANCE OF THE

SERVICE PERIOD AS UNEARNED PREMIUMS.

CMS DEPLOYS A RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL WHICH APPORTIONS PREMIUMS PAID TO ALL HEALTH PLANS ACCORDING TO HEALTH SEVERITY

AND CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. THE CMS RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL PAYS MORE FOR MEMBERS WHOSE MEDICAL HISTORY WOULD INDICATE ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS. UNDER THIS RISK ADJUSTMENT

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

METHODOLOGY, CMS CALCULATES THE RISK ADJUSTED PREMIUM PAYMENT USING DIAGNOSIS DATA FROM HOSPITAL INPATIENT, HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT AND PHYSICIAN TREATMENT

SETTINGS. THE COMPANY AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COLLECT, CAPTURE, AND SUBMIT THE NECESSARY AND AVAILABLE DIAGNOSIS DATA TO CMS WITHIN PRESCRIBED DEADLINES. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES RISK ADJUSTMENT REVENUES BASED UPON THE DIAGNOSIS DATA SUBMITTED AND

EXPECTED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CMS.

SERVICE REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FEES DERIVED FROM SERVICES PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE MEDICAL

COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDANTS. UNDER SERVICE FEE CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED BASED UPON THE FEE CHARGED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CUSTOMERS RETAIN THE RISK OF FINANCING

MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES DEPENDANTS, AND THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMER FUNDS TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS FROM CUSTOMER-FUNDED BANK ACCOUNTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY NEITHER HAS THE

OBLIGATION FOR FUNDING THE MEDICAL EXPENSES, NOR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING THE MEDICAL CARE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUE AND MEDICAL COSTS FOR THESE CONTRACTS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR BOTH PREMIUM RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES; TRANSACTION PROCESSING;

CUSTOMER, CONSUMER AND CARE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.

THROUGH

THE COMPANYS PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT (PBM) BUSINESS, REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH A CONTRACTED NETWORK OF RETAIL PHARMACIES, AND FROM ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS PROCESSING AND

FORMULARY DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT. PRODUCT REVENUES INCLUDE INGREDIENT COSTS (NET OF REBATES), A NEGOTIATED DISPENSING FEE AND CUSTOMER CO-PAYMENTS FOR DRUGS DISPENSED THROUGH THE COMPANYS MAIL-SERVICE PHARMACY. IN ALL RETAIL PHARMACY

TRANSACTIONS, REVENUES RECOGNIZED ALWAYS EXCLUDE THE MEMBERS APPLICABLE CO-PAYMENT. PRODUCT REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON SALE OR SHIPMENT. SERVICE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRESCRIPTION CLAIM IS ADJUDICATED. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO

RETAIL SERVICE CONTRACTS THAT SEPARATELY OBLIGATE IT TO PAY ITS NETWORK PHARMACY PROVIDERS FOR BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY IS PAID. THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING THE PRICES CHARGED BY RETAIL

PHARMACIES, DETERMINING WHICH DRUGS WILL BE INCLUDED IN FORMULARY LISTINGS AND SELECTING WHICH RETAIL PHARMACIES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE NETWORK OFFERED TO PLAN SPONSORS MEMBERS. AS A RESULT, REVENUES ARE REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 99-19, REPORTING GROSS REVENUE AS A PRINCIPAL VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT. PRODUCT REVENUES ALSO INCLUDE SALES OF INGENIX PUBLISHING AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED

AS REVENUE UPON SHIPMENT.

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS EITHER NOT YET

RECEIVED OR PROCESSED CLAIMS, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY

CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, CARE PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH PERIOD, THE COMPANY RE-EXAMINES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED

MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE LIABILITY ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS BECOME MORE EXACT, THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES, AND INCLUDES THE

CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES THEIR CARRYING VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT

MATURITY OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS INTENT WITH RESPECT TO OFFSETTING CASH BALANCES, WHICH AFFECTED

ITS BALANCES IN CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF BANK DEPOSITS FOR CERTAIN CASH BALANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF BANK DEPOSITS OF $1.2 BILLION, WHICH WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND HAVE BEEN REFLECTED AS CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THERE WERE NO CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF BANK DEPOSITS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007.

INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. BECAUSE OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MATURITY DATE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THESE INVESTMENTS AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTS THEM AT AMORTIZED COST. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE.

THE COMPANY EXCLUDES UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES FROM EARNINGS AND REPORTS THEM, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

OF ITS INVESTMENTS. FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION, THE COMPANY ANALYZES RELEVANT FACTORS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT TIME TO RECOVER ITS COST.

NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE THESE JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANY REVISES IMPAIRMENT JUDGMENTS WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN OR WHEN IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE HOLDING THE INVESTMENT UNTIL THE FORECASTED RECOVERY. IF ANY OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN VALUE THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, BASED ON ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT FACTORS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A REALIZED LOSS IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS. THE AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS ARE RECORDED UTILIZING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD (INTEREST) METHOD, OVER THE PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO MATURITY OR CALL DATE, WHICHEVER PRODUCES THE LOWEST YIELD. FOR

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES INCLUDED IN DEBT SECURITIES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INCOME USING AN EFFECTIVE YIELD BASED ON ANTICIPATED PREPAYMENTS AND THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE SECURITIES. WHEN ESTIMATES OF PREPAYMENTS CHANGE, THE EFFECTIVE YIELD

IS RECALCULATED TO REFLECT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO DATE AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE PAYMENTS. THE NET INVESTMENT IN THE SECURITIES IS ADJUSTED TO THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD HAVE EXISTED HAD THE NEW EFFECTIVE YIELD BEEN APPLIED SINCE THE ACQUISITION OF THE

SECURITIES. THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE. THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR MARKET SECTOR, AND LARGELY LIMIT ITS INVESTMENTS TO U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, ASSET-BACKED, AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, ALL OF INVESTMENT GRADE QUALITY. IF SECURITIES ARE DOWNGRADED BELOW POLICY MINIMUMS, SUBSEQUENT TO PURCHASE, THEY WILL BE DISPOSED OF IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT POLICY. TO CALCULATE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY USES THE SPECIFIC COST OR AMORTIZED COST OF EACH INVESTMENT SOLD.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AARPS INSURANCE PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 13 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). PURSUANT TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENT, AARP ASSETS ARE MANAGED SEPARATELY

FROM ITS GENERAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT THE COMPANYS DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED BY AARP. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF

RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND, UPON TRANSFER OF THE AARP CONTRACT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSFER CASH EQUAL IN AMOUNT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER TO THAT ENTITY. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THESE ASSETS

IS TO FUND THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, THE RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF) LIABILITIES AND OTHER RELATED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP CONTRACT, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS, CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF

THESE LIABILITIES. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF. ACCORDINGLY, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS EARNINGS.

OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES

OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES INCLUDE

PROCEEDS DUE FROM PHARMACY REBATES, CMS FOR MEDICARE PART D, REINSURANCE AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS AMOUNTS DUE TO THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS PBM

COMPANIES CONTRACT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, SOME OF WHOM PROVIDE REBATES BASED ON USE OF THE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCTS BY ITS PBM COMPANIES AFFILIATED AND NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES REBATES AS THEY ARE EARNED BY

ITS CLIENTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTS, HISTORICAL DATA AND CURRENT ESTIMATES. THE PBM COMPANIES BILL THESE REBATES TO THE MANUFACTURERS ON A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS DEPENDING ON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE

COMPANY RECORDS REBATES ATTRIBUTABLE TO AFFILIATED CLIENTS AS A REDUCTION TO MEDICAL COSTS. REBATES ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS ARE ACCRUED AS REBATES RECEIVABLE AND A REDUCTION OF COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD WITH A CORRESPONDING PAYABLE FOR

THE AMOUNTS OF THE REBATES TO BE REMITTED TO NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR CONTRACTS AND POSTED TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS A REDUCTION OF PRODUCT REVENUE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECEIVES REBATES BETWEEN TWO TO

FIVE MONTHS AFTER BILLING.

FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPANYS MEDICARE PART D RECEIVABLES SEE MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT BELOW.

FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPANYS REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE SEE FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES BELOW.

MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT

THE COMPANY

SERVES AS A PLAN SPONSOR OFFERING MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS). UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, THERE ARE SIX SEPARATE ELEMENTS OF PAYMENT RECEIVED

BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PLAN YEAR. THESE PAYMENT ELEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.



CMS PREMIUM

 CMS PAYS A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM PER MEMBER TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.



MEMBER PREMIUM

 ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN MEMBERS PAY A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.



LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY

 FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS SOME OR ALL OF THE MEMBERS MONTHLY PREMIUMS TO THE COMPANY ON THE

MEMBERS BEHALF.



CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY

 CMS PAYS THE COMPANY A COST REIMBURSEMENT ESTIMATE MONTHLY TO FUND THE CMS OBLIGATION TO PAY APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE

COSTS INCURRED BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS IN EXCESS

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

OF THE INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM. A SETTLEMENT IS MADE WITH CMS BASED ON ACTUAL COST EXPERIENCE, SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.



LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY

 FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS ON THE MEMBERS BEHALF SOME OR ALL OF A MEMBERS COST

SHARING AMOUNTS, SUCH AS DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE. THE COST SHARING SUBSIDY IS FUNDED BY CMS THROUGH MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS AND PAYS THE SUBSIDIZED PORTION OF THE CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CMS, AND A SETTLEMENT PAYMENT

IS MADE BETWEEN CMS AND THE COMPANY BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS AND PREMIUM EXPERIENCE, SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.



CMS RISK-SHARE

 PREMIUMS FROM CMS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK CORRIDOR PROVISIONS WHICH COMPARE COSTS TARGETED IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL BIDS TO ACTUAL

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, LIMITED TO ACTUAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED UNDER THE STANDARD COVERAGE AS DEFINED BY CMS. VARIANCES OF MORE THAN 5% ABOVE OR BELOW THE ORIGINAL BID SUBMITTED BY THE COMPANY MAY RESULT IN CMS MAKING ADDITIONAL

PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY OR REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REFUND TO CMS A PORTION OF THE PREMIUMS IT RECEIVED. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES AND RECOGNIZES AN ADJUSTMENT TO PREMIUM REVENUES RELATED TO THE RISK CORRIDOR PAYMENT SETTLEMENT BASED UPON PHARMACY CLAIMS

EXPERIENCE. THE ESTIMATE OF THE SETTLEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISK CORRIDOR PROVISIONS REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO CONSIDER FACTORS THAT MAY NOT BE CERTAIN, INCLUDING MEMBER ELIGIBILITY STATUS DIFFERENCES WITH CMS. THE RISK-SHARE ADJUSTMENT, IF ANY,

IS RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO PREMIUM REVENUES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

THE CMS PREMIUM, THE MEMBER PREMIUM, AND THE

LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY REPRESENT PAYMENTS FOR THE COMPANYS INSURANCE RISK COVERAGE UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM AND THEREFORE ARE RECORDED AS PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. PREMIUM REVENUES ARE

RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS. THE COMPANY RECORDS PREMIUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE APPLICABLE SERVICE PERIOD IN UNEARNED PREMIUMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS.

THE CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY AND THE LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY REPRESENT COST REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART

D PROGRAM. THE COMPANY IS FULLY REIMBURSED BY CMS FOR COSTS INCURRED FOR THESE CONTRACT ELEMENTS AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO INSURANCE RISK TO THE COMPANY. AMOUNTS RECEIVED FOR THESE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT REFLECTED AS PREMIUM REVENUES, BUT RATHER ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS WITHIN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RELATED CASH FLOWS ARE PRESENTED AS CUSTOMER FUNDS ADMINISTERED WITHIN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THERE WAS A RECEIVABLE FOR THE CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY AND THE LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY OF $349 MILLION RECORDED IN

OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WERE AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT FOR THESE SUBSIDIES OF APPROXIMATELY $340 MILLION RECORDED IN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS UNDER THE CONTRACT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN MEDICAL COSTS AND OPERATING COSTS,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THE MEDICARE PART D PRODUCT BENEFIT DESIGN, THE COMPANY INCURS A

DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS EARLY IN THE CONTRACT YEAR. WHILE THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 67% OF A MEDICARE PART D BENEFICIARYS DRUG COSTS UP TO THE INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT, THE BENEFICIARY IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR 100% OF THEIR DRUG COSTS FROM THE INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT TO THE OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY INCURS A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE CONTRACT YEAR AS COMPARED WITH THE LAST HALF OF

THE CONTRACT YEAR, WHEN COMPARATIVELY MORE MEMBERS WILL BE INCURRING CLAIMS ABOVE THE INITIAL

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

COVERAGE LIMIT. THE UNEVEN TIMING OF MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFIT CLAIMS RESULTS IN LOSSES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THAT, IF THEY CONTINUED AT THAT

PACE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR, WOULD ENTITLE THE COMPANY TO RISK-SHARE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS FROM CMS. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THE CONTRACT YEAR, THE COMPANY RECORDS A NET RISK-SHARE RECEIVABLE FROM CMS IN OTHER CURRENT

RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND A CORRESPONDING RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT IN PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. THIS REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT PAYABLE BY CMS TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE

RISK-SHARE CONTRACT PROVISIONS IF THE PROGRAM WERE TERMINATED BASED ON ESTIMATED COSTS INCURRED THROUGH THAT INTERIM PERIOD. TYPICALLY, THOSE LOSSES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

THE FINAL 2008 RISK-SHARE AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2009, AND IS SUBJECT TO THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS WITH CMS. THE NET RISK-SHARE

RECEIVABLE FROM CMS OF $19 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WAS A NET RISK-SHARE PAYABLE OF APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION RECORDED IN

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2009, CERTAIN CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE MEDICARE PART D

COVERAGE BY CMS, INCLUDING.



THE INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT INCREASED TO $2,700.



THE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE BEGINS AT $6,154.



THE ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM INCREASED TO $4,350.

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE STATED AT COST, NET OF ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE CONSISTS OF CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND PAYROLL COSTS OF EMPLOYEES DEVOTED TO SPECIFIC SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE FOR EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT WE MIGHT NOT RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE,

AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED.

THE COMPANY CALCULATES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF

THE ASSETS. THE USEFUL LIVES FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE.

FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

3 TO 7 YEARS

BUILDINGS

35 TO 40 YEARS

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

SHORTER OF USEFUL LIFE OR REMAINING LEASE TERM

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

3 TO 9 YEARS

GOODWILL

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE PURCHASE PRICE OF BUSINESSES THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE ASSETS AND SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF THESE BUSINESSES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY TESTS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR

ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON JANUARY 1ST OF EACH YEAR OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF IT BELIEVES INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST. THE COMPANY HAS ELEVEN REPORTING UNITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TEST INVOLVES A

TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST INVOLVES COMPARING THE FAIR VALUES OF THE APPLICABLE REPORTING UNITS WITH THEIR AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES,

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

INCLUDING GOODWILL. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DETERMINES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS UTILIZING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD, AN INCOME APPROACH. IF

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNITS FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY PERFORMS THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS. THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST

INVOLVES COMPARING THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE AFFECTED REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THAT GOODWILL.

THE INCOME APPROACH

UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY REQUIRES THE USE OF VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH INCLUDE FORECASTED CASH FLOWS, WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, TERMINAL VALUE, LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES, AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE COMPANY CONDUCTED ITS MOST RECENT IMPAIRMENT TEST ON JANUARY 1, 2009 AND HAS DETERMINED THERE TO BE NO IMPAIRMENT OF THE CARRYING VALUES OF GOODWILL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DISCRETE

USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES UNLESS ANOTHER METHOD CAN BE REASONABLY DETERMINED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE AN ASSETS

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN WHICH CASE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD BE RECORDED. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE UTILITY AND CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSETS, TO MAKE THIS DECISION. THERE WERE

NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES INCLUDE THE RSF ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 13 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), DEPOSITS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM (SEE MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY

BENEFITS CONTRACT ABOVE), CUSTOMER BALANCES RELATED TO EXPERIENCE-RATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS. CUSTOMER BALANCES REPRESENT EXCESS CUSTOMER PAYMENTS AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS UNDER EXPERIENCE-RATED

CONTRACTS. AT THE CUSTOMERS OPTION, THESE BALANCES MAY BE REFUNDED OR USED TO PAY FUTURE PREMIUMS OR CLAIMS UNDER ELIGIBLE CONTRACTS.

INCOME

TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND LAWS. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT GENERALLY REFLECTS THE NET CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING THE YEAR, EXCLUDING ANY DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION REFLECTS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES CURRENTLY TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE ON VARIOUS INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEAR REPORTED.

FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES

FUTURE

POLICY BENEFITS REPRESENT ACCOUNT BALANCES THAT ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS, EXCLUDING SURRENDER CHARGES, FOR UNIVERSAL LIFE AND INVESTMENT ANNUITY PRODUCTS AND HEALTH POLICIES SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS FOR WHICH SOME OF THE PREMIUM

INDEMNITY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED A LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REINSURED CONTRACTS, AS IT REMAINS PRIMARILY LIABLE TO THE POLICYHOLDERS, AND HAS RECORDED A CORRESPONDING REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE PURCHASER.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE $2.0 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE, OF WHICH $154 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND $1.9 BILLION WAS RECORDED

IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE $2.0 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE, OF WHICH $167 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND $1.8 BILLION WAS RECORDED IN

OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORDS THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT OF PROBABLE RECOVERY.

POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL HEALTH

INSURANCE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY HAVE A ONE-YEAR TERM AND MAY BE CANCELLED BY THE CUSTOMER WITH AT LEAST 31 DAYS NOTICE. COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND RENEWAL OF COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER CONTRACTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (FAS 123R) UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD OF ADOPTION. UNDER THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION

PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION VESTS.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

THE COMPANY COMPUTES BASIC NET

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. THE COMPANY DETERMINES DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD, ADJUSTED FOR POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) AND THE CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AS PART OF THE

COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF MARKET INTEREST RATES ON INTEREST EXPENSE. THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE FIXED RATES RECEIVED AND THE

VARIABLE RATES PAID IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENTS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANYS SWAP AGREEMENTS CONVERTED A MAJORITY OF ITS INTEREST EXPENSE FROM

FIXED TO VARIABLE RATES TO BETTER OFFSET THE IMPACT OF MARKET RATES ON ITS VARIABLE RATE CASH EQUIVALENT INVESTMENTS AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 9 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES  INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 EXPANDS THE USE OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING BUT DOES NOT AFFECT EXISTING STANDARDS THAT REQUIRE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. UNDER

FAS 159, A COMPANY MAY ELECT TO USE FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES, EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, GUARANTEES AND ISSUED DEBT. THE

FAIR VALUE ELECTION IS IRREVOCABLE

AND GENERALLY MADE ON AN INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT BASIS, EVEN IF A COMPANY HAS SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS THAT IT ELECTS NOT TO MEASURE BASED ON FAIR VALUE. THE

COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 159 AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008 AND ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR THE AARP ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT THAT DATE. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 159 WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THE INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS APPLIED, SEE NOTE 13 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN SEPTEMBER

2006, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (FAS 157). FAS 157 ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, BUT DOES REQUIRE EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE

INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS USED TO MEASURE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASURES ON EARNINGS. FAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION FAS 157-2, EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157 (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-2 DELAYED THE

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FAS 157 FOR ALL NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR ONE YEAR, EXCEPT THOSE THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 157 AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, EXCEPT

FOR THOSE PROVISIONS DEFERRED UNDER FSP 157-2. THE DEFERRED PROVISIONS OF FAS 157, WHICH APPLY PRIMARILY TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING PURPOSES, WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE

ADOPTION OF THE DEFERRED PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION FAS 142-3, DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE

ASSETS (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3 AMENDS THE FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING RENEWAL AND EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER FAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. FSP 142-3 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE

ADOPTION OF FSP 142-3 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 141 (REVISED

2007), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (FAS 141R), WHICH REPLACES FAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. FAS 141R ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR HOW AN ACQUIRER RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE

IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED, ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE ACQUIREE AND THE GOODWILL ACQUIRED. THE STATEMENT ALSO ESTABLISHES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL ENABLE USERS TO EVALUATE THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS

OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. FAS 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL NEW ACQUISITIONS CLOSING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009. EARLY ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT PERMITTED. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF FAS 141R WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED

FAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 REQUIRES THAT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS BE RECHARACTERIZED AS NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS AND CLASSIFIED AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND MUST BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF FAS 160 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOT PERMIT THE ISSUER TO SETTLE THE SECURITIES AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE INVESTMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS

APPROXIMATE THEIR AMORTIZED COST.

(B)

INCLUDES AGENCY-BACKED MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES.

THE UNREALIZED

LOSSES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 WERE GENERATED FROM APPROXIMATELY 4,400 POSITIONS OUT OF A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 12,000 POSITIONS. THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS

AND CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 WERE PRIMARILY CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND NOT BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SECURITIES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES IMPAIRMENT AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD

FOR SECURITIES WHERE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN ITS COST. THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS ARE EITHER GUARANTEED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AN AGENCY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT IS EXPECTED

THAT THE SECURITIES WOULD NOT BE SETTLED AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE COST OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY OF THE ISSUERS AND THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND THE

CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS, NOTING NEITHER A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION SINCE PURCHASE NOR OTHER FACTORS LEADING TO AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT.

A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS CONSISTS OF INVESTMENTS HELD IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NONPUBLIC COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.

MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY STOCKS WILL LIKEWISE IMPACT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS EQUITY PORTFOLIO. THE EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS WERE EVALUATED FOR SEVERITY AND DURATION OF

UNREALIZED LOSS, OVERALL MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

THE COMPANY ANALYZES RELEVANT FACTORS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION INCLUDING THE

LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER, AND ITS INTENT AND

ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT TIME TO RECOVER THE COMPANYS COST. THE COMPANY REVISES IMPAIRMENT JUDGMENTS WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN OR WHEN IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE HOLDING THE INVESTMENT UNTIL RECOVERY. IF ANY OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCES A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, BASED ON ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT FACTORS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A REALIZED LOSS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT CONSIDER THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON EACH OF THE INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1

 QUOTED (UNADJUSTED) PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 2

 OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, INCLUDING.



QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS;



QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS IN NON-ACTIVE MARKETS (FEW TRANSACTIONS, LIMITED INFORMATION, NON-CURRENT PRICES, HIGH VARIABILITY OVER TIME, ETC.);



INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET (INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, VOLATILITIES, DEFAULT RATES, ETC.); AND



INPUTS THAT ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED BY OTHER OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

LEVEL 3

 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

FAIR VALUES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. THE COMPANY OBTAINS ONE PRICE FOR EACH SECURITY

PRIMARILY FROM A THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE), WHICH GENERALLY USES LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 157. THE PRICING SERVICE NORMALLY DERIVES THE SECURITY PRICES THROUGH RECENTLY

REPORTED TRADES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR SECURITIES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE REPORTING DATE BASED UPON AVAILABLE OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. FOR SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED, THE PRICING SERVICE MAY USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF COMPARABLE

INSTRUMENTS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES, INCORPORATING INPUTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKETS FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES. INPUTS THAT ARE OFTEN USED IN THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, NON-BINDING BROKER

QUOTES, BENCHMARK YIELDS, CREDIT SPREADS, DEFAULT RATES AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS. AS THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, IT PERFORMS QUARTERLY ANALYSES ON THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

PRICES ARE REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. AS A RESULT OF THESE REVIEWS, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HISTORICALLY ADJUSTED THE PRICES OBTAINED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE.

IN INSTANCES IN WHICH THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FALL INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HAS BEEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR ITEM TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE CONSIDERATION OF INPUTS SPECIFIC TO THE ASSET.

THE FOLLOWING

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH CLASS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE CARRYING

VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AS MATURITIES ARE LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. FAIR VALUES OF CASH EQUIVALENT INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT TRADE ON A REGULAR BASIS IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

DEBT SECURITIES.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF DEBT SECURITIES HELD AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND/OR OTHER MARKET DATA FOR THE

SAME OR COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS IN ESTABLISHING THE PRICES. FAIR VALUES OF DEBT SECURITIES THAT DO NOT TRADE ON A REGULAR BASIS IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

EQUITY SECURITIES.

ALL EQUITY SECURITIES ARE HELD AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS IN VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIOS ARE

ESTIMATED USING A MARKET MODEL APPROACH THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS AND QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS AND ARE THEREFORE CONSIDERED TO BE LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE BASED ON QUOTED

MARKET PRICES AND/OR OTHER MARKET DATA FOR THE SAME OR COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS IN ESTABLISHING THE PRICES.

INTEREST RATE

SWAPS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE ESTIMATED UTILIZING THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET YIELD CURVES. BECAUSE THE SWAPS ARE UNIQUE AND ARE NOT ACTIVELY TRADED, THE FAIR VALUES ARE CLASSIFIED

AS LEVEL 2 ESTIMATES.

8.    MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED

CONSUMERS, BUT FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE EITHER NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED OR PROCESSED, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN

ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE

CONSUMPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH

PERIOD, THE COMPANY RE-EXAMINES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS DEVELOP, THE

COMPANY ADJUSTS THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES AND INCLUDES THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.6 BILLION IN SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, WHICH INCLUDED: $250 MILLION

OF 5.1% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2010, $450 MILLION OF 5.5% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2012, $250 MILLION OF 6.0% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2017 AND $650 MILLION OF 6.6% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2037. THESE NOTES WERE ISSUED

PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SECTION 4(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (1933 ACT). IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED AN EXCHANGE OFFER IN WHICH THEN-EXISTING NOTEHOLDERS EXCHANGED EACH SERIES OF THESE NOTES FOR A

NEW ISSUE OF SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL DEBT SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER THE 1933 ACT.

IN JUNE 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED A TOTAL OF $1.5 BILLION IN SENIOR

UNSECURED DEBT, WHICH INCLUDED: $500 MILLION OF FLOATING-RATE NOTES DUE JUNE 2010, $500 MILLION OF 6.0% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE JUNE 2017 AND $500 MILLION OF 6.5% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE JUNE 2037. THE FLOATING-RATE NOTES ARE BENCHMARKED TO LIBOR AND HAD

AN INTEREST RATE OF 1.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THESE NOTES WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SECTION 4(2) OF THE 1933 ACT. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED AN EXCHANGE OFFER IN WHICH

DEBT COVENANTS

THE COMPANYS DEBT

ARRANGEMENTS AND CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS, THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO (CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER,

DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) BELOW 50%. THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN AUGUST 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF DEFAULT FROM PERSONS CLAIMING TO HOLD

ITS 5.8% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2036 ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THOSE DEBT SECURITIES. THIS FOLLOWED THE COMPANYS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE COMPANY WOULD DELAY FILING ITS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR

THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEEDING REGARDING THE PURPORTED DEFAULT.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME

RECEIVED ON THE COMPANYS CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO CONVERT THE MAJORITY OF ITS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM FIXED RATES TO FLOATING RATES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS HAVE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $5.1 BILLION AND $5.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE FLOATING RATES ARE BENCHMARKED TO LIBOR. THE SWAPS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE

FIXED-RATE DEBT UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD OF FAS 133, AND ARE REPORTED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE DEBT ADJUSTED BY AN OFFSETTING AMOUNT, WITH NO CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE

RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JANUARY 2009 THE COMPANY TERMINATED $4.9 BILLION NOTIONAL OF INTEREST RATE

SWAP CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO LOCK-IN THE BENEFIT OF CURRENT LOW MARKET INTEREST RATES. THE CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT WAS $513 MILLION AND WILL BE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION TO INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE RELATED DEBT, RESULTING IN A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 3.3%.

VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE PROVIDED WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE

REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES PRIMARILY RELATE TO FUTURE TAX BENEFITS ON CERTAIN STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS OF $82 MILLION EXPIRE BEGINNING IN 2012 THROUGH 2028, AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS EXPIRE BEGINNING IN 2009 THROUGH 2028.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 ON JANUARY 1, 2007. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ADOPTING FIN 48 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $88 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED A REDUCTION OF $61 MILLION IN RETAINED EARNINGS AND AN INCREASE OF $26 MILLION IN GOODWILL. THE TOTAL

AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION WAS $341 MILLION. A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31 IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS AS INCOME TAXES

WITHIN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $23 MILLION AND $28 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION AND $54 MILLION OF

ACCRUED INTEREST, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, WHICH WERE REPORTED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECONCILIATION ABOVE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS $193 MILLION.

THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION, VARIOUS STATES, AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED EXAMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND

PRIOR. THE COMPANYS 2008 TAX RETURN IS UNDER ADVANCE REVIEW BY THE IRS UNDER ITS COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROGRAM (CAP). WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW STATES, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS PRIOR TO 2002 IN MAJOR STATE

AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES

IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL DECREASE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS BY $138 MILLION OR LESS AS A RESULT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS IN CERTAIN MAJOR JURISDICTIONS.

11.    SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES THAT

ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES OF DOMICILE. MOST OF THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS CONFORM

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

TO THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN

SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY

A REGULATED SUBSIDIARY, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS LIMITED BASED ON THE ENTITYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS.

IN 2008, BASED ON THE 2007 STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVELS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS WHICH COULD BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL WAS $3.0 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANYS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES HAVE PAID THEIR PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF $4.2 BILLION, INCLUDING $1.2 BILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS APPROVED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS. IN 2007, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS WHICH

COULD BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL WAS $2.5 BILLION. $2.9 BILLION WAS PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES, INCLUDING $400 MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS APPROVED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY

$865 MILLION OF THE COMPANYS $21.6 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND WAS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

THE COMPANYS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES HAD AGGREGATE STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY

MORE THAN THE AGGREGATE MINIMUM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

UNDER ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM). THE OBJECTIVES OF THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ARE

TO OPTIMIZE THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND COST OF CAPITAL THEREBY IMPROVING RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS, AS WELL AS TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES. DURING

2008, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 72 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $37 PER SHARE AND AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO

PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 103 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK.

12.    SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANYS 2002 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (PLAN), AS AMENDED AND RESTATED MAY 15, 2002, IS INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, OFFER THEM INCENTIVES TO PUT FORTH MAXIMUM EFFORTS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND AFFORD THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE A PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE COMPANY. THE PLAN ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO

GRANT STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS OR OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. THE PLAN INCORPORATES THE FOLLOWING PRIOR PLANS: 1991 STOCK

AND INCENTIVE PLAN, 1998 BROAD-BASED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN. ALL OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER AWARDS ISSUED UNDER THE PRIOR PLANS SHALL REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

THESE PLANS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ISSUED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 58.7 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS

OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS UNDER ITS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCENTIVE OR NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), AND UP TO 20.8 MILLION OF AWARDS IN RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (COLLECTIVELY, RESTRICTED SHARES). THE COMPANYS EXISTING SHARE-BASED AWARDS CONSIST MAINLY OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, SARS AND RESTRICTED SHARES.

TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH

AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL. FOR PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND SAR GRANTS, THE COMPANY USES A BINOMIAL MODEL. THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS THE COMPANY

USED IN APPLYING THE OPTION-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS BASED ON U.S. TREASURY YIELDS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF GRANT. EXPECTED VOLATILITIES

ARE BASED ON THE IMPLIED VOLATILITIES FROM TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OPTION AND SAR EXERCISES AND FORFEITURES

WITHIN THE VALUATION MODEL. THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OPTIONS AND SARS GRANTED REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE AWARDS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING BASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE PATTERNS.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS GRANTED FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $9 PER SHARE, $14 PER SHARE AND $11 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. THE

TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS EXERCISED DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $244 MILLION, $1.1 BILLION AND $753 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTED SHARES

RESTRICTED SHARES GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER TWO TO FIVE YEARS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED SHARES

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (ESPP) IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE EMPLOYEE COMMITMENT TO THE GOALS OF THE COMPANY, BY PROVIDING A MEANS OF ACHIEVING STOCK OWNERSHIP AT ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO

PURCHASE THE COMPANYS STOCK AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE, WHICH IS 85% OF THE LOWER MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT THE BEGINNING OR AT THE END OF THE SIX-MONTH PURCHASE PERIOD. DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006, 2.9 MILLION SHARES,

1.9 MILLION SHARES AND 1.9 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, WERE PURCHASED UNDER THE ESPP. THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED AND DISCUSSED BELOW. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THERE WERE 13.1 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE ESPP.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, SARS AND RESTRICTED SHARES, ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED

SERVICE PERIOD (GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD) OF THE AWARD, OR TO AN EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT DATE UNDER THE AWARD AGREEMENT, IF EARLIER. FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006 THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO ITS SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS OF $305 MILLION ($202 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS), $505 MILLION ($325 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS) AND $404 MILLION ($259 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS), RESPECTIVELY. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED WITHIN OPERATING

COSTS IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. SHARE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR 2006 INCLUDED $31 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASH SETTLEMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS EXPIRING OR FORFEITING DURING THE PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

THERE WAS $518 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO SHARE AWARDS THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 1.5 YEARS. FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006 THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM

SHARE-BASED AWARD EXERCISES WAS $106 MILLION, $399 MILLION AND $287 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED IN THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS $176 MILLION ($112 MILLION NET OF TAX BENEFIT) OF EXPENSES RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 RELATED TO APPLICATION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION RULES UNDER SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (SECTION

409A) TO THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. AS PART OF ITS REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER

EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME OF GRANT WERE GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE THAT WAS LOWER THAN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENT DATE, SUBJECTING THESE INDIVIDUALS TO ADDITIONAL TAX UNDER

SECTION 409A. THE COMPANY ELECTED TO PAY THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR THE ADDITIONAL TAX COSTS RELATING TO SUCH STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED IN 2006 AND EARLY 2007. FOR ANY OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TAX UNDER SECTION 409A THAT

WERE GRANTED TO NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE EXERCISE PRICE AND COMMITTED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THESE OPTIONHOLDERS FOR THEIR VESTED OPTIONS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL STOCK OPTION PRICE AND THE

REVISED INCREASED STOCK OPTION PRICE. THE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS UPON VESTING OF THE APPLICABLE AWARDS. THE FIRST PAYMENT OF $110 MILLION WAS MADE TO OPTIONHOLDERS IN JANUARY 2008 FOR OPTIONS THAT VESTED THROUGH DECEMBER 31,

2007. PAYMENTS OF $6 MILLION WERE MADE TO OPTIONHOLDERS IN 2008 FOR OPTIONS THAT VESTED THROUGH OCTOBER 31, 2008. PAYMENTS OF $20 MILLION WERE MADE TO OPTIONHOLDERS IN JANUARY 2009 FOR OPTIONS THAT VESTED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2008.

AGGREGATE FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL BE $7 MILLION, ASSUMING ALL APPLICABLE OPTIONS VEST DURING 2009. IF THE MODIFIED STOCK OPTIONS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY EXERCISED, THE COMPANY WILL RECOVER THESE CASH PAYMENTS AT THAT TIME FROM EXERCISE PROCEEDS AT THE REVISED

INCREASED STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PRICES.

THE $176 MILLION SECTION 409A CHARGE INCLUDES $87 MILLION OF EXPENSE ($55 MILLION NET OF TAX BENEFIT) FOR THE

PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPTIONHOLDERS TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED IN 2006 AND EARLY 2007 AND $89 MILLION OF EXPENSE ($57 MILLION NET OF TAX BENEFIT) FOR THE MODIFICATION RELATED TO INCREASING THE EXERCISE PRICE OF UNEXERCISED STOCK

OPTIONS GRANTED TO NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES AND THE RELATED CASH PAYMENTS. THESE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT.

AS FURTHER

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ARE TO OPTIMIZE THE COMPANYS CAPITAL STRUCTURE, COST OF CAPITAL AND RETURN

TO SHAREHOLDERS, AS WELL AS TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF SHARES ISSUED FOR SHARE-BASED AWARD EXERCISES.

OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 401(K) PLAN FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THIS PLAN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFITS (SERPS), WHICH ARE NON-QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS, FOR ITS CURRENT CEO AND

ITS FORMER CEO, AS WELL AS FOR CERTAIN NONEXECUTIVE OFFICERS UNDER PLANS THAT WERE ASSUMED IN ACQUISITIONS. NO ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS ARE ACCRUING TO THE SERPS OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT CEO AND FORMER CEO. THE SERPS ARE NON-CONTRIBUTORY, UNFUNDED

AND PROVIDE BENEFITS BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND COMPENSATION DURING EMPLOYMENT. PENSION EXPENSE IS DETERMINED USING VARIOUS ACTUARIAL METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL BENEFITS ULTIMATELY PAYABLE TO EXECUTIVES, AND IS ALLOCATED TO SERVICE PERIODS.

THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE PENSION COSTS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY. PENSION EXPENSE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006. THE TOTAL SERP LIABILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS $159 MILLION, OF WHICH $51 MILLION WAS

RECORDED WITHIN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND $108 MILLION WAS RECORDED WITHIN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE TOTAL SERP LIABILITY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 OF $139 MILLION WAS RECORDED WITHIN OTHER

LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NON-QUALIFIED, UNFUNDED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS, WHICH ALLOW

CERTAIN MEMBERS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVES TO DEFER PORTIONS OF THEIR SALARY OR BONUS AND RECEIVE CERTAIN COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS ON SUCH DEFERRALS, SUBJECT TO PLAN LIMITATIONS. THE DEFERRALS ARE RECORDED WITHIN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH AN

APPROXIMATELY EQUAL AMOUNT IN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE TOTAL DEFERRALS ARE DISTRIBUTABLE BASED UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER PERIODS, AS ELECTED UNDER EACH PLAN AND ARE $182 MILLION AND $225 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

13.    AARP

THE COMPANY PROVIDES HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF AARP UNDER A SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), AND SEPARATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND MEDICARE PART D ARRANGEMENTS. THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER THE PROGRAM INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICARE BENEFITS (AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE), HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE, INCLUDING INSURANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN 50 TO 64 YEARS OF AGE, AND OTHER RELATED PRODUCTS.

ON OCTOBER 3, 2007, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, THAT AMENDED ITS EXISTING AARP ARRANGEMENTS.

THESE AGREEMENTS EXTENDED THE COMPANYS ARRANGEMENTS WITH AARP ON THE PROGRAM TO DECEMBER 31, 2017, EXTENDED THE COMPANYS ARRANGEMENT WITH AARP ON THE MEDICARE PART D BUSINESS TO DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND GAVE THE COMPANY AN

EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE THE AARP BRAND ON THE COMPANYS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OFFERINGS UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2014, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCLUSIONS.

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(CONTINUED)

UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY IS COMPENSATED FOR TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND OTHER SERVICES, AS WELL AS FOR ASSUMING

UNDERWRITING RISK. THE COMPANY IS ALSO ENGAGED IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO COMPLEMENT THE INSURANCE OFFERINGS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM THE COMPANYS PORTION OF THE PROGRAM WERE APPROXIMATELY $5.7 BILLION IN 2008, $5.3 BILLION IN 2007 AND

$5.0 BILLION IN 2006.

THE COMPANYS AGREEMENT WITH AARP ON THE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF) THAT IS HELD

BY THE COMPANY ON BEHALF OF POLICYHOLDERS. UNDERWRITING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE BUSINESS ARE DIRECTLY RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS

ARE PREMIUM REVENUE, MEDICAL COSTS, INVESTMENT INCOME, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, MEMBER SERVICE EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. UNDERWRITING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF AND ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL

BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS, UNLESS CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES WERE TO EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF. TO THE EXTENT UNDERWRITING LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, LOSSES WOULD BE BORNE BY THE COMPANY. DEFICITS MAY BE RECOVERED BY UNDERWRITING

GAINS IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FUND ANY UNDERWRITING DEFICITS. THE RSF BALANCE IS REPORTED IN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CHANGES IN THE RSF ARE REPORTED IN

MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. IN JANUARY 2008, $127 MILLION IN CASH WAS TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE RSF TO AN EXTERNAL INSURANCE ENTITY THAT OFFERS AN AARP BRANDED AGE 50 TO 64 COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE PRODUCT. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THE RSF BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER POTENTIAL FUTURE UNDERWRITING AND OTHER RISKS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT.

THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF BALANCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF SUCH

CHANGES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

UNDER THE COMPANYS AGREEMENT WITH AARP, THE COMPANY SEPARATELY MANAGES THE ASSETS THAT SUPPORT

THE PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE HELD AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT THE COMPANYS DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED BY THE PROGRAM AND ARE USED TO PAY

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF INVESTMENT RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND UPON ANY TRANSFER OF THE PROGRAM TO ANOTHER ENTITY, THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSFER CASH IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF AND, THUS, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS EARNINGS.

INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO THE AARP RSF AND WERE $82 MILLION, $108 MILLION AND $94 MILLION IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 159 ON JANUARY 1, 2008, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO MEASURE THE ENTIRETY OF THE AARP ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ON A FAIR VALUE BASIS. THE ADOPTION

IMPACT WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY.

RECEIVED A DOCUMENT REQUEST FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ITS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND OTHER COMPENSATION FOR THE PERSONS WHO FROM 2003 TO MAY 2006 WERE THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE

COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WOULD NO LONGER QUALIFY AS DEDUCTIBLE PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 162(M) (SECTION 162(M)) AS A RESULT OF THE REVISION OF MEASUREMENT DATES THAT OCCURRED AS

, SEEKING A PROTECTIVE ORDER, WHICH WAS DENIED. THE COMPANY APPEALED THE DENIAL OF THE

PROTECTIVE ORDER TO THE MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS. ON DECEMBER 4, 2007, THE MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS ACKNOWLEDGED LIMITATIONS ON THE MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERALS AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND, BUT AFFIRMED THE DENIAL

OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER. ON FEBRUARY 27, 2008, THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO REVIEW THE MATTER, AND THE COMPANY HAS SINCE PRODUCED RELEVANT AND RESPONSIVE MATERIALS.

MDL LITIGATION.

BEGINNING IN 1999, A SERIES OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED

AGAINST THE COMPANY BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ALLEGING VARIOUS CLAIMS RELATING TO THE COMPANYS REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES, INCLUDING ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED CORRUPT ORGANIZATION ACT (RICO) AND STATE PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND

BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS. MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN A MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF FLORIDA (MDL). IN THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT, THE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS OF HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS FOR CERTAIN OF THE RICO CLAIMS. IN 2006, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED ALL OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT, AND THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS LATER AFFIRMED THAT DISMISSAL, LEAVING ELEVEN RELATED LAWSUITS

THAT HAD BEEN STAYED DURING THE LITIGATION OF THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT. IN AUGUST 2008, THE TRIAL COURT, APPLYING ITS RULINGS IN THE LEAD MDL LAWSUIT, DISMISSED SEVEN OF THE 11 RELATED LAWSUITS, AND ALL BUT ONE CLAIM IN AN EIGHTH LAWSUIT. THE PLAINTIFFS

REMAINING LAWSUITS. IN LATE 2008, A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE JUDGE RECOMMENDED THAT THE TRIAL COURT DENY THE PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS TO REMAND TO STATE COURT THE REMAINING TWO LAWSUITS. ON JANUARY 23, 2009, THE TRIAL COURT ADOPTED THIS

RECOMMENDATION WITH RESPECT TO ONE OF THE LAWSUITS. THE TRIAL COURT HAS NOT YET ISSUED AN ORDER WITH RESPECT TO THE FINAL LAWSUIT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS PARTY TO A NUMBER OF ARBITRATIONS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS INVOLVING SIMILAR CLAIMS. THE

COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING AGAINST THE REMAINING CLAIMS IN THESE CASES.

AMA LITIGATION.

ON MARCH 15, 2000, A GROUP OF PLAINTIFFS

INCLUDING THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (AMA) FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN STATE COURT IN NEW YORK, WHICH WAS REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT. THE COMPLAINT AND SUBSEQUENT AMENDED COMPLAINTS ASSERTED ANTITRUST CLAIMS AND CLAIMS BASED ON ERISA,

AS WELL AS BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES, AND TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK HEALTH CARE

PROVIDERS BY THE COMPANYS AFFILIATES. ON JANUARY 14, 2009, AFTER ALMOST NINE YEARS OF LITIGATION AND MANY RULINGS FROM THE COURT ON VARIOUS MOTIONS, THE PARTIES ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LAWSUIT, ALONG WITH A SIMILAR CASE FILED

IN 2008 IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW JERSEY. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATED ENTITIES WILL BE RELEASED FROM CLAIMS RELATING TO THEIR OUT-OF-NETWORK REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES FROM MARCH 15, 1994 THROUGH THE

DATE OF FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY WILL PAY A TOTAL OF $350 MILLION TO FUND THE SETTLEMENT FOR HEALTH PLAN MEMBERS AND OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS IN CONNECTION WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK PROCEDURES PERFORMED SINCE MARCH 15,

1994. THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS SUBJECT TO PRELIMINARY AND FINAL COURT APPROVAL. IN ADDITION, THE

NYAG INVESTIGATION.

ON FEBRUARY 13, 2008, THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (NYAG) ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS CONDUCTING AN

INDUSTRY-WIDE INVESTIGATION INTO OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES OF HEALTH INSURERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, AND SERVED THE COMPANY WITH A NOTICE OF INTENT TO INITIATE LITIGATION. ON JANUARY 13, 2009, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAD

REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NYAG REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL PAY $50 MILLION TO FUND A NOT-FOR-PROFIT ENTITY TO DEVELOP AND OWN A NEW, INDEPENDENT DATABASE PRODUCT TO REPLACE THE PREVAILING

HEALTH CHARGES SYSTEM (PHCS) AND MEDICAL DATA RESEARCH (MDR) DATABASE PRODUCTS OWNED BY THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY INGENIX, INC. BOTH PRODUCTS ARE USED BY A NUMBER OF HEALTH PLANS AND EMPLOYERS AS TOOLS THAT HELP DETERMINE THE AMOUNT TO REIMBURSE

MEMBERS WHO RECEIVE PHYSICIAN SERVICES OUTSIDE THEIR MANAGED CARE NETWORKS. WHEN THE NEW DATABASE PRODUCT IS READY, THE COMPANY WILL CEASE USING THE PHCS AND MDR DATABASES AND WILL USE THE NEW DATABASE FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST FIVE YEARS IN

CONNECTION WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK REIMBURSEMENT IN THOSE BENEFIT PLANS THAT EMPLOY A REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY STANDARD FOR OUT OF NETWORK REIMBURSEMENTS.

ON JANUARY 16, 2009, A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND COMPANY SUBSIDIARY PACIFICARE

ALLEGED CLAIMS PROCESSING AND PAYMENT REGULATORY VIOLATIONS, INCLUDING VIOLATIONS ALLEGEDLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION OF PACIFICARE. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED MONEY DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS, AND ATTORNEYS

FEES. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THIS LAWSUIT.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT

CHANGE. BROAD LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS. STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES AS THE SUBJECT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND RULES COULD FORCE US TO

CHANGE HOW THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE THE COMPANYS HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE THE COMPANYS LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR

COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. FURTHER, THE COMPANY MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AND IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND

HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE

IRS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2007, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE EXAMINED THE

COMPANYS PACIFICARE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN IN CALIFORNIA. THE EXAMINATION FINDINGS RELATED TO CLAIMS PROCESSING ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS; ACCURATE AND TIMELY INTEREST PAYMENTS; TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF PROVIDER CONTRACTS; TIMELY, ACCURATE

PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION; AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS. TO DATE, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS NOT LEVIED A FINANCIAL PENALTY RELATED TO ITS FINDINGS. THE COMPANY IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES

ARISING FROM THE FINDINGS OF ITS EXAMINATION.

OTHER EXAMPLES OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDE AN INVESTIGATION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OF THE

COMPANYS ADMINISTRATION OF ITS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WITH RESPECT TO ERISA COMPLIANCE AND AUDITS OF THE COMPANYS MEDICARE HEALTH PLANS TO VALIDATE THE CODING PRACTICES OF AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MAINTAINED BY ITS CARE PROVIDERS.

SUCH GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR

EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE CODING AUDITS MAY RESULT IN RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO HEALTH PLANS PURSUANT

TO CMS MEDICARE CONTRACTS.

16.    SEGMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION

FACTORS USED IN DETERMINING THE COMPANYS REPORTING SEGMENTS INCLUDE THE NATURE OF OPERATING ACTIVITIES, ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, EXISTENCE OF SEPARATE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND THE TYPE OF INFORMATION

PRESENTED TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION-MAKER TO EVALUATE ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR REPORTING

SEGMENT OPERATIONS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (SEE NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN REPORTING SEGMENTS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF SALES OF PHARMACY

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS ARE HELD AND OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN

THE UNITED STATES, REPORTING SEGMENTS WITH SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS MAY BE COMBINED. THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE, OVATIONS AND AMERICHOICE HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED IN THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT COLUMN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES

BECAUSE THESE BUSINESSES HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND HAVE SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TYPES OF CUSTOMERS, DISTRIBUTION METHODS AND OPERATIONAL PROCESSES, AND OPERATE IN A SIMILAR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. THESE BUSINESSES ALSO SHARE

SIGNIFICANT COMMON ASSETS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER RESOURCES.

AND PROCEDURES

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT) THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR SUBMITS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS (I) RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED

WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN SEC RULES AND FORMS; AND (II) ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY

DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, MANAGEMENT EVALUATED, UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE

PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION,

THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES

13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT

AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN MAKING THIS

ASSESSMENT, WE USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT AND THOSE CRITERIA, WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE INTERNAL CONTROLS OF SIERRA HEALTH SERVICES, INC. (SIERRA) AND UNISON HEALTH PLANS (UNISON) WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY ON FEBRUARY 25, 2008 AND

MAY 30, 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM THE DATES OF ACQUISITION THROUGH YEAR END. SUCH EXCLUSION WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

GUIDANCE THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF A RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY BE OMITTED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE YEAR OF ACQUISITION. NET AND TOTAL ASSETS OF SIERRA REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 1% AND 6%,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED NET AND TOTAL ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND APPROXIMATELY 2% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND APPROXIMATELY 4% OF NET EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR THEN ENDED. NET AND TOTAL ASSETS OF UNISON

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 0% AND 2%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED NET AND TOTAL ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, AND APPROXIMATELY 1% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND NET EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR THEN ENDED.

CHANGES TO CERTAIN PROCESSES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF INTERNAL CONTROL RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF SIERRA AND UNISON MAY OCCUR AND

WILL BE EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT AS SUCH INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES ARE IMPLEMENTED.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. AS DESCRIBED IN REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008,

MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED FROM ITS ASSESSMENT THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT SIERRA HEALTH SERVICES, INC. (SIERRA) AND UNISON HEALTH PLANS (UNISON), WHICH WERE ACQUIRED ON FEBRUARY 25, 2008 AND MAY 30, 2008, RESPECTIVELY, AND

WHOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 1% AND 8% OF NET AND TOTAL ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY, APPROXIMATELY 3% OF REVENUES, AND APPROXIMATELY 5% OF NET INCOME OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008. ACCORDINGLY, OUR AUDIT DID NOT INCLUDE THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT SIERRA OR UNISON. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL

FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE

OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.
