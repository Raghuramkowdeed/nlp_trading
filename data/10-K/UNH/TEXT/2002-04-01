BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP IS A LEADER IN THE HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING INDUSTRY, SERVING MORE THAN 38 MILLION

AMERICANS. THROUGH OUR FAMILY OF BUSINESSES, WE COMBINE CLINICAL

INSIGHT WITH CONSUMER-FRIENDLY SERVICES AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE OPTIMAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING THROUGH ALL

STAGES OF LIFE. OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM PREMIUM REVENUES

ON INSURED (RISK-BASED) PRODUCTS, FEES FROM MANAGEMENT,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND CONSULTING SERVICES, AND INVESTMENT AND OTHER

INCOME. WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS PRIMARILY THROUGH OPERATING

DIVISIONS IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.



UNIPRISE;

	



HEALTH CARE SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR

	UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND OVATIONS BUSINESSES;

	



SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES; AND

	



INGENIX.

	

WHILE SEPARATE, OUR BUSINESSES REMAIN

INTERRELATED AS PART OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING ENTERPRISE.

OUR BUSINESSES SHARE CUSTOMERS, AND IN MOST INSTANCES, USE

COMMON INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SHARE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS BY SEGMENT SEE ITEM 7

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED IS A MINNESOTA

CORPORATION INCORPORATED IN JANUARY 1977. THE TERMS

WE, OUR OR THE COMPANY REFER

TO UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. OUR

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

UNIPRISE

UNIPRISE SERVES THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT NEEDS OF

LARGE ORGANIZATIONS BY DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICE-DRIVEN

SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EACH CORPORATE

CUSTOMER. UNIPRISE OFFERS CONSUMERS ACCESS TO A WIDE SPECTRUM OF

HEALTH AND WELL-BEING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. TOGETHER WITH ITS

AFFILIATES, UNIPRISES CORE BUSINESS PROVIDES

COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED HEALTH BENEFIT SERVICES TO

MULTI-LOCATION EMPLOYERS WITH MORE THAN 5,000 EMPLOYEES,

SPECIALIZING IN LARGE VOLUME TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT, LARGE-SCALE

BENEFIT DESIGN, CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATION FOR

LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS

DESIGNED TO MANAGE AND CONTROL MEDICAL CARE COSTS, FACILITATE

DELIVERY OF CARE, AND TRANSFORM COMPLEX ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES

INTO SIMPLER, EFFICIENT, HIGH QUALITY AUTOMATED PROCESSES.

UNIPRISE IS THE BUSINESS THROUGH WHICH LARGE EMPLOYERS CAN

ACCESS NOT ONLY UNIPRISE SERVICES, BUT ALSO ALL OF UNITEDHEALTH

GROUPS PROVIDER-BASED MEDICAL, INSURANCE AND SPECIALTY

SERVICES, WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, UNIPRISE PROVIDED SERVICES TO NEARLY

300 CLIENTS, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MILLION

INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 150 OF THE FORTUNE 500

COMPANIES.

UNIPRISE ALSO OFFERS HUMAN RESOURCES AND BENEFIT

ADMINISTRATION OUTSOURCING SERVICES TO LARGE ORGANIZATIONS,

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CALL CENTER SERVICES, ENROLLMENT

SERVICES, AND DEFINED HEALTH BENEFIT AND CONTRIBUTION PLAN

SUPPORT SERVICES. UNIPRISE PROVIDES CLAIM AND CUSTOMER SERVICES

AND TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS FOR SIX INDEPENDENT, OR

UNAFFILIATED, NON-UNITEDHEALTHCARE HEALTH PLANS, WHICH SERVE

APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION INDIVIDUALS.

WE BELIEVE THAT INTERNET TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED A

NEW CHANNEL FOR PROVIDING HEALTH INFORMATION AND TRANSACTION

SERVICES TO CONSUMERS, ENROLLEES, PHYSICIANS AND EMPLOYERS.

UNIPRISE HAS DEVELOPED INDUSTRY

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEADING INTERNET APPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICIAN

INQUIRIES AND TRANSACTIONS, CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC DATA ANALYSIS FOR

EMPLOYERS, AND CONSUMER ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION AND

SERVICE APPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THESE APPLICATIONS

GIVES EMPLOYERS INSTANT, REAL-TIME, ONLINE ACCESS TO ADD, UPDATE

OR VERIFY EMPLOYEE BENEFITS INFORMATION AT ANY TIME. ANOTHER

APPLICATION ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO MAKE REAL-TIME INQUIRIES INTO

THE STATUS AND HISTORY OF THEIR HEALTH CLAIMS, TO VIEW AND

SEARCH FOR CARE PROVIDERS THROUGH AN ON-LINE PROVIDER DIRECTORY,

TO VIEW ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION AND TO ACCESS HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING INFORMATION TAILORED TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND

INTERESTS.

HEALTH CARE SERVICES

OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE

UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND OVATIONS BUSINESSES.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE

UNITEDHEALTHCARE COORDINATES HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING SERVICES ON BEHALF OF LOCAL EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMERS

NATIONWIDE. UNITEDHEALTHCARES PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY

MARKETED TO SMALL AND MID-SIZE EMPLOYERS WITH UP TO

5,000 EMPLOYEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THIS

BUSINESS SERVED APPROXIMATELY 7.6 MILLION INDIVIDUALS. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, UNITEDHEALTHCARE ALSO SERVED

APPROXIMATELY 345,000 MEDICARE INDIVIDUALS IN 10 STATES

WITH MEDICARE+CHOICE PRODUCTS AND APPROXIMATELY

640,000 MEDICAID ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN 11 STATES.

WITH SOME OF THESE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, UNITEDHEALTHCARE ASSUMES

THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR ITS

MEMBERS IN RETURN FOR PREMIUM REVENUE. UNITEDHEALTHCARE OFFERS

ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE USUALLY LICENSED AS

HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS (HMOS), PREFERRED

PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS (PPOS) OR INSURERS, DEPENDING

UPON STATE REGULATIONS. IT ALSO PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE AND

OTHER MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO HEALTH PLANS AND SELF-FUNDED

CUSTOMERS FOR WHICH UNITEDHEALTHCARE RECEIVES A FEE, AS IT DOES

NOT ASSUME THE RISK OF HEALTH CARE COSTS.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE ARRANGES FOR ACCESS TO CARE

THROUGH MORE THAN 360,000 PHYSICIANS AND 3,100 HOSPITALS ACROSS

THE UNITED STATES. THE CONSOLIDATED PURCHASING POWER REPRESENTED

BY THE INDIVIDUALS UNITEDHEALTHCARE SERVES MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR

UNITEDHEALTHCARE TO CONTRACT FOR COST-EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO A

LARGE NUMBER OF CONVENIENTLY LOCATED CARE PROVIDERS. THROUGH ITS

FAMILY OF COMPANIES, UNITEDHEALTHCARE OFFERS.



A BROAD RANGE OF BENEFIT PLANS INTEGRATING

	MEDICAL, ANCILLARY AND ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS SO CUSTOMERS CAN

	CHOOSE WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THEM;

	



ACCESS TO BROAD AND DIVERSE NUMBERS OF HEALTH

	CARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING BENEFIT PLANS THAT GIVE CUSTOMERS

	DIRECT ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS WITHOUT OBTAINING REFERRALS;

	



INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT FACILITATE INTEGRATED

	CARE DELIVERY;

	



CONVENIENT SELF-SERVICE FOR CUSTOMER

	TRANSACTIONS, PHARMACY SERVICES AND HEALTH INFORMATION;

	



CLINICAL INFORMATION THAT PHYSICIANS CAN USE IN

	WORKING WITH THEIR PATIENTS;

	



SIMPLIFIED ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS;

	AND

	



ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF

	MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

	

WE BELIEVE THAT UNITEDHEALTHCARES HISTORY

OF INNOVATION DISTINGUISHES ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS FROM THE

COMPETITION. UNITEDHEALTHCARE DESIGNS CONSUMER-ORIENTED HEALTH

BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT VALUE INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND CONTROL

IN ACCESSING HEALTH CARE. ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO MAKE IT EASIER

FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED, WHEN THEY NEED IT.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE HAS PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION;

ADMISSION COUNSELING BEFORE HOSPITAL STAYS; CARE ADVOCACY TO

HELP AVOID DELAYS IN PATIENTS STAYS IN THE HOSPITAL;

SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF NEEDING INTENSIVE TREATMENT;

CONTINUOUS COORDINATION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS; AND

PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANAGEMENT, WHICH PROMOTES SAFE USE OF

MEDICATIONS. WE WANT CONSUMERS TO BE ENGAGED AND ACTIVE

PARTICIPANTS IN MANAGING THEIR OWN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. FOR

EXAMPLE, UNITEDHEALTHCARES MULTI-LAYERED PHARMACY BENEFIT

PROGRAM PROVIDES ACCESS TO A WIDE RANGE OF GENERIC AND

BRAND-NAME DRUGS. INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO USE GENERIC DRUGS

PAY LESS, WHILE THOSE WHO

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PREFER TO USE BRAND-NAME DRUGS PAY MORE. OUR

AGREEMENT WITH MERCK MEDCO MANAGED CARE L.L.C. IS AN IMPORTANT

PART OF THIS PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, UNITEDHEALTHCARE WAS AN EARLY

LEADER IN OFFERING OPEN ACCESS PRODUCTS, WHICH ALLOW INDIVIDUALS

TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS DIRECTLY WITH SPECIALISTS WITHOUT A

REFERRAL FROM A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. FURTHER,

UNITEDHEALTHCARE OFFERS WEB SITES THAT ENABLE ACCESS TO A

VARIETY OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING A DIRECTORY OF NETWORK

PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS, REPORTS ON THOUSANDS OF HEALTH TOPICS

AND A HEALTH PROFILE TAILORED TO INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS.

OVATIONS

RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP TO INCLUDE AARP PHARMACY SERVICES, THE

COUNTRYS LARGEST PHARMACY DISCOUNT CARD PROGRAM, OFFERING

EXPANSION AND DIVESTITURE OF

OPERATIONS

WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES

AND, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, OFTEN CONSIDER WHETHER TO

SELL CERTAIN BUSINESSES OR STOP OFFERING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES. EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES MAY INCLUDE ACQUIRING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS.

DURING 2001, WE COMPLETED SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS AND CEASED

OFFERING SOME PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS, ALL AS PART OF OUR

ONGOING EMPHASIS ON OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS. FURTHER, WE DEVOTE

SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES IN THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SECTOR AS WE HAVE BROADLY

DEFINED IT.

IF WE WERE TO MAKE ANY PARTICULAR ACQUISITION, IT

MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE AND MANAGE OUR OVERALL

BUSINESS EFFECTIVELY. INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES RELATING TO

ACQUISITIONS MAY INCREASE COSTS, AFFECT REVENUE AND EARNINGS

GROWTH AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE

HEAVILY REGULATED. THIS REGULATION CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY

AGENCIES GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND

INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING CONSIDERED, AND THE

INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE

PERIODICALLY. THESE REVISIONS COULD AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS. ENACTMENT OF FEDERAL AND STATE HEALTH BENEFIT

LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. EXAMPLES OF

SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDE: HEALTH PLAN LIABILITY LAWS;

PHYSICIAN AND PROVIDER PROMPT PAY LAWS; DATA PRIVACY; MANDATED

BENEFITS; LIMITS ON CONTRACTUAL TERMS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING AUDIT, PAYMENT AND TERMINATION

PROVISIONS; IMPLEMENTATION OF A MANDATORY THIRD PARTY REVIEW

PROCESS FOR COVERAGE DENIALS; AND OTHER LAWS AND LIMITS ON

UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO CARVE

OUT CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF RISK, SUCH AS ACTS OF TERRORISM.

FURTHER, AS OUR BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THEIR

E-COMMERCE INITIATIVES, UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE REGULATORY

AUTHORITY AND REQUIREMENTS IN THIS AREA WILL MAKE COMPLIANCE AN

IMPORTANT FOCUS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FEDERAL PROGRAMS

OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT, WHICH INCLUDES

UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND OVATIONS, HAS MEDICARE+CHOICE CONTRACTS

THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

SERVICES (CMS). CMS HAS THE RIGHT TO AUDIT SUCH

HEALTH PLANS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE EACH PLANS COMPLIANCE

WITH CMS CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE

BEING GIVEN TO MEMBERS. THE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF REGULATIONS

SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID MAKES COMPLIANCE IN THIS

PRODUCT LINE A CONTINUING CHALLENGE. OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES

SEGMENT ALSO HAS MEDICAID AND STATE CHILDRENS HEALTH

INSURANCE PROGRAM CONTRACTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND

STATE REGULATION REGARDING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID

ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF

THESE PROGRAMS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS WITH THESE REGULATIONS.

STATE REGULATION

ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER

INSURANCE AND HMO PRODUCTS REGULATE THE ACTIVITIES OF THOSE

PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. MOST STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL

REPORTS AND IMPOSE MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH RESERVE

REQUIREMENTS. MANY OF UNITEDHEALTHCARES HEALTH PLANS AND

EACH OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED UNDER STATE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS

GENERALLY REQUIRE REGISTRATION WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF

INSURANCE AND THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CERTAIN INTER-COMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR

REGULATORY APPROVAL OR, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, PRIOR NOTICE OF

ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTER-COMPANY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS

WELL AS TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE REGULATED COMPANIES AND THEIR

PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES OR AFFILIATES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES OR PRODUCTS MAY BY SUBJECT TO PPO, MANAGED CARE

ORGANIZATION (MCO) OR THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR

(TPA) RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE

REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER GREATLY FROM STATE TO

STATE, BUT GENERALLY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING, FINANCIAL AND

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. MANY STATES ALSO HAVE ENACTED LAWS

AND/OR ADOPTED REGULATIONS GOVERNING UTILIZATION REVIEW AND

EXTERNAL APPEALS ACTIVITIES, AND THESE LAWS MAY APPLY TO SOME OF

OUR OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES, PROMPT

PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, CONFIDENTIALITY OF CONSUMER HEALTH

INFORMATION AND COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES. TO DATE, THESE

VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996

(HIPAA) APPLY TO BOTH THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL

HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING SELF-FUNDED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

PLANS. COVERED ENTITIES MUST BE COMPLIANT WITH STANDARDS FOR

ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND CODE SETS BY OCTOBER 2002, AND WITH

STANDARDS FOR PRIVACY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION BY APRIL

2003. NEW STANDARDS FOR HEALTH INFORMATION SECURITY AND NATIONAL

PROVIDER AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFIERS ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED

BY REGULATORS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES TO COMPLY WITH THESE STANDARDS. WE PLAN TO BE IN

MATERIAL COMPLIANCE BY THE ENFORCEMENT DATES; HOWEVER, THE LAW

IS FAR-REACHING AND COMPLEX AND THE GOVERNMENTS DELAY IN

PROVIDING GUIDANCE MAY AFFECT THE TIMELINESS OF OUR COMPLIANCE

EFFORTS. ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HIPAAS

PROVISIONS AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES IN THE DIFFERENT

STATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO STANDARDIZE OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS STATE LINES.

ERISA

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF

1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), REGULATES HOW GOODS AND

SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A COMPLEX SET

OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

INTERPRETATION BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

(DOL) AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL COURTS. ERISA PLACES

CONTROLS ON HOW OUR BUSINESS UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH

EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS,

PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MAINTAIN SELF-FUNDED PLANS. NEW ERISA

CLAIM REGULATIONS, EFFECTIVE JULY 2002, REQUIRE CHANGES

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO OPERATIONS AND MAY LEAD TO INCREASED

LITIGATION ACTIVITY. WE PLAN TO BE IN MATERIAL COMPLIANCE WITH

THE NEW REGULATIONS BY THE ENFORCEMENT DATES.

FRAUD AND ABUSE

THE REGULATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO PARTICIPANTS IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ARE COMPLEX AND CHANGING.

WE HAVE RE-EMPHASIZED OUR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE EFFORTS FOR

THESE PROGRAMS, BUT ONGOING VIGOROUS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

HIGHLY TECHNICAL REGULATIONS MEAN THAT COMPLIANCE EFFORTS IN

THIS ARENA WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES.

ADDITIONALLY, STATES HAVE ALSO BEGUN TO FOCUS THEIR ANTI-FRAUD

EFFORTS ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE

ORGANIZATIONS. SOME STATES NOW REQUIRE FILING AND APPROVAL OF

ANTI-FRAUD PLANS AND MAY MONITOR COMPLIANCE AS PART OF ANY

MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION.

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS,

INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT

ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL

FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF

LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT

PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, A STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OR OTHER

STATE OR FEDERAL AUTHORITY (INCLUDING CMS, THE OFFICE OF THE

INSPECTOR GENERAL AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL) MAY FROM TIME TO

TIME BEGIN A SPECIAL AUDIT OF ONE OF OUR HEALTH PLANS, OUR

INSURANCE PLANS AND PRODUCTS OR ONE OF OUR OTHER OPERATIONS

REGARDING ISSUES SUCH AS UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT; FINANCIAL,

ELIGIBILITY OR OTHER DATA REPORTING; PROMPT CLAIMS PAYMENT; OR

COVERAGE OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE, INCLUDING EMERGENCY ROOM

CARE. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE,

REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS,

STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR

GENERAL AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY

OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS OR REVIEWS, INDIVIDUALLY

OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

OUR INGENIX AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE SEGMENTS BOTH

HAVE LIMITED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2001, INGENIX HAD PROVIDED SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS FOR TRIALS

OCCURRING IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES, AND UNITEDHEALTHCARES

INTERNATIONAL DIVISION OPERATED HEALTH COMPANIES OR OFFERED

CONSULTING SERVICES IN NINE MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEGAL AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING

VARIOUS TAX, TARIFF AND TRADE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS

EMPLOYMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INVESTMENT RULES AND LAWS.

MARKETING

OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IS DEFINED AND COORDINATED

BY EACH BUSINESS DEDICATED MARKETING STAFF. WITHIN THESE

SEGMENTS, PRIMARY MARKETING RESPONSIBILITY GENERALLY RESIDES

WITH A MARKETING LEADER AND A DIRECT SALES FORCE. IN ADDITION,

SEVERAL OF THE SEGMENTS ALSO RELY UPON INDEPENDENT INSURANCE

AGENTS AND BROKERS TO SELL SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS. MARKETING

EFFORTS ALSO INCLUDE PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORTS AND ADVERTISING

PROGRAMS THAT MAY USE TELEVISION, RADIO, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES,

BILLBOARDS, DIRECT MAIL AND TELEMARKETING.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES

COMPANY WITH A SCOPE THAT EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF

TRADITIONAL MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANAGED HEALTH CARE

COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHICH HAVE

FORMED NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS AND VARIOUS

INFORMATION AND CONSULTING COMPANIES. NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN

THESE MARKETS ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AFFECTING US AND THE SALES AND PRICING OF OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION, CONSUMER

SATISFACTION, THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

NETWORK CAPABILITIES, PRICE, MARKET SHARE, PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION

SYSTEMS, EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL STRENGTH

AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS INCLUDE

THE CUSTOMER FOCUS RESULTING FROM OUR OPERATIONAL REALIGNMENT.

EACH UNITEDHEALTH GROUP BUSINESS REPRESENTS A STRATEGIC PLATFORM

FROM WHICH WE CAN PENETRATE MORE DEEPLY INTO SPECIFIC MARKETS.

THESE BUSINESSES ARE ANCHORED IN A COMMON PURSUIT OF IMPROVED

HEALTH AND WELL BEING, EXPLOITING THREE CORE COMPETENCIES.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION AND SERVICE

INFRASTRUCTURE. OTHER STRENGTHS INCLUDE THE BREADTH AND QUALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE AND DIVERSITY, OUR

EFFECTIVE USE OF PROPRIETARY TOOLS AND PRODUCTS TO COORDINATE

AND FACILITATE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO REALIZE APPROPRIATELY LOWER

HEALTH CARE COSTS, OUR DISCIPLINED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING

PRACTICES AND STAFF, OUR SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITION IN CERTAIN

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THE STRENGTH OF OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, OUR

FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OUR GENERALLY LARGE PROVIDER NETWORKS THAT

PROVIDE MORE CONSUMER CHOICE AND MINIMIZE BARRIERS TO ACCESS OUR

POINT-OF-SERVICE PRODUCTS AND OUR STRONG MARKETPLACE REPUTATION.

HOWEVER, IN SOME MARKETS WE MAY BE AT A DISADVANTAGE FOR A

NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING COMPETITORS WITH MORE RESOURCES,

LONGER OPERATING HISTORIES, LARGER MARKET SHARES, BROADER

NETWORKS, NARROWER NETWORKS (WHICH MAY ALLOW GREATER COST

CONTROL AND LOWER PRICES) OR MORE ESTABLISHED NAMES AND

REPUTATIONS. THESE COMPETITIVE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, WE EMPLOYED

APPROXIMATELY 30,000 INDIVIDUALS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE GOOD.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K AND THE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER

SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE IN THIS DOCUMENT, INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM

ACT OF 1995 (THE PSLRA). WHEN USED IN THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN FUTURE FILINGS BY THE COMPANY

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN OUR PRESS

RELEASES, PRESENTATIONS TO SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, AND

IN ORAL STATEMENTS MADE BY OR WITH THE APPROVAL OF ONE OF OUR

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE WORDS OR PHRASES BELIEVES,

ANTICIPATES, INTENDS, WILL LIKELY

RESULT, ESTIMATES, PROJECTS OR

SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ANY OF THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE OUR

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED

IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS CERTAIN

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS THAT INVESTORS AND

OTHERS SHOULD CONSIDER. THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE

PSLRA. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS, IN MAKING THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS, WE ARE

NOT UNDERTAKING TO ADDRESS OR UPDATE EACH FACTOR IN FUTURE

FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATING

RESULTS, AND ARE NOT UNDERTAKING TO ADDRESS HOW ANY OF THESE

FACTORS MAY HAVE CAUSED RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM DISCUSSIONS OR

INFORMATION CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS. IN

ADDITION, ANY OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW MAY HAVE AFFECTED

OUR PAST, AS WELL AS CURRENT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT

FUTURE RESULTS. ANY OR ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS

REPORT, IN THE 2001 ANNUAL REPORT AND IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC

STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY TURN OUT TO BE WRONG. THEY CAN BE

AFFECTED BY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR BY KNOWN OR

UNKNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW

WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS. CONSEQUENTLY,

NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED. ACTUAL FUTURE

RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED IN OUR

COMMUNICATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HEALTH CARE COSTS

WE USE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO

PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OR SUPPLIES DELIVERED TO

OUR CUSTOMERS. TOTAL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE

NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH

SERVICE. MUCH OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUE IS PRICED BEFORE SERVICES

ARE DELIVERED AND THE RELATED COSTS ARE INCURRED, USUALLY ON A

PROSPECTIVE ANNUAL BASIS. ALTHOUGH WE BASE THE PREMIUMS WE

CHARGE ON OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS OVER THE

FIXED PREMIUM PERIOD, INFLATION, REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS

MAY CAUSE ACTUAL HEALTH CARE COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED

AND REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED

USE OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES,

CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY

TREATMENTS, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES,

INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE

REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS

INCURRED THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REPORTED TO US. BECAUSE OF THESE

ESTIMATES, OUR EARNINGS MAY BE ADJUSTED LATER TO REFLECT THE

ACTUAL COSTS. RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN MEDICAL COSTS AS A

PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES AND OUR ABILITY TO PROPERLY

ESTIMATE FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS OVER FIXED PREMIUM PERIODS CAN

CREATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS BECAUSE OF

THE RELATIVELY NARROW MARGINS OF OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

INDUSTRY FACTORS

THE MANAGED CARE INDUSTRY RECEIVES SIGNIFICANT

NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF LARGE JURY

AWARDS. THIS PUBLICITY HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY LITIGATION,

LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY, REGULATION AND GOVERNMENTAL REVIEW OF

INDUSTRY PRACTICES. THESE FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, MAY REQUIRE US TO

CHANGE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY INCREASE THE

REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE, FURTHER INCREASING

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

PROFITABILITY.

COMPETITION

IN MANY OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC OR PRODUCT MARKETS, WE

COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES, SOME OF WHICH MAY HAVE

CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OR CAPABILITIES THAT GIVE THEM A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE BELIEVE THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN THESE

MARKETS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL, SO THE ADDITION OF NEW COMPETITORS

CAN OCCUR RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CONSUMERS ENJOY SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING TO NEW PROVIDERS OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

SERVICES. CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DECIDE TO PERFORM FOR

THEMSELVES FUNCTIONS OR SERVICES WE PROVIDE, WHICH WOULD

DECREASE OUR REVENUES. CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS AND

OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MAY DECIDE TO MARKET PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN COMPETITION WITH US. IN ADDITION,

SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE

INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE AS WELL AS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ACT

AS SUPPLIERS TO US, SUCH AS THE HOSPITAL, PHYSICIAN,

PHARMACEUTICAL, MEDICAL DEVICE AND HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS

INDUSTRIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS STRONG COMPETITION OR

THAT COMPETITION INTENSIFIES IN ANY MARKET, OUR ABILITY TO

RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS OR CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, OR MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR REVENUE

GROWTH, PRICING FLEXIBILITY, CONTROL OVER MEDICAL COST TRENDS

AND MARKETING EXPENSES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AARP CONTRACT

UNDER OUR LONG-TERM CONTRACT WITH AARP, WE

PROVIDE MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND HOSPITAL INDEMNITY HEALTH

INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, OUR PORTION OF AARPS INSURANCE

PROGRAM REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION IN ANNUAL

NET PREMIUM REVENUE FROM APPROXIMATELY 3.5 MILLION AARP

MEMBERS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENT DEPENDS, IN PART,

ON OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE THESE CUSTOMERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

COMPETITIVELY, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATORY CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT

AARP OR ONE OF ITS OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS FOR ITS MEMBER

INSURANCE PROGRAM COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE SUCCESS OF

OUR ARRANGEMENT WITH AARP.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEDICARE OPERATIONS

IN RESPONSE TO MEDICAL COST INCREASES THAT

EXCEEDED MEDICARE PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT RATE GROWTH, WE HAVE

WITHDRAWN OUR MEDICARE+CHOICE PRODUCT OFFERINGS FROM A NUMBER OF

COUNTIES AND FILED SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS IN OTHER

COUNTIES. THESE AND OTHER ACTIONS HAVE REDUCED MEDICARE+CHOICE

ENROLLMENT AND MAY RESULT IN FURTHER WITHDRAWALS OF

MEDICARE+CHOICE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHEN AND AS PERMITTED BY OUR

CONTRACTS WITH THE CMS. WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM RE-ENTERING THE

COUNTIES FROM WHICH WE HAVE WITHDRAWN OUR MEDICARE+CHOICE

PRODUCT OFFERINGS UNTIL TWO YEARS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

WITHDRAWAL.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER MEDICARE+CHOICE

PRODUCTS IN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE MARKETS AND ARE EXPLORING

ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO SENIORS.

HOWEVER, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR MEDICARE+CHOICE OPERATIONS

DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE MEDICARE PROGRAM

REIMBURSEMENT INCREASES, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, BENEFIT DESIGN,

PHYSICIAN AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTING AND OTHER

FACTORS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR MEDICARE+CHOICE

OPERATIONS WILL BE PROFITABLE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND REGULATION

OUR BUSINESS IS HEAVILY REGULATED DOMESTICALLY AT

THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE

LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF

THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. BROAD

LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE

REGULATIONS. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND RULES COULD FORCE US TO

CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT

GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND

STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT

INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. WE MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN

REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. DELAYS IN

OBTAINING OR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE OR COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS. WE

PARTICIPATE IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE

COVERAGE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO

FREQUENT CHANGE, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT

OR PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEALTH CARE

COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. SUCH CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH

PROGRAMS IN THE PAST AND MAY ALSO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS

ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES. CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING PATIENTS

BILL OF RIGHTS LEGISLATION THAT, IF ADOPTED, COULD FUNDAMENTALLY

ALTER ERISAS TREATMENT OF LIABILITY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE,

FIDUCIARY BREACH OF CONTRACT AND IMPROPER BENEFIT COVERAGE

DENIALS. OTHER BILLS AND REGULATIONS AT STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS

MAY AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDING PHYSICIAN

AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTING, CLAIM PAYMENTS AND

PROCESSING, CONFIDENTIALITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION AND

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF

THESE INITIATIVES WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME BINDING LAW OR

REGULATION, OR IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS WILL BE, THEIR

ENACTMENT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO EXPANDED

LIABILITY, REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT

BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR A LOSS OF BUSINESS TO NEW HEALTH

CARE FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS. FURTHER, AS OUR BUSINESSES CONTINUE

TO IMPLEMENT THEIR E-COMMERCE INITIATIVES, UNCERTAINTY

SURROUNDING THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND REQUIREMENTS IN THIS

AREA WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

REVIEWS, AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. SUCH OVERSIGHT COULD RESULT

IN THE LOSS OF LICENSURE OR THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN

PROGRAMS, OR THE IMPOSITION OF CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES,

PENALTIES AND OTHER SANCTIONS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF ANY

ADVERSE INVESTIGATION OR AUDIT RESULTS OR SANCTIONS COULD DAMAGE

OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

US TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED

IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS.

THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS,

AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY THE CMS, STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AND

STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE

OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. WE DO NOT

BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS

OR REVIEWS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH OUR WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH INCLUDE HEALTH MAINTENANCE

ORGANIZATIONS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. THESE COMPANIES ARE

SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAY

REQUIRE THE MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL,

AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND MAY RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT

OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR

RESPECTIVE PARENT COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND

DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES,

WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS

LIMITED BASED ON THE SUBSIDIARYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET

INCOME, STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS.

PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER HEALTH CARE

PROVIDER RELATIONS

ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT TECHNIQUES WE USE TO

CONTAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS AND FACILITATE CARE DELIVERY IS

CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE

PROVIDERS. BECAUSE OUR HEALTH PLANS ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE

AND MOST OF THOSE HEALTH PLANS CONTRACT WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF

THESE PROVIDERS, WE BELIEVE OUR AGGREGATE EXPOSURE TO PROVIDER

RELATIONS ISSUES IS LIMITED. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE

ADVOCATING FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXEMPT CERTAIN OF THESE

PROVIDERS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS, THE ADOPTION OF

WHICH COULD AFFECT THIS ASSESSMENT. IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET,

THESE PROVIDERS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER

PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER

HEALTH CARE COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS OR

DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN

SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS,

PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN

GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES.

LITIGATION AND INSURANCE

WE MAY BE A PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS

THAT AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT

DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CLAIMS, BREACH OF

CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER SUITS, INCLUDING

SECURITIES FRAUD, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED LITIGATION.

IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE

ROUTINELY PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE

DESIGN, MANAGEMENT AND OFFERINGS OF OUR SERVICES. THESE MATTERS

INCLUDE: CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE;

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS; ALLEGATIONS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE AND

UNFAIR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES; DISPUTES OVER COMPENSATION AND

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH PHYSICIANS AND

OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS; DISPUTES RELATED TO OUR

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING ACTIONS ALLEGING CLAIM

ADMINISTRATION ERRORS AND FAILURE TO DISCLOSE RATE DISCOUNTS AND

OTHER FEE AND REBATE ARRANGEMENTS; DISPUTES OVER BENEFIT

COPAYMENT CALCULATIONS; CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN

BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND CLAIMS RELATING TO CUSTOMER AUDITS AND

CONTRACT PERFORMANCE. IN 1999, A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

WERE FILED AGAINST US AND VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE

HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS. THE SUITS ARE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS

ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND PHYSICIANS FOR ALLEGED

BREACHES OF FEDERAL STATUTES, INCLUDING ERISA AND THE RACKETEER

INFLUENCED CORRUPT ORGANIZATION ACT (RICO). WHILE WE

BELIEVE THESE SUITS AGAINST US ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND WE INTEND

TO DEFEND OUR POSITION VIGOROUSLY, WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES IN THE

DEFENSE OF THESE MATTERS AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR OUTCOME.

RECENT COURT DECISIONS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY

MAY INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE FOR ANY OF THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS. IN

SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NON-ECONOMIC, TREBLE OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES

MAY BE SOUGHT. WE CURRENTLY HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF

THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES. OTHER POTENTIAL LIABILITIES MAY NOT

BE COVERED BY INSURANCE, INSURERS MAY DISPUTE COVERAGE, OR THE

AMOUNT OF INSURANCE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE DAMAGES

AWARDED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS PUNITIVE

DAMAGES, MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE AND INSURANCE COVERAGE

FOR ALL OR CERTAIN FORMS OF LIABILITY MAY BECOME UNAVAILABLE OR

PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE IN THE FUTURE.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS

OUR BUSINESSES DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON EFFECTIVE

INFORMATION SYSTEMS. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING

COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE

EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH

CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY,

EVOLVING INDUSTRY AND REGULATORY STANDARDS, AND CHANGING

CUSTOMER PREFERENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADMINISTRATIVE

SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF HIPAA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

LABORS ERISA CLAIM PROCESSING REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES TO CURRENT SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, WE

OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR SYSTEMS-RELATED OR OTHER

SERVICES OR FACILITIES FROM INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY

MAKE OUR OPERATIONS VULNERABLE TO SUCH THIRD PARTIES

FAILURE TO PERFORM ADEQUATELY. AS A RESULT OF OUR

ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES, WE HAVE ACQUIRED ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS AND

HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS AND HAVE

UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

COULD CAUSE THE LOSS OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS, DIFFICULTY IN

ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, ISSUES IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST

ESTIMATES, CUSTOMER AND PHYSICIAN AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

DISPUTES, REGULATORY PROBLEMS, INCREASES IN ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES OR OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.

DATA AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEPEND

SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA ON WHICH THEY ARE

BASED. IF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OUR DATABASES WERE FOUND

OR PERCEIVED TO BE INACCURATE, OR IF SUCH INFORMATION WERE

GENERALLY PERCEIVED TO BE UNRELIABLE, COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF

OUR DATABASE-RELATED PRODUCTS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AND MATERIALLY

AFFECTED. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA

BY OUR BUSINESSES IS REGULATED AT INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE

AND LOCAL LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE CHANGED FREQUENTLY BY

LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. THESE RESTRICTIONS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES FROM CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES AND, MORE GENERALLY, AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THERE ARE VARIOUS RECENTLY ADOPTED STATE LAWS

THAT ADDRESS THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUALLY

IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA. MOST ENACT PRIVACY PROVISIONS FROM THE

FEDERAL GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT. ADDITIONALLY, NEW FEDERAL

REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO HIPAA ARE NOW EFFECTIVE WITH

COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY APRIL 2003. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE

PROPOSALS AND NEW REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE

TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES AND MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON

OUR USE OF PATIENT IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT IS HOUSED IN ONE OR

MORE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES. THE SUCCESS OF OUR

KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES ALSO DEPENDS

SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO

OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS. WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS

WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND

OUR TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT THESE LEGAL

PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS WILL PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION

REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE

INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY

SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF

PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH

LITIGATION COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF OUR

BUSINESSES TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ON OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT

EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF

OUR OPERATIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PROFITABILITY AND COMPETITIVE

POSITIONING. WHILE WE MANAGE EXPENSES, STAFF-RELATED AND OTHER

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES MAY INCREASE FROM TIME TO TIME DUE TO

BUSINESS OR PRODUCT START-UPS OR EXPANSIONS, GROWTH OR CHANGES

IN BUSINESS OR THE MIX OF PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY CUSTOMERS,

ACQUISITIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REASONS.

UNANTICIPATED EXPENSE INCREASES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS. FURTHER, WE BELIEVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN

EXPERIENCED, CAPABLE MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL STAFF. THE MARKET

FOR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, INCLUDING INFORMATION

SYSTEMS PROFESSIONALS, IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS VERY

COMPETITIVE. LOSS OF CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES OR A NUMBER OF

MANAGERS OR TECHNICAL STAFF COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY

TO ADMINISTER AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.

MARKETING

WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH BOTH

EMPLOYED SALES PEOPLE AND INDEPENDENT SALES AGENTS. ALTHOUGH WE

HAVE MANY SALES EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS, THE DEPARTURE OF CERTAIN

KEY SALES EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS OR A LARGE SUBSET OF THESE

INDIVIDUALS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING

CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR POTENTIAL

CUSTOMERS CONSIDER OUR DEBT RATINGS, ACCREDITATION OR

CERTIFICATION BY VARIOUS PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENTAL BODIES OR

RATING AGENCIES NECESSARY OR IMPORTANT. CERTAIN OF

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR HEALTH PLANS OR OTHER BUSINESS UNITS MAY NOT

HAVE OBTAINED OR MAINTAINED, OR MAY NOT DESIRE OR BE ABLE TO

OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN, SUCH RATINGS, ACCREDITATION OR

CERTIFICATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

OBTAIN OR RETAIN BUSINESS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

WE HAVE AN ACTIVE ONGOING ACQUISITION AND

DISPOSITION PROGRAM UNDER WHICH WE MAY ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, PRODUCTS OR

BUSINESSES, SOME OR ALL OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL. THESE

TRANSACTIONS MAY ENTAIL CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND MAY

AFFECT ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF UNKNOWN

LIABILITIES, UNFORESEEN ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS OR INCREASED

EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS. FAILURE TO

IDENTIFY LIABILITIES, ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS

OR EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN

REDUCED REVENUES, INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND

CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION.

TERRORIST ATTACKS

THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED ON

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE WAR ON TERRORISM, THE THREAT OF

FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AND THE RELATED CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS

AND PROVIDERS HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO

NEGATIVELY AFFECT, THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND OUR

INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY. DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENTS

ACTIONS AND THE RESPONSIVENESS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND

INSURANCE COMPANIES, FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AND BIO-TERRORISM

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY THROUGH, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

INCREASED USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, HOSPITAL AND PHYSICIAN SERVICES, ANCILLARY TESTING

AND PROCEDURES, INCREASED PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CERTAIN DRUGS,

MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES; LOSS OF MEMBERSHIP AS A RESULT

OF LAY-OFFS OR OTHER REDUCTIONS OF EMPLOYMENT; ADVERSE EFFECTS

UPON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR BUSINESS OF EMPLOYERS WHO

SPONSOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES; DISRUPTION OF

OUR INFORMATION AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS; INCREASED HEALTH CARE COSTS

DUE TO RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO CARVE OUT CERTAIN

CATEGORIES OF RISK, SUCH AS ACTS OF TERRORISM; AND DISRUPTION OF

THE FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE MARKETS IN GENERAL.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

FROM TIME TO TIME IN PRESS RELEASES AND

OTHERWISE, WE MAY PUBLISH FORECASTS OR OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED

REVENUES, NET EARNINGS AND OTHER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL

METRICS. ANY FORECAST OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE REFLECTS VARIOUS

ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

UNCERTAINTIES, AND AS A MATTER OF COURSE, ANY NUMBER OF THEM MAY

PROVE TO BE INCORRECT. FURTHER, THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANY FORECAST

DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS RISKS AND OTHER FACTORS (INCLUDING THOSE

DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCUSSION), MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR

CONTROL. AS A RESULT, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT OUR PERFORMANCE WILL

BE CONSISTENT WITH ANY MANAGEMENT FORECASTS OR THAT THE

VARIATION FROM SUCH FORECASTS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL AND ADVERSE.

YOU ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO BASE YOUR ENTIRE ANALYSIS OF OUR

BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS UPON ISOLATED PREDICTIONS, BUT INSTEAD

ARE ENCOURAGED TO UTILIZE THE ENTIRE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MIX OF

HISTORICAL AND FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION, AS WELL AS OTHER

AVAILABLE INFORMATION AFFECTING US AND OUR SERVICES, WHEN

EVALUATING OUR PROSPECTIVE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY

COULD AFFECT OUR EMPLOYER GROUP RENEWAL PROSPECTS AND OUR

ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICES IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH

WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY STRIVING TO DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS

TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING NEEDS OF CONSUMERS, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT OR A FUTURE DOWNTURN

IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WILL NOT CAUSE OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS TO

SEEK HEALTH COVERAGE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE DO NOT OFFER OR WILL

NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, OR DECREASED

MARGINS ON OUR CONTINUING CUSTOMERS.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

IN SEPTEMBER 1999, A GROUP OF PLAINTIFFS

TRIAL LAWYERS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE TARGETING THE

MANAGED CARE INDUSTRY BY WAY OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION. SINCE

THAT TIME, WE HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL PURPORTED CLASS ACTION

MATTERS THAT GENERALLY CHALLENGE MANAGED CARE PRACTICES

INCLUDING COST CONTAINMENT MECHANISMS, DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS

AND PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES. WE INTEND TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY ALL OF

THESE CASES.

IN RE: MANAGED CARE LITIGATION: MDL

NO. 1334. THE MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL HAS

CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL LITIGATION MATTERS INVOLVING UNITEDHEALTH

GROUP AND ITS AFFILIATES IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,

MIAMI DIVISION. THE UNITEDHEALTH GROUP MATTERS HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED WITH LITIGATION INVOLVING OTHER INDUSTRY MEMBERS

FOR THE COORDINATION OF PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE LITIGATION

HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO TRACKS, WITH ONE TRACK COMPRISING

CONSUMER CLAIMS AND THE OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CLAIMS.

GENERALLY, THE CLAIMS MADE IN THIS CONSOLIDATED LITIGATION

ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF ERISA AND RICO IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED

UNDISCLOSED POLICIES INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS. THE

LITIGATION ALSO ASSERTS BREACH OF STATE PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND

BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

AFFILIATES FAIL TO TIMELY REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR MEDICAL

SERVICES RENDERED. THE CONSOLIDATED SUITS SEEK INJUNCTIVE,

COMPENSATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF AS WELL AS RESTITUTION, COSTS,

FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. FOLLOWING THE COURTS INITIAL

DECISIONS ON INDUSTRY MEMBERS MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE

COMPLAINTS, AMENDED COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN BOTH TRACKS. ON

FEBRUARY 20, 2002 THE COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN

PART THE INDUSTRY DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED

COMPLAINT IN THE MEMBER TRACK LITIGATION. IN SIGNIFICANT PART,

THE COURT LIMITED THE RICO AND ERISA CLAIMS THAT COULD BE

BROUGHT BY THE PLAINTIFFS, AND DISMISSED ENTIRELY THE COMMON LAW

CLAIMS FOR CIVIL CONSPIRACY AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT. ON MARCH 14,

2002, THE COURT CERTIFIED TO THE 11TH CIRCUIT THE THRESHOLD

ISSUE OF WHETHER PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO ASSERT THEIR RICO

CLAIMS. THE 11TH CIRCUIT HAS NOT RULED AS TO WHETHER THEY WILL

REVIEW THE ISSUE. ALL ACTIVITY WAS STAYED IN THE HEALTH CARE

PROVIDER TRACK PENDING RESOLUTION OF A THRESHOLD APPEAL TO

DETERMINE WHICH OF THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CLAIMS MUST BE

ARBITRATED. ON MARCH 14, 2002, THE 11TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED

THE TRIAL COURTS ARBITRATION RULING AND IT IS ANTICIPATED

THAT THE STAY WILL BE LIFTED. IN BOTH TRACKS, DECISIONS ARE

PENDING ON

PLAINTIFFS MOTIONS FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION.

ADDITIONALLY, A DECISION IS PENDING ON INDUSTRY MEMBERS

MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TRACK.

THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ET AL. V.

METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, UNITED HEALTHCARE SERVICES,

INC. AND UNITEDHEALTH GROUP WAS FILED ON MARCH 15, 2000 IN

THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK.

ON APRIL 13, 2000, WE REMOVED THIS CASE TO FEDERAL COURT.

THE SUIT ALLEGES BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF

GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES, AND

TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND

CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS. THE

SUIT SEEKS DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE, EXEMPLARY AND COMPENSATORY

RELIEF AS WELL AS COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. AN AMENDED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 25, 2000, WHICH ALLEGED TWO

CLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS, AN ERISA CLASS AND A NON-ERISA CLASS.

AFTER THE COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN ERISA CLAIMS AND THE CLAIMS

BROUGHT BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, A THIRD AMENDED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED. WE HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE THIRD

AMENDED COMPLAINT.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE

ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO SUITS ALLEGING VARIOUS CAUSES OF ACTION.

SOME OF THESE SUITS MAY INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL

NON-ECONOMIC OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF

PENDING LITIGATION ARE ALWAYS UNCERTAIN, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT

ANY SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, OR ANY OTHER

TYPES OF ACTIONS, CURRENTLY THREATENED OR PENDING WILL,

INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
