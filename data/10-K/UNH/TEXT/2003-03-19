UNITEDHEALTHCARE

UNITEDHEALTHCARE COORDINATES HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING SERVICES ON BEHALF OF LOCAL EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMERS

NATIONWIDE. UNITEDHEALTHCARES PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY

MARKETED TO SMALL AND MID-SIZE EMPLOYERS WITH UP TO 5,000

EMPLOYEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THIS BUSINESS SERVED

APPROXIMATELY 7.8 MILLION INDIVIDUALS. WITH ITS RISK-BASED

PRODUCT OFFERINGS, UNITEDHEALTHCARE ASSUMES THE RISK OF BOTH

MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR

A MONTHLY PREMIUM, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT A FIXED RATE FOR A

ONE-YEAR PERIOD. UNITEDHEALTHCARE ALSO PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE

AND OTHER MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE

MEDICAL COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS, FOR WHICH

UNITEDHEALTHCARE RECEIVES A FEE. THESE CUSTOMERS RETAIN THE RISK

OF FINANCING MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES, AND

UNITEDHEALTHCARE ADMINISTERS THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMER FUNDS TO

PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FROM CUSTOMER-FUNDED

BANK ACCOUNTS. SMALL EMPLOYER GROUPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PURCHASE

RISK-BASED PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY ARE GENERALLY UNABLE OR

UNWILLING TO BEAR A GREATER POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR HEALTH CARE

EXPENDITURES. UNITEDHEALTHCARE OFFERS ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

AFFILIATES THAT ARE USUALLY LICENSED AS INSURANCE COMPANIES OR

AS HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, DEPENDING UPON A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING STATE REGULATIONS.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE ARRANGES FOR DISCOUNTED ACCESS

TO CARE THROUGH MORE THAN 380,000 PHYSICIANS AND 3,500 HOSPITALS

ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THE CONSOLIDATED PURCHASING POWER

REPRESENTED BY THE INDIVIDUALS UNITEDHEALTHCARE SERVES MAKES IT

POSSIBLE FOR UNITEDHEALTHCARE TO CONTRACT FOR COST-EFFECTIVE

ACCESS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF CONVENIENTLY LOCATED CARE PROVIDERS.

DIRECTLY OR THROUGH UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS FAMILY OF

COMPANIES, UNITEDHEALTHCARE OFFERS.



A BROAD RANGE OF BENEFIT PLANS INTEGRATING

MEDICAL, ANCILLARY AND ALTERNATIVE CARE PRODUCTS SO CUSTOMERS

CAN CHOOSE BENEFITS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR THEM;



AFFORDABILITY BY LEVERAGING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS

OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE;



ACCESS TO BROAD AND DIVERSE NUMBERS OF HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING BY MEANS OF BENEFIT PLANS THAT GIVE

CUSTOMERS DIRECT ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS WITHOUT OBTAINING

REFERRALS;



INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT FACILITATE INTEGRATED

CARE DELIVERY;



CONVENIENT SELF-SERVICE FOR CUSTOMER

TRANSACTIONS, PHARMACY SERVICES AND HEALTH INFORMATION;

CLINICAL INFORMATION THAT PHYSICIANS CAN USE IN

WORKING WITH THEIR PATIENTS; AND



SIMPLIFIED ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS.

INNOVATION DISTINGUISHES ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS FROM THE

COMPETITION. UNITEDHEALTHCARE DESIGNS CONSUMER-ORIENTED HEALTH

EXPANSION AND DIVESTITURE OF

OPERATIONS

WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES

AND, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, OFTEN CONSIDER WHETHER TO

SELL CERTAIN BUSINESSES OR STOP OFFERING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES. EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES MAY INCLUDE ACQUIRING

BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS.

DURING 2002, WE COMPLETED SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS AND CEASED

OFFERING SOME PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS, ALL AS PART OF OUR

ONGOING EMPHASIS ON OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS. FURTHER, WE DEVOTE

SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES FOR THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SECTOR AS WE HAVE BROADLY

DEFINED IT.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE

REGULATED. THIS REGULATION CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY

AGENCIES GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND

INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING CONSIDERED, AND THE

INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE

PERIODICALLY.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE REVISIONS COULD AFFECT OUR CONSOLIDATED

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. ENACTMENT OF FEDERAL AND STATE

HEALTH BENEFIT LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

FEDERAL REGULATION

OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT, WHICH INCLUDES

UNITEDHEALTHCARE, OVATIONS, AND AMERICHOICE, HAS MEDICARE+CHOICE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE REGULATED BY CMS. CMS HAS THE RIGHT TO AUDIT

OUR PERFORMANCE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CMS

CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE BEING GIVEN TO

MEMBERS. OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT ALSO HAS MEDICAID AND

STATE CHILDRENS HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM CONTRACTS THAT

ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATION REGARDING SERVICES

TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE

SERVICES, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE

IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THE APPLICABLE

REGULATIONS; HOWEVER, THE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF REGULATIONS

SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID MAKES COMPLIANCE IN THIS

PRODUCT LINE A CONTINUING CHALLENGE.

STATE REGULATION

ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER

INSURANCE AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE PRODUCTS REGULATE THOSE

PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. MOST STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL

REPORTS FROM US AND IMPOSE MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH

RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. MANY OF OUR HEALTH PLANS AND EACH OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED UNDER STATE INSURANCE

HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRE

REGISTRATION WITH APPLICABLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND

THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CERTAIN INTER-COMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR

REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTER-COMPANY

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE

REGULATED COMPANIES AND THEIR PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES OR

AFFILIATES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR PRODUCTS

MAY BE SUBJECT TO PPO, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION

(MCO) OR TPA-RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE

REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER GREATLY FROM STATE TO

STATE, BUT GENERALLY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING, FINANCIAL AND

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. MANY STATES ALSO HAVE ENACTED LAWS

AND/OR ADOPTED REGULATIONS GOVERNING UTILIZATION REVIEW AND

EXTERNAL APPEALS ACTIVITIES, AND THESE LAWS MAY APPLY TO SOME OF

OUR OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES, PROMPT

PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, CONFIDENTIALITY OF CONSUMER HEALTH

INFORMATION AND COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES. TO DATE, THESE

VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

HIPAA

THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF

THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996,

AS AMENDED (HIPAA), APPLY TO BOTH THE GROUP AND

INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING SELF-FUNDED

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. FEDERAL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT

TO HIPAA ARE NOW EFFECTIVE, WITH COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY APRIL

2003. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC

TRANSACTIONS AND CODE SETS, AND FOR THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF

PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE REGULATIONS. NEW STANDARDS FOR NATIONAL PROVIDER AND

EMPLOYER IDENTIFIERS ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED BY

REGULATORS. WE INTEND TO BE IN COMPLIANCE BY THE ENFORCEMENT

DATES; HOWEVER, THE LAW IS FAR-REACHING AND COMPLEX AND THE

GOVERNMENTS DELAY IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON SOME ASPECTS OF

THE LAW MAY AFFECT THE TIMELINESS OF OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HIPAAS PROVISIONS

AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES IN THE DIFFERENT STATES MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO STANDARDIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES ACROSS STATE LINES.

ERISA

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF

1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), REGULATES HOW GOODS AND

SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A COMPLEX SET

OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

INTERPRETATION BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AS WELL

AS THE FEDERAL COURTS. ERISA PLACES CONTROLS ON HOW OUR BUSINESS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MAINTAIN

SELF-FUNDED PLANS. DURING 2002, WE PROCESSED AND ADMINISTERED

THE PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $21 BILLION OF MEDICAL CLAIMS

ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE MEDICAL COSTS OF

THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES DEPENDENTS. NEW ERISA

CLAIM REGULATIONS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JULY 2002 REQUIRE

ONGOING MODIFICATIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW REGULATIONS.

FRAUD AND ABUSE

THE REGULATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO PARTICIPANTS IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ARE COMPLEX AND CHANGING.

WE CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE OUR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE EFFORTS FOR

THESE PROGRAMS, BUT ONGOING VIGOROUS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

HIGHLY TECHNICAL NATURE OF THE REGULATIONS MEAN THAT COMPLIANCE

EFFORTS IN THIS ARENA WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, STATES HAVE BEGUN TO FOCUS THEIR

ANTI-FRAUD EFFORTS ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE

ORGANIZATIONS. SOME STATES NOW REQUIRE FILING AND APPROVAL OF

ANTI-FRAUD PLANS AND MAY MONITOR COMPLIANCE AS PART OF ANY

MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION.

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS,

INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT

ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL

FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF

LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT

PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, A STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OR OTHER

STATE OR FEDERAL AUTHORITY (INCLUDING CMS, THE OFFICE OF THE

INSPECTOR GENERAL AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL) MAY FROM TIME TO

TIME BEGIN A SPECIAL AUDIT OF ONE OF OUR HEALTH PLANS, OUR

INSURANCE PLANS AND PRODUCTS OR ONE OF OUR OTHER OPERATIONS TO

INVESTIGATE ISSUES SUCH AS UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT; FINANCIAL,

ELIGIBILITY OR OTHER DATA REPORTING; PROMPT CLAIMS PAYMENT; OR

COVERAGE OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE, INCLUDING EMERGENCY ROOM

CARE. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE,

REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS,

STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR

GENERAL AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY

OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS OR REVIEWS, INDIVIDUALLY

OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

OUR INGENIX AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENTS

BOTH HAVE LIMITED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEGAL AND REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING VARIOUS TAX,

TARIFF AND TRADE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT,

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INVESTMENT RULES AND LAWS.

MARKETING

OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IS DEFINED AND COORDINATED

BY EACH BUSINESSS DEDICATED MARKETING STAFF. WITHIN THESE

BUSINESSES, PRIMARY MARKETING RESPONSIBILITY GENERALLY RESIDES

WITH A MARKETING LEADER AND A DIRECT SALES FORCE. IN ADDITION,

SEVERAL OF THE SEGMENTS ALSO RELY UPON INDEPENDENT INSURANCE

AGENTS AND BROKERS TO SELL SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS. MARKETING

EFFORTS ALSO INCLUDE PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORTS AND ADVERTISING

PROGRAMS THAT MAY USE TELEVISION, RADIO, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES,

BILLBOARDS, DIRECT MAIL AND TELEMARKETING.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES

COMPANY WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR

COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, TPAS AND BUSINESS SERVICES OUTSOURCING COMPANIES,

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE FORMED NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY

CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS, SPECIALTY BENEFIT PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT

ENTITIES, AND VARIOUS INFORMATION AND CONSULTING

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANIES. NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS IN WHICH

WE COMPETE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THESE MARKETS, ALSO

CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING US AND THE SALES AND

PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION,

CONSUMER SATISFACTION, THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, NETWORK CAPABILITIES, PRICE, MARKET SHARE, PRODUCT

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS ARE

ENHANCED BY OUR CUSTOMER FOCUS RESULTING FROM OUR OPERATIONAL

ALIGNMENT. EACH UNITEDHEALTH GROUP BUSINESS REPRESENTS A

STRATEGIC PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN PENETRATE MORE DEEPLY INTO

SPECIFIC MARKETS USING OUR THREE CORE COMPETENCIES: NETWORK

MANAGEMENT, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION AND SERVICE

INFRASTRUCTURE. OTHER STRENGTHS INCLUDE THE BREADTH AND QUALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE AND DIVERSITY, THE SCOPE

AND DEPTH OF OUR DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH CARE COSTS

AND CONSUMPTION, OUR EFFECTIVE USE OF PROPRIETARY TOOLS AND

PRODUCTS TO COORDINATE AND FACILITATE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO

REALIZE APPROPRIATELY LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS, OUR DISCIPLINED

UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PRACTICES AND STAFF, OUR SIGNIFICANT

MARKET POSITION IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THE STRENGTH OF OUR

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OUR GENERALLY

LARGE PROVIDER NETWORKS THAT PROVIDE MORE CONSUMER CHOICE AND

MINIMIZE BARRIERS TO ACCESS, OUR POINT-OF-SERVICE PRODUCTS AND

OUR STRONG MARKETPLACE REPUTATION. HOWEVER, IN SOME MARKETS WE

MAY BE AT A DISADVANTAGE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING

COMPETITORS WITH MORE RESOURCES, LONGER OPERATING HISTORIES,

LARGER MARKET SHARES, BROADER NETWORKS, NARROWER NETWORKS (WHICH

MAY ALLOW GREATER COST CONTROL AND LOWER PRICES) OR MORE

ESTABLISHED NAMES AND REPUTATIONS. THESE COMPETITIVE FACTORS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, WE EMPLOYED

APPROXIMATELY 32,000 INDIVIDUALS. WE BELIEVE OUR EMPLOYEE

RELATIONS ARE GOOD.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K, AND IN THE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

OTHER SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS INCORPORATED

BY REFERENCE IN THIS FORM 10-K, INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (THE PSLRA). WHEN USED

IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN FUTURE FILINGS BY

US WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN OUR PRESS

RELEASES, PRESENTATIONS TO SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, AND

IN ORAL STATEMENTS MADE BY OR WITH THE APPROVAL OF ONE OF OUR

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE WORDS OR PHRASES BELIEVES,

ANTICIPATES, INTENDS, WILL LIKELY

RESULT, ESTIMATES, PROJECTS OR

SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS CERTAIN

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS THAT INVESTORS AND

OTHERS SHOULD CONSIDER. THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE

PSLRA. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS, IN MAKING THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS, WE DO

NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS OR UPDATE EACH FACTOR IN FUTURE FILINGS

OR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATING RESULTS,

AND DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS HOW ANY OF THESE FACTORS MAY

HAVE CAUSED RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM DISCUSSIONS OR INFORMATION

CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS. IN ADDITION,

ANY OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW MAY HAVE AFFECTED OUR PAST,

AS WELL AS CURRENT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT FUTURE

RESULTS. ANY OR ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS

FORM 10-K, IN THE 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND

IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY TURN OUT TO BE WRONG.

THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR

BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS

DISCUSSED BELOW WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS.

CONSEQUENTLY, NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED.

ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS

EXPRESSED IN OUR PRIOR COMMUNICATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HEALTH CARE COSTS

WE USE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO

PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO OUR

CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED

PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY

PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HEALTH CARE COSTS.

TOTAL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL

SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM

REVENUE IS TYPICALLY FIXED IN PRICE FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS

GENERALLY PRICED THREE MONTHS BEFORE CONTRACT COMMENCEMENT.

SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AND RELATED COSTS ARE INCURRED WHEN THE

CONTRACT COMMENCES. ALTHOUGH WE BASE THE PREMIUMS WE CHARGE ON

OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS OVER THE FIXED PREMIUM

PERIOD, INFLATION, REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE

ACTUAL HEALTH CARE COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND

REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED USE

OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES,

CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY

TREATMENTS, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES,

INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM

REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY NARROW OPERATING MARGINS OF

OUR RISK-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS

WE REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS

INCURRED FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING CLAIMS HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED

BY US OR FOR WHICH THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BUT NOT

PROCESSED. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW, OUR

EARNINGS MAY BE ADJUSTED LATER BASED ON ACTUAL COSTS.

INDUSTRY FACTORS

THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING INDUSTRIES RECEIVE

SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF

LARGE JURY VERDICTS. THIS PUBLICITY HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY

LITIGATION, LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY, REGULATION AND GOVERNMENTAL

REVIEW OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES. THESE FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, MAY REQUIRE US

TO CHANGE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAY INCREASE THE

REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE, FURTHER INCREASING

OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

PROFITABILITY.

COMPETITION

IN MANY OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC OR PRODUCT MARKETS, WE

COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES, SOME OF WHICH MAY HAVE

CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OR CAPABILITIES THAT GIVE THEM A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE BELIEVE THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN

CERTAIN MARKETS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL, SO THE ADDITION OF NEW

COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CONSUMERS ENJOY

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING TO COMPETITORS. SOME OF OUR

CUSTOMERS MAY DECIDE TO PERFORM FOR THEMSELVES FUNCTIONS OR

SERVICES WE PROVIDE, WHICH WOULD DECREASE OUR REVENUES. SOME OF

OUR CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MAY

DECIDE TO MARKET PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN

COMPETITION WITH US. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND

ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE

OPERATE AS WELL AS IN INDUSTRIES THAT ACT AS SUPPLIERS TO US,

SUCH AS THE HOSPITAL, PHYSICIAN, PHARMACEUTICAL, MEDICAL DEVICE

AND HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS INDUSTRIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT

THERE IS STRONG COMPETITION OR THAT COMPETITION INTENSIFIES IN

ANY MARKET, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS OR

CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, OR

MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR REVENUE GROWTH, PRICING FLEXIBILITY,

CONTROL OVER MEDICAL COST TRENDS AND MARKETING EXPENSES MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AARP CONTRACT

UNDER OUR LONG-TERM CONTRACT WITH AARP, WE

PROVIDE MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND HOSPITAL INDEMNITY HEALTH

INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, OUR PORTION OF AARPS INSURANCE

PROGRAM REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION IN ANNUAL

NET PREMIUM REVENUE FROM APPROXIMATELY 3.6 MILLION AARP

MEMBERS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENT DEPENDS, IN PART,

ON OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE THESE CUSTOMERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

COMPETITIVELY, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATORY CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, EVENTS

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT AARP OR ONE OF ITS OTHER

BUSINESS PARTNERS FOR ITS MEMBER INSURANCE PROGRAM COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR ARRANGEMENT WITH AARP.

GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

IN RESPONSE TO MEDICAL COST INCREASES THAT

EXCEEDED MEDICARE PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT RATE GROWTH, WE HAVE

WITHDRAWN OUR MEDICARE+CHOICE PRODUCT OFFERINGS FROM A NUMBER OF

COUNTIES AND FILED SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS IN OTHER

COUNTIES. THESE AND OTHER ACTIONS HAVE REDUCED MEDICARE+CHOICE

ENROLLMENT AND MAY RESULT IN FURTHER OR COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL OF

MEDICARE+CHOICE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHEN AND AS PERMITTED BY OUR

CONTRACTS WITH THE CMS. UNDER CURRENT REGULATIONS, WE ARE

PRECLUDED FROM RE-ENTERING THE COUNTIES FROM WHICH WE HAVE

WITHDRAWN OUR MEDICARE+CHOICE PRODUCT OFFERINGS UNTIL TWO YEARS

AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF WITHDRAWAL.

THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR MEDICARE+CHOICE,

MEDICAID AND STATE CHILDRENS HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

(SCHIP) OPERATIONS DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT INCREASES, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, BENEFIT

DESIGN, PHYSICIAN AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTING,

STATE BUDGETARY PRESSURES (MEDICAID AND SCHIP) AND OTHER

FACTORS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OR ALL OF OUR

GOVERNMENT PROGRAM OPERATIONS WILL BE PROFITABLE IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE,

LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR

BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT

TO FREQUENT CHANGE. BROAD LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES

ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND

RULES COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT

REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR

LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE

DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. WE

MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF

OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS

AND TO CONSUMMATE OUR ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. DELAYS IN

OBTAINING OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS

COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE PARTICIPATE IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS

GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT

MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE

THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR

ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. SUCH

CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN THE PAST AND MAY

DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS

ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES. BILLS AND REGULATIONS AT STATE AND

FEDERAL LEVELS MAY AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS,

INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER

HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT METHODS AND

PAYMENT RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; CLAIM PAYMENTS AND

PROCESSING; USE AND MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE

HEALTH INFORMATION; MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LITIGATION REFORM; AND

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS. WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE

INITIATIVES WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME BINDING LAW OR REGULATION,

OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS WILL BE, BUT THEIR ENACTMENT

COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO EXPANDED LIABILITY,

REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR

PUT US AT RISK FOR A LOSS OF BUSINESS TO NEW HEALTH CARE FUNDING

ARRANGEMENTS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. SUCH OVERSIGHT COULD RESULT

IN OUR LOSS OF LICENSURE OR OUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN

PROGRAMS, OR THE IMPOSITION OF CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES,

PENALTIES AND OTHER SANCTIONS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF ANY

ADVERSE INVESTIGATION OR AUDIT RESULTS OR SANCTIONS COULD DAMAGE

OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

US TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED

IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS.

THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS,

AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY THE CMS, STATE AND HEALTH INSURANCE

DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL

MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND U.S.

ATTORNEYS. ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF PENDING MATTERS ARE ALWAYS

UNCERTAIN, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY OF THE CURRENT

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS OR REVIEWS, INDIVIDUALLY

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH OUR

SUBSIDIARIES. THESE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATIONS

THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAY REQUIRE THE MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM

LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND MAY

RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER

DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT

COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT

MAY BE PAID BY OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES, WITHOUT PRIOR

APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS LIMITED BASED ON

THE SUBSIDIARYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME, STATUTORY

CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. WE USE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS,

COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE OPERATING AND

FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. THE AGENCIES THAT ASSESS OUR

CREDITWORTHINESS ALSO CONSIDER STATUTORY CAPITAL LEVELS WHEN

ESTABLISHING OUR DEBT RATINGS. WE MAINTAIN AN AGGREGATE

STATUTORY CAPITAL LEVEL FOR OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM LEVEL REGULATORS REQUIRE.

PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER HEALTH CARE

PROVIDER RELATIONS

ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT TECHNIQUES WE USE TO

CONTAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS AND FACILITATE CARE DELIVERY IS TO

CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT

MANAGERS AND PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE

PROVIDERS FOR FAVORABLE PRICES. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE

ADVOCATING FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXEMPT CERTAIN OF THESE

PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE

ANTITRUST LAWS. IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, THESE PHYSICIANS AND

HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND

HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN

HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS

OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS.

IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY

HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY

PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR

MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON

OUR PART.

LITIGATION AND INSURANCE

SOMETIMES WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF LEGAL

ACTIONS THAT CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND

EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER

SUITS, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN

ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE

ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO

THE DESIGN, MANAGEMENT AND OFFERINGS OF OUR SERVICES. THESE

MATTERS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATED TO

HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS,

CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN

BUSINESS PRACTICES. IN 1999, A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

WERE FILED AGAINST US AND VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE

HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS. THE SUITS ARE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS

ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND PHYSICIANS FOR ALLEGED

BREACHES OF FEDERAL STATUTES, INCLUDING ERISA AND THE RACKETEER

INFLUENCED CORRUPT ORGANIZATION ACT (RICO). WE WILL

INCUR EXPENSES IN THE DEFENSE OF THESE MATTERS, EVEN IF THEY ARE

WITHOUT MERIT.

RECENT COURT DECISIONS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY

MAY INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE FOR ANY OF THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS. IN

SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NON-ECONOMIC, TREBLE OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES

MAY BE SOUGHT. WE CURRENTLY HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF

THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES. OTHER POTENTIAL LIABILITIES MAY NOT

BE COVERED BY INSURANCE, INSURERS MAY DISPUTE COVERAGE, OR THE

AMOUNT OF INSURANCE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE DAMAGES

AWARDED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS PUNITIVE

DAMAGES, MAY NOT BE COVERED BY INSURANCE. THE COST OF GENERAL

BUSINESS INSURANCE COVERAGE HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. AS A RESULT, WE

HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF RISK THAT WE SELF-INSURE,

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ROUTINE MATTERS INCIDENTAL TO OUR

BUSINESS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE

PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS. ALTHOUGH WE

BELIEVE THE LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED FOR THESE RISKS ARE

ADEQUATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL

LOSSES WILL NOT EXCEED THE LIABILITIES RECORDED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DATA INTEGRITY AND INFORMATION

SYSTEMS

OUR BUSINESSES DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON EFFECTIVE

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA WE USE TO RUN

THESE BUSINESSES. OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES, PROVIDE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES,

WE HAVE ACQUIRED ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS. WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS

TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE UPGRADED AND

EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. IF THE

INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WAS FOUND TO BE

INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVELY

OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY, WE COULD LOSE

EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY IN ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS,

HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND

ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE CUSTOMER AND PHYSICIAN

AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER DISPUTES, HAVE REGULATORY

PROBLEMS, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER

ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING

COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE

EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH

CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY,

EVOLVING INDUSTRY AND REGULATORY STANDARDS, AND CHANGING

CUSTOMER PREFERENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ADMINISTRATIVE

SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF HIPAA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

LABORS ERISA CLAIM PROCESSING REGULATIONS REQUIRE CHANGES

TO OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS.

WE DEPEND ON INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES FOR

SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR SYSTEMS-RELATED SUPPORT, EQUIPMENT,

FACILITIES, AND CERTAIN DATA, INCLUDING DATA CENTER OPERATIONS,

DATA NETWORK, VOICE COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND PHARMACY DATA

PROCESSING. THIS DEPENDENCE MAKES OUR OPERATIONS VULNERABLE TO

SUCH THIRD PARTIES FAILURE TO PERFORM ADEQUATELY UNDER THE

CONTRACT, DUE TO INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL FACTORS. ALTHOUGH THERE

ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE SIZE,

SCALE AND CAPABILITIES TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE CERTAIN OF THESE

SERVICES, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO PHARMACY BENEFITS PROCESSING

AND MANAGEMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER ORGANIZATIONS COULD

PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES ON COMPARABLE TERMS. A CHANGE IN

SERVICE PROVIDERS, HOWEVER, COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN SERVICE

QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OR LESS FAVORABLE CONTRACT TERMS WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND PRIVACY

REGULATIONS

THE USE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR

BUSINESSES IS REGULATED AT INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE AND

LOCAL LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE CHANGED FREQUENTLY BY

LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS

ADDRESS THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE

HEALTH DATA. MOST ARE DERIVED FROM THE PRIVACY PROVISIONS IN THE

FEDERAL GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND HIPAA. HIPAA ALSO IMPOSES

GUIDELINES ON OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES (AS THIS TERM IS DEFINED

IN THE HIPAA REGULATIONS). EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR

APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS

ASSOCIATES, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND

PRACTICES. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PROPOSALS AND NEW REGULATIONS

MAY RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES,

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, AND THE EFFECTS

OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. THEY ALSO

MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR USE OF PATIENT

IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT IS HOUSED IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR

ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE AND

INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES ALSO DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR

ABILITY TO MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND

RELATED PRODUCTS. WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS,

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND OUR TRADE

SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY

RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT

MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION,

SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS

THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT

GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

ABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT

EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF

OUR OPERATIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PROFITABILITY AND COMPETITIVE

POSITIONING. STAFF-RELATED AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES MAY

INCREASE FROM TIME TO TIME DUE TO BUSINESS OR PRODUCT START-UPS

OR EXPANSIONS, GROWTH OR CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR THE MIX OF

PRODUCTS PURCHASED BY CUSTOMERS, ACQUISITIONS, REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER REASONS. UNANTICIPATED EXPENSE INCREASES

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE BELIEVE WE

CURRENTLY HAVE AN EXPERIENCED, CAPABLE MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL

STAFF. THE MARKET FOR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL,

INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS PROFESSIONALS, IN THE HEALTH CARE

INDUSTRY IS VERY COMPETITIVE. LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES OR A NUMBER

OF MANAGERS OR TECHNICAL STAFF COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO ADMINISTER AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.

MARKETING

WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH BOTH

EMPLOYED SALES PEOPLE AND INDEPENDENT SALES AGENTS. THE

DEPARTURE OF KEY SALES EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS OR A LARGE SUBSET OF

THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EXISTING

CUSTOMERS. SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS CONSIDER

OUR DEBT RATINGS, ACCREDITATION OR CERTIFICATION BY VARIOUS

PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENTAL BODIES OR RATING AGENCIES NECESSARY OR

IMPORTANT. SOME OF OUR HEALTH PLANS OR OTHER BUSINESS UNITS MAY

NOT HAVE OBTAINED OR MAINTAINED, OR MAY NOT DESIRE OR BE ABLE TO

OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN, SUCH RATINGS, ACCREDITATION OR

CERTIFICATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

OBTAIN OR ACQUIRE OR RETAIN BUSINESS FROM THESE CUSTOMERS AND

POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

WE HAVE AN ACTIVE ONGOING ACQUISITION AND

DISPOSITION PROGRAM UNDER WHICH WE MAY ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, PRODUCTS OR

BUSINESSES, SOME OR ALL OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL. THESE

TRANSACTIONS MAY ENTAIL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND MAY AFFECT

ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF UNKNOWN LIABILITIES,

UNFORESEEN ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS OR THE USE OF RESOURCES TO

INTEGRATE THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS. FAILURE TO IDENTIFY

LIABILITIES, ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS OR

EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS COULD RESULT IN

REDUCED REVENUES, INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND

CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION.

TERRORIST ATTACKS

THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED ON

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE WAR ON TERRORISM, THE THREAT OF

FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AND THE RELATED CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS

AND PROVIDERS HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO

NEGATIVELY AFFECT, THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND OUR INDUSTRY

SPECIFICALLY. DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENTS ACTIONS AND THE

RESPONSIVENESS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND INSURANCE

COMPANIES, FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AND BIO-TERRORISM COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT US THROUGH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASED USE

OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, HOSPITAL

AND PHYSICIAN SERVICES; LOSS OF MEMBERSHIP IN HEALTH PLANS WE

ADMINISTER AS A RESULT OF LAY-OFFS OR OTHER REDUCTIONS OF

EMPLOYMENT; ADVERSE EFFECTS UPON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

BUSINESS OF EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THEIR

EMPLOYEES; DISRUPTION OF OUR INFORMATION AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS;

INCREASED HEALTH CARE COSTS DUE TO RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY

TO CARVE OUT CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF RISK, SUCH AS ACTS OF

TERRORISM; AND DISRUPTION OF THE FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE MARKETS

IN GENERAL.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

FROM TIME TO TIME IN PRESS RELEASES AND

OTHERWISE, WE MAY PUBLISH FORECASTS OR OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED

REVENUES, EARNINGS PER SHARE AND OTHER OPERATING AND FINANCIAL

METRICS. ANY FORECAST OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE REFLECTS VARIOUS

ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

UNCERTAINTIES, AND ANY NUMBER OF THEM MAY PROVE TO BE INCORRECT.

FURTHER, THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANY FORECAST DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS

FACTORS (INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCUSSION), MANY OF

WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. AS A RESULT, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT

OUR PERFORMANCE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH ANY MANAGEMENT FORECASTS

OR THAT THE VARIATION FROM SUCH FORECASTS WILL NOT BE

AND OUR SERVICES, WHEN EVALUATING OUR PROSPECTIVE CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY

AFFECTS OUR EMPLOYER GROUP RENEWAL PROSPECTS AND OUR ABILITY TO

INCREASE PRICES IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WE ARE

CONTINUOUSLY STRIVING TO DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO

ADDRESS THE CHANGING NEEDS OF CONSUMERS, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT OR A FUTURE DOWNTURN

IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WILL NOT CAUSE OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS TO

SEEK HEALTH COVERAGE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE DO NOT OFFER OR WILL

NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, OR DECREASED

MARGINS ON OUR CONTINUING CUSTOMERS.

STOCK MARKET

THE MARKET PRICES OF THE SECURITIES OF THE

PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE

SHOWN VOLATILITY AND SENSITIVITY IN RESPONSE TO MANY FACTORS,

INCLUDING GENERAL MARKET TRENDS, PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING

MANAGED CARE, LITIGATION AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS, LEGISLATIVE OR

REGULATORY ACTIONS, HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS, PRICING TRENDS,

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

IN SEPTEMBER 1999, A GROUP OF PLAINTIFFS

TRIAL LAWYERS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE TARGETING THE

MANAGED CARE INDUSTRY BY WAY OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION. SINCE

THAT TIME, SEVERAL CLAIMS AGAINST US HAVE BEEN ALLEGED THAT

GENERALLY CHALLENGE MANAGED CARE PRACTICES, INCLUDING COST

CONTAINMENT MECHANISMS, DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS AND PAYMENT

METHODOLOGIES. THESE CLAIMS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING

PARAGRAPH. WE INTEND TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY ALL OF THESE CLAIMS.

IN RE: MANAGED CARE LITIGATION: MDL

NO. 1334.

A MULTI-DISTRICT

LITIGATION PANEL HAS CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL LITIGATION CASES

INVOLVING UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND OUR AFFILIATES IN THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT COURT OF FLORIDA, MIAMI DIVISION. THE FIRST OF THESE

SUITS WAS INITIATED IN FEBRUARY 2000. IN DECEMBER 2000, THE

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP LITIGATION WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH LITIGATION

INVOLVING OTHER INDUSTRY MEMBERS FOR THE COORDINATION OF

PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE LITIGATION HAS BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO

TRACKS, WITH ONE TRACK COMPRISING CONSUMER CLAIMS AND THE OTHER

HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CLAIMS. GENERALLY, THE CLAIMS MADE IN THIS

CONSOLIDATED LITIGATION ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF ERISA AND RICO IN

CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED UNDISCLOSED POLICIES INTENDED TO

MAXIMIZE PROFITS. THE LITIGATION ALSO ASSERTS BREACH OF STATE

PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AFFILIATES FAIL TO TIMELY REIMBURSE PROVIDERS

FOR MEDICAL SERVICES RENDERED. THE CONSOLIDATED SUITS SEEK

INJUNCTIVE, COMPENSATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF AS WELL AS

RESTITUTION, COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. FOLLOWING THE

COURTS INITIAL DECISIONS ON INDUSTRY MEMBERS MOTIONS

TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINTS, AMENDED COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN BOTH

TRACKS. ON FEBRUARY 20, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART AND

DENIED IN PART THE INDUSTRY DEFENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS

THE AMENDED COMPLAINT IN THE CONSUMER TRACK LITIGATION. IN

SIGNIFICANT PART, THE COURT LIMITED THE RICO AND ERISA CLAIMS

THAT COULD BE BROUGHT BY THE PLAINTIFFS, AND DISMISSED ENTIRELY

THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS FOR CIVIL CONSPIRACY AND UNJUST

ENRICHMENT. ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2002, THE TRIAL COURT DENIED

THE CONSUMER TRACK PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION WHILE GRANTING THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TRACK

PLAINTIFFS

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTIFICATION MOTION. DISCOVERY COMMENCED IN BOTH

TRACKS OF THE LITIGATION ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. THE

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT GRANTED THE INDUSTRY DEFENDANTS PETITION

SEEKING REVIEW OF THE DISTRICT COURTS CERTIFICATION ORDER

IN THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TRACK LITIGATION. ON

FEBRUARY 24, 2003, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HEARD

ARGUMENT IN UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS AND UNAFFILIATED DEFENDANT

PACIFICARES APPEAL TO REVIEW THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT

COURTS DECISION (AFFIRMED BY THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT) TO

LIMIT ARBITRATION TO ONLY CERTAIN OF THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

TRACK PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS.

THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ET AL. V.

METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, UNITED HEALTHCARE SERVICES,

INC. AND UNITEDHEALTH GROUP.

THIS

LAWSUIT WAS FILED ON MARCH 15, 2000, IN THE SUPREME COURT

OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK. ON APRIL 13,

2000, WE REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE SUIT ALLEGES CAUSES

OF ACTION BASED ON ERISA, AS WELL AS BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE

IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS

AND PRACTICES, AND TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE

CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR

NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS. THE SUIT SEEKS DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE

AND COMPENSATORY RELIEF AS WELL AS COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST

PAYMENTS. AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 25,

2000, WHICH ALLEGED TWO CLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS, AN ERISA CLASS

AND A NON-ERISA CLASS. AFTER THE COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN ERISA

CLAIMS AND THE CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

ASSOCIATION, A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED. ON

OCTOBER 25, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN

PART OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT. WE ARE

ENGAGED IN DISCOVERY IN THIS MATTER.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE

ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO LAWSUITS ALLEGING VARIOUS CAUSES OF ACTION.

SOME OF THESE SUITS MAY INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL

NON-ECONOMIC, TREBLE OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. WE RECORD LIABILITIES

FOR OUR ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS.

ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF PENDING LITIGATION ARE ALWAYS UNCERTAIN,

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING

THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, OR ANY OTHER TYPES OF ACTIONS, CURRENTLY

THREATENED OR PENDING, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
