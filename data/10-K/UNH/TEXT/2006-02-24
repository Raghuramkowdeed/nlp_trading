TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH THE HELP OF LEADING RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS AT ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS.

FOR PHYSICIANS, THE AMERICHOICE PERSONAL CARE MODEL MEANS ASSISTANCE WITH COORDINATION OF THEIR PATIENTS CARE. AMERICHOICE UTILIZES SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY TO MONITOR PREVENTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS AND

AMERICHOICE UTILIZES ADVANCED AND UNIQUE PHARMACY SERVICESINCLUDING BENEFIT DESIGN, GENERIC DRUG INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW AND PREFERRED DRUG LIST DEVELOPMENTTO HELP OPTIMIZE THE USE OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND CONCURRENTLY

CONTAIN PHARMACY EXPENDITURES TO LEVELS APPROPRIATE TO THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL SITUATIONS. FOR STATE CUSTOMERS, THE AMERICHOICE PERSONAL CARE MODEL MEANS INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE AND IMPROVED QUALITY, IN A MEASURABLE SYSTEM THAT REDUCES THEIR

ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND LOWERS THEIR COSTS.

AMERICHOICE CONSIDERS A VARIETY

OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING IN WHICH STATE PROGRAMS TO PARTICIPATE, INCLUDING THE STATES EXPERIENCE AND CONSISTENCY OF SUPPORT FOR ITS MEDICAID PROGRAM IN TERMS OF SERVICE INNOVATION AND FUNDING, THE POPULATION BASE IN THE STATE, THE WILLINGNESS

OF THE PHYSICIAN/PROVIDER COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE AMERICHOICE PERSONAL CARE MODEL, AND THE PRESENCE OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN PARTNER WITH AMERICHOICE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS MEMBERS. USING THESE CRITERIA, AMERICHOICE

ENTERED ONE NEW MARKET IN 2005, SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO ENTER ANOTHER NEW MARKET IN 2006, AND IS EXAMINING SEVERAL OTHERS. CONVERSELY, DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS, AMERICHOICE HAS EXITED SEVERAL MARKETS BECAUSE OF REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES OR LACK OF

CONSISTENT DIRECTION AND SUPPORT FROM THE SPONSORING STATES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE REGULATED. THIS REGULATION CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. CHANGES IN

APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING CONSIDERED, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE PERIODICALLY.

FEDERAL REGULATION

OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT, WHICH INCLUDES UNITEDHEALTHCARE, OVATIONS AND AMERICHOICE, IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REGULATION. OVATIONS MEDICARE BUSINESS IS REGULATED BY CMS. CMS HAS THE RIGHT TO AUDIT

PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CMS CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE BEING GIVEN TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT ALSO HAS MEDICAID AND STATE CHILDRENS HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM CONTRACTS

THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE MANY REGULATIONS SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COMPLIANCE. IN

ADDITION, BECAUSE A PORTION OF INGENIXS BUSINESS INCLUDES CLINICAL RESEARCH, IT IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

STATE REGULATION

ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER INSURANCE AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE

ORGANIZATION PRODUCTS REGULATE THOSE PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THESE STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ESTABLISH MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REGULATED UNDER STATE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRE REGISTRATION WITH APPLICABLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CERTAIN INTER-COMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE REGULATED

COMPANIES AND THEIR PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES OR AFFILIATES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR BUSINESS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO PREFERRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION (PPO), MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION (MCO) OR THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR-RELATED

REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER FROM STATE TO STATE, BUT MAY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING, PRODUCT AND RATE, FINANCIAL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR

DELIVERY OF SERVICES, PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, FRAUD PREVENTION, PROTECTION OF CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION AND COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

AS TYPICALLY OCCURS IN CONNECTION WITH A TRANSACTION OF THIS SIZE, IN CONNECTION WITH THE

PACIFICARE TRANSACTION, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO VARIOUS COMMITMENTS WITH STATE REGULATORY DEPARTMENTS, PRINCIPALLY IN CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

HIPAA

THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996, AS AMENDED (HIPAA), APPLY

TO BOTH THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING SELF-FUNDED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. FEDERAL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO HIPAA INCLUDE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND CODE SETS, AND FOR THE PRIVACY AND

SECURITY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THESE REGULATIONS. NEW STANDARDS FOR NATIONAL PROVIDER AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFIERS ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED BY REGULATORS. WE HAVE BEEN

AND INTEND TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THESE REGULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HIPAAS PROVISIONS AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES IN THE DIFFERENT STATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

STANDARDIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS STATE LINES.

ERISA

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA),

REGULATES HOW GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A SET OF LAWS AND

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC INTERPRETATION BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL COURTS. ERISA PLACES CONTROLS ON HOW OUR

BUSINESS UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MAINTAIN SELF-FUNDED PLANS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE ERISA REGULATIONS.

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE TYPICALLY HAVE AND ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS

AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS, AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT,

THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. SUCH GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM

PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS OR REVIEWS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

SOME OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS HAVE LIMITED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING VARIOUS TAX, TARIFF AND TRADE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INVESTMENT RULES AND LAWS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN

COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND

WELL-BEING SERVICES COMPANY WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATORS AND BUSINESS SERVICES OUTSOURCING COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE

FORMED NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS, SPECIALTY BENEFIT PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, AND VARIOUS HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONSULTING COMPANIES. FOR OUR UNIPRISE AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC.,

CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HUMANA INC., AND WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER ENTERPRISES CONCENTRATED IN MORE

LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. OUR SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES AND INGENIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BUSINESSES. NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THESE MARKETS, ALSO CONTRIBUTE

TO A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES RELATE TO THE SALES AND PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CONSUMER SATISFACTION; THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES; CARE DELIVERY; NETWORK CAPABILITIES; MARKET SHARE; PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS; FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION.

EMPLOYEES

EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 55,000 INDIVIDUALS. WE BELIEVE OUR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ARE POSITIVE.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS

REVENUES

REVENUES CONSIST OF PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS; SERVICE REVENUES, WHICH PRIMARILY INCLUDE FEES FOR MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATIVE AND CONSULTING SERVICES; AND INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME.

PREMIUM REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH

THE PREMIUM IS FIXED, TYPICALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND WE ASSUME THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING OUR CUSTOMERS HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. SERVICE REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FEES DERIVED FROM SERVICES PERFORMED

FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE MEDICAL COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. FOR BOTH

PREMIUM RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, WE PROVIDE COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES; TRANSACTION PROCESSING; CUSTOMER,

CONSUMER AND CARE PROVIDER SERVICES; AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2005 INCREASED BY $8.1 BILLION, OR 22%, TO $45.4 BILLION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004, CONSOLIDATED

REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 11% IN 2005 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF RATE INCREASES ON PREMIUM-BASED AND FEE-BASED SERVICES AND GROWTH IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED ACROSS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF 2005 CONSOLIDATED REVENUE TRENDS

FOR EACH OF OUR THREE REVENUE COMPONENTS.

PREMIUM REVENUES

CONSOLIDATED PREMIUM REVENUES TOTALED $41.1 BILLION IN 2005, AN INCREASE OF $7.6 BILLION, OR 23%, OVER 2004. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, CONSOLIDATED PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 11% OVER 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY PREMIUM RATE INCREASES AND A MODEST INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY $5.1 BILLION, OR 24%, OVER 2004. EXCLUDING PREMIUM REVENUES FROM BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004,

UNITEDHEALTHCARE PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 9% OVER 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AVERAGE NET PREMIUM RATE INCREASES OF APPROXIMATELY 8% TO 9% ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RENEWING COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, OVATIONS PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY $1.8 BILLION, OR 24%, OVER 2004. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, OVATIONS PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 20% OVER 2004, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

SERVED BY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AND BY MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS PROVIDED TO AARP MEMBERS, AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES ON THESE PRODUCTS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM AMERICHOICES MEDICAID PROGRAMS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION, OR

9%, OVER 2004 DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PREMIUM RATE INCREASES. THE REMAINING PREMIUM REVENUE INCREASE IS DUE MAINLY TO STRONG GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY SEVERAL SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES BUSINESSES UNDER PREMIUM-BASED ARRANGEMENTS.

SERVICE REVENUES

SERVICE REVENUES IN 2005 TOTALED $3.8 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF $473 MILLION, OR 14%, OVER 2004. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AGGREGATE GROWTH OF 8% IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNIPRISE AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE UNDER FEE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS DURING 2005, EXCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS ANNUAL RATE INCREASES. IN ADDITION, INGENIX SERVICE REVENUES INCREASED BY MORE THAN 20% DUE TO GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CLINICAL RESEARCH BUSINESSES AS WELL AS BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE

BEGINNING OF 2004.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME

INVESTMENT AND

OTHER INCOME TOTALED $499 MILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $111 MILLION OVER 2004. INTEREST INCOME INCREASED BY $126 MILLION IN 2005, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INCREASED LEVELS OF CASH AND FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS DURING THE YEAR DUE TO

THE ACQUISITIONS OF OXFORD AND MAMSI AS WELL AS HIGHER YIELDS ON FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. NET CAPITAL GAINS ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE $4 MILLION IN 2005, A DECREASE OF $15 MILLION FROM 2004.

MEDICAL COSTS

THE COMBINATION OF PRICING, BENEFIT DESIGNS, CONSUMER HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE FACILITATION EFFORTS IS REFLECTED IN

THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO (MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES). THE CONSOLIDATED MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED FROM 80.6% IN 2004 TO 79.7% IN 2005. EXCLUDING THE AARP BUSINESS

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES DISCLOSURE OF THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO EXCLUDING THE AARP BUSINESS IS MEANINGFUL SINCE UNDERWRITING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE AARP BUSINESS

ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH A RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF). ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS AT RISK FOR UNDERWRITING LOSSES TO THE EXTENT CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO

FUND ANY UNDERWRITING DEFICITS TO DATE, AND MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE RSF BALANCE IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER POTENTIAL FUTURE UNDERWRITING OR OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT DURING THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED FROM 79.5% IN 2004 TO 78.6% IN 2005. THESE MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN PRODUCT, BUSINESS

AND CUSTOMER MIX AND AN INCREASE IN FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR PERIODS.

EACH PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF REVISIONS IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS. CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS, RESULTING FROM MORE COMPLETE

CLAIM INFORMATION, IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS REPORTED FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2005 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL

YEARS. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2004 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $210 MILLION OF FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. THE INCREASE IN FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED MEDICAL

COSTS AS WELL AS GROWTH IN THE SIZE OF THE MEDICAL COST BASE AND RELATED MEDICAL PAYABLES DUE TO ORGANIC GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004.

ON AN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR BASIS, 2005 MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED $5.7 BILLION, OR 21%, OVER 2004. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, MEDICAL

COSTS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 9% DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A 7% TO 8% INCREASE IN MEDICAL COST TREND DUE TO BOTH INFLATION AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE CONSUMPTION AS WELL AS ORGANIC GROWTH.

OPERATING COSTS

THE OPERATING COST RATIO (OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES) FOR 2005 WAS 15.0%, DOWN FROM 15.4% IN 2004. THIS DECREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REVENUE MIX CHANGES, WITH PREMIUM REVENUES GROWING AT A FASTER RATE THAN SERVICE REVENUES LARGELY DUE TO RECENT ACQUISITIONS. OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN OPERATING

COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF FEE-BASED REVENUES. ADDITIONALLY, THE DECREASE IN THE OPERATING COST RATIO REFLECTS PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND OTHER COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.

ON AN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR BASIS, OPERATING COSTS FOR 2005 INCREASED $1.1 BILLION, OR 19%, OVER

2004. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, OPERATING COSTS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 11%. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY AN 8% INCREASE IN TOTAL INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND UNIPRISE DURING 2005, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

ACQUISITIONS, GROWTH IN SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES AND INGENIX AND GENERAL OPERATING COST INFLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND OTHER COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN 2005 WAS $453 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $79 MILLION, OR 21%,

OVER 2004. APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION OF THIS INCREASE WAS RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004. THE REMAINING INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION FROM HIGHER

LEVELS OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS, BUSINESS GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004.

INCOME TAXES

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 35.7% IN 2005, COMPARED TO 34.9% IN 2004. THE INCREASE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS OF PRIOR YEAR TAX RETURNS DURING 2004.

EXCLUDING THESE SETTLEMENTS, THE 2004 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS THE 2005 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

REVENUE ADVANCE OVER 2004 LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OVATIONS MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS PROVIDED TO AARP MEMBERS AND BY ITS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES ON THESE PRODUCTS.

THE REMAINING INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES REVENUES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN 8% INCREASE IN AMERICHOICES REVENUES, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PREMIUM REVENUE RATE INCREASES ON MEDICAID PRODUCTS.

HEALTH CARE SERVICES EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2005 WERE $3.8 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN

INCREASE OF $1.0 BILLION, OR 36%, OVER 2004. THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNITEDHEALTHCARES

COMMERCIAL FEE-BASED PRODUCTS, AND THE ACQUISITIONS OF OXFORD AND MAMSI DURING 2004. UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED TO 78.2% IN 2005 FROM 79.0% IN 2004 MAINLY DUE TO CHANGES IN PRODUCT, BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER MIX.

HEALTH CARE SERVICES 2005 OPERATING MARGIN WAS 9.5%, AN

21

20%, OVER 2004 DUE PRIMARILY TO NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. AMERICHOICES MEDICAID ENROLLMENT DECREASED BY 10,000 FROM 2004 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPATION IN ONE MARKET DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW

TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICES, CONSUMER CONNECTIVITY AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SERVICES NATIONWIDE TO LARGE EMPLOYERS AND HEALTH PLANS, AND PROVIDES HEALTH-RELATED CONSUMER AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. UNIPRISE REVENUES IN 2005

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS

REVENUES

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES INCREASED BY $8.4 BILLION, OR 29%, IN 2004 TO $37.2 BILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF REVENUES FROM BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2003. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ACQUISITIONS, CONSOLIDATED REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 8% IN 2004 AS A RESULT OF RATE INCREASES ON PREMIUM-BASED AND FEE-BASED SERVICES AND GROWTH ACROSS BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF 2004 CONSOLIDATED REVENUE TRENDS FOR EACH OF OUR THREE REVENUE COMPONENTS.

PREMIUM REVENUES

CONSOLIDATED PREMIUM REVENUES IN 2004 TOTALED $33.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $8.0 BILLION, OR 32%, OVER 2003. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY

APPROXIMATELY 8% IN 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE IN PART TO AVERAGE NET PREMIUM RATE INCREASES OF APPROXIMATELY 9% ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RENEWING COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

SERVED BY UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND CHANGES IN THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT BENEFIT AND CUSTOMER MIX. IN ADDITION, OVATIONS PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED LARGELY DUE TO INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IT SERVES

THROUGH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX RELATED TO MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES ON ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM AMERICHOICES MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SPECIALIZED CARE

SERVICES BUSINESSES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO ADVANCES IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY THOSE BUSINESSES.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SERVICE REVENUES

SERVICE REVENUES IN 2004 TOTALED $3.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $217 MILLION, OR 7%, OVER

2003. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AGGREGATE GROWTH OF 4% IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNIPRISE AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE UNDER FEE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS DURING 2004, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS

ANNUAL RATE INCREASES. IN ADDITION, INGENIX SERVICE REVENUES INCREASED DUE TO NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CLINICAL RESEARCH BUSINESSES.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME TOTALED $388 MILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $131 MILLION OVER 2003. INTEREST INCOME INCREASED

BY $134 MILLION IN 2004, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INCREASED LEVELS OF CASH AND FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS DURING THE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF OXFORD, MAMSI AND GOLDEN RULE FINANCIAL CORPORATION (GOLDEN RULE), WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN

NOVEMBER 2003. NET CAPITAL GAINS ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE $19 MILLION IN 2004, A DECREASE OF $3 MILLION FROM 2003.

MEDICAL COSTS

THE CONSOLIDATED MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED FROM 81.4% IN 2003 TO 80.6% IN 2004. EXCLUDING THE AARP BUSINESS, THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED FROM 80.0% IN 2003 TO 79.5% IN 2004. THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASE

RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM NET PREMIUM RATE INCREASES THAT SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED OVERALL MEDICAL BENEFIT COST INCREASES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT, BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER MIX.

EACH PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF REVISIONS IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS. CHANGES IN

MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS REPORTED FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2004 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $210 MILLION OF FAVORABLE MEDICAL

COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2003 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION OF FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS.

ON AN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR BASIS, 2004 MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED $6.3 BILLION, OR 30%, OVER 2003 PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS

OF OXFORD, MAMSI AND GOLDEN RULE. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 8% DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY MEDICAL COST INFLATION AND A MODERATE INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE CONSUMPTION.

OPERATING COSTS

THE OPERATING COST RATIO FOR 2004 WAS 15.4%, DOWN FROM 16.9% IN 2003. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY REVENUE MIX CHANGES, WITH PREMIUM REVENUES

GROWING AT A FASTER RATE THAN SERVICE REVENUES LARGELY DUE TO RECENT ACQUISITIONS. THE EXISTENCE OF PREMIUM REVENUES WITHIN OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS CAUSE THEM TO HAVE LOWER OPERATING COST RATIOS THAN FEE-BASED PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE NO PREMIUM

REVENUES. ADDITIONALLY, THE DECREASE IN THE OPERATING COST RATIO REFLECTS PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND OTHER COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.

ON AN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR BASIS, OPERATING COSTS FOR 2004 INCREASED $868 MILLION, OR 18%, OVER 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF OXFORD, MAMSI AND GOLDEN RULE.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, OPERATING COSTS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 3%. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A MORE THAN 3% INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND UNIPRISE IN 2004, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

ACQUISITIONS, AND GENERAL OPERATING COST INFLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND OTHER COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN 2004 WAS $374 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $75 MILLION, OR 25%, OVER 2003. APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION OF THIS INCREASE IS RELATED TO INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS IN 2004. THE REMAINING INCREASE IS DUE PRIMARILY TO ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS, BUSINESS

GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME TAXES

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 34.9% IN 2004, COMPARED TO 35.7% IN 2003. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS OF PRIOR YEAR INCOME TAX RETURNS

DURING 2004.

APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION OF THIS INCREASE, DRIVEN BY AVERAGE PREMIUM RATE INCREASES OF APPROXIMATELY 9% ON RENEWING COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED BUSINESS AND GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY FEE-BASED PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT

DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS. OVATIONS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $770 MILLION TO THE REVENUE ADVANCE OVER 2003 DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY

OVATIONS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX RELATED TO MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS IT PROVIDES TO AARP MEMBERS, AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES ON ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS. THE REMAINING INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES REVENUES IS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY AMERICHOICES MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND MEDICAID PREMIUM RATE INCREASES.

HEALTH CARE SERVICES EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2004 WERE $2.8 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $945 MILLION, OR 51%, OVER 2003. THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED

FROM OVATIONS AND UNITEDHEALTHCARES REVENUE GROWTH, IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS OF OXFORD, MAMSI AND GOLDEN RULE. UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL

MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED TO 79.0% IN 2004 FROM 80.0% IN 2003. THE DECREASE IN THE COMMERCIAL MEDICAL CARE RATIO WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET PREMIUM RATE INCREASES THAT SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED OVERALL MEDICAL BENEFIT COST INCREASES AND CHANGES IN

BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER MIX. HEALTH CARE SERVICES 2004 OPERATING MARGIN WAS 8.6%, AN INCREASE OF 110 BASIS

POINTS OVER 2003. THIS INCREASE WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF THE IMPROVED COMMERCIAL MEDICAL CARE RATIO AND CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER

MIX.

MEMBERS.

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY

UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, INCREASED BY NEARLY 2.7 MILLION, OR 32%, OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THE 2004 ACQUISITIONS OF OXFORD, MAMSI AND A SMALLER REGIONAL HEALTH PLAN, THE NUMBER OF

INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL BUSINESS INCREASED BY 245,000. THIS INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF 285,000 IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH FEE-BASED PRODUCTS, DRIVEN BY NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS

CONVERTING FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS TO FEE-BASED PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 40,000 IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH RISK-BASED PRODUCTS RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM CUSTOMERS CONVERTING TO SELF-FUNDED, FEE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS AND

A COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRICING ENVIRONMENT.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT

OF THE OXFORD ACQUISITION, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OVATIONS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS INCREASED BY 30,000, OR 13%, FROM 2003. AMERICHOICES MEDICAID ENROLLMENT INCREASED BY 155,000, OR 14%, DUE TO ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE

NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED AND THE ACQUISITION OF A MEDICAID HEALTH PLAN IN MICHIGAN IN FEBRUARY 2004, RESULTING IN THE ADDITION OF APPROXIMATELY 95,000 INDIVIDUALS SERVED.

UNIPRISE

UNIPRISE REVENUES IN 2004 WERE $3.4 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 8% OVER 2003. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH OF 4% IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

SERVED BY UNIPRISE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, AND ANNUAL SERVICE FEE RATE INCREASES FOR SELF-INSURED CUSTOMERS. UNIPRISE SERVED 9.9 MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND 9.1 MILLION INDIVIDUALS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY.

UNIPRISE EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2004 WERE $677 MILLION,

REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF 11% OVER 2003. OPERATING MARGIN FOR 2004 IMPROVED TO 20.1% FROM 19.6% IN 2003. UNIPRISE HAS EXPANDED ITS OPERATING MARGIN THROUGH OPERATING COST EFFICIENCIES DERIVED FROM PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND

COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES THAT HAVE REDUCED LABOR AND OCCUPANCY COSTS IN ITS TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, BILLING AND ENROLLMENT FUNCTIONS.

SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES

SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES REVENUES DURING 2004 OF $2.3 BILLION INCREASED BY $417 MILLION, OR 22%, OVER 2003. THIS INCREASE WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE

NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY ITS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS, ITS DENTAL SERVICES BUSINESS AND ITS VISION CARE BENEFITS BUSINESS; RATE INCREASES RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES; AND INCREMENTAL REVENUES RELATED TO BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE

THE BEGINNING OF 2003 OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2004 OF $485 MILLION INCREASED $100 MILLION, OR 26%, OVER 2003. SPECIALIZED CARE

SERVICES OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED TO 21.1% IN 2004, UP FROM 20.5% IN 2003. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY OPERATIONAL AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES BUSINESSES AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE PRODUCTION

AND SERVICE OPERATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY OF SERVICE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BUSINESS MIX SHIFT TOWARD HIGHER REVENUE, LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS.

INGENIX

INGENIX REVENUES IN 2004 OF $670 MILLION INCREASED BY $96 MILLION, OR 17%, OVER 2003. THIS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN

THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES. EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2004 WERE $129 MILLION, UP $54 MILLION, OR 72%, FROM 2003. OPERATING MARGIN WAS 19.3% IN 2004, UP FROM 13.1% IN 2003. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND

OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AND IMPROVING GROSS MARGINS IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CLINICAL RESEARCH BUSINESSES.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE MANAGE OUR CASH, INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE SO WE ARE ABLE TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS WHILE MAINTAINING STRONG FINANCIAL

FLEXIBILITY AND LIQUIDITY. WE FORECAST, ANALYZE AND MONITOR OUR CASH FLOWS TO ENABLE PRUDENT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND FINANCING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR FINANCIAL STRATEGY.

OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. A MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS HELD BY OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE

IN THE FORM OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS. AFTER CONSIDERING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE GENERALLY INVEST CASH OF REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED OUR SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS IN LONGER TERM, INVESTMENT-GRADE,

MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT RETURN. FACTORS WE CONSIDER IN MAKING THESE INVESTMENT DECISIONS INCLUDE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED INVESTMENT POLICY, REGULATORY LIMITATIONS, RETURN OBJECTIVES, TAX

IMPLICATIONS, RISK TOLERANCE AND MATURITY DATES. OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR SALE TO MEET SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY AND OTHER NEEDS. CASH IN EXCESS OF THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR REGULATED ENTITIES ARE PAID TO THEIR NON-REGULATED PARENT

COMPANIES, TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, WHEN AND AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.

OUR NON-REGULATED BUSINESSES ALSO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FROM OPERATIONS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE. CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THESE ENTITIES, COMBINED WITH THE ISSUANCE

OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, LONG-TERM DEBT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESSES IN THE FORM OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF OUR SERVICES THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, AND TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, ARE PRINCIPALLY FROM NET EARNINGS, PRIOR TO DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. AS A RESULT,

ANY FUTURE DECLINE IN OUR PROFITABILITY MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. THE LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED INSURED BUSINESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY PREDICT AND PRICE FOR HEALTH CARE AND OPERATING

COST INCREASES. THIS RISK IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY THE DIVERSITY OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF OUR RISK-BASED BUSINESS AND OUR DISCIPLINED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROCESSES, WHICH SEEK TO MATCH PREMIUM RATE INCREASES WITH

FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS. IN 2005, A HYPOTHETICAL UNEXPECTED 1% INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL INSURED MEDICAL COSTS WOULD HAVE REDUCED NET EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION.

THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING IN THE FORM OF DEBT OR EQUITY IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR PROFITABILITY, OPERATING CASH

FLOWS, DEBT LEVELS, DEBT RATINGS, DEBT COVENANTS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND MARKET CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS TOWARD MAINTAINING FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY MITIGATE MUCH OF THIS RISK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH AND INVESTMENTS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE $4.3 BILLION IN 2005, AN INCREASE OVER $4.1 BILLION IN 2004. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN

INCREASE OF $834 MILLION IN NET INCOME PRIOR TO DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NONCASH ITEMS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $643 MILLION IN CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES. WE GENERATED OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM WORKING

CAPITAL CHANGES OF $406 MILLION IN 2005 AND $1,049 MILLION IN 2004. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE COMPANY RECEIVING ONLY ELEVEN MONTHLY MEDICARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS DURING 2005 FROM THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

SERVICES (CMS) RATHER THAN THE TWELVE MONTHLY PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN 2004, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE CHANGE IN REPORTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS BY $375 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS REDUCED GROWTH IN MEDICAL PAYABLES DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 DUE IN

PART TO AN INCREASE IN ELECTRONIC CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER DISBURSEMENT PROCESS EFFICIENCIES.

WE MAINTAINED A STRONG FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY POSITION, WITH CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF $15.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. TOTAL CASH AND INVESTMENTS INCREASED BY $2.7 BILLION SINCE DECEMBER 31,

2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH AND INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED THROUGH BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005, STRONG OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND CASH RECEIVED FROM DEBT ISSUANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, CASH PAID FOR BUSINESS

ACQUISITIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

AS FURTHER DESCRIBED UNDER REGULATORY

CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS THAT RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION OF OUR $15.0 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES

IN ADDITION TO OUR STRONG CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE USE COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND DEBT TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, WE HAD COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT OUTSTANDING OF APPROXIMATELY $7.1 BILLION AND $4.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL

RATIO WAS 28.6% AND 27.3% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004, RESPECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE THE PRUDENT USE OF DEBT LEVERAGE OPTIMIZES OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND RETURN ON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WHILE MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE

LIQUIDITY.

ON DECEMBER 20, 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED PACIFICARE. UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, PACIFICARE SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED 1.1 SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK AND $21.50 IN CASH FOR EACH SHARE OF PACIFICARE COMMON STOCK THEY OWNED. TOTAL CONSIDERATION ISSUED FOR THE TRANSACTION WAS APPROXIMATELY $8.8

BILLION, COMPOSED OF APPROXIMATELY 99.2 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK (VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS SHARE CLOSING PRICE FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE, THE DAY OF AND TWO DAYS

AFTER THE ACQUISITION ANNOUNCEMENT DATE OF JULY 6, 2005), APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION IN CASH, $960 MILLION CASH PAID TO RETIRE PACIFICARES EXISTING DEBT AND UNITEDHEALTH GROUP VESTED COMMON STOCK OPTIONS WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $420 MILLION ISSUED IN EXCHANGE FOR PACIFICARES OUTSTANDING VESTED COMMON STOCK OPTIONS.

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006, OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT ACQUIRED JOHN DEERE HEALTH CARE, INC. (JOHN DEERE HEALTH). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PAID APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION IN CASH IN

EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF JOHN DEERE HEALTH. WE ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FINANCE THE JOHN DEERE HEALTH PURCHASE PRICE.

ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2005, OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT ACQUIRED NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PARTNERSHIP (NHP). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PAID

APPROXIMATELY $185 MILLION IN CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF NHP. WE ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FINANCE THE NHP PURCHASE PRICE.

ON DECEMBER 10, 2004, OUR UNIPRISE BUSINESS SEGMENT ACQUIRED DEFINITY HEALTH CORPORATION (DEFINITY). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PAID $305 MILLION

IN CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING STOCK OF DEFINITY. WE USED AVAILABLE CASH AND ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FINANCE THE DEFINITY PURCHASE PRICE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON JULY 29, 2004, OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT ACQUIRED OXFORD. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE

AGREEMENT, OXFORD SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED 1.2714 SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK AND $16.17 IN CASH FOR EACH SHARE OF OXFORD COMMON STOCK THEY OWNED. TOTAL CONSIDERATION ISSUED WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.0 BILLION, COMPOSED OF APPROXIMATELY

104.4 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK (VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $3.4 BILLION BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS SHARE CLOSING PRICE FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE, THE DAY OF AND TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACQUISITION

ANNOUNCEMENT DATE OF APRIL 26, 2004), APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION IN CASH AND UNITEDHEALTH GROUP VESTED COMMON STOCK OPTIONS WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $240 MILLION ISSUED IN EXCHANGE FOR OXFORDS OUTSTANDING VESTED COMMON STOCK

OPTIONS.

ON FEBRUARY 10, 2004, OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT

ACQUIRED MAMSI. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, MAMSI SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED 1.64 SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK AND $18 IN CASH FOR EACH SHARE OF MAMSI COMMON STOCK THEY OWNED. TOTAL CONSIDERATION ISSUED WAS APPROXIMATELY

$2.7 BILLION, COMPOSED OF 72.8 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK (VALUED AT $1.9 BILLION BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS SHARE CLOSING PRICE FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE, THE DAY OF AND TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACQUISITION

ANNOUNCEMENT DATE OF OCTOBER 27, 2003) AND APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION IN CASH.

IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2005, WE ISSUED $2.6 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION DESCRIBED ABOVE AND TO RETIRE A PORTION OF THE PACIFICARE DEBT AT THE

CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS TO REFINANCE CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER HAD INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 4.2% TO 4.4%.

IN MARCH 2005, WE ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 4.9% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2015. WE USED THE

PROCEEDS FROM THIS BORROWING FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

IN JULY 2004, WE ISSUED $1.2 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND THE CASH PORTION OF THE OXFORD PURCHASE PRICE. IN AUGUST 2004, WE

REFINANCED THE COMMERCIAL PAPER BY ISSUING $550 MILLION OF 3.4% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE AUGUST 2007, $450 MILLION OF 4.1% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE AUGUST 2009 AND $500 MILLION OF 5.0% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE AUGUST 2014.

IN FEBRUARY 2004, WE ISSUED $250 MILLION OF 3.8% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2009 AND $250

MILLION OF 4.8% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2014. WE USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE FEBRUARY 2004 BORROWINGS TO FINANCE A MAJORITY OF THE CASH PORTION OF THE MAMSI PURCHASE PRICE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST COSTS WITH THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE RECEIVED ON OUR CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO CONVERT THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM A FIXED RATE TO A VARIABLE RATE. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE INTEREST

RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS HAVE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $3.4 BILLION WITH VARIABLE RATES THAT ARE BENCHMARKED TO THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR). AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE RATE USED TO ACCRUE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THESE AGREEMENTS

RANGED FROM 4.3% TO 5.0%. THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE FIXED AND VARIABLE RATES TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENTS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2005, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR $1.0 BILLION FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING

CREDIT FACILITY SUPPORTING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. WE INCREASED THE CAPACITY TO $1.3 BILLION AND EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE TO DECEMBER 2010. IN OCTOBER 2005, WE EXECUTED A $3.0 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO SUPPORT A $3.0

BILLION INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER EITHER OF THESE CREDIT FACILITIES.

PACIFICARE HAD APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION PAR VALUE OF 3% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES (CONVERTIBLE NOTES) WHICH WERE CONVERTIBLE INTO APPROXIMATELY

5.2 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS COMMON STOCK AND $102 MILLION OF CASH AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, WE INITIATED A CONSENT SOLICITATION TO ALL OF THE HOLDERS OF OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES PURSUANT TO WHICH

WE OFFERED TO COMPENSATE ALL HOLDERS WHO ELECTED TO CONVERT THEIR NOTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING TERMS AND CONSENT TO AN AMENDMENT TO A COVENANT IN THE INDENTURE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOVERNING THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE COMPENSATION CONSISTED OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST THROUGH OCTOBER 18, 2007, THE EARLIEST MANDATORY REDEMPTION

DATE, PLUS A PRO RATA SHARE OF $1 MILLION. ON JANUARY 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY 91% OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE TENDERED PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, FOR WHICH WE ISSUED 4.8 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK AND CASH OF $99 MILLION.

OUR DEBT ARRANGEMENTS AND CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS, THE

MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO (CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) BELOW 45% AND TO EXCEED SPECIFIED MINIMUM

INTEREST COVERAGE LEVELS. WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL DEBT COVENANTS.

OUR SENIOR DEBT IS RATED A BY STANDARD & POORS (S&P) AND FITCH, AND A2 BY MOODYS. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1 BY S&P, F-1 BY FITCH,

AND P-1 BY MOODYS. CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENTION OF MAINTAINING OUR SENIOR DEBT RATINGS IN THE A RANGE, WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO MAINTAIN OUR DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO AT APPROXIMATELY 30% OR LESS. A SIGNIFICANT

DOWNGRADE IN OUR DEBT OR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BORROWING CAPACITY AND COSTS.

UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, WE MAINTAIN A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON VOLUME, PRICING AND

TIMING. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE REPURCHASED 53.6 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $48 PER SHARE AND AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 55.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS DISCRETIONARY AS WE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REPURCHASE SHARES. WE REPURCHASE SHARES BECAUSE WE

BELIEVE IT IS A PRUDENT USE OF CAPITAL. A DECISION BY THE COMPANY TO DISCONTINUE SHARE REPURCHASES WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE A $4.0 BILLION UNIVERSAL S-3 SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT (FOR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER

SECURITIES) WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC. IN ADDITION, WE ARE CONSIDERED A WELL KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER UNDER THE SECURITIES OFFERING REFORM ACT THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN DECEMBER 2005. WE HAVE NOT YET ISSUED ANY SECURITIES

UNDER THIS SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. WE MAY PUBLICLY OFFER SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING. WE INTEND TO ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006 TO REFINANCE SOME OR ALL OF

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING. UNDER OUR S-4 ACQUISITION SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WE HAVE REMAINING ISSUING CAPACITY OF 48.6 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. WE FILED SEPARATE S-4

REGISTRATION STATEMENTS FOR THE 72.8 MILLION SHARES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FEBRUARY 2004 ACQUISITION OF MAMSI, THE 104.4 MILLION SHARES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE JULY 2004 ACQUISITION OF OXFORD AND THE 99.2 MILLION SHARES

ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DECEMBER 2005 ACQUISITION OF PACIFICARE DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY.

INCLUDES OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND MINORITY INTEREST

CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER

MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR COMMITMENTS THAT REQUIRE CASH RESOURCES; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS. THIS INCLUDES INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND

TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS, AND MAY INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS.

AARP

IN JANUARY 1998, WE ENTERED INTO A 10-YEAR CONTRACT TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF AARP. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO SUPPLEMENT BENEFITS COVERED UNDER TRADITIONAL MEDICARE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, WE ARE COMPENSATED FOR TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND OTHER SERVICES AS WELL AS FOR

ASSUMING UNDERWRITING RISK. WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO COMPLEMENT THE INSURANCE OFFERINGS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM OUR PORTION OF THE AARP INSURANCE OFFERINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY $4.9 BILLION IN 2005,

$4.5 BILLION IN 2004 AND $4.1 BILLION IN 2003.

THE UNDERWRITING GAINS OR

LOSSES RELATED TO THE AARP BUSINESS ARE DIRECTLY RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO A RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF). THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE PREMIUM REVENUE, MEDICAL COSTS, INVESTMENT INCOME, ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES, MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. UNDERWRITING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF AND ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS, UNLESS CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES WERE

TO EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF. TO THE EXTENT UNDERWRITING LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, WE WOULD HAVE TO FUND THE DEFICIT. ANY DEFICIT WE FUND COULD BE RECOVERED BY UNDERWRITING GAINS IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, WE HAVE

NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FUND ANY UNDERWRITING DEFICITS. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE RSF BALANCE IS REPORTED IN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE BELIEVE THE

RSF BALANCE IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER POTENTIAL FUTURE UNDERWRITING OR OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT

THE COMPANY HAS CONTRACTED WITH THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES TO SERVE AS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN SPONSOR OFFERING

MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INSURANCE COVERAGE TO ELIGIBLE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2006. THIS PRODUCT IS EITHER OFFERED AS A STAND-ALONE PRODUCT OR AS AN ELEMENT OF THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS.

AS A RESULT OF THIS CONTRACT AND THE DECEMBER 2005 ACQUISITION OF PACIFICARE, PREMIUM

REVENUES FROM MEDICARE-RELATED PROGRAMS, WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN APPROXIMATELY 10% OF TOTAL PREMIUM REVENUES, ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO APPROXIMATELY 25% IN 2006.

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC). THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A REGULATED SUBSIDIARY, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS LIMITED BASED ON THE ENTITYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY

NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. THE AGENCIES THAT ASSESS OUR CREDITWORTHINESS ALSO CONSIDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY LEVELS WHEN ESTABLISHING OUR DEBT RATINGS. CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENT TO MAINTAIN OUR SENIOR DEBT RATINGS IN THE A

RANGE, WE MAINTAIN AN AGGREGATE STATUTORY CAPITAL LEVEL FOR OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM LEVEL REGULATORS REQUIRE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES HAD AGGREGATE STATUTORY CAPITAL

OF APPROXIMATELY $6.4 BILLION, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE AGGREGATE MINIMUM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE THE MOST CHALLENGING, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE THEY MUST ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN

SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVE JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE TO RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ARE THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MEDICAL COSTS

EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE EITHER NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED OR PROCESSED, AND FOR

LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL

MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, SEASONAL VARIANCES IN MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION, PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE UTILIZATION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS, MEMBERSHIP VOLUME AND

DEMOGRAPHICS, BENEFIT PLAN CHANGES, AND BUSINESS MIX CHANGES RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHY. DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND TYPE OF SERVICE, THE TYPICAL BILLING LAG FOR SERVICES CAN RANGE FROM TWO TO 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF

SERVICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO MEDICAL CARE SERVICES ARE KNOWN AND SETTLED WITHIN NINE TO 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. WE ESTIMATE LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF

POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES.

EACH PERIOD, WE RE-EXAMINE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF

THE ESTIMATES, AND INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS

PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS. IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL DECREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). IF THE

REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL INCREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). HISTORICALLY, THE NET IMPACT OF ESTIMATE DEVELOPMENTS HAS REPRESENTED LESS

THAN 1% OF ANNUAL MEDICAL COSTS, LESS THAN 5% OF ANNUAL EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND LESS THAN 4% OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE.

IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR DISCRETE PERIOD, ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BOTH THE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN

THE CURRENT PERIOD PERTAINING TO PRIOR PERIODS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS PERTAINING TO THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE ACCOMPANYING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE NET IMPACT OF FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON MEDICAL COSTS AND

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS (IN MILLIONS).

OUR ESTIMATE OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE REPRESENTS

MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY FOR UNPAID MEDICAL COSTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, DEVELOPED USING CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACTUARIAL METHODS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE IS REASONABLE AND

ADEQUATE TO COVER THE COMPANYS LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005; HOWEVER, ACTUAL CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES. THE INCREASE IN FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT IN 2005 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY

LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED MEDICAL COSTS AS WELL AS GROWTH IN THE SIZE OF THE MEDICAL COST BASE AND RELATED MEDICAL PAYABLES DUE TO ORGANIC GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004. ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL 1% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR

DECEMBER 31, 2005 ESTIMATES OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE AND ACTUAL COSTS PAYABLE, EXCLUDING THE AARP BUSINESS, 2005 EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BY $63 MILLION AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WOULD INCREASE OR

DECREASE BY $0.03 PER SHARE.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE ROUTINELY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS DISPUTES,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS. OUR ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN

ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERING OUR INSURANCE COVERAGES, IF ANY, FOR SUCH MATTERS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY MATTERS CURRENTLY THREATENED OR PENDING WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OR

ASSUMPTIONS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING

GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, OF $19.9 BILLION. WE REVIEW OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, AND WE REVIEW OUR REMAINING LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE WE MIGHT NOT RECOVER

THEIR CARRYING VALUE. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ASSESS THEIR RECOVERABILITY, WE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE UTILITY AND ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS, WHICH IN TURN ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR THEIR RELATED ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS THAT COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

REVENUES

REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY DERIVED FROM HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS. WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY BILLED

MONTHLY AT A CONTRACTED RATE PER ELIGIBLE PERSON MULTIPLIED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES, AS RECORDED IN OUR RECORDS. EMPLOYER GROUPS GENERALLY PROVIDE US WITH CHANGES TO THEIR ELIGIBLE POPULATION ONE MONTH IN ARREARS.

EACH BILLING INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT FOR PRIOR MONTH CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY STATUS THAT WERE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR PREVIOUS BILLING. WE ESTIMATE AND ADJUST THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ACCORDINGLY. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED

ON HISTORICAL TRENDS, PREMIUMS BILLED, THE LEVEL OF CONTRACT RENEWAL ACTIVITY AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. WE REVISE ESTIMATES OF REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS EACH PERIOD, AND RECORD CHANGES IN THE PERIOD THEY BECOME KNOWN.

INVESTMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $9.6 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY HELD IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. OUR

INVESTMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. WE EXCLUDE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE FROM EARNINGS AND REPORT THEM TOGETHER, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE

COMPONENT IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR INVESTMENTS HAD GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS OF $105 MILLION AND GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES OF

$53 MILLION. IF ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, BASED ON ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT FACTORS, WE RECORD A REALIZED LOSS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN EVALUATING WHETHER A DECLINE IN AN INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE THESE JUDGMENTS. WE REVISE IMPAIRMENT JUDGMENTS WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN

AND RECORD ANY RESULTING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AT THAT TIME. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR INDUSTRY AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL

SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE.

INFLATION

THE CURRENT NATIONAL HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION

RATE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE GENERAL INFLATION RATE. WE USE VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO LESSEN THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION. THESE INCLUDE SETTING COMMERCIAL PREMIUMS BASED ON ANTICIPATED HEALTH CARE COSTS AND COORDINATING CARE WITH

PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, WE EMPHASIZE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE, APPROPRIATE USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, EDUCATION AND

CLOSING GAPS IN CARE.

WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF

HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, NEW HEALTH CARE AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, DEMANDS FROM PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS, MAJOR EPIDEMICS, AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION. BECAUSE OF THE NARROW OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST

TRENDS THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED IN ESTABLISHING PREMIUM RATES CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

LEGAL MATTERS

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE

RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED

TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES.

BEGINNING IN 1999, A SERIES OF

CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST BOTH UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND PACIFICARE, AND VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS. IN DECEMBER 2000, A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL LITIGATION CASES INVOLVING

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND OUR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING PACIFICARE, IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF FLORIDA, MIAMI DIVISION. GENERALLY, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF ERISA AND THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED CORRUPT ORGANIZATION ACT

(RICO) IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED UNDISCLOSED POLICIES INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS. OTHER ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE BREACH OF STATE PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO TIMELY REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES RENDERED.

THE CONSOLIDATED SUITS SEEK INJUNCTIVE, COMPENSATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF AS WELL AS RESTITUTION, COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THAT ORDER WAS REVIEWED

BY THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE CLASS ACTION STATUS OF THE RICO CLAIMS, BUT REVERSED AS TO THE BREACH OF CONTRACT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT AND PROMPT PAYMENT CLAIMS. DURING THE COURSE OF THE LITIGATION, THERE

HAVE BEEN CO-DEFENDANT SETTLEMENTS. THROUGH A SERIES OF MOTIONS AND APPEALS, ALL DIRECT CLAIMS AGAINST US HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ARBITRATION. A TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR SEPTEMBER 2006. THE TRIAL COURT HAS ORDERED THAT THE TRIAL BE SPLIT INTO

SEPARATE LIABILITY AND DAMAGE PROCEEDINGS. IN AUGUST 2005, THE CAPITATION-RELATED CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED FROM LITIGATION. ON JANUARY 31, 2006, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED ALL REMAINING CLAIMS AGAINST PACIFICARE. A MARCH 14, 2006 HEARING DATE

HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR OUR SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION.

ON MARCH 15, 2000,

THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK. ON APRIL 13, 2000, WE REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW

YORK. THE SUIT ALLEGES CAUSES OF ACTION BASED ON ERISA, AS WELL AS BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES, AND TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND

CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS. THE SUIT SEEKS DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE AND COMPENSATORY RELIEF AS WELL AS COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 25, 2000, WHICH ALLEGED TWO CLASSES

OF PLAINTIFFS, AN ERISA CLASS AND A NON-ERISA CLASS. AFTER THE COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN ERISA CLAIMS AND THE CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED. ON OCTOBER 25, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART

AND DENIED IN PART OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON MAY 21, 2003, WE FILED A COUNTERCLAIM COMPLAINT IN THIS MATTER ALLEGING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS AGAINST THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND ASSERTING CLAIMS BASED ON

IMPROPER BILLING PRACTICES AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER PLAINTIFF. ON MAY 26, 2004, WE FILED A MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT SEEKING THE DISMISSAL OF CERTAIN CLAIMS AND PARTIES BASED, IN PART, DUE TO LACK OF STANDING. ON JULY 16,

2004, PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, SEEKING TO ASSERT RICO VIOLATIONS.

ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF PENDING LITIGATION ARE ALWAYS UNCERTAIN, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS CURRENTLY THREATENED OR PENDING, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE,

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR EQUITY PRICES. THE COMPANYS PRIMARY MARKET RISK IS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES THAT COULD IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM DEBT.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPROXIMATELY $14.7 BILLION OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WERE DEBT SECURITIES.

ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL AND IMMEDIATE 1% INCREASE OR DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS WOULD DECREASE OR INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY

$345 MILLION. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR INDUSTRY AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE

INVESTMENT GRADE.

TO MITIGATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH THE INTEREST RATES OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT WITH THOSE OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS,

APPROXIMATELY $6.2 BILLION OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT HAD VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST AND APPROXIMATELY $0.9 BILLION HAD FIXED RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. A HYPOTHETICAL 1% INCREASE OR DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE

HAD $261 MILLION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, A PORTION OF WHICH WERE HELD BY OUR UNITEDHEALTH CAPITAL BUSINESS IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. MARKET

CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE OR TECHNOLOGY STOCKS WILL LIKEWISE IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY SUBJECT UNITEDHEALTH GROUP TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. OUR

INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE MANAGED UNDER AN INVESTMENT POLICY AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS POLICY LIMITS THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE INVESTED IN ANY ONE ISSUER AND GENERALLY LIMITS OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE LIMITED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYER GROUPS THAT CONSTITUTE OUR

CUSTOMER BASE. AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE HAVE A $1.8 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF OUR LIFE AND ANNUITY BUSINESS. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

REINSURER AND ONLY RECORD THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AMOUNTS ARE DEEMED PROBABLE OF RECOVERY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (PSLRA). WHEN USED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN FUTURE FILINGS BY US WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN OUR NEWS RELEASES, PRESENTATIONS TO SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, AND IN ORAL

STATEMENTS MADE BY OR WITH THE APPROVAL OF ONE OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE WORDS OR PHRASES BELIEVES, ANTICIPATES, EXPECTS, PLANS, SEEKS, INTENDS, WILL LIKELY

RESULT, ESTIMATES, PROJECTS OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PSLRA. THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS CERTAIN CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS THAT INVESTORS AND OTHERS SHOULD CONSIDER. EXCEPT TO

THE EXTENT OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS OR UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN FUTURE FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATING RESULTS, AND DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS HOW ANY OF

THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE CAUSED RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM DISCUSSIONS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW MAY HAVE AFFECTED PAST, AS WELL AS CURRENT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

ABOUT FUTURE RESULTS. ANY OR ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC FILINGS OR STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TURN OUT TO BE WRONG. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS DISCUSSED

BELOW WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS. BY THEIR NATURE, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OR QUANTIFY.

ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS EXPRESSED IN OUR PRIOR COMMUNICATIONS.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS.

UNDER OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS (EXCLUDING AARP) HAVE

TYPICALLY COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 75% TO 80% OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. WE GENERALLY USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO 85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR

RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HEALTH CARE COSTS. TOTAL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM

REVENUE IS TYPICALLY FIXED IN PRICE FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. WE BASE THE PREMIUMS WE CHARGE ON OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS OVER THE FIXED PREMIUM PERIOD; HOWEVER,

INFLATION, REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED USE OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES, CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES, INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. AS A MEASURE OF THE IMPACT OF MEDICAL COST ON OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS, RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED BY 1% WITHOUT A

PROPORTIONAL CHANGE IN RELATED REVENUES FOR UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL INSURED PRODUCTS, OUR ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2005 WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR

PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR WHICH CLAIMS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW, THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE WILL BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE RESULTS. THAT CHANGE CAN BE EITHER

POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE TO OUR RESULTS.

WE FACE COMPETITION IN MANY OF OUR

MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND FACE COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. FOR OUR UNIPRISE AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENTS, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY

HEALTH CARE, INC., HUMANA INC., AND WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. OUR SPECIALIZED

CARE SERVICES AND INGENIX SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES. THE ADDITION OF NEW COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CUSTOMERS ENJOY SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS. IN PARTICULAR MARKETS, COMPETITORS

MAY HAVE CAPABILITIES OR RESOURCES THAT GIVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. GREATER MARKET SHARE, ESTABLISHED REPUTATION, SUPERIOR SUPPLIER OR PROVIDER ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER FACTORS ALL CAN PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR TO THEIR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BOTH AS TO OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES. CONSOLIDATION MAY MAKE IT

MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS, TO IMPROVE THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, OR TO MAINTAIN OR ADVANCE PROFITABILITY.

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP IS IMPORTANT.

UNDER OUR 10-YEAR CONTRACT WITH AARP, WHICH COMMENCED IN 1998, WE PROVIDE MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND HOSPITAL INDEMNITY HEALTH INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR PORTION OF AARPS INSURANCE PROGRAM REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $4.9 BILLION IN ANNUAL NET PREMIUM REVENUE FROM APPROXIMATELY 3.8 MILLION AARP MEMBERS. THE AARP CONTRACT MAY BE TERMINATED EARLY BY US OR AARP

UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING A MATERIAL BREACH BY EITHER PARTY, INSOLVENCY OF EITHER PARTY, A MATERIAL

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF EITHER PARTY, AND BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENT DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO

SERVICE AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COMPETITIVELY, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY CHANGES.

SOME OF THE FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN MEDICARE REMAIN UNCERTAIN.

THE CHANGES IN MEDICARE AS A RESULT OF THE MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (MMA) ARE

COMPLEX AND WIDE-RANGING AND CONTINUE TO AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. WE HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CREATED BY THE MMA, INCLUDING MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REGIONAL

PPOS, AND SPECIAL NEEDS PLANS FOR CHRONICALLY ILL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WE HAVE INVESTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES IN CREATING NEW MEDICARE PRODUCT OFFERINGS FOR THESE INITIATIVES AND IN ANALYZING HOW TO BEST ADDRESS UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND OTHER CHANGES ARISING FROM THE MMA. IN PARTICULAR, THE PART D PROGRAM PRESENTS CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE NEW PROGRAM. OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PART D PROGRAM DEPENDS

IN PART ON COORDINATION OF INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS BETWEEN US, CMS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CMS TO CORRECT SYSTEMS ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN LOW INCOME PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO

PARTICIPATE IN PART D. THE INABILITY TO RECEIVE CORRECT INFORMATION DUE TO SYSTEMS ISSUES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENT OR US COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE PART D

PROGRAM IS BASED UPON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT, UTILIZATION, PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MATERIALLY INCORRECT, EITHER AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE PART D PROGRAM OR

OTHERWISE, OUR RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. ANY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RESULTS OF THE PART D PROGRAM ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US AS A RESULT OF THE SIZE OF OUR ENROLLMENT IN OUR PART D PROGRAM.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUNDING RISKS WITH RESPECT TO REVENUE RECEIVED FROM PARTICIPATION IN

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS.

WE PARTICIPATE AS A PAYER IN MEDICARE

ADVANTAGE, PART D, AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND RECEIVE REVENUES FROM THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE BENEFITS UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. REVENUES FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON ANNUAL FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR APPLICABLE

STATE GOVERNMENTS. FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AT THE FEDERAL OR APPLICABLE STATE LEVEL AND GENERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AND PRIORITIES. AN UNEXPECTED REDUCTION

IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO ROUTINE GOVERNMENT SCRUTINY, AND WE MUST RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO FREQUENT CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS

AND RULES GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. BROAD LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND RULES COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE

DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER

ACTIONS. WE MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. DELAYS IN OBTAINING APPROVALS OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN

OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE

PARTICIPATE IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. SUCH CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE

FUTURE.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES. LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS AT STATE

AND FEDERAL LEVELS MAY AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT METHODS AND PAYMENT RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; CLAIM PAYMENTS AND

PROCESSING; DRUG UTILIZATION AND PATIENT SAFETY EFFORTS; USE AND MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION; MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LITIGATION; AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS. WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL

ULTIMATELY BECOME BINDING LAW OR REGULATION, OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS WILL BE, BUT THEIR ENACTMENT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO EXPANDED LIABILITY, REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR

LOSS OF BUSINESS.

WE TYPICALLY ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE

OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. SUCH GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR

CHANGES IN THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, PUBLIC PERCEPTION OR PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ROUTINE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE,

DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR COMPETITIVE PRICES.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THESE COMPETITIVE PRICES. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE ADVOCATING FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXEMPT CERTAIN OF THESE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE

PROFESSIONALS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, THESE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS, LESS

DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTISPECIALTY PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE

SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDER THE TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT, THE PROVIDER RECEIVES A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM TO COVER ALL THE MEDICAL

COSTS PROVIDED TO THE CAPITATED MEMBER. UNDER SOME CAPITATED ARRANGEMENTS, THE PROVIDER MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FROM RISK SHARING AND OTHER INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS. CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF INCREASING

MEDICAL COSTS, BUT EXPOSE US TO RISK RELATED TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL CARE RESOURCES OF THE PROVIDER. TO THE EXTENT THAT A CAPITATED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION FACES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID HEALTH CARE CLAIMS THAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAPITATED PROVIDER AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PAID THE PROVIDER UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT.

THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO LITIGATION RISKS.

PERIODICALLY, WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF LEGAL ACTIONS THAT

CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER SUITS, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE

NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL

MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES. IN 1999, A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND PACIFICARE AND VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE HEALTH

BENEFITS BUSINESS, ALTHOUGH ALL CLAIMS AGAINST PACIFICARE HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. THE SUITS ARE

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF PHYSICIANS FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF FEDERAL STATUTES, INCLUDING ERISA AND RICO . IN MARCH 2000, THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

ASSOCIATION FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS. ALTHOUGH THE EXPENSES WE HAVE INCURRED TO DATE IN DEFENDING THE 1999 CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND THE

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION LAWSUIT HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR EXPENSES IN THE DEFENSE OF THESE LAWSUITS AND OTHER MATTERS, EVEN IF THEY ARE WITHOUT MERIT.

THE COMPANY IS LARGELY SELF-INSURED WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION RISKS; HOWEVER, WE MAINTAIN

EXCESS LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH OUTSIDE INSURANCE CARRIERS TO MINIMIZE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CATASTROPHIC CLAIMS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY INSURED FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS

PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED FOR THESE RISKS ARE ADEQUATE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES MAY EXCEED THE LIABILITIES RECORDED.

OUR

BUSINESSES PROVIDING PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGEMENT (PBM) SERVICES FACE REGULATORY AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE RISKS OF PROVIDING MANAGED CARE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PACIFICARE MERGER, WE ACQUIRED A PHARMACY

BENEFITS MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO PROVIDE PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH UNITEDHEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS. PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS AND UNITEDHEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND

STATE ANTI-REMUNERATION AND OTHER LAWS THAT GOVERN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATURES ARE CONSIDERING NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CURRENT

INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OF REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, IF A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT OUR PBM BUSINESS ACTS AS A FIDUCIARY UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT, OR ERISA, WE COULD BE SUBJECT

TO CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF FORMULARIES, PREFERRED DRUG LISTINGS AND THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION PROGRAMS, CONTRACTING NETWORK PRACTICES, SPECIALITY DRUG DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. OUR PBM ALSO

CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS A MAIL ORDER PHARMACY, WHICH SUBJECTS IT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS RISKS INHERENT IN THE PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS.

THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE OUR PBM SUBSIDIARY TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. WE ALSO FACE POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED ERRORS BY OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACY.

OUR BUSINESSES DEPEND ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN

OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES, PROVIDE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES, WE HAVE ACQUIRED

ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS. WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. IF THE INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WERE FOUND TO BE INACCURATE OR

UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE

PRICING, HAVE DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS HAVE REGULATORY PROBLEMS, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.

THE VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY BECOME IMPAIRED.

DUE LARGELY TO OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR ASSETS. GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY $18.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 44% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. IF WE MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON OUR BOOKS.

WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY NO LONGER BE RECOVERABLE, IN WHICH CASE A CHARGE TO EARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY. ANY

FUTURE EVALUATIONS REQUIRING AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY COULD, IN TURN, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DEBT RATINGS OR POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS.

OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND OUR

TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF

OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE MUST COMPLY WITH RESTRICTIONS ON PATIENT PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHO OBTAIN ACCESS TO SENSITIVE PATIENT INFORMATION MAINTAIN ITS

CONFIDENTIALITY.

THE USE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR

BUSINESSES IS REGULATED AT THE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE CHANGED FREQUENTLY BY LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS ADDRESS THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE

HEALTH DATA. MOST ARE DERIVED FROM THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS IN THE FEDERAL GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996, (HIPAA). HIPAA ALSO IMPOSES GUIDELINES ON OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES (AS

THIS TERM IS DEFINED IN THE HIPAA REGULATIONS). EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND PRACTICES. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PROPOSALS,

REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, AND THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. THEY ALSO MAY IMPOSE FURTHER

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR USE OF PATIENT IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT IS HOUSED IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES.

THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ACQUIRING PACIFICARE MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

WE ACQUIRED PACIFICARE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN VARIOUS BENEFITS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, BENEFITS RELATING TO A

STRONGER AND MORE DIVERSE NETWORK OF DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, EXPANDED AND ENHANCED AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE SERVICES, ENHANCED REVENUES, A STRENGTHENED MARKET POSITION FOR UNITEDHEALTH GROUP IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES, CROSS-SELLING

OPPORTUNITIES, TECHNOLOGY, COST SAVINGS AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. ACHIEVING THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING WHETHER UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INTEGRATES PACIFICARE IN AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE

MANNER AND GENERAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKETPLACE. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, DECREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF EXPECTED REVENUES AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS TIME AND ENERGY, WHICH COULD

MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED (ALSO REFERRED TO AS UNITEDHEALTH GROUP, THE COMPANY, WE, US, AND OUR) IS A

DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING COMPANY DEDICATED TO MAKING HEALTH CARE WORK BETTER. THROUGH STRATEGICALLY ALIGNED, MARKET-DEFINED BUSINESSES, WE DESIGN PRODUCTS, PROVIDE SERVICES AND APPLY TECHNOLOGIES THAT IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

SERVICES, SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE, PROMOTE QUALITY AND MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

WE HAVE PREPARED THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HAVE INCLUDED THE ACCOUNTS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE ELIMINATED ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND

TRANSACTIONS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON OUR BEST

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE US TO APPLY COMPLEX ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND WILL CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO MEDICAL COSTS, MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INTANGIBLE ASSET VALUATIONS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND REVENUES. WE ADJUST THESE ESTIMATES EACH PERIOD, AS MORE CURRENT INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE

IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IS INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS ADJUSTED.

REVENUES

PREMIUM REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS FIXED, TYPICALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND WE ASSUME THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING OUR CUSTOMERS

HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE RECORD HEALTH CARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS IN

ADVANCE OF THE SERVICE PERIOD AS UNEARNED PREMIUMS.

SERVICE REVENUES CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF FEES DERIVED FROM SERVICES PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE MEDICAL COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. UNDER SERVICE FEE CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED BASED UPON

THE FEE CHARGED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CUSTOMERS RETAIN THE RISK OF FINANCING MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES DEPENDENTS, AND WE ADMINISTER THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMER FUNDS TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FROM

CUSTOMER-FUNDED BANK ACCOUNTS. BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE THE OBLIGATION FOR FUNDING THE MEDICAL EXPENSES, NOR DO WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DELIVERING THE MEDICAL CARE, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE GROSS REVENUE AND MEDICAL COSTS FOR THESE CONTRACTS IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR BOTH PREMIUM RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED

CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, WE PROVIDE COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES; TRANSACTION PROCESSING; CUSTOMER, CONSUMER AND CARE PROVIDER SERVICES; AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE

PROFESSIONALS.

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL

CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH WE HAVE EITHER NOT YET RECEIVED OR PROCESSED CLAIMS,

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN

ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE

CONSUMPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. WE ESTIMATE LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH PERIOD, WE

RE-EXAMINE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE LIABILITY ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS BECOME MORE EXACT, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE

ESTIMATES, AND INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES

ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

INVESTMENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT

GENERALLY HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES THEIR CARRYING VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT MATURITY OF THE INSTRUMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE

CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. WE MAY SELL INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM BEFORE THEIR MATURITIES TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES. BECAUSE OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS REGARDLESS

OF THEIR MATURITY DATE. WE CLASSIFY THESE INVESTMENTS AS HELD TO MATURITY AND REPORT THEM AT AMORTIZED COST. ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES.

WE EXCLUDE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE FROM EARNINGS AND

REPORT IT, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCES A DECLINE IN VALUE

THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, BASED ON ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT FACTORS, WE RECORD A REALIZED LOSS IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. TO CALCULATE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF

INVESTMENTS, WE USE THE SPECIFIC COST OR AMORTIZED COST OF EACH INVESTMENT SOLD.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

WE ADMINISTER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF

AARPS INSURANCE PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 11). PURSUANT TO OUR AGREEMENT, AARP ASSETS ARE MANAGED SEPARATELY FROM OUR GENERAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT OUR DISCRETION,

WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED BY AARP. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND, UPON TRANSFER OF THE AARP CONTRACT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, WE WOULD TRANSFER CASH EQUAL IN AMOUNT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT

THE DATE OF TRANSFER TO THAT ENTITY. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THESE ASSETS IS TO FUND THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, THE RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF) LIABILITIES AND OTHER RELATED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP CONTRACT, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS, CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE LIABILITIES. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF. AS SUCH, THEY

ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR EARNINGS.

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED

SOFTWARE

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE IS STATED AT COST,

NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE CONSISTS OF CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND PAYROLL COSTS OF EMPLOYEES DEVOTED

TO SPECIFIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

WE CALCULATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE USEFUL LIVES FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE: FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS FOR FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT; FROM 35 TO 40 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS;

THE SHORTER OF THE USEFUL LIFE OR REMAINING

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEASE TERM FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS; AND FROM THREE TO NINE YEARS FOR CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $876 MILLION AND $543 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF CAPITALIZED

SOFTWARE WAS $771 MILLION AND $596 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE PURCHASE PRICE OF BUSINESSES WE HAVE ACQUIRED EXCEED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE ASSETS AND SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF THESE BUSINESSES. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE

ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT ARE TESTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DISCRETE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE WE MIGHT NOT RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE UTILITY AND CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSETS, TO MAKE THIS DECISION. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH AN ASSETS CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. WE RECORD ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE, LESS ANY COSTS FOR THE FINAL SETTLEMENT.

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES INCLUDE THE RSF ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 11),

CUSTOMER BALANCES RELATED TO EXPERIENCE-RATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS. CUSTOMER BALANCES REPRESENT EXCESS CUSTOMER PAYMENTS AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS UNDER

EXPERIENCE-RATED CONTRACTS. AT THE CUSTOMERS OPTION, THESE BALANCES MAY BE REFUNDED OR USED TO PAY FUTURE PREMIUMS OR CLAIMS UNDER ELIGIBLE CONTRACTS.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND LAWS. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAX

PROVISION OR BENEFIT GENERALLY REFLECTS THE NET CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING THE YEAR, EXCLUDING ANY DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION REFLECTS THE TAX

CONTRACTS TYPICALLY HAVE A ONE-YEAR TERM AND MAY BE CANCELLED UPON 30 DAYS NOTICE BY EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE CUSTOMER.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE ACCOUNT FOR ACTIVITY UNDER OUR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION

NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS BECAUSE WE GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AT EXERCISE PRICES NOT LESS THAN THE FAIR VALUE

INFORMATION ON OUR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS AND DATA USED TO CALCULATE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE TABLE ABOVE ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 9.

AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY WITHIN NOTE 9, FAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE BASED PAYMENT, (FAS 123R) WAS EFFECTIVE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, AND

REQUIRES US TO MEASURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (INCLUDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS) AT FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THE EXPENSE OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD ON A RETROSPECTIVE RESTATEMENT BASIS AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2006 AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT RESULT IN ANY CHANGE TO THE PRO FORMA COMPENSATION EXPENSE AMOUNTS HISTORICALLY DISCLOSED UNDER FAS 123.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

WE COMPUTE BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. WE DETERMINE

DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD, ADJUSTED FOR POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES THAT MIGHT BE ISSUED UPON THE EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK OPTIONS OR THE CONVERSION OF

CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AS PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN FIXED AND VARIABLE RATES TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED IS ACCRUED AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENTS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR EXISTING INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS CONVERT A MAJORITY OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM A FIXED TO A VARIABLE RATE AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR EXISTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 7.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITION NO. 115-1, THE MEANING OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AND ITS APPLICATION TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS (FSP 115-1). FSP 115-1 PROVIDES ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING AND RECORDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON CERTAIN DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

FSP 115-1 NULLIFIES CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 03-1 WHILE RETAINING ITS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED FSP 115-1 AND ITS ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2005, THE

FASB ISSUED AN EXPOSURE DRAFT OF A PROPOSED STANDARD ENTITLED BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  A REPLACEMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 141. THE PROPOSED STANDARD, IF ADOPTED, WOULD PROVIDE NEW GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING AND RECORDING

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND WOULD BE EFFECTIVE ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WHOSE ACQUISITION DATES ARE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2007. UPON ISSUANCE OF A FINAL STANDARD, THE COMPANY WILL EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD

AND ITS EFFECT ON THE PROCESS FOR RECORDING BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2005, WE ISSUED $2.6 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF

THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO RETIRE A PORTION OF THE PACIFICARE DEBT UPON CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION AS WELL AS TO REFINANCE MATURING LONG TERM DEBT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER HAD INTEREST RATES

RANGING FROM 4.2% TO 4.4%.

IN MARCH 2005, WE ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 4.9%

FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2015. WE USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS BORROWING FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

IN JULY 2004, WE ISSUED $1.2 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND THE CASH PORTION OF THE

OXFORD PURCHASE PRICE. IN AUGUST 2004, WE REFINANCED THE COMMERCIAL PAPER BY ISSUING $550 MILLION OF 3.4% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE AUGUST 2007, $450 MILLION OF 4.1% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE AUGUST 2009 AND $500 MILLION OF 5.0% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE AUGUST

2014.

IN FEBRUARY 2004, WE ISSUED $250 MILLION OF 3.8% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE

FEBRUARY 2009 AND $250 MILLION OF 4.8% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2014. WE USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE FEBRUARY 2004 BORROWINGS TO FINANCE A MAJORITY OF THE CASH PORTION OF THE MAMSI PURCHASE PRICE.

TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE RECEIVED ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT

BALANCES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO CONVERT THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM A FIXED RATE TO A VARIABLE RATE. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS HAVE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $3.4 BILLION WITH VARIABLE RATES THAT ARE BENCHMARKED TO THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR). AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE RATES USED TO ACCRUE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THESE AGREEMENTS RANGED FROM

4.3% TO 5.0%. THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE FIXED AND VARIABLE RATES TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED IS ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENTS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2005, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR $1.0 BILLION FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT

FACILITY SUPPORTING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. WE INCREASED THE CAPACITY TO $1.3 BILLION AND EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE TO

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECEMBER 2010. IN OCTOBER 2005, WE EXECUTED A $3.0 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO SUPPORT A $3.0 BILLION INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER

PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER EITHER OF THESE CREDIT FACILITIES.

PACIFICARE HAD APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION PAR VALUE OF 3% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES (CONVERTIBLE NOTES) WHICH WERE CONVERTIBLE INTO APPROXIMATELY 5.2 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS COMMON

STOCK AND $102 MILLION OF CASH AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, WE INITIATED A CONSENT SOLICITATION TO ALL OF THE HOLDERS OF OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES PURSUANT TO WHICH WE OFFERED TO COMPENSATE ALL HOLDERS WHO ELECTED TO CONVERT

THEIR NOTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING TERMS AND CONSENT TO AN AMENDMENT TO A COVENANT IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE COMPENSATION CONSISTED OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST THROUGH OCTOBER 18, 2007, THE EARLIEST

MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE, PLUS A PRO RATA SHARE OF $1 MILLION. ON JANUARY 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY 91% OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE TENDERED PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, FOR WHICH WE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 4.8 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP

COMMON STOCK AND CASH OF $99 MILLION.

OUR DEBT ARRANGEMENTS AND CREDIT

FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS, THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO BELOW 45% AND TO EXCEED SPECIFIED MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE LEVELS. WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL DEBT

COVENANTS.

MATURITIES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT FOR THE YEARS ENDING

DECEMBER 31 ARE AS FOLLOWS: $3,261 MILLION IN 2006, $950 MILLION IN 2007, $500 MILLION IN 2008, $700 MILLION IN 2009, AND $1,700 MILLION THEREAFTER.

WE MADE CASH PAYMENTS FOR INTEREST OF $219 MILLION, $100 MILLION AND $94 MILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

8. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH COMPANIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC). THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING

AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A REGULATED SUBSIDIARY, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS

LIMITED BASED ON THE ENTITYS LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION OF OUR $15.0 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND

AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

THE AGENCIES THAT ASSESS OUR CREDITWORTHINESS ALSO CONSIDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY LEVELS WHEN ESTABLISHING OUR DEBT RATINGS. CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENT TO MAINTAIN OUR SENIOR DEBT RATINGS IN THE A RANGE, WE MAINTAIN AN AGGREGATE

STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVEL FOR OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM LEVEL REGULATORS REQUIRE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES HAD AGGREGATE STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF

APPROXIMATELY $6.4 BILLION, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE AGGREGATE MINIMUM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

UNDER OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, WE MAINTAIN A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON VOLUME, PRICING AND TIMING. DURING 2005, WE REPURCHASED

53.6 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $48 PER SHARE AND AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL

55.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMON STOCK SPLIT

IN MAY 2005, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT. THE STOCK SPLIT WAS EFFECTIVE ON MAY 27, 2005 FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MAY 20,

2005. ALL SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

PREFERRED STOCK

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD

10 MILLION SHARES OF $0.001 PAR VALUE PREFERRED STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE, AND NO PREFERRED SHARES ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.

9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 96.9 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCENTIVE OR NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND RESTRICTED STOCK.

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GRANTED AT AN EXERCISE PRICE NOT LESS THAN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THEY GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER FOUR YEARS AND MAY

BE EXERCISED UP TO 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. ACTIVITY UNDER OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN IS SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLES BELOW (SHARES IN MILLIONS).

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FAS 123R, WHICH AMENDED FAS 123 AND 95. FAS 123R REQUIRES ALL COMPANIES TO MEASURE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (INCLUDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS) AT FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THE EXPENSE OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS, AS DEFINED IN FAS 123R, ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN

ADDITION TO PAID-IN-CAPITAL AND ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO FINANCING CASH FLOWS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT RESULT IN ANY CHANGE TO

THE PRO FORMA COMPENSATION AMOUNTS HISTORICALLY DISCLOSED UNDER FAS 123.

WE MADE CASH PAYMENTS FOR INCOME TAXES OF $1,377 MILLION IN 2005, $898 MILLION IN 2004 AND $783 MILLION IN 2003. WE RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT UPON THE EXERCISE OF

NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS OF $320 MILLION IN 2005, $358 MILLION IN 2004, AND $222 MILLION IN 2003.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2003 AND 2004 ARE CURRENTLY BEING EXAMINED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE EXAMINATION WILL HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

11. AARP

IN JANUARY 1998, WE ENTERED

INTO A 10-YEAR CONTRACT TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF AARP. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO SUPPLEMENT BENEFITS COVERED UNDER TRADITIONAL MEDICARE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, WE ARE COMPENSATED FOR

TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND OTHER SERVICES AS WELL AS FOR ASSUMING UNDERWRITING RISK. WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO COMPLEMENT THE INSURANCE OFFERINGS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM OUR PORTION OF THE AARP

INSURANCE OFFERINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY $4.9 BILLION IN 2005, $4.5 BILLION IN 2004 AND $4.1 BILLION IN 2003.

THE UNDERWRITING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE AARP BUSINESS ARE DIRECTLY RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO A RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF). THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE PREMIUM

REVENUE, MEDICAL COSTS, INVESTMENT INCOME, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, MEMBER SERVICE EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. UNDERWRITING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF AND ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF

THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS, UNLESS CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES WERE TO EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF. TO THE EXTENT UNDERWRITING LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, WE WOULD HAVE TO FUND THE DEFICIT. ANY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFICIT WE FUND COULD BE RECOVERED BY UNDERWRITING GAINS IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FUND ANY UNDERWRITING

DEFICITS. THE RSF BALANCE IS REPORTED IN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE BELIEVE THE RSF BALANCE IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER POTENTIAL FUTURE UNDERWRITING OR OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT.

THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN BALANCE

SHEET AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF BALANCE. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF SUCH CHANGES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

PURSUANT TO OUR AGREEMENT, AARP ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE MANAGED SEPARATELY FROM OUR

GENERAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT OUR DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED BY AARP. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF INVESTMENT RETURN ON THESE

INVESTMENTS AND, UPON TRANSFER OF THE AARP CONTRACT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, WE WOULD TRANSFER CASH EQUAL IN AMOUNT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER TO THAT ENTITY. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES

ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF. AS SUCH, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR EARNINGS. INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO

THE AARP RSF AND WERE $90 MILLION, $103 MILLION AND $101 MILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE REPORTED AT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED DIRECTLY IN THE RSF ASSOCIATED WITH

LEGAL MATTERS

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE

COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES.

BEGINNING IN 1999, A SERIES OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST BOTH

UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND PACIFICARE, AND VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS. IN DECEMBER 2000, A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL LITIGATION CASES INVOLVING UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND OUR AFFILIATES IN THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF FLORIDA, MIAMI DIVISION. GENERALLY, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF ERISA AND RICO IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED UNDISCLOSED POLICIES INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS. OTHER ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE BREACH OF

STATE PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO TIMELY REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES RENDERED. THE CONSOLIDATED SUITS SEEK INJUNCTIVE, COMPENSATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF AS WELL AS RESTITUTION, COSTS, FEES AND

INTEREST PAYMENTS. THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THAT ORDER WAS REVIEWED BY THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE CLASS ACTION STATUS OF THE RICO CLAIMS,

BUT REVERSED AS TO THE BREACH OF CONTRACT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT AND PROMPT PAYMENT CLAIMS. DURING THE COURSE OF THE LITIGATION, THERE HAVE BEEN CO-DEFENDANT SETTLEMENTS. THROUGH A SERIES OF MOTIONS AND APPEALS, ALL DIRECT CLAIMS AGAINST US HAVE BEEN

COMPELLED TO ARBITRATION. A TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR APRIL 2006. THE TRIAL COURT HAS ORDERED THAT THE TRIAL BE SPLIT INTO SEPARATE LIABILITY AND DAMAGE PROCEEDINGS. IN AUGUST 2005, THE CAPITATION RELATED CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED FROM LITIGATION. ON

JANUARY 31, 2006, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED ALL REMAINING CLAIMS AGAINST PACIFICARE. A MARCH 14, 2006 HEARING DATE HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR OUR SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION.

ON MARCH 15, 2000, THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

COUNTY OF NEW YORK. ON APRIL 13, 2000, WE REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE SUIT ALLEGES CAUSES OF ACTION BASED ON ERISA, AS WELL AS BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF

GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES, AND TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS. THE SUIT SEEKS DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE AND COMPENSATORY RELIEF

AS WELL AS COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 25, 2000, WHICH ALLEGED TWO CLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS, AN ERISA CLASS AND A NON-ERISA CLASS. AFTER THE COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN ERISA CLAIMS AND THE CLAIMS

BROUGHT BY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED. ON OCTOBER 25, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART OUR MOTION TO

DISMISS THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON MAY 21, 2003, WE FILED A COUNTERCLAIM COMPLAINT IN THIS MATTER ALLEGING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS AGAINST THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND ASSERTING CLAIMS BASED ON IMPROPER BILLING PRACTICES AGAINST AN

INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER PLAINTIFF. ON MAY 26, 2004, WE FILED A MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT SEEKING THE DISMISSAL OF CERTAIN CLAIMS AND PARTIES BASED, IN PART, DUE TO LACK OF STANDING. ON JULY 16, 2004, PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION FOR

LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, SEEKING TO ASSERT RICO VIOLATIONS.

ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF PENDING LITIGATION ARE ALWAYS UNCERTAIN, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS CURRENTLY THREATENED OR PENDING, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT FEDERAL,

STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. BROAD LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS. STATE LEGISLATURES

AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES AS THE SUBJECT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND RULES COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. FURTHER, WE MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF

OUR PRODUCTS.

WE TYPICALLY ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS), STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS

GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. SUCH GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR

PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE

MATTERS. IN ADDITION, PUBLIC PERCEPTION OR PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ROUTINE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF PENDING MATTERS ARE ALWAYS UNCERTAIN, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS OR REVIEWS, CURRENTLY THREATENED OR PENDING, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SEGMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION

FACTORS USED IN DETERMINING OUR REPORTABLE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS INCLUDE THE NATURE OF OPERATING ACTIVITIES, EXISTENCE OF SEPARATE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAMS, AND THE TYPE OF INFORMATION PRESENTED TO THE COMPANYS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION-MAKER TO EVALUATE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATIONS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE

DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (SEE NOTE 2). TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING SERVICES THAT UNIPRISE PROVIDES TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES, CERTAIN

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF UNITEDHEALTH

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH

FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS

OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, AND

THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 24, 2006, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AN EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934). BASED UPON THAT

EVALUATION, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

THE MANAGEMENT OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND

15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.



PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND



PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, WE USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT AND THOSE CRITERIA, WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THE INTERNAL CONTROLS OF PACIFICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC. (PACIFICARE) WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY ON DECEMBER 20, 2005, AND IS INCLUDED IN THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM THAT DATE THROUGH YEAREND. SUCH EXCLUSION WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION GUIDANCE THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF A RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY BE OMITTED IN

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE YEAR OF ACQUISITION. TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PACIFICARE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 29% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND

LESS THAN 1% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME FOR THE YEAR THEN ENDED.

CHANGES TO CERTAIN PROCESSES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF INTERNAL CONTROL RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PACIFICARE MAY OCCUR AND WILL BE EVALUATED BY MANAGEMENT AS SUCH INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES ARE

IMPLEMENTED. OTHER THAN THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AS STATED IN THE REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM,

APPEARING UNDER ITEM 9A, WHICH EXPRESSES UNQUALIFIED OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND

SUBSIDIARIES.

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT, THAT UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. AS DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT OF MANAGEMENT, MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED FROM THEIR ASSESSMENT THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AT PACIFICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC. (PACIFICARE), WHICH WAS ACQUIRED ON DECEMBER 20, 2005 AND WHOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT TOTAL ASSETS AND REVENUES CONSTITUTING APPROXIMATELY 29 AND 1 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE

RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. ACCORDINGLY, OUR AUDIT DID NOT INCLUDE THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT PACIFICARE. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN

OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS

AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY

NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE

OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THE

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.
