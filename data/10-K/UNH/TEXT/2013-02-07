GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE REGULATED BY U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AS WELL AS NON-U.S. REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. THESE REGULATIONS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE PERIODICALLY. THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND A RECONCILIATION MEASURE, THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, WHICH WE REFER TO TOGETHER AS THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, WERE SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 AND, AFTER BEING

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHALLENGED, WERE SUBSTANTIALLY UPHELD IN A U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2012. THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW, ALTERS THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, IN SOME CASES TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO ENACT AND CONSIDER VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. NEW LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES, OR CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES, AS WELL AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN THE EVENT WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH, OR WE FAIL TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO CHANGES IN, APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS” FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

HEALTH CARE REFORMS

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION EXPANDS ACCESS TO COVERAGE AND MODIFIES ASPECTS OF THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET, AS WELL AS THE MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS, CHIP AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION HAVE ALREADY TAKEN EFFECT AND OTHER PROVISIONS BECOME EFFECTIVE AT VARIOUS DATES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL), HHS AND THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT HAVE ISSUED OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS ON A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, BUT FINAL RULES AND INTERIM GUIDANCE ON OTHER KEY ASPECTS OF THE LEGISLATION REMAIN PENDING.

THE FOLLOWING OUTLINES CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION THAT ARE CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE, CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE WITH PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OR ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE EFFECT IN THE COMING YEARS.

•

CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE

: THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION MANDATED THE EXPANSION OF DEPENDANT COVERAGE TO INCLUDE ADULT CHILDREN UNTIL AGE 26; ELIMINATED CERTAIN ANNUAL AND LIFETIME CAPS ON THE DOLLAR VALUE OF CERTAIN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS; ELIMINATED PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIMITS FOR ENROLLEES UNDER AGE 19; PROHIBITED CERTAIN POLICY RESCISSIONS; PROHIBITED PLANS AND ISSUERS FROM CHARGING HIGHER COST SHARING (COPAYMENTS OR COINSURANCE) FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT ARE OBTAINED OUTSIDE OF A PLAN’S NETWORK; AND INCLUDED A REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES WITHOUT COST TO MEMBERS (FOR NON-GRANDFATHERED PLANS).

COMMERCIAL FULLY INSURED HEALTH PLANS IN THE LARGE EMPLOYER GROUP, SMALL EMPLOYER GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WITH MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS BELOW CERTAIN TARGETS (85% FOR LARGE EMPLOYER GROUPS, 80% FOR SMALL EMPLOYER GROUPS AND 80% FOR INDIVIDUALS, AS CALCULATED UNDER THE DEFINITIONS IN THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS, SUBJECT TO STATE SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS) ARE REQUIRED TO REBATE RATABLE PORTIONS OF THEIR PREMIUMS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS ANNUALLY.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION ALSO MANDATED CERTAIN CHANGES TO COVERAGE DETERMINATION AND APPEALS PROCESSES, INCLUDING: EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF “ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATION” TO INCLUDE RESCISSIONS; EXTENDING EXTERNAL REVIEW RIGHTS OF ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS TO INSURED AND SELF-FUNDED PLANS; AND IMPROVING THE CLARITY OF AND EXPANDING THE TYPES OF INFORMATION IN ADVERSE BENEFIT DETERMINATION NOTICES.

•

CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE WITH PHASED IMPLEMENTATION

: THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION ALSO MANDATED CONSUMER DISCOUNTS ON BRAND NAME AND GENERIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR PART D PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE COVERAGE GAP. THESE CONSUMER DISCOUNTS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, WHICH WILL DECREASE CONSUMER OUT-OF-POCKET DRUG SPENDING WITHIN THE COVERAGE GAP, SHIFTING A PORTION OF THESE COSTS TO THE PLAN SPONSOR. IN 2012, THE DISCOUNT ON BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WAS 50% WHILE THE DISCOUNT ON GENERIC PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WAS 14%.

IN ADDITION, AS REQUIRED UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, HHS ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL PREMIUM RATE REVIEW PROCESS, WHICH GENERALLY APPLIES TO PROPOSED RATE INCREASES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING 10%. THE REGULATIONS FURTHER REQUIRE COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE TO THE STATES AND HHS EXTENSIVE INFORMATION SUPPORTING ANY RATE INCREASES SUBJECT TO THE NEW FEDERAL RATE REVIEW PROCESS. THE REGULATIONS CLARIFY THAT HHS REVIEW WILL NOT SUPERSEDE EXISTING STATE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESSES, BUT PLANS DEEMED TO HAVE A HISTORY OF “UNREASONABLE” RATE INCREASES MAY BE PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE-BASED EXCHANGES THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO BECOME ACTIVE UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION IN 2014. UNDER CURRENT REGULATIONS, THE HHS RATE REVIEW PROCESS WOULD APPLY ONLY TO HEALTH PLANS IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS.

CMS REDUCED OR FROZE BENCHMARKS WHICH AFFECT OUR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM CMS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2011, AND IN 2012, ADDITIONAL CUTS TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE BENCHMARKS BEGAN TO TAKE EFFECT (BENCHMARKS WILL ULTIMATELY RANGE FROM 95% OF MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE RATES IN HIGH COST AREAS TO 115% IN LOW COST AREAS), WITH CHANGES CONTINUING TO BE PHASED-IN OVER THE NEXT ONE TO FIVE YEARS, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF BENCHMARK REDUCTION IN A COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO OTHER MEASURES, QUALITY BONUSES MAY PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE ANTICIPATED BENCHMARK REDUCTIONS. CMS QUALITY RATING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BONUSES ARE PAID TO CERTAIN QUALIFYING PLANS FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT BEGAN IN 2012. QUALITY BONUSES ARE BASED UPON STAR RATINGS AT THE LOCAL PLAN LEVEL, AS DETERMINED BY CMS, AND ARE DEPENDENT ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MEMBER SATISFACTION AND MEMBER BEHAVIOR IN THE CONTEXT OF OBTAINING PREVENTIVE SCREENS.

•

EFFECTIVE 2013

: EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN 2013 WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES PERFORMED AFTER 2009, THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION LIMITS THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE FOR INSURANCE PROVIDERS IF AT LEAST 25% OF THE INSURANCE PROVIDER’S GROSS PREMIUM REVENUE FROM HEALTH BUSINESS IS DERIVED FROM HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS THAT MEET THE MINIMUM CREDITABLE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.

•

EFFECTIVE 2013/2014

: THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR AN INCREASE IN MEDICAID FEE-FOR-SERVICE AND MANAGED CARE PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENTS FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS (FAMILY MEDICINE, GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE OR PEDIATRIC MEDICINE) TO 100% OF THE MEDICARE PAYMENT RATES FOR 2013 AND 2014, AND PROVIDES 100% FEDERAL FINANCING FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN RATES BASED ON RATES APPLICABLE ON JULY 1, 2009.

•

EFFECTIVE 2014

: A NUMBER OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION ARE SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT IN 2014, INCLUDING: AN ANNUAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY ASSESSMENT ($8 BILLION TO BE LEVIED ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN 2014 INCREASING TO $14.3 BILLION BY 2018 WITH INCREASING ANNUAL AMOUNTS THEREAFTER), WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES; A TRANSITIONAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM ($25 BILLION OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD), WHICH WILL BE FUNDED BY A $5.25 PER MEMBER PER MONTH FEE (AS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED BY HHS), ON ALL COMPREHENSIVE LINES OF BUSINESS (INCLUDING RISK-BASED AND SELF-INSURED) WITH ONLY INSURANCE PLANS FOR INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR REINSURANCE RECOVERIES; A PERMANENT RISK ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROMOTE STABILITY IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL EMPLOYER GROUP MARKETPLACE BY TRANSFERRING FUNDS AMONG COMPETING PLANS BASED ON VARIANCE IN RISK POPULATIONS; ALL INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HEALTH PLANS MUST OFFER COVERAGE ON A GUARANTEED ISSUE AND GUARANTEED RENEWAL BASIS DURING ANNUAL OPEN ENROLLMENT AND SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIODS AND CANNOT APPLY PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS OR HEALTH STATUS RATING ADJUSTMENTS; ALL INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP PLANS MUST PROVIDE CERTAIN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS, WITH MEMBER COST-SHARING LIMITATIONS AND NO ANNUAL LIMITS ON ESSENTIAL BENEFITS COVERAGE; ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE-BASED EXCHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS CERTAIN CHIP ELIGIBLES; A TEMPORARY RISK CORRIDOR PROGRAM THAT LIMITS THE LOSSES AND GAINS OF INSURERS THAT OFFER PRODUCTS ON EXCHANGES; INTRODUCTION OF PLAN DESIGNS BASED ON SET ACTUARIAL VALUES TO INCREASE COMPARABILITY OF COMPETING PRODUCTS ON THE EXCHANGES AND LIMIT MEMBER COST-SHARING OBLIGATIONS; AND ESTABLISHMENT OF MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIO OF 85% FOR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS, AS CALCULATED UNDER RULES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ISSUED.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND THE RELATED FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS WILL IMPACT HOW WE DO BUSINESS AND COULD RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND MARKET SEGMENTS, RESTRICT PREMIUM GROWTH RATES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND MARKET SEGMENTS, INCREASE OUR MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, EXPOSE US TO AN INCREASED RISK OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING INCREASING OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS AND CONTRACT INTERPRETATION) OR PUT US AT RISK FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL, AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH CHANGES. THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION MAY ALSO CREATE NEW OR EXPAND EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESS GROWTH, BUT DUE TO ITS COMPLEXITY, THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND IS NOT YET FULLY KNOWN. SEE ALSO ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS” FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

OTHER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEVELS OF U.S. FEDERAL REGULATION. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE CONTRACT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE AWARD, ADMINISTRATION AND PERFORMANCE OF U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. CMS REGULATES OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES, AND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES. OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICARE & RETIREMENT, UNITEDHEALTHCARE COMMUNITY & STATE AND OPTUMHEALTH BUSINESSES SUBMIT INFORMATION RELATING TO THE HEALTH STATUS OF ENROLLEES TO CMS (OR STATE AGENCIES) FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO US. CMS ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO AUDIT PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CMS CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE GIVEN TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. BEGINNING IN 2014, OUR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS MAY BE SUBJECT TO AUDIT RELATED TO THE RISK ADJUSTMENT AND REINSURANCE DATA. SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” AND ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS” FOR A DISCUSSION OF AUDITS BY CMS.

OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT, THROUGH UNITEDHEALTHCARE COMMUNITY & STATE, ALSO HAS MEDICAID AND CHIP CONTRACTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE MANY REGULATIONS SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COMPLIANCE, AND THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WITH RESPECT TO THESE PROGRAMS HAS BECOME AND WILL CONTINUE TO BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS A RESULT OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION, OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE MILITARY & VETERANS BUSINESS AND CERTAIN OF OPTUM’S BUSINESSES HOLD CONTRACTS WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DOD AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THESE CONTRACTS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE’S AND OPTUM’S BUSINESSES, SUCH AS UNITEDHEALTHCARE’S EYEGLASS MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES AND OPTUM’S HIGH ACUITY CLINICAL WORKFLOW SOFTWARE, HEARING AID PRODUCTS, AND CLINICAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA), AND THE CLINICAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES THAT REGULATE CLINICAL TRIALS. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION, ANTI-FRAUD AND ABUSE, ANTI-KICKBACKS, FALSE CLAIMS, PROHIBITED REFERRALS, INAPPROPRIATELY REDUCING OR LIMITING HEALTH CARE SERVICES, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, SECURITIES AND ANTITRUST ALSO AFFECT US.

HIPAA, GLBA AND OTHER PRIVACY AND SECURITY REGULATION.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996, AS AMENDED (HIPAA), APPLY TO BOTH THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING SELF-FUNDED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. HIPAA REQUIRES GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS AND CERTAIN ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. IT ALSO REQUIRES GUARANTEED RENEWABILITY FOR EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS AND LIMITS EXCLUSIONS BASED ON PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. FEDERAL REGULATIONS RELATED TO HIPAA INCLUDE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND CODE SETS, AND FOR THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. THE HIPAA PRIVACY REGULATIONS DO NOT PREEMPT MORE STRINGENT STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY ALSO APPLY TO US.

FEDERAL PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS CHANGE FREQUENTLY BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS AND JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. CONGRESS ENACTED THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDS, AND ADDS NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS TO HIPAA AND IMPOSES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON USES AND DISCLOSURES OF HEALTH INFORMATION. ARRA INCLUDES NEW CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HIPAA BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENTS; EXTENDS PARTS OF HIPAA PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS TO BUSINESS ASSOCIATES; ADDS NEW FEDERAL DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR COVERED ENTITIES AND BUSINESS ASSOCIATES AND NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO HHS AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) AND, IN SOME CASES, TO THE LOCAL MEDIA; STRENGTHENS ENFORCEMENT AND IMPOSES HIGHER FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR HIPAA VIOLATIONS AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, IMPOSES CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES. IN JANUARY 2013, HHS ISSUED ITS FINAL REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE ARRA AMENDMENTS TO HIPAA AND UPDATING THE HIPAA PRIVACY, SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT RULES. IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, WE MAY ACT, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AS EITHER A COVERED ENTITY OR A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE. FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS MAY ALSO APPLY IN SOME INSTANCES TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES RELATED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES IS ALSO REGULATED IN SOME INSTANCES BY OTHER FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (GLBA) OR STATE STATUTES IMPLEMENTING GLBA, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE INSURERS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH NOTICE REGARDING HOW THEIR NON-PUBLIC PERSONAL HEALTH AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS USED AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO “OPT OUT” OF CERTAIN DISCLOSURES BEFORE THE INSURER SHARES SUCH INFORMATION WITH A THIRD PARTY, AND WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE SAFEGUARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. SEE ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS” FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH HIPAA, GLBA AND OTHER PRIVACY-RELATED REGULATIONS.

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), REGULATES HOW GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A SET OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC INTERPRETATION BY THE DOL AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL COURTS. ERISA PLACES CONTROLS ON HOW OUR BUSINESS UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MAINTAIN SELF-FUNDED PLANS. REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE DOL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RULES FOR CLAIMS PAYMENT AND MEMBER APPEALS UNDER HEALTH CARE PLANS GOVERNED BY ERISA. ADDITIONALLY, SOME STATES REQUIRE LICENSURE OR REGISTRATION OF COMPANIES PROVIDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FOR HEALTH CARE PLANS.

STATE LAWS AND REGULATION

HEALTH CARE REGULATION.

OUR INSURANCE AND HMO SUBSIDIARIES MUST BE LICENSED BY THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS. ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER INSURANCE AND HMO PRODUCTS REGULATE THOSE PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THESE STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ESTABLISH MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) HAS ADOPTED MODEL REGULATIONS THAT, WHEN IMPLEMENTED BY STATES WOULD REQUIRE CERTAIN GOVERNANCE PRACTICES SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND EXPAND INSURANCE COMPANY AND HMO RISK AND SOLVENCY ASSESSMENT REPORTING. WE EXPECT THAT STATES WILL ADOPT THESE OR SIMILAR MEASURES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF REGULATIONS RELATING TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INTERNAL CONTROL ACTIVITIES OF HMOS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. CERTAIN STATES HAVE ALSO ADOPTED THEIR OWN REGULATIONS FOR MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS WITH WHICH HEALTH PLANS MUST COMPLY. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE ENACTED OR ARE CONTEMPLATING SIGNIFICANT REFORMS OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, EITHER INDEPENDENT OF OR TO COMPLY WITH OR BE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS OR OTHER INCENTIVES IN CONNECTION WITH THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION. WE EXPECT THE STATES TO CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE AND PASS SIMILAR LAWS IN 2013, AND THIS WILL AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ALSO REGULATED UNDER STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRE REGISTRATION WITH APPLICABLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE REGULATED COMPANIES AND THEIR PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES OR AFFILIATES. THESE LAWS MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR HOLDING COMPANIES.

IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR BUSINESS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO OTHER HEALTH CARE-RELATED REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PPO, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION (MCO), UTILIZATION REVIEW (UR) OR TPA-RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER FROM STATE TO STATE, AND MAY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING, PRODUCT AND RATE, AND FINANCIAL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES, APPEALS, GRIEVANCES AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, ADEQUACY OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS, FRAUD PREVENTION, PROTECTION OF CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION, PRICING AND UNDERWRITING PRACTICE AND COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES. STATE HEALTH CARE ANTI-FRAUD AND ABUSE PROHIBITIONS ENCOMPASS A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING KICKBACKS FOR REFERRAL OF MEMBERS, BILLING UNNECESSARY MEDICAL SERVICES AND IMPROPER MARKETING. CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE GENERAL AGENT, BROKER, AND SALES DISTRIBUTIONS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE COMMUNITY & STATE, UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICARE & RETIREMENT AND CERTAIN OPTUM BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE THE PROVISION OF BENEFITS TO OUR MEDICAID AND CHIP BENEFICIARIES AND TO OUR DUALLY ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES. WE ALSO CONTRACT WITH STATE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE AWARD, ADMINISTRATION AND PERFORMANCE OF STATE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

GUARANTY FUND ASSESSMENTS.

UNDER STATE GUARANTY FUND LAWS, CERTAIN INSURANCE COMPANIES (AND HMOS IN SOME STATES), INCLUDING THOSE ISSUING HEALTH, LONG-TERM CARE, LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE POLICIES, DOING BUSINESS IN THOSE STATES CAN BE ASSESSED (UP TO PRESCRIBED LIMITS) FOR CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO THE POLICYHOLDERS AND CLAIMANTS OF INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE THE SAME LINE OR LINES OF BUSINESS. ASSESSMENTS GENERALLY ARE BASED ON A FORMULA RELATING TO PREMIUMS IN THE STATE COMPARED TO THE PREMIUMS OF OTHER INSURERS AND COULD BE SPREAD OUT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. SOME STATES PERMIT MEMBER INSURERS TO RECOVER ASSESSMENTS PAID THROUGH FULL OR PARTIAL PREMIUM TAX OFFSETS.

PHARMACY REGULATION.

OPTUMRX’S MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MUST BE LICENSED TO DO BUSINESS AS PHARMACIES IN THE STATES IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MUST ALSO REGISTER WITH THE U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION AND INDIVIDUAL STATE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AUTHORITIES TO DISPENSE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. IN MANY OF THE STATES WHERE OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES DELIVER PHARMACEUTICALS THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE OUT-OF-STATE MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES TO REGISTER WITH THAT STATE’S BOARD OF PHARMACY OR SIMILAR REGULATORY BODY. THESE STATES GENERALLY PERMIT THE PHARMACY TO FOLLOW THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE MAIL ORDER PHARMACY IS LOCATED, ALTHOUGH SOME STATES REQUIRE THAT WE ALSO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN LAWS IN THAT STATE. OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES MAINTAIN CERTAIN MEDICARE AND STATE MEDICAID PROVIDER NUMBERS AS PHARMACIES PROVIDING SERVICES UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. PARTICIPATION IN THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRES THE PHARMACIES TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROVIDER RULES AND REGULATIONS. OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES INCLUDE FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE LABELING, PACKAGING, ADVERTISING AND ADULTERATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND DISPENSING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. SEE ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS” FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO OUR PBM BUSINESSES.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS.

STATES HAVE ADOPTED REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE GLBA. LIKE HIPAA, GLBA ALLOWS STATES TO ADOPT MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING PRIVACY PROTECTION. A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE ALSO ADOPTED OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES, FOR EXAMPLE, STATE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE USE, DISCLOSURE AND PROTECTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND SENSITIVE HEALTH INFORMATION OR THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT DATA. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES INCREASINGLY FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS FROM IDENTITY THEFT, WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STATES ENACTING LAWS REQUIRING BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS OF SECURITY BREACHES INVOLVING PERSONAL INFORMATION. STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS MAY ALSO APPLY TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES RELATED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION RELATED TO CONSUMERS AND CARE PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO STATE PRIVACY AND INSURANCE REGULATION AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES IN THE DIFFERENT STATES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO STANDARDIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS STATE LINES. SEE ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS” FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH STATE PRIVACY AND SECURITY-RELATED REGULATIONS.

CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND FEE-SPLITTING LAWS.

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES FUNCTION AS DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND, AS SUCH, ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SOME STATES HAVE CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT CERTAIN ENTITIES FROM PRACTICING MEDICINE OR EMPLOYING PHYSICIANS TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. ADDITIONALLY, SOME STATES PROHIBIT CERTAIN ENTITIES FROM SHARING IN THE FEES OR REVENUES OF A PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE (FEE-SPLITTING). THESE PROHIBITIONS MAY BE STATUTORY OR REGULATORY, OR MAY BE A MATTER OF JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY INTERPRETATION. THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS HAVE, IN CERTAIN STATES, BEEN SUBJECT TO LIMITED JUDICIAL AND REGULATORY INTERPRETATION AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS.

CERTAIN BUSINESSES PARTICIPATE IN DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ACTIVITIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO EMERGING REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO ON-LINE COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER GENERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

BANKING REGULATION

OPTUM BANK IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC), WHICH PERFORMS ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REQUIREMENTS, AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, WHICH MAY PERFORM PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS TO ENSURE

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAT THE BANK IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND AGENCY GUIDELINES. OPTUM BANK IS ALSO SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE UTAH STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH CARRIES OUT ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE BANK IS OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMS PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE BANK’S COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE BANKING STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND AGENCY GUIDELINES. IN THE EVENT OF UNFAVORABLE EXAMINATION RESULTS FROM ANY OF THESE AGENCIES, THE BANK COULD BE SUBJECTED TO INCREASED OPERATIONAL EXPENSES AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ENHANCED GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT AND MONETARY PENALTIES.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE ORGANIZED OR CONDUCT BUSINESS. THESE REGULATORY REGIMES ENCOMPASS TAX, LICENSING, TARIFFS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INVESTMENT, MANAGEMENT CONTROL, LABOR, ANTI-FRAUD, ANTI-CORRUPTION AND PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS (INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS FOR CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS) THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION, AMONG OTHER MATTERS. WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ACQUIRE OR COMMENCE ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES BASED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCREASING OUR EXPOSURE TO NON-U.S. REGULATORY REGIMES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ACQUISITION OF AMIL SUBJECTS US TO BRAZILIAN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE MANAGED CARE AND INSURANCE INDUSTRIES AND REGULATION BY BRAZILIAN REGULATORS INCLUDING THE NATIONAL REGULATORY AGENCY FOR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE AND PLANS, THE AGÊNCIA NACIONAL DE SAÚDE SUPLEMENTAR (ANS), WHOSE APPROACH TO THE INTERPRETATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF INDUSTRY REGULATIONS COULD DIFFER FROM THE APPROACH TAKEN BY U.S. REGULATORS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMIL ACQUISITION, SEE NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.” IN ADDITION, OUR NON-U.S. BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO U.S. LAWS THAT REGULATE THE CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES OF U.S.-BASED BUSINESSES OPERATING ABROAD, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT.

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (OIG), THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE FTC, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ), U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), THE BRAZILIAN SECURITIES REGULATOR, THE COMISSÃO DE VALORES MOBILIÁRIOS (CVM), THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS), THE BRAZILIAN FEDERAL REVENUE SERVICE - THE SECRETARIA DA RECEITA FEDERAL (SRF), THE DOL, THE FDIC AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN REVIEWED OR ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW, INCLUDING FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH CODING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE RISK-ADJUSTMENT MODEL. SUCH GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF ANY ADVERSE INVESTIGATION, AUDIT RESULTS OR SANCTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHILE RETAINING OUR CURRENT BUSINESS.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES COMPANY, WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, HMOS, TPAS AND BUSINESS SERVICES OUTSOURCING COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE FORMED NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS OR WITH CMS, SPECIALTY BENEFIT PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, DISEASE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AND VARIOUS HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONSULTING COMPANIES. FOR OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HEALTH NET, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE, WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION, AND, WITH RESPECT TO OUR BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS, SEVERAL ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS IN BRAZIL, AND OTHER ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. FOR OUR OPTUMRX BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE CVS CAREMARK CORPORATION, EXPRESS SCRIPTS, INC. AND CATAMARAN CORPORATION. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND OPTUMINSIGHT REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A BROAD AND DIVERSE SET OF BUSINESSES. NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THESE MARKETS, ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES RELATE TO THE SALES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT AND SATISFACTION; THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; CARE DELIVERY; NETWORK AND CLINICAL MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES; MARKET SHARE; PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS; FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION. IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS,” FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

THE STATEMENTS, ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, GUIDANCE OR OUTLOOK CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (PSLRA). WHEN USED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN FUTURE FILINGS BY US WITH THE SEC, IN OUR NEWS RELEASES, PRESENTATIONS TO SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, AND IN ORAL STATEMENTS MADE BY OR WITH THE APPROVAL OF ONE OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE WORDS OR PHRASES “BELIEVE,” “EXPECT,” “INTEND,” “ESTIMATE,” “ANTICIPATE,” “PLAN,” PROJECT,” “SHOULD” OR SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PSLRA. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS THAT INVESTORS AND OTHERS SHOULD CONSIDER. WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS OR UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN FUTURE FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS HOW ANY OF THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE CAUSED RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM DISCUSSIONS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW MAY HAVE AFFECTED PAST, AS WELL AS CURRENT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT FUTURE RESULTS. ANY OR ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC FILINGS OR STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY TURN OUT TO BE WRONG. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS. BY THEIR NATURE, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OR QUANTIFY. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT OR ANY OF OUR PRIOR COMMUNICATIONS.

IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY ESTIMATE, PRICE FOR AND MANAGE OUR MEDICAL COSTS, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD DECLINE AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

UNDER OUR RISK-BASED BENEFIT PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED BENEFITS PRODUCTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. WE GENERALLY USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO 85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF THESE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MEDICAL COSTS. IN THIS REGARD, THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION ESTABLISHED MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS FOR CERTAIN HEALTH PLANS AND AUTHORIZED HHS TO MAINTAIN AN ANNUAL PRICE INCREASE REVIEW PROCESS FOR COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS, WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS COMPETITIVELY. SEE THE RISK FACTOR BELOW RELATING TO HEALTH CARE REFORM FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE PROVISIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPTUMHEALTH COLLABORATIVE CARE BUSINESS NEGOTIATES CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH COMMERCIAL THIRD PARTY PAYERS. UNDER THE TYPICAL CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER RECEIVES A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF A THIRD PARTY PAYER’S PREMIUMS TO COVER ALL OR A DEFINED PORTION OF THE MEDICAL COSTS PROVIDED TO THE CAPITATED MEMBER. IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY PREDICT, PRICE FOR OR MANAGE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING CARE TO OUR CAPITATED MEMBERS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MANAGE MEDICAL COSTS THROUGH UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, PRODUCT DESIGN, NEGOTIATION OF FAVORABLE PROVIDER CONTRACTS AND CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM REVENUE ON COMMERCIAL POLICIES IS TYPICALLY AT A FIXED RATE PER INDIVIDUAL SERVED FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. OUR REVENUE ON MEDICARE POLICIES IS BASED ON BIDS SUBMITTED IN JUNE THE YEAR BEFORE THE CONTRACT YEAR. WE BASE THE PREMIUMS WE CHARGE AND OUR MEDICARE BIDS ON OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAL COSTS OVER THE FIXED CONTRACT PERIOD; HOWEVER, MANY FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS OR BIDS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE MEDICAL COST INFLATION, INCREASED USE OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES, NATURAL CATASTROPHES OR OTHER LARGE-SCALE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS (SUCH AS THE EXPANSION OF ESSENTIAL BENEFITS COVERAGE) OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES AND INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS. RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS OR UTILIZATION RATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF OUR 2012 MEDICAL COSTS FOR COMMERCIAL INSURED PRODUCTS WERE 1% HIGHER, WITHOUT PROPORTIONALLY HIGHER REVENUES FROM SUCH PRODUCTS, OUR ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2012 WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $215 MILLION, EXCLUDING ANY OFFSETTING IMPACT FROM PREMIUM REBATES.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR WHICH CLAIMS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE AN EXTENSIVE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO LOW, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLY REGULATED; NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THEIR ENFORCEMENT OR APPLICATION COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. OUR INSURANCE AND HMO SUBSIDIARIES MUST BE LICENSED BY AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY CONDUCT BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ENFORCE MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ALSO REGULATED UNDER STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS, AND SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO OTHER HEALTH CARE-RELATED REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO PPOS, MCOS, UTILIZATION REVIEW AND TPA-RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. SOME OF OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND OPTUM BUSINESSES HOLD OR PROVIDE SERVICES RELATED TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE AND NON-U.S. SELF-REFERRAL, ANTI-KICKBACK, MEDICAL NECESSITY, RISK ADJUSTMENT, FALSE CLAIMS, DEBT COLLECTION AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS AND THE USE OF GOVERNMENT FUNDS. IN ADDITION, UNDER STATE GUARANTY FUND LAWS, CERTAIN HEALTH, LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANIES AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, HMOS CAN BE ASSESSED (UP TO PRESCRIBED LIMITS) FOR CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO THE POLICYHOLDERS AND CLAIMANTS OF INSOLVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WRITE THE SAME LINE OR LINES OF BUSINESS IN THESE STATES, WHICH WOULD EXPOSE OUR BUSINESS TO THE RISK OF INSOLVENCY OF A COMPETITOR IN THESE STATES.

CERTAIN OF OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM THOSE FACED BY OUR INSURANCE AND HMO SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, FDA REGULATIONS, STATE TELEMEDICINE REGULATIONS AND STATE CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE DOCTRINES AND FEE-SPLITTING RULES, SOME OF WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, OPTUMHEALTH PARTICIPATES IN THE EMERGING PRIVATE EXCHANGE MARKETS AND IT IS NOT YET KNOWN TO WHAT EXTENT THE STATES WILL ISSUE NEW REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO PRIVATE EXCHANGES. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR TO DO SO AT TARGETED MARGINS, OR INCREASE THE REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE.

THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE, AND THE INTEGRATION INTO OUR BUSINESSES OF ENTITIES THAT WE ACQUIRE MAY AFFECT THE WAY IN WHICH EXISTING LAWS AND RULES APPLY TO US. THE BROAD LATITUDE GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING, INTERPRETING AND ENFORCING CURRENT AND FUTURE REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OR EXPOSE US TO INCREASED LIABILITY IN COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS.

WE MUST ALSO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS AND COMPLETE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OR INTEGRATE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, PREMIUM RATES FOR OUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND/OR MANAGED CARE PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REVIEW OR APPROVAL IN MANY STATES AND BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE ENHANCED (OR ARE PROPOSING TO ENHANCE) THEIR RATE REVIEW PROCESSES. IN ADDITION, GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT EXPANSIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY APPROVALS. DELAYS IN OBTAINING NECESSARY APPROVALS OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN ADEQUATE APPROVALS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE AND CONSEQUENTLY FACE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, COMPLIANCE, REGULATORY, OPERATIONAL AND OTHER RISKS AND EXPOSURES THAT ARE UNIQUE AND VARY BY JURISDICTION. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS AND ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING TAX, LICENSING, TARIFFS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INVESTMENT, MANAGEMENT CONTROL, LABOR RELATIONS, FRAUD AND CORRUPTION PRESENT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES FOR US THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE FACED BY U.S.-BASED BUSINESSES. WE HAVE RECENTLY ACQUIRED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ACQUIRE OR COMMENCE ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES BASED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ACQUISITION OF AMIL IN OCTOBER 2012

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUBJECTS US TO BRAZILIAN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING THE MANAGED CARE AND INSURANCE INDUSTRIES, WHICH VARY FROM COMPARABLE U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND REGULATION BY BRAZILIAN REGULATORS, WHOSE APPROACH TO THE INTERPRETATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF INDUSTRY REGULATIONS COULD DIFFER FROM THE APPROACH TAKEN BY U.S. REGULATORS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE AMIL ACQUISITION, SEE NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.” IN ADDITION, OUR NON-U.S. BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO U.S. LAWS THAT REGULATE THE CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES OF U.S.-BASED BUSINESSES OPERATING ABROAD, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH U.S. OR NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR CONDUCT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OR TO ESTABLISH CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH NON-U.S. REGULATORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR TO DO SO AT TARGETED MARGINS, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS ALSO REGULARLY SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, ADVERSE MEDIA COVERAGE AND POLITICAL DEBATE SURROUNDING INDUSTRY REGULATION. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS OR FOSTER AN INCREASINGLY ACTIVE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH, IN TURN, COULD FURTHER INCREASE THE REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE AND OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES, SEE ITEM 1, “BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION.”

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND OTHER REFORMS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION EXPANDS ACCESS TO COVERAGE AND MODIFIES ASPECTS OF THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET, AS WELL AS THE MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS, CHIP AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION INCLUDES GUARANTEED COVERAGE AND EXPANDED BENEFIT REQUIREMENTS, ELIMINATES PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS AND ANNUAL AND LIFETIME MAXIMUM LIMITS, RESTRICTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH POLICIES CAN BE RESCINDED, ESTABLISHES MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS, CREATES A FEDERAL PREMIUM REVIEW PROCESS, IMPOSES NEW REQUIREMENTS ON THE FORMAT AND CONTENT OF COMMUNICATIONS (SUCH AS EXPLANATIONS OF BENEFITS, OR EOBS) BETWEEN HEALTH INSURERS AND THEIR MEMBERS, GRANTS TO MEMBERS NEW AND ADDITIONAL APPEAL RIGHTS, IMPOSES NEW AND SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON HEALTH INSURERS AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, REDUCES THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP AND REDUCES PAYMENTS TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION HAVE ALREADY TAKEN EFFECT, AND OTHER PROVISIONS BECOME EFFECTIVE AT VARIOUS DATES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. HHS, THE DOL AND THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT HAVE ISSUED OR PROPOSED REGULATIONS ON A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, BUT FINAL RULES AND INTERIM GUIDANCE ON OTHER KEY ASPECTS OF THE LEGISLATION REMAIN PENDING. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, THE IMPACT OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND IS NOT YET FULLY KNOWN. FOR EXAMPLE, EFFECTIVE IN 2011, THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION ESTABLISHED MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS FOR ALL COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS IN THE LARGE EMPLOYER GROUP, SMALL EMPLOYER GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL MARKETS (85% FOR LARGE EMPLOYER GROUPS, 80% FOR SMALL EMPLOYER GROUPS AND 80% FOR INDIVIDUALS, CALCULATED UNDER THE DEFINITIONS IN THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS), SUBJECT TO STATE SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS. COMPANIES WITH MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS BELOW THESE TARGETS ARE REQUIRED TO REBATE RATABLE PORTIONS OF THEIR PREMIUMS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS ANNUALLY. THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS THAT DETERMINE THE SIZE OF THE REBATES WILL BE MEASURED BY STATE, BY GROUP SIZE AND BY LICENSED SUBSIDIARY. THIS DISAGGREGATION OF INSURANCE POOLS INTO MUCH SMALLER POOLS WILL LIKELY DECREASE THE PREDICTABILITY OF RESULTS FOR ANY GIVEN POOL AND COULD LEAD TO VARIATION OVER TIME IN THE ESTIMATES OF REBATES OWED IN TOTAL. EFFECTIVE IN 2014, MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIO OF 85%, ALTHOUGH THE RULES EXPECTED TO SET FORTH THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING THIS MEDICAL LOSS RATIO HAVE NOT YET BEEN ISSUED. SOME STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE ALSO IMPOSING MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REQUIREMENTS ON MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE SUCH PLANS TO REBATE RATABLE PORTIONS OF THEIR PREMIUMS TO THEIR STATE CUSTOMERS IF THEY CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THEY HAVE MET THE MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS. DEPENDING ON OUR CALCULATIONS OF THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS FOR EACH OF OUR PLANS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH WE ADJUST OUR BUSINESS MODEL IN LIGHT OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, THERE COULD BE MEANINGFUL DISRUPTIONS IN LOCAL HEALTH CARE MARKETS, AND OUR MARKET SHARE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION, THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL EMPLOYERS BY 2014. THE TYPES OF EXCHANGE PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS ULTIMATELY ENACTED BY EACH STATE, THE AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR PREMIUMS AND COST-SHARING REDUCTIONS WITHIN EXCHANGES, THE POTENTIAL FOR DIFFERENTIAL IMPOSITION OF STATE BENEFIT MANDATES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EXCHANGES, THE OPERATION OF REINSURANCE, RISK CORRIDORS AND RISK ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EXCHANGES AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT CERTAIN STATES MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF HEALTH PLANS TO CONTINUE TO OFFER COVERAGE TO INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL EMPLOYERS OUTSIDE OF THE EXCHANGES COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTIONS IN LOCAL HEALTH CARE MARKETS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION ALSO INCLUDES SPECIFIC REFORMS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETPLACE, SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT IN JANUARY 2014, INCLUDING ADJUSTED COMMUNITY RATING REQUIREMENTS (WHICH INCLUDE ELIMINATION OF HEALTH STATUS AND GENDER RATING FACTORS), ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT REQUIREMENTS (EXPECTED TO RESULT IN BENEFIT CHANGES FOR MANY MEMBERS) AND ACTUARIAL VALUE REQUIREMENTS LIKELY TO RESULT IN EXPANDED BENEFITS OR REDUCED MEMBER COST SHARING (OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH) FOR SOME POLICYHOLDERS. ALTHOUGH HHS ISSUED PROPOSED REGULATIONS RELATED TO THESE PROVISIONS IN LATE 2012, THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE NOT YET FINAL AND MOST STATES HAVE NOT ISSUED IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS OR GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT TO THESE PROVISIONS. DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND OUTCOME OF THE FINAL FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND REQUIRED STATE REGULATIONS OR GUIDANCE, THERE COULD BE DISRUPTIONS IN LOCAL HEALTH CARE MARKETS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION INCLUDES A “MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT” (MOE) PROVISION THAT REQUIRES STATES TO MAINTAIN THEIR ELIGIBILITY RULES FOR ADULTS COVERED BY MEDICAID, UNTIL THE SECRETARY OF HHS DETERMINES THAT AN INSURANCE EXCHANGE IS OPERATIONAL IN A GIVEN STATE, SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 2014, AND FOR CHILDREN COVERED BY MEDICAID OR CHIP, THROUGH FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR 2019. STATES WITH, OR PROJECTING, A BUDGET DEFICIT MAY APPLY FOR AN EXCEPTION TO THE MOE PROVISION. IF STATES ARE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING MOE WAIVERS AND ALLOW CERTAIN MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO EXPIRE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED MEDICAID ENROLLMENT, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

UNDER THE U.S. SUPREME COURT’S JUNE 2012 DECISION, STATE PARTICIPATION IN THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION’S MEDICAID EXPANSION IS VOLUNTARY. SEVERAL STATES HAVE INDICATED THEY MAY NOT EXPAND THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS BASED ON CONCERNS OVER COSTS WHEN EXPANDED FEDERAL FUNDING PARES DOWN, STARTING IN 2017. THE EXTENT TO WHICH STATES EXPAND THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS, OR DISCONTINUE CURRENT EXPANSION PROGRAMS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR MEDICAID ENROLLMENT LEVELS, WHICH COULD IN TURN MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

SEVERAL OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION WILL LIKELY INCREASE OUR MEDICAL COST TRENDS. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROVISIONS ARE THE EXCISE TAX ON MEDICAL DEVICES, ANNUAL FEES ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG MANUFACTURERS, ENHANCED COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT REQUIREMENTS AND PHASED-IN CLOSING OF THE COVERAGE GAP FOR MEDICARE PART D PARTICIPANTS), THE PROHIBITION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADJUSTED COMMUNITY RATING REQUIREMENTS. THE ANNUAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY ASSESSMENT ($8 BILLION TO BE LEVIED ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN 2014 INCREASING TO $14.3 BILLION BY 2018 WITH INCREASING ANNUAL AMOUNTS THEREAFTER), WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES, AND THE TEMPORARY REINSURER’S FEE ($25 BILLION TO BE LEVIED ON ALL COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS INCLUDING INSURED AND SELF-FUNDED ARRANGEMENTS, OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD STARTING IN 2014), WILL INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. PREMIUM INCREASES OR BENEFIT REDUCTIONS WILL BE NECESSARY TO OFFSET THE IMPACT THESE AND OTHER PROVISIONS WILL HAVE ON OUR MEDICAL AND OPERATING COSTS. THESE PREMIUM INCREASES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATORY APPROVAL, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGING STATES TO INTENSIFY THEIR REVIEWS OF REQUESTS FOR RATE INCREASES BY COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDING FUNDING TO ASSIST IN THOSE STATE-LEVEL REVIEWS. WE HAVE BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE GREATER REGULATORY CHALLENGES TO APPROPRIATE PREMIUM RATE INCREASES IN SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK. IN ADDITION, AS REQUIRED UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, HHS ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL PREMIUM RATE REVIEW PROCESS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN SEPTEMBER 2011 AND GENERALLY APPLIES TO PROPOSED RATE INCREASES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING 10%. THE REGULATIONS FURTHER REQUIRE COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS TO PROVIDE TO THE STATES AND HHS EXTENSIVE INFORMATION SUPPORTING RATE INCREASES. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SECURE APPROVAL FOR ADEQUATE PREMIUM INCREASES TO OFFSET INCREASES IN OUR COST STRUCTURE OR IF CONSUMERS FOREGO COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF SUCH PREMIUM INCREASES, OUR MARGINS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, PLANS DEEMED TO HAVE A HISTORY OF “UNREASONABLE” RATE INCREASES MAY BE PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE-BASED EXCHANGES THAT BECOME ACTIVE UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION IN 2014. UNDER THE REGULATIONS, THE HHS RATE REVIEW PROCESS WOULD APPLY ONLY TO HEALTH PLANS IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS.

WE ALSO EXPECT THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS AND CAPABILITIES OFFERED BY OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES. WE HAVE MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS AND INVESTMENTS BASED, IN PART, ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF FEWER INDIVIDUALS GAIN COVERAGE UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION THAN WE EXPECT OR WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT THESE NEW INDIVIDUALS TO OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE OFFERINGS, OR IF THE DEMAND FOR OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES DOES NOT INCREASE.

FUTURE REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE ACTION COULD FURTHER IMPACT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION. FOR EXAMPLE, CONGRESS MAY ATTEMPT TO AMEND OR WITHHOLD THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE ENACTED OR ARE CONTEMPLATING SIGNIFICANT REFORMS OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, EITHER INDEPENDENT OF OR TO COMPLY WITH OR BE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS OR OTHER INCENTIVES IN CONNECTION WITH THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION. NEW FEDERAL OR STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD FORCE US TO MATERIALLY CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS AND ANY AMENDMENT, WITHHOLDING OF FUNDING, EXTENDED DELAYS IN THE ISSUANCE OF NECESSARY FEDERAL AND STATE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS OR GUIDANCE OR OTHER UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED BY THE LEGISLATION OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS OF COMPLIANCE OR REVERSE SOME OF THE CHANGES WE HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED. IN ADDITION, OUR MARKET SHARE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL, AND OUR CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, SEE ITEM 1, “BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION” AND ITEM 7, “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW - REGULATORY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, BOTH AS A PAYER AND AS A SERVICE PROVIDER TO PAYERS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAM FUNDING, ENROLLMENTS, PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS, AUDITS AND GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

WE PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING AS A PAYER IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, VARIOUS MEDICAID PROGRAMS, CHIP AND OUR TRICARE WEST CONTRACT WITH THE DOD, AND RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUES FROM THESE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PAYERS THROUGH OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT LEVELS, REDUCE OUR PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN SERVICE AREAS OR MARKETS, OR INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR MEDICAL COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. REVENUES FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PERIODIC FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING THROUGH VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS. FUNDING FOR THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AT THE FEDERAL OR APPLICABLE STATE LEVEL, AND GENERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AND PRIORITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CMS HAS IN THE PAST REDUCED OR FROZEN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE BENCHMARKS AND ADDITIONAL CUTS TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE BENCHMARKS ARE EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ADJUSTED MEMBERS’ BENEFITS AND PREMIUMS ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, TERMINATED BENEFIT PLANS IN CERTAIN COUNTIES, AND INTENSIFIED BOTH OUR MEDICAL AND OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THESE BENCHMARK REDUCTIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY ON THESE OR OTHER STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM. A REDUCTION OR LESS THAN EXPECTED INCREASE, OR A PROTRACTED DELAY, IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS OR CHANGE IN ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

UNDER THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM, STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES ARE PERIODICALLY REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO SEEK BIDS FROM ELIGIBLE HEALTH PLANS TO CONTINUE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACUTE CARE MEDICAID HEALTH PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING RENEWALS OF STATE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS THAT WERE ENROLLED IN THOSE MEDICAID PLANS. UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, TO QUALIFY FOR AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME MEMBERS, OUR BIDS MUST RESULT IN AN ENROLLEE PREMIUM BELOW A REGIONAL BENCHMARK, WHICH IS CALCULATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER ALL REGIONAL BIDS ARE SUBMITTED. IF THE ENROLLEE PREMIUM IS NOT BELOW THE GOVERNMENT BENCHMARK, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS WHO WERE AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LOST APPROXIMATELY 470,000 OF OUR AUTO-ENROLLED LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY MEMBERS IN 2012 BECAUSE CERTAIN OF OUR BIDS EXCEEDED THRESHOLDS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN GENERAL, OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT, UTILIZATION, MEDICAL COSTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MATERIALLY INCORRECT, EITHER AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM OR OTHER PROGRAMS ON WHICH WE BID, OR OUR COMPETITORS SUBMIT BIDS AT LOWER RATES THAN OUR BIDS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANY OF THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS OR PERFORMANCE STANDARDS OR BENCHMARKS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS PART OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, CMS HAS DEVELOPED A SYSTEM ENTITLING PLANS THAT MEET CERTAIN QUALITY RATINGS AT THE LOCAL PLAN LEVEL TO VARIOUS QUALITY BONUS PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, CONGRESS AUTHORIZED CMS AND THE STATES TO IMPLEMENT MME MANAGED CARE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS TO SERVE DUALLY ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES TO IMPROVE THE COORDINATION OF THEIR CARE. HEALTH PLAN PARTICIPATION IN THESE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS IS SUBJECT TO CMS APPROVAL OF SPECIFIED CARE DELIVERY MODELS AND THE SATISFACTION OF CONDITIONS TO PARTICIPATION, INCLUDING MEETING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. ANY CHANGES IN STANDARDS OR CARE DELIVERY MODELS THAT APPLY TO GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND THE MME DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS FOR DUALLY ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES, OR OUR INABILITY TO MEET GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OR TO MATCH THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPETITORS COULD RESULT IN LIMITATIONS TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN OR EXCLUSION FROM THESE OR OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, WHICH IN TURN COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

CMS USES VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING ADJUSTING MONTHLY CAPITATION PAYMENTS TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS AND MEDICARE PART D PLANS ACCORDING TO THE PREDICTED HEALTH STATUS OF EACH BENEFICIARY AS SUPPORTED BY DATA FROM HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS, FOR MEDICARE PART D PLANS, RISK-SHARING PROVISIONS BASED ON A COMPARISON OF COSTS PREDICTED IN OUR ANNUAL BIDS TO ACTUAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. SOME STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS UTILIZE A SIMILAR PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICARE & RETIREMENT AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE COMMUNITY & STATE BUSINESSES SUBMIT INFORMATION RELATING TO THE HEALTH STATUS OF ENROLLEES TO CMS OR STATE AGENCIES FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO US. CMS AND THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR HHS PERIODICALLY PERFORM RISK ADJUSTMENT DATA VALIDATION (RADV) AUDITS OF SELECTED MEDICARE HEALTH PLANS TO VALIDATE THE CODING PRACTICES OF AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MAINTAINED BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, AND CERTAIN OF OUR LOCAL PLANS HAVE BEEN AUDITED. SUCH AUDITS HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED AND COULD IN THE FUTURE RESULT IN RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO OUR HEALTH PLANS, FINES, CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS OR OTHER ADVERSE ACTION BY CMS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, CMS PUBLISHED A FINAL RADV AUDIT AND PAYMENT ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY. THE METHODOLOGY CONTAINS PROVISIONS ALLOWING RETROACTIVE CONTRACT LEVEL PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE YEAR AUDITED, BEGINNING WITH 2011 PAYMENTS, USING AN EXTRAPOLATION OF THE “ERROR RATE” IDENTIFIED IN AUDIT SAMPLES AND, FOR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS, AFTER CONSIDERING A FEE-FOR-SERVICE (FFS) “ERROR RATE” ADJUSTER THAT WILL BE USED IN DETERMINING THE PAYMENT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADJUSTMENT. DEPENDING ON THE PLANS SELECTED FOR AUDIT, IF ANY, AND THE ERROR RATE FOUND IN THOSE AUDITS, IF ANY, POTENTIAL PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

WE HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS, REVIEWS AND ASSESSMENTS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OIG, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE FTC, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE DOJ, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE CVM, THE IRS, THE SRF, THE DOL, THE FDIC AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN REVIEWED OR ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW, INCLUDING FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH CODING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE RISK-ADJUSTMENT MODEL. SUCH INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS OR REVIEWS SOMETIMES ARISE OUT OF OR PROMPT CLAIMS BY PRIVATE LITIGANTS OR WHISTLEBLOWERS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE FAILED TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES OR, AS A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR, SUBMITTED FALSE CLAIMS TO THE GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS, REVIEWS AND ASSESSMENTS COULD EXPAND TO SUBJECTS BEYOND THOSE TARGETED BY THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION, AUDIT, REVIEW, ASSESSMENT OR PRIVATE ACTION AND COULD LEAD TO GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN OF THESE MATTERS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT UTILIZE SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION ON OUR BEHALF, OR IF WE FAIL TO ADDRESS EMERGING SECURITY THREATS OR DETECT AND PREVENT PRIVACY AND SECURITY INCIDENTS, OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE, PROTECTION, USE, TRANSMISSION, DISCLOSURE AND DISPOSAL OF SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION ARE REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, INTERNATIONAL AND INDUSTRY LEVELS AND REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPOSED ON US BY CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THESE LAWS, RULES AND REQUIREMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. FURTHER, MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARDS (PCI DSS), WHICH IS A MULTIFACETED SECURITY STANDARD THAT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT DATA AS MANDATED BY PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY ENTITIES. SEE ITEM 1, “BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION” FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. HIPAA ALSO REQUIRES BUSINESS ASSOCIATES AS WELL AS COVERED ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND IN CERTAIN CASES ASSESS THEIR SECURITY CONTROLS, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED OVERSIGHT OR CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND PRACTICES.

OUR FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY INCIDENTS; SECURITY ATTACKS AND BREACHES; ACTS OF VANDALISM OR THEFT; COMPUTER VIRUSES; COORDINATED ATTACKS BY ACTIVIST ENTITIES; EMERGING CYBERSECURITY RISKS; MISPLACED OR LOST DATA; PROGRAMMING AND/OR HUMAN ERRORS; OR OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. EMERGING AND ADVANCED SECURITY THREATS, INCLUDING COORDINATED ATTACKS, REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF SECURITY WHICH MAY DISRUPT OR IMPACT EFFICIENCY OF OPERATIONS.

COMPLIANCE WITH NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, AND MAY CONSTRAIN OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS MODEL. FOR EXAMPLE, FINAL HHS REGULATIONS RELEASED IN JANUARY 2013 IMPLEMENTING THE ARRA AMENDMENTS TO HIPAA MAY FURTHER RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT, DISCLOSE AND USE SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, HHS HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ITS AUDIT PROGRAM TO ASSESS HIPAA COMPLIANCE EFFORTS BY COVERED ENTITIES. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT AWARE OF HHS PLANS TO AUDIT ANY OF OUR COVERED ENTITIES, AN AUDIT RESULTING IN FINDINGS OR ALLEGATIONS OF NONCOMPLIANCE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

NONCOMPLIANCE OR FINDINGS OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS, OR THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY PRIVACY OR SECURITY BREACH INVOLVING THE MISAPPROPRIATION, LOSS OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION, WHETHER BY US OR BY ONE OF OUR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS, INCLUDING MANDATORY DISCLOSURE TO THE MEDIA, SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE COST OF MANAGING AND REMEDIATING PRIVACY OR SECURITY INCIDENTS AND MATERIAL FINES, PENALTIES AND LITIGATION AWARDS, AMONG OTHER CONSEQUENCES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR BUSINESSES PROVIDING PBM SERVICES FACE REGULATORY AND OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PBM INDUSTRY THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE RISKS OF OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING MANAGED CARE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

WE PROVIDE PBM SERVICES THROUGH OUR OPTUMRX AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES. EACH BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE ANTI-KICKBACK AND OTHER LAWS THAT GOVERN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, PHYSICIANS, PHARMACIES, CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. OPTUMRX ALSO CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS A MAIL ORDER PHARMACY AND SPECIALTY PHARMACY, WHICH SUBJECTS IT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATURES REGULARLY CONSIDER NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OR DISCLOSURE OF REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF FORMULARIES, AND THE USE OF AVERAGE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHOLESALE PRICES. SEE ITEM 1, “BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION” FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR PBM BUSINESSES.

OUR PBM BUSINESSES WOULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO CONTRACT ON FAVORABLE TERMS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS, AND COULD FACE POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED ERRORS BY OUR MAIL ORDER OR SPECIALTY PHARMACIES, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. DISRUPTIONS AT ANY OF OUR MAIL ORDER OR SPECIALTY PHARMACIES DUE TO AN ACCIDENT OR AN EVENT THAT IS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY PROCESS AND DISPENSE PRESCRIPTIONS AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

IN ADDITION, OUR PBM BUSINESSES PROVIDE SERVICES TO SPONSORS OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ERISA. THE DOL, WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT ENFORCES ERISA, COULD ASSERT THAT THE FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE APPLY TO SOME OR ALL OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR PBM BUSINESSES EVEN WHERE OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO ASSUME FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS. IN THE EVENT A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS APPLY TO OUR PBM BUSINESSES IN CONNECTION WITH SERVICES FOR WHICH OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO ASSUME FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS OR ENTERING INTO CERTAIN PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE EMPLOYER & INDIVIDUAL RECENTLY BEGAN TO TRANSITION PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGEMENT FOR APPROXIMATELY 12 MILLION OF ITS COMMERCIAL MEMBERS, INCLUDING PHARMACY CLAIMS ADJUDICATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, FROM EXPRESS SCRIPTS’ SUBSIDIARY, MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., TO OPTUMRX. IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH OUR PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSITION, UNITEDHEALTHCARE EMPLOYER & INDIVIDUAL COULD FACE LOSS OF BUSINESS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS

COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES ON THE BASIS OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICE OF BENEFITS OFFERED AND COST AND RISK OF ALTERNATIVES, LOCATION AND CHOICE OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, COMPREHENSIVENESS OF COVERAGE OFFERED, REPUTATION FOR QUALITY CARE, FINANCIAL STABILITY AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HEALTH NET, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE, WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION, AND, WITH RESPECT TO OUR BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS, SEVERAL ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS IN BRAZIL, AND OTHER ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. FOR OUR OPTUMRX BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE CVS CAREMARK CORPORATION, EXPRESS SCRIPTS, INC. AND CATAMARAN CORPORATION. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND OPTUMINSIGHT REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A BROAD AND DIVERSE SET OF BUSINESSES.

IN PARTICULAR MARKETS, COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER CAPABILITIES, RESOURCES OR MARKET SHARE; A MORE ESTABLISHED REPUTATION; SUPERIOR SUPPLIER OR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS; BETTER EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS; OR OTHER FACTORS THAT GIVE SUCH COMPETITORS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BOTH AMONG OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND OTHER CARE PROFESSIONALS). CONSOLIDATION MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE OUR CUSTOMER BASE, IMPROVE THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, OR MAINTAIN OR INCREASE PROFITABILITY. IF WE DO NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR MARKETS, IF WE SET RATES TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, IF WE DO NOT DESIGN AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS PROPERLY AND COMPETITIVELY, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INNOVATE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT DEMONSTRATE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IF WE DO NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY LEVEL OF SERVICES, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DOES NOT INCREASE AS WE EXPECT OR DECLINES, OR IF WE LOSE ACCOUNTS WITH MORE PROFITABLE PRODUCTS WHILE RETAINING OR INCREASING MEMBERSHIP IN ACCOUNTS WITH LESS PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR SERVICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO CONTRACT FOR THESE SERVICES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES. FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, WHETHER IN-NETWORK OR OUT-OF-NETWORK, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART. IN ADDITION, ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS (ACOS), PRACTICE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WHICH AGGREGATE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND MARKETING LEVERAGE, AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES THAT PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS CHOOSE MAY CHANGE THE WAY THAT THESE PROVIDERS INTERACT WITH US AND MAY CHANGE THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. SUCH ORGANIZATIONS OR GROUPS OF PHYSICIANS MAY COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH US, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE PROVIDERS OR AFFECT THE WAY THAT WE PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND ESTIMATE OUR COSTS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR OPERATIONS, AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, IF THESE PROVIDERS REFUSE TO CONTRACT WITH US, USE THEIR MARKET POSITION TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE CONTRACTS OR PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET PRODUCTS OR TO BE PROFITABLE IN THOSE AREAS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE HAVE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS, BUT EXPOSE US TO RISK RELATED TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL CARE RESOURCES OF THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. TO THE EXTENT THAT A CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION FACES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID HEALTH CARE CLAIMS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PAID THE PROVIDER UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT. FURTHER, PAYMENT OR OTHER DISPUTES BETWEEN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND SPECIALISTS WITH WHOM THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A DISRUPTION IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS OR A REDUCTION IN THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR MEMBERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH WHOM WE CONTRACT WILL PROPERLY MANAGE THE COSTS OF SERVICES, MAINTAIN FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OR AVOID DISPUTES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS AND OUR OPERATIONS.

SOME PROVIDERS THAT RENDER SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE CONTRACTS WITH US. IN THOSE CASES, WE DO NOT HAVE A PRE-ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT IS DUE TO THE PROVIDER FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO OUR MEMBERS. IN SOME STATES, THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION DUE TO THESE OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS IS DEFINED BY LAW OR REGULATION, BUT IN MOST INSTANCES, IT IS EITHER NOT DEFINED OR IT IS ESTABLISHED BY A STANDARD THAT DOES NOT CLEARLY SPECIFY DOLLAR TERMS. IN SOME INSTANCES, PROVIDERS MAY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE UNDERPAID FOR THEIR SERVICES AND MAY EITHER LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTE WITH US OR TRY TO RECOVER FROM OUR MEMBERS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE PAID THEM AND THE AMOUNT THEY CHARGED US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN “LITIGATION MATTERS” IN NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.”

THE SUCCESS OF CERTAIN OPTUM BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY COLLABORATIVE CARE, DEPENDS ON MAINTAINING SATISFACTORY PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIPS. THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THAT PRACTICE MEDICINE OR CONTRACT WITH OUR AFFILIATED PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS COULD TERMINATE THEIR PROVIDER CONTRACTS OR OTHERWISE BECOME UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO CONTINUE PRACTICING MEDICINE OR CONTRACTING WITH US. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS, OR TO RETAIN ENROLLEES FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF A PHYSICIAN, OUR REVENUES COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, OUR AFFILIATED PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS CONTRACT WITH HEALTH INSURANCE AND HMO COMPETITORS OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE. IF OUR AFFILIATED PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS FAIL TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE HEALTH INSURANCE OR HMO COMPANIES, OR TO ADEQUATELY PRICE THEIR CONTRACTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTY PAYERS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION, PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE CUSTOMERS OF OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND OTHER CONSTITUENTS TO OUR BUSINESSES, FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LITIGATION ACTIONS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND, IF RESOLVED UNFAVORABLY, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES AND/OR MONETARY DAMAGES AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DESIGN, MANAGEMENT AND DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE MATTERS HAVE INCLUDED OR COULD IN THE FUTURE INCLUDE CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE AND PAYMENT (INCLUDING DISPUTES WITH ENROLLEES, CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTED AND NON-CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS), TORT (INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES, SUCH AS MEDICAL MALPRACTICE BY HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED BY US, HAVE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH US, OR SERVE AS PROVIDERS TO OUR MANAGED CARE NETWORKS), CONTRACT AND LABOR DISPUTES, TAX CLAIMS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO PARTY TO CERTAIN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS AND CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, WE PERIODICALLY ACQUIRE BUSINESSES OR COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WHERE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS, TAX POSITIONS AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION OR UNCERTAINTY TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THEREFORE SUBJECT TO DISPUTE BY CUSTOMERS, GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES OR OTHERS. WE ARE LARGELY SELF-INSURED WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION RISKS. ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN EXCESS

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH OUTSIDE INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE LIABILITIES RECORDED.

A DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.” WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE ACTIONS WITH CERTAINTY, AND WE ARE INCURRING EXPENSES IN RESOLVING THESE MATTERS. THE LEGAL ACTIONS WE FACE OR MAY FACE IN THE FUTURE COULD FURTHER INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN LEGAL ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN ADVERSE PUBLICITY, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT BUSINESS OR GROW OUR MARKET SHARE IN SELECT MARKETS AND BUSINESSES.

ANY FAILURE BY US TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR COMPLETE, MANAGE OR INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES, AND OUTSOURCING TRANSACTIONS AND OFTEN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS RELATING TO SUCH TRANSACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH AARP UNDER WHICH WE PROVIDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE TO AARP MEMBERS AND OTHER AARP-BRANDED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BOTH AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE NEEDS OF AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, INCLUDING BY DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COMPETITIVELY OR RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY CHANGES, OUR ALLIANCE WITH THE AARP COULD BE DAMAGED OR TERMINATED, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FURTHER, IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSACTIONS THAT FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY INTERNALLY, WE MAY BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE MARKET PERCEPTIONS, ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. FOR ACQUISITIONS, SUCCESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT UPON EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO INTEGRATE THESE BUSINESSES INTO OUR INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH MAY PRESENT CHALLENGES THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE PRESENTED BY ORGANIC GROWTH AND THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AND GROW THESE ACQUISITIONS AND TO REALIZE CONTEMPLATED REVENUE SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS, OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ACQUIRED FOREIGN BUSINESSES, SUCH AS AMIL, WILL PRESENT CHALLENGES THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE PRESENTED BY ACQUISITIONS OF DOMESTIC BUSINESSES, INCLUDING ADAPTING TO NEW MARKETS, BUSINESS, LABOR AND CULTURAL PRACTICES AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE AMIL ACQUISITION, SEE NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.” ADAPTING TO THESE CHALLENGES COULD REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND OTHER RESOURCES TO THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES BEFORE WE REALIZE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OR SYNERGIES FROM THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE CHALLENGES VARY WIDELY BY COUNTRY AND MAY INCLUDE POLITICAL INSTABILITY, GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, DISCRIMINATORY REGULATION, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT COULD PREVENT US FROM TRANSFERRING FUNDS FROM THESE OPERATIONS OUT OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES OPERATE OR CONVERTING LOCAL CURRENCIES THAT WE HOLD INTO U.S. DOLLARS OR OTHER CURRENCIES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS, OUR BUSINESS, PROSPECTS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR DEBT TO DEBT-PLUS-EQUITY RATIO, AND THE FUTURE COSTS OF OR REVENUES AND CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND ANY MEASURES WE MAY IMPLEMENT TO REDUCE THE EFFECT OF VOLATILE CURRENCIES MAY BE COSTLY OR INEFFECTIVE.

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS AND CONSULTANTS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN PART THROUGH INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS AND CONSULTANTS WHO ASSIST IN THE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING OF BUSINESS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR PRODUCERS AND CONSULTANTS, WHO GENERALLY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO US AND WHO TYPICALLY ALSO RECOMMEND AND/OR MARKET HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF OUR COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, WE MUST COMPETE INTENSELY FOR THEIR SERVICES AND ALLEGIANCE. OUR SALES WOULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE WERE UNABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS AND CONSULTANTS OR IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SUPPORT, TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO THEM REGARDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, OR IF OUR SALES STRATEGY IS NOT APPROPRIATELY ALIGNED ACROSS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

BECAUSE PRODUCER COMMISSIONS ARE INCLUDED AS ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES UNDER THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REQUIREMENTS OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, THESE EXPENSES WILL BE UNDER THE SAME COST REDUCTION PRESSURES AS OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. OUR

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRODUCERS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THE NATURE OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS TO ADDRESS THESE PRESSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN COMMISSIONS.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF PRODUCERS SELLING HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND THE PAYMENTS THEY RECEIVE. THESE HAVE RESULTED IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AND PRODUCERS MARKETING AND SELLING THESE COMPANIES’ PRODUCTS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES AND THE IMPOSITION OF CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPACT DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE LOWER ENROLLMENT OR LOWER RATES OF RENEWAL IN OUR EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS AND OUR NON-EMPLOYER INDIVIDUAL PLANS. UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE ALSO CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE EMPLOYERS TO STOP OFFERING CERTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OR ELECT TO OFFER THIS COVERAGE ON A VOLUNTARY, EMPLOYEE-FUNDED BASIS AS A MEANS TO REDUCE THEIR OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PREMIUMS OR RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION BY CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ALL OF THESE COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN OUR MEMBERSHIP LEVELS AND PREMIUM AND FEE REVENUES AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

DURING A PROLONGED UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED, RESULTING IN REDUCED REIMBURSEMENTS OR PAYMENTS IN OUR FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND CHIP. A REDUCTION IN STATE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PAYMENTS ALREADY NEGOTIATED AND/OR RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, THE STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETARY PRESSURES COULD CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE NEW OR A HIGHER LEVEL OF TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND SURCHARGES OR FEES ON SELECT FEE-FOR-SERVICE AND CAPITATED MEDICAL CLAIMS, AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

IN ADDITION, A PROLONGED UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF HOSPITALS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONTRACTED RATES WITH THESE PARTIES AND INCREASE OUR MEDICAL COSTS OR MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO PURCHASE OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. FURTHER, UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CUSTOMERS OF OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES, INCLUDING HEALTH PLANS, HMOS, HOSPITALS, CARE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYERS AND OTHERS, WHICH COULD, IN TURN, MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OPTUM’S FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

MARKET FLUCTUATIONS COULD IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTS OUR INTEREST INCOME AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES OF VARYING MATURITIES, WHICH COMPRISE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. RELATIVELY LOW INTEREST RATES ON INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS THOSE EXPERIENCED DURING RECENT YEARS, HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR INVESTMENT INCOME, AND A PROLONGED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT INCOME. IN ADDITION, A DELAY IN PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND/OR INTEREST BY ISSUERS, OR DEFAULTS BY ISSUERS (PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS), COULD REDUCE OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY.

WE ALSO ALLOCATE A SMALL PROPORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO TO EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS WILL PRODUCE TOTAL POSITIVE RETURNS OR THAT WE WILL NOT SELL INVESTMENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE LESS THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUES. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT ASSETS, AS A RESULT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, CHANGES IN ISSUER FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, ILLIQUIDITY OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY. IN ADDITION, IF IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE CAPITAL POSITION OF REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

IF THE VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MATERIALLY IMPAIRED, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND DEBT RATINGS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE

$36.0 BILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, REPRESENTING

44%

OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY BE IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE A CHARGE TO EARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MANNER IN OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION IS IMPLEMENTED MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN OUR BUSINESS. SIMILARLY, THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF BUSINESSES THAT WE ACQUIRE PERFORM IN A MANNER THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME WE DIVEST BUSINESSES, AND ANY SUCH DIVESTITURE COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ASSET IMPAIRMENT AND DISPOSITION CHARGES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. ANY FUTURE EVALUATIONS REQUIRING AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY COULD, IN TURN, ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR DEBT RATINGS OR POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR DEBT COVENANTS.

IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OR AVAILABILITY OF OUR DATA OR TO STRATEGICALLY IMPLEMENT NEW OR UPGRADE OR CONSOLIDATE EXISTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR IF OUR TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS DO NOT OPERATE AS INTENDED, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES AND RECENTLY ENACTED REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE PERIODICALLY CONSOLIDATE, INTEGRATE, UPGRADE AND EXPAND OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN, PROTECT AND ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING SYSTEMS AND REGULATORY STANDARDS, EMERGING CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND THREATS, AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PATTERNS. IF THE INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WAS FOUND TO BE INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OR PROTECT OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE DIFFICULTY PREVENTING, DETECTING AND CONTROLLING FRAUD, HAVE DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, HAVE REGULATORY SANCTIONS OR PENALTIES IMPOSED, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATING THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE, UPGRADING AND EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES, PROTECTING OUR SYSTEMS AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND THREATS, ENHANCING OUR SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPING NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS ISSUES WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO PROTECT, CONSOLIDATE AND INTEGRATE OUR SYSTEMS SUCCESSFULLY COULD RESULT IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED COSTS AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT’S TIME AND ENERGY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES SELL AND INSTALL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND THESE PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN UNEXPECTED DESIGN DEFECTS OR MAY ENCOUNTER UNEXPECTED COMPLICATIONS DURING INSTALLATION OR WHEN USED WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED BY THE CUSTOMER. CONNECTIVITY AMONG COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. A FAILURE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS TO OPERATE AS INTENDED AND IN A SEAMLESS FASHION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

IN ADDITION, UNCERTAIN AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE, NON-U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MARKET MAY PRESENT COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES AND COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE CONFIGURATION OF OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PLATFORMS, AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THIS MARKET.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES COULD BE HINDERED AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND OUR TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUNDS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IS RESTRICTED AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

BECAUSE WE OPERATE AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON DIVIDENDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS. MANY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED BY DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY LAW OR REGULATION TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIC PRESCRIBED MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE LEVELS OF CAPITALIZATION REQUIRED DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON THE VOLUME OF PREMIUM REVENUES GENERATED BY THE APPLICABLE SUBSIDIARY. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PREMIUM VOLUME WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITALIZATION FROM US. IN MOST STATES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK PRIOR APPROVAL BY THESE STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES BEFORE WE TRANSFER MONEY OR PAY DIVIDENDS FROM THESE SUBSIDIARIES THAT

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCEED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. AN INABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES IN THE DESIRED AMOUNTS OR AT THE TIME OF OUR CHOOSING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR CORPORATE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT CYCLE, REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND REPAY OUR DEBT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

DOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AND CREDIT RATINGS BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. RATINGS INFORMATION IS BROADLY DISSEMINATED AND GENERALLY USED THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE OUR CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS TO CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR CREDIT RATINGS IMPACT BOTH THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS. EACH OF THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATINGS PERIODICALLY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. OUR RATINGS REFLECT EACH CREDIT RATING AGENCY’S OPINION OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO MEET OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS. DOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

IN NOVEMBER 1997, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH THE BOARD EVALUATES PERIODICALLY. IN JUNE 2012, THE BOARD RENEWED AND EXPANDED OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WITH AN AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO 110 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR OTHER TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING PREPAID OR STRUCTURED REPURCHASE PROGRAMS). THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED EXPIRATION DATE FOR THE PROGRAM.

UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

ON NOVEMBER 2, 2012, WE ISSUED AND SOLD, IN RELIANCE ON SECTION 4(A)(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, 8 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO CSHG 1122 FUNDO DE INVESTIMENTO MULTIMERCADO - CRÉDITO PRIVADO

BUENO HAS AGREED TO HOLD THE SHARES FOR FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF SALE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THERETO. READERS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE STATEMENTS, ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OUTLOOK CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS REGARDING FINANCIAL PROSPECTS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTAINED IN THIS ITEM 7, MAY CONSTITUTE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PSLRA. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. A DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CAN BE FOUND FURTHER BELOW IN THIS ITEM 7 AND IN ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS.”

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

GENERAL

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP IS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING COMPANY DEDICATED TO HELPING PEOPLE LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES AND MAKING HEALTH CARE WORK BETTER. WE OFFER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH TWO DISTINCT PLATFORMS: UNITEDHEALTHCARE, WHICH PROVIDES HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND BENEFITS SERVICES; AND OPTUM, WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED HEALTH SERVICES. FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR BUSINESS IS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1, “BUSINESS” AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE OUR SEGMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THIS ITEM 7 AND IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.”

REVENUES

OUR REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PREMIUMS DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS TYPICALLY AT A FIXED RATE PER INDIVIDUAL SERVED FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND WE ASSUME THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING OUR CUSTOMERS’ HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE ALSO GENERATE REVENUES FROM FEE-BASED SERVICES PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE HEALTH CARE COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES’ DEPENDANTS. FOR BOTH RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED HEALTH CARE BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS, WE PROVIDE COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES; TRANSACTION PROCESSING; HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. WE ALSO GENERATE SERVICE REVENUES FROM OUR OPTUM BUSINESSES RELATING TO CARE MANAGEMENT, CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT, DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES, HEALTH FINANCIAL SERVICES, OPERATIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT, HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACY SERVICES. PRODUCT REVENUES ARE MAINLY COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY OUR PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. WE DERIVE INVESTMENT INCOME PRIMARILY FROM INTEREST EARNED ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES; INVESTMENT INCOME ALSO INCLUDES GAINS OR LOSSES WHEN INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE SOLD, OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

PRICING TRENDS

. WE SEEK TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS CONSISTENT WITH ANTICIPATED UNDERLYING MEDICAL TRENDS, WHILE BALANCING GROWTH, MARGINS, COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, COST INCREASES FOR THE INDUSTRY FEES AND TAX PROVISIONS OF HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND PREMIUM REBATES AT THE LOCAL MARKET LEVEL. WE ENDEAVOR TO SUSTAIN A COMMERCIAL MEDICAL CARE RATIO IN A STABLE RANGE FOR AN EQUIVALENT MIX OF BUSINESS. CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX AND HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION MAY IMPACT OUR PREMIUMS, MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL CARE RATIO. FURTHER, WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT PREMIUM RATES TO BE UNDER PRESSURE THROUGH CONTINUED MARKET COMPETITION IN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND GOVERNMENT PAYMENT RATES. AGGREGATING UNITEDHEALTHCARE’S BUSINESSES, WE EXPECT THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO TO RISE OVER TIME AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE SENIOR AND PUBLIC MARKETS AND PARTICIPATE IN THE HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE MARKET IN 2014.

IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET SEGMENT, WE EXPECT PRICING TO CONTINUE TO BE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN 2013. WE PLAN TO HOLD TO OUR PRICING DISCIPLINES AND, CONSIDERING THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND PERSISTENTLY WEAK EMPLOYMENT AND NEW BUSINESS FORMATION RATES, WE EXPECT CONTINUED PRESSURE ON OUR COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCT MEMBERSHIP IN 2013. ADDITIONALLY, SELF-INSURED MEMBERSHIP AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL COMMERCIAL MEMBERSHIP IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT A MODEST PACE IN 2013 AND BEYOND, DUE IN PART TO THE EMERGING POPULARITY OF MIDSIZE EMPLOYERS MOVING TO SELF-FUNDED ARRANGEMENTS.

IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, WE ARE SEEING CONTINUING RATE PRESSURES, AND RATE CHANGES FOR SOME MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE. UNLIKE IN PRIOR YEARS, RECENT MEDICAID REDUCTIONS HAVE GENERALLY NOT BEEN MITIGATED BY CORRESPONDING BENEFIT REDUCTIONS OR CARE PROVIDER FEE SCHEDULE REDUCTIONS BY THE STATE SPONSOR. WE CONTINUE TO TAKE A PRUDENT, MARKET-SUSTAINABLE POSTURE FOR BOTH NEW BIDS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING MEDICAID CONTRACTS. MEDICARE FUNDING IS SIMILARLY PRESSURED; SEE FURTHER DISCUSSION BELOW IN “REGULATORY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES.” WE EXPECT THESE FACTORS TO RESULT IN PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES FOR OUR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS IN 2013.

IN 2013, UNITEDHEALTHCARE CREATED A NEW AFFORDABLE “BASIC PLAN” FOR MEDICARE PART D CONSUMERS AND RECLASSIFIED ITS LARGE 4 MILLION MEMBER MEDICARE PART D PLAN TO AN “ENHANCED PLAN” STATUS WITH CMS. THE CHANGE TO ENHANCED PLAN STATUS CHANGES THE SEASONAL PATTERN OF EARNINGS TO LATER IN THE YEAR WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT EXPECTED ON FULL YEAR PROFITABILITY.

OPERATING COSTS

MEDICAL COSTS.

MEDICAL COSTS REPRESENT THE COSTS OF OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR CLAIMS AND/OR BENEFITS OF OUR RISK-BASED INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY ESTIMATE, PRICE FOR AND MANAGE OUR MEDICAL COSTS THROUGH UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, PRODUCT DESIGN, NEGOTIATION OF FAVORABLE CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTS AND CARE COORDINATION PROGRAMS. CONTROLLING MEDICAL COSTS REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED APPROACH TO ORGANIZE AND ADVANCE THE FULL RANGE OF INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG PATIENTS/CONSUMERS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL/TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS.

MEDICAL COSTS INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED OR PROCESSED CLAIMS, AND OUR ESTIMATES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS.

OUR MEDICAL CARE RATIO, CALCULATED AS MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES, REFLECTS THE COMBINATION OF PRICING, REBATES, BENEFIT DESIGNS, CONSUMER HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE FACILITATION EFFORTS.

MEDICAL COST TRENDS.

IN 2012, WE MANAGED OUR COMMERCIAL MEDICAL COST TREND TO A LEVEL UNDER 5.5 PERCENT. IN 2013, WE EXPECT A SLIGHT INCREASE IN TREND FROM 2012, ALBEIT WITH RELATIVELY CONSISTENT UNIT COST AND UTILIZATION TRENDS COMPARED TO 2012. WE EXPECT OUR TOTAL TREND WILL BE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED UNIT COST PRESSURE FROM HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AS THEY TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR SOFT UTILIZATION TRENDS AND CROSS-SUBSIDIZATION PRESSURE DUE TO THEIR GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS.

UNDERLYING UTILIZATION TRENDS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2010 AND INCREASED MODESTLY IN 2011 AND 2012. USE OF OUTPATIENT SERVICES HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF UTILIZATION TREND INCREASE, WITH INPATIENT UTILIZATION DECLINING. WE ALSO EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS IN 2012 AND EXPECT THAT TREND TO CONTINUE DUE TO UNIT COST PRESSURE AND A TREND TOWARDS EXPENSIVE NEW SPECIALTY DRUGS. AS WE MOVE INTO 2013, WE BELIEVE CURRENT UTILIZATION TRENDS ARE SLIGHTLY BELOW WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE NORMAL UTILIZATION LEVELS. THE WEAK ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, COMBINED WITH OUR MEDICAL COST MANAGEMENT, HAS HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON UTILIZATION TRENDS. WE BELIEVE OUR ALIGNMENT OF PROGRESSIVE BENEFIT DESIGNS, CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT, CLINICAL MANAGEMENT, PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS FOR CARE PROVIDERS AND NETWORK RESOURCES IS FAVORABLY CONTROLLING MEDICAL AND PHARMACY COSTS, ENHANCING AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND MEMBERS AND HELPING TO DRIVE STRONG MARKET RESPONSE AND GROWTH.

OPERATING COSTS.

OPERATING COSTS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF COSTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AGENT AND BROKER COMMISSIONS, PREMIUM TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS, PROFESSIONAL FEES, ADVERTISING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS. WE SEEK TO IMPROVE OUR OPERATING COST RATIO, CALCULATED AS OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES, FOR AN EQUIVALENT MIX OF BUSINESS. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX, SUCH AS INCREASES IN THE SIZE OF OUR HEALTH SERVICES BUSINESSES OR AN INCREASE IN THE DELIVERY OF MEDICAL SERVICES ON AN INTEGRATED BASIS MAY IMPACT OUR OPERATING COSTS AND OPERATING COST RATIO.

OTHER BUSINESS TRENDS

OUR BUSINESSES PARTICIPATE IN THE U.S., BRAZILIAN AND CERTAIN OTHER HEALTH ECONOMIES. IN THE U.S., HEALTH CARE SPENDING COMPRISES APPROXIMATELY 18% OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND HAS GROWN CONSISTENTLY FOR MANY YEARS. WE EXPECT OVERALL SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE FUTURE, DUE TO INFLATION, MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND PHARMACEUTICAL ADVANCEMENT, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS IN THE POPULATION AND NATIONAL INTEREST IN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE RATE OF MARKET GROWTH MAY BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND REGULATORY CHANGES, INCLUDING IN THE U.S. ENACTED HEALTH CARE REFORMS, WHICH COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DELIVERY SYSTEM AND PAYMENT MODERNIZATION.

THE MARKET IS CHANGING BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS, NEW REGULATIONS, POLITICAL FORCES AND BOTH PAYER AND PATIENT EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS ARE CREATING MARKET PRESSURES TO CHANGE FROM FEE-FOR-SERVICE MODELS TO NEW DELIVERY MODELS FOCUSED ON THE HOLISTIC HEALTH OF THE CONSUMER, INTEGRATED CARE ACROSS CARE PROVIDERS AND PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE PAYMENT STRUCTURES. HEALTH PLANS AND CARE PROVIDERS ARE BEING CALLED UPON TO WORK TOGETHER TO CLOSE GAPS IN CARE AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL CARE FOR PEOPLE, IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF A POPULATION AND REDUCE THE COST OF CARE. THE FOCUS ON DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION AND PAYMENT REFORM IS CRITICAL AND THE ALIGNMENT OF INCENTIVES BETWEEN KEY CONSTITUENTS REMAINS AN IMPORTANT THEME. WE HAVE SEEN INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN INCENTIVE-BASED PAYMENT MODELS SUCH AS PAY FOR PERFORMANCE, SHARED SAVINGS, BUNDLED/EPISODE PAYMENT AND PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOME MODELS (PCMHS). WE ALSO HAVE SEEN CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF RISK-BASED ACCOUNTABLE CARE MODELS DESIGNED TO MODERNIZE LOCAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS BY BETTER COORDINATING CARE, REDUCING THE FRAGMENTATION OF TREATMENTS BETWEEN MULTIPLE CARE PROVIDERS IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM, LIMITING UNNECESSARY HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND READMISSIONS, FOCUSING ON PREVENTIVE CARE, BREAKING DOWN REIMBURSEMENT AND TREATMENT “SILOS,” AND IMPROVING QUALITY AND OUTCOMES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIS TREND IS CREATING THE NEED FOR HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICES THAT CAN COORDINATE CARE AROUND THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND FOR INVESTMENT IN NEW CLINICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, PROVIDING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR OPTUM BUSINESS PLATFORM.

GOVERNMENT RELIANCE ON PRIVATE SECTOR.

THE GOVERNMENT, AS A BENEFIT SPONSOR, HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY RELYING ON PRIVATE SECTOR SOLUTIONS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AS WE BELIEVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDES A MORE FLEXIBLE, BETTER MANAGED, HIGHER QUALITY HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE THAN DO TRADITIONAL PASSIVE INDEMNITY PROGRAMS TYPICALLY USED IN GOVERNMENTAL BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

STATES ARE STRUGGLING TO BALANCE UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET PRESSURES WITH INCREASES IN THEIR MEDICAID EXPENDITURES. AT THE SAME TIME, MANY ARE EXPANDING THEIR INTEREST IN MANAGED CARE WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON CONSUMERS WHO HAVE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE HEALTH CARE NEEDS. MORE AND MORE, MEDICAID MANAGED CARE IS BEING VIEWED AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND MANAGE COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE MORE THAN NINE MILLION INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. DUALLY ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES TYPICALLY HAVE COMPLEX CONDITIONS WITH COSTS OF CARE THAT ARE FAR HIGHER THAN A TYPICAL MEDICARE OR MEDICAID BENEFICIARY. WHILE THESE INDIVIDUALS’ HEALTH NEEDS ARE MORE COMPLEX AND MORE COSTLY, THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN IN UNMANAGED ENVIRONMENTS. THIS PROVIDES UNITEDHEALTHCARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FINANCING TO FUND EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE THE HEALTH STATUS OF THIS FRAIL POPULATION THROUGH CLOSE COORDINATION OF CARE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, UNITEDHEALTHCARE SERVED MORE THAN 250,000 MEMBERS IN LEGACY DUALLY ELIGIBLE PROGRAMS THROUGH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND SNPS. IN 2013, UNITEDHEALTHCARE COMMUNITY & STATE WILL HELP IMPLEMENT OHIO’S MME PROGRAM, ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY UNDER THE NEW CMS DESIGN.

REGULATORY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES

FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF MANAGEMENT’S VIEW OF THE TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO SOME OF THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND OTHER REGULATORY ITEMS; FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES, SEE ITEM 1, “BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION” AND ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS.”

COMMERCIAL RATE INCREASE REVIEW.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION REQUIRES HHS TO MAINTAIN AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF “UNREASONABLE” INCREASES IN PREMIUM RATES FOR COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS. HHS ESTABLISHED A REVIEW THRESHOLD OF ANNUAL PREMIUM RATE INCREASES GENERALLY AT OR ABOVE 10% AND CLARIFIED THAT HHS REVIEW WILL NOT SUPERSEDE EXISTING STATE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES. PREMIUM RATE REVIEW LEGISLATION (RANGING FROM NEW OR ENHANCED RATE FILING REQUIREMENTS TO PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS) HAS BEEN INTRODUCED OR PASSED IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATES AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.

THE COMPETITIVE FORCES COMMON IN OUR MARKETS DO NOT SUPPORT UNJUSTIFIABLE RATE INCREASES. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A TIGHT, COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL PRICING ENVIRONMENT. FURTHER, OUR RATES AND RATE FILINGS ARE DEVELOPED USING METHODS CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS OF ACTUARIAL PRACTICES. WE ANTICIPATE REQUESTING RATE INCREASES ABOVE 10% IN A NUMBER OF MARKETS DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF MEDICAL COST TRENDS AND THE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF HEALTH CARE REFORM. WE HAVE BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE GREATER REGULATORY CHALLENGES TO APPROPRIATE PREMIUM RATE INCREASES IN SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK. DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY BY THE STATES, THERE IS A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL BUSINESS IMPACTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO PRICE OUR COMMERCIAL RISK BUSINESS CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTED UNDERLYING COST TRENDS, LEADING TO THE RISK OF OPERATING MARGIN COMPRESSION IN THE COMMERCIAL HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS.

MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RATES AND MINIMUM LOSS RATIOS.

MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRICING BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN CUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND ADDITIONAL CUTS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 2012, WITH CHANGES TO CONTINUE TO BE PHASED IN OVER THE NEXT ONE TO FIVE YEARS (BENCHMARKS WILL ULTIMATELY RANGE FROM 95% OF MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE RATES IN HIGH COST AREAS TO 115% IN LOW COST AREAS), DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF BENCHMARK REDUCTION IN A COUNTY. ADDITIONALLY, CONGRESS PASSED THE BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 2011, WHICH AS AMENDED BY THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012, WOULD TRIGGER AUTOMATIC ACROSS-THE-BOARD BUDGET CUTS (SEQUESTRATION), INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN OUTLAYS FOR MEDICARE STARTING IN MARCH 2013, ABSENT FURTHER CONGRESSIONAL ACTION. FURTHER, BEGINNING IN 2014, MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS WILL BE REQUIRED TO HAVE A MINIMUM MEDICAL LOSS RATIO OF 85%. CMS HAS NOT YET ISSUED GUIDANCE AS TO HOW THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE CALCULATED FOR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NETWORK CONTRACTS ARE TIED TO MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. HOWEVER, FUTURE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RATES MAY BE OUTPACED BY UNDERLYING MEDICAL COST TRENDS, PLACING CONTINUED IMPORTANCE ON EFFECTIVE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT AND ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS IN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS WE CAN AND ARE MAKING TO OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH MAY PARTIALLY OFFSET ANY IMPACT FROM THESE RATE REDUCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SEEK TO INTENSIFY OUR MEDICAL AND OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT, ADJUST MEMBERS’ BENEFITS AND DECIDE ON A COUNTY-BY-COUNTY BASIS IN WHICH GEOGRAPHIES TO PARTICIPATE. ADDITIONALLY, ACHIEVING HIGH QUALITY SCORES FROM CMS FOR IMPROVING UPON CERTAIN CLINICAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WILL IMPACT FUTURE QUALITY BONUSES THAT MAY OFFSET THESE ANTICIPATED RATE REDUCTIONS. THE EXPANDED STARS BONUS PROGRAM IS SET TO EXPIRE IN 2014. IN 2015, QUALITY BONUS PAYMENTS WILL ONLY BE PAID TO 4 AND 5 STAR PLANS PER PPACA (COMPARED TO CURRENT BONUSES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN QUALIFYING PLANS RATED 3 STARS OR HIGHER). APPROXIMATELY 60% AND 10% OF OUR CURRENT MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MEMBERS ARE ENROLLED IN PLANS THAT WILL BE RATED 3.5 STARS OR HIGHER AND 4 STARS OR

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY FOR THE 2014 PAYMENT YEAR BASED ON SCORING RELEASED BY CMS IN OCTOBER 2012. UPDATED SCORES, TO BE RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2013, WILL DETERMINE WHAT PORTION OF OUR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MEMBERSHIP WILL RESIDE IN A 4 STAR OR 5 STAR PLAN AND QUALIFY FOR QUALITY BONUS PAYMENTS IN 2015. ALTHOUGH WE ARE DEDICATING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO IMPROVING OUR QUALITY SCORES AND STAR RATINGS, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE LEVEL OF MEMBERSHIP IN PLANS WITH A RATING OF 4 STARS OR HIGHER FOR THE 2015 PAYMENT YEAR, OUR 2015 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.

WE ALSO MAY BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF REDUCED FUNDING BY INCREASING ENROLLMENT DUE, IN PART, TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE IN COMING YEARS. COMPARED TO 2011, OUR 2012 MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MEMBERSHIP HAS INCREASED BY

400,000

CONSUMERS, OR

18%

, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS. LONGER TERM, MARKET WIDE DECREASES IN THE AVAILABILITY OR RELATIVE QUALITY OF MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS MAY INCREASE DEMAND FOR OTHER SENIOR HEALTH BENEFITS PRODUCTS SUCH AS OUR MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND MEDICARE PART D INSURANCE OFFERINGS.

INDUSTRY FEES AND TAXES.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION INCLUDES AN ANNUAL, NON-DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TAX TO BE LEVIED PROPORTIONALLY ACROSS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY FOR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2014. THE AMOUNT OF THE ANNUAL TAX IS $8 BILLION IN 2014, $11.3 BILLION IN 2015 AND 2016, $13.9 BILLION IN 2017 AND $14.3 BILLION IN 2018. FOR 2019 AND BEYOND, THE AMOUNT WILL BE EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL TAX FOR THE PRECEDING YEAR INCREASED BY THE RATE OF PREMIUM GROWTH FOR THE PRECEDING YEAR. THE ANNUAL TAX WILL BE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE RATIO OF AN ENTITY’S NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN DURING THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR TO THE TOTAL HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY’S NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN FOR ANY U.S. HEALTH RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DURING THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THIS TAX WILL FIRST BE PAID AND EXPENSED IN 2014; HOWEVER, BECAUSE OUR POLICIES ARE ANNUAL, WE HAVE INCLUDED THE TAX AND OTHER HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION COST FACTORS IN OUR 2013 RATE FILINGS RELATING TO 2014 RATE PERIODS AND ANY RELATED PREMIUM INCREASES FOR 2013 POLICIES THAT HAVE COVERAGE INTO 2014 WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM RECOGNIZED IN 2013. OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2014 AS A RESULT OF THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF THESE TAXES.

WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF STATE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES IN 2014, THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION INCLUDES THREE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO STABILIZE THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE: A TRANSITIONAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM; A TEMPORARY RISK CORRIDORS PROGRAM; AND A PERMANENT RISK ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM. THE TRANSITIONAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM IS A TEMPORARY PROGRAM WHICH WILL BE FUNDED ON A PER CAPITA BASIS FROM ALL COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS INCLUDING INSURED AND SELF-FUNDED ARRANGEMENTS ($25 BILLION OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING IN 2014 OF WHICH $20 BILLION (SUBJECT TO INCREASES BASED ON STATE DECISIONS) WILL FUND THE STATE REINSURANCE POOLS AND $5 BILLION FUNDS THE U.S. TREASURY). THE TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC REINSURANCE PROGRAMS TO BE USED IN EACH STATE ARE NOT YET KNOWN.

IT IS OUR INTENTION TO PASS THESE TAXES AND FEES ON TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH INCREASES IN RATES AND/OR DECREASES IN BENEFITS, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL.

STATE-BASED EXCHANGES AND COVERAGE EXPANSION.

EFFECTIVE IN 2014, STATE-BASED EXCHANGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL EMPLOYERS WITH ENROLLMENT PROCESSES SCHEDULED TO COMMENCE IN OCTOBER OF 2013. WE EXPECT TO SELECTIVELY RESPOND AND PARTICIPATE IN EXCHANGES AS THEY ARE INTRODUCED TO THE MARKET. OUR LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN STATE-BASED EXCHANGES WILL BE DRIVEN BY HOW WE ASSESS EACH LOCAL MARKET’S CURRENT AND FUTURE PROSPECTS, INCLUDING HOW THE EXCHANGE AND ITS RULES ARE SET UP STATE-BY-STATE AND, OUR MARKET POSITION RELATIVE TO OTHERS IN THE MARKET. OUR PARTICIPATION WILL LIKELY EVOLVE AND CHANGE OVER TIME AS THE EXCHANGE MARKETS MATURE. EXCHANGES WILL CREATE NEW MARKET DYNAMICS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES, DEPENDING ON THE ULTIMATE MEMBER MIGRATION PATTERNS FOR EACH MARKET, ITS PACE AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR ESTABLISHED MEMBERSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN SMALL EMPLOYERS MAY NO LONGER OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND LARGER EMPLOYERS MAY ELECT TO CONVERT THEIR BENEFIT PLANS FROM RISK-BASED TO SELF-FUNDED PROGRAMS.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION ALSO PROVIDES FOR EXPANDED MEDICAID COVERAGE EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2014. THESE MEASURES REMAIN SUBJECT TO IMPLEMENTATION AT THE STATE LEVEL.

INDIVIDUAL & SMALL GROUP MARKET REFORMS.

THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION INCLUDES SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT WILL TAKE EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2014 AND ARE EXPECTED TO ALTER THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETPLACE. ALTHOUGH HHS ISSUED PROPOSED REGULATIONS IN LATE 2012, THESE REGULATIONS ARE NOT YET FINAL. KEY PROVISIONS INCLUDE: (1) ADJUSTED COMMUNITY RATING REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WILL CHANGE HOW INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP PLANS ARE RATED IN MANY STATES AND ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS IN SOME POLICYHOLDERS’ RATES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD; (2) ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WILL RESULT IN BENEFIT CHANGES FOR MANY INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP POLICYHOLDERS AND WILL ALSO IMPACT RATES; AND (3) ACTUARIAL VALUE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT BENEFIT DESIGNS (E.G. MEMBER COST SHARING REQUIREMENTS) AND COULD ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RATES FOR SOME POLICYHOLDERS.

2012 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2011 RESULTS

C

ONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS

REVENUES

REVENUE INCREASES IN

2012

WERE DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED AND PREMIUM RATE INCREASES RELATED TO UNDERLYING MEDICAL COST TRENDS IN OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES AND GROWTH IN OUR OPTUM HEALTH SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS.

MEDICAL COSTS

MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED IN

2012

DUE TO RISK-BASED MEMBERSHIP GROWTH IN OUR PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS BUSINESSES, UNIT COST INFLATION ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES AND CONTINUED MODERATE INCREASES IN HEALTH SYSTEM USE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FAVORABLE MEDICAL RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. UNIT COST INCREASES REPRESENTED THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF OUR MEDICAL COST TREND, WITH THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR BEING PRICE INCREASES TO HOSPITALS.

OPERATING COSTS

THE INCREASES IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FOR

2012

WERE DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH, INCLUDING INCREASES IN REVENUES FROM UNITEDHEALTHCARE FEE-BASED BENEFITS AND OPTUM SERVICES, WHICH CARRY COMPARATIVELY HIGHER OPERATING COSTS, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN THE OPTUMRX PHARMACY MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE MILITARY & VETERANS BUSINESSES.

INCOME TAX RATE

THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

2012

WAS DUE TO THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS TAX MATTERS IN 2011, WHICH LOWERED THE

2011

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE.

EARLIER PERIODS PRESENTED ABOVE HAVE BEEN RECAST SUCH THAT ALL PERIODS PRESENTED REFLECT THE DUALLY ELIGIBLE ENROLLMENT CHANGE FROM MEDICARE ADVANTAGE TO MEDICAID DISCUSSED ABOVE.

COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED MEMBERSHIP DECREASED IN 2012 DUE TO A COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT, CONVERSIONS TO FEE-BASED PRODUCTS BY LARGE PUBLIC SECTOR CLIENTS THAT WE RETAINED AND OTHER DECREASES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. IN FEE-BASED COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A NUMBER OF NEW BUSINESS AWARDS AND STRONG CUSTOMER RETENTION. MEDICARE ADVANTAGE INCREASED DUE TO STRENGTHENED EXECUTION IN PRODUCT DESIGN, MARKETING AND LOCAL ENGAGEMENT, WHICH DROVE SALES GROWTH, COMBINED WITH THE ADDITION OF 185,000 MEDICARE ADVANTAGE MEMBERS FROM 2012 ACQUISITIONS. MEDICAID GROWTH WAS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF WINNING NEW STATE ACCOUNTS AND GROWTH WITHIN EXISTING STATE CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FOURTH QUARTER MARKET WITHDRAWAL FROM ONE PRODUCT IN A SPECIFIC REGION, AFFECTING 175,000 BENEFICIARIES. MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT GROWTH WAS DUE TO STRONG RETENTION AND NEW SALES. IN OUR MEDICARE PART D STAND-ALONE BUSINESS, MEMBERSHIP DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FIRST QUARTER 2012 LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 470,000 AUTO-ASSIGNED LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY MEDICARE PART D BENEFICIARIES, DUE TO PRICING BENCHMARKS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SUBSIDIZED LOW INCOME MEDICARE PART D MARKET COMING IN BELOW OUR BIDS IN A NUMBER OF REGIONS. INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTS COMMERCIAL MEMBERSHIP IN BRAZIL ADDED AS A RESULT OF THE AMIL ACQUISITION IN 2012.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE’S REVENUE GROWTH IN

2012

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED, COMMERCIAL PREMIUM RATE INCREASES RELATED TO EXPECTED INCREASES IN UNDERLYING MEDICAL COST TRENDS AND THE IMPACT OF LOWER PREMIUM REBATES.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE’S EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR

2012

INCREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACTORS THAT INCREASED REVENUES COMBINED WITH AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO DRIVEN BY EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF MEDICAL COSTS AND INCREASED FAVORABLE MEDICAL RESERVE DEVELOPMENT. THE FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT FOR

2012

WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER THAN EXPECTED HEALTH SYSTEM UTILIZATION LEVELS AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY IN CLAIMS HANDLING AND PROCESSING.

IN MARCH 2012, UNITEDHEALTHCARE MILITARY & VETERANS WAS AWARDED THE TRICARE WEST REGION MANAGED CARE SUPPORT CONTRACT. THE CONTRACT, FOR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS, INCLUDES A TRANSITION PERIOD AND FIVE ONE-YEAR RENEWALS AT THE GOVERNMENT’S OPTION. THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATIONS IS ANTICIPATED TO BEGIN APRIL 1, 2013. THE BASE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES CONTRACT IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE A TOTAL OF $1.4 BILLION IN REVENUES OVER THE FIVE YEARS.

OPTUM.

TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED IN

2012

DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH AND 2011 ACQUISITIONS AT OPTUMHEALTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN PHARMACY SERVICE REVENUES RELATED TO REDUCED LEVELS OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG MEMBERSHIP AND RELATED PRESCRIPTION VOLUMES.

OPTUM’S EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN FOR

2012

INCREASED COMPARED TO 2011 DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATING COST STRUCTURE STEMMING FROM ADVANCES IN BUSINESS SIMPLIFICATION, INTEGRATION AND OVERALL EFFICIENCY AND REVENUE GROWTH IN HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCTS.

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE RESULTS BY SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS.

OPTUMHEALTH

REVENUE INCREASES AT OPTUMHEALTH FOR

2012

WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET EXPANSION, INCLUDING GROWTH RELATED TO 2011 ACQUISITIONS IN INTEGRATED CARE DELIVERY, AND STRONG OVERALL BUSINESS GROWTH.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR

2012

AND OPERATING MARGINS INCREASED COMPARED TO 2011 PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS IN OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND COST MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS INCREASES IN EARNINGS FROM INTEGRATED CARE OPERATIONS.

OPTUMINSIGHT

REVENUES AT OPTUMINSIGHT FOR

2012

INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF GROWTH IN COMPLIANCE SERVICES FOR CARE PROVIDERS AND PAYMENT INTEGRITY OFFERINGS FOR COMMERCIAL PAYERS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE JUNE 2011 DIVESTITURE OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS SERVICES BUSINESS.

THE INCREASES IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGINS FOR

2012

REFLECT AN IMPROVED MIX OF SERVICES AND ADVANCES IN OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND COST MANAGEMENT.

OPTUMRX

THE DECREASES IN OPTUMRX REVENUES IN

2012

WERE DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICARE PART D PLAN PARTICIPANTS. INTERSEGMENT REVENUES ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION WERE

$15.6 BILLION

FOR

2012

AND

$16.7 BILLION

FOR

2011.

OPTUMRX EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGINS FOR

2012

DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED PRESCRIPTION VOLUME IN THE MEDICARE PART D BUSINESS AND INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH INITIATIVES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SPECIALTY PHARMACY GROWTH AND GREATER USE OF GENERIC MEDICATIONS.

OVER THE COURSE OF 2013, WE WILL CONSOLIDATE AND MANAGE OUR COMMERCIAL PHARMACY BENEFIT PROGRAMS FROM EXPRESS SCRIPTS’ SUBSIDIARY, MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSITION, OPTUMRX EXPECTS TO ADD APPROXIMATELY12 MILLION MEMBERS THROUGHOUT 2013.

2011 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2010 RESULTS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS

REVENUES

THE INCREASES IN REVENUES FOR

2011

WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED IN OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES, COMMERCIAL PREMIUM RATE INCREASES REFLECTING UNDERLYING MEDICAL COST TRENDS AND REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS ALL OPTUM BUSINESSES.

MEDICAL COSTS

MEDICAL COSTS FOR

2011

INCREASED DUE TO RISK-BASED MEMBERSHIP GROWTH IN OUR COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC AND SENIOR MARKETS BUSINESSES AND CONTINUED INCREASES IN THE COST PER SERVICE PAID FOR HEALTH SYSTEM USE, AND A MODEST INCREASE IN HEALTH SYSTEM UTILIZATION, MAINLY IN OUTPATIENT AND PHYSICIAN OFFICE SETTINGS.

FOR EACH PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF REVISIONS IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO PRIOR PERIODS. CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO PRIOR PERIODS, RESULTING FROM MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS REPORTED FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD. FOR

2011

AND

2010

THERE WAS

$720 MILLION

AND

$800 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY, OF NET FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. THE FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN BOTH PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN CLAIMS SUBMISSION TIMELINESS, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER COMPLETION FACTORS AND LOWER THAN EXPECTED HEALTH SYSTEM UTILIZATION LEVELS. THE FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT IN 2010 ALSO BENEFITED FROM A REDUCTION IN RESERVES NEEDED FOR DISPUTED CLAIMS FROM CARE PROVIDERS; AND FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN STATE-BASED ASSESSMENTS.

OPERATING COSTS

THE INCREASE IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FOR

2011

WAS DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH, INCLUDING AN INCREASED MIX OF OPTUM AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE FEE-BASED AND SERVICE REVENUES, WHICH HAVE HIGHER OPERATING COSTS, AND INCREASED SPENDING RELATED TO REFORM READINESS AND COMPLIANCE. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OVERALL OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT AND THE INCREASE IN 2010 OPERATING COSTS DUE TO THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CHARGES FOR A BUSINESS LINE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN I3-BRANDED CLINICAL TRIAL SERVICE BUSINESSES.

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

2011

DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS HISTORICAL TAX MATTERS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS A HIGHER EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN 2010, DUE TO THE CUMULATIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN CHANGES UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

UNITEDHEALTHCARE

UNITEDHEALTHCARE’S REVENUE GROWTH FOR

2011

WAS DUE TO GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND COMMERCIAL PREMIUM RATE INCREASES REFLECTING EXPECTED UNDERLYING MEDICAL COST TRENDS.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE’S EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR

2011

INCREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OPERATING COST RATIO MORE THAN OFFSET INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS AND AN INCREASE TO THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INITIATION OF PREMIUM REBATE OBLIGATIONS IN 2011, AND LOWER FAVORABLE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT LEVELS.

OPTUM.

TOTAL REVENUE FOR THESE BUSINESSES INCREASED IN 2011 DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH AND ACQUISITIONS AT OPTUMHEALTH AND OPTUMINSIGHT AND GROWTH IN CUSTOMERS SERVED THROUGH PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AT OPTUMRX.

OPTUM’S OPERATING MARGIN FOR

2011

WAS DOWN COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX WITHIN OPTUM’S BUSINESSES AND REALIGNMENT OF CERTAIN INTERNAL BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS.

THE RESULTS BY SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS.

OPTUMHEALTH

INCREASED REVENUES AT OPTUMHEALTH FOR

2011

WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPANSIONS IN SERVICE OFFERINGS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS IN CLINICAL SERVICES, AS WELL AS GROWTH IN CONSUMER AND POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR

2011

AND OPERATING MARGIN DECREASED COMPARED TO 2010. THE DECREASES REFLECT THE IMPACT FROM INTERNAL BUSINESS AND SERVICE ARRANGEMENT REALIGNMENTS AND THE MIX EFFECT OF GROWTH AND EXPANSION IN NEWER BUSINESSES SUCH AS CLINICAL SERVICES.

OPTUMINSIGHT

INCREASED REVENUES AT OPTUMINSIGHT FOR

2011

WERE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF ORGANIC GROWTH AND THE FULL-YEAR IMPACT OF 2010 ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS SERVICES BUSINESS IN JUNE 2011.

THE INCREASES IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGINS FOR

2011

REFLECT AN INCREASED MIX OF HIGHER MARGIN SERVICES IN 2011 AS WELL AS THE EFFECT ON 2010 EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CHARGES FOR A BUSINESS LINE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN I3-BRANDED CLINICAL TRIAL SERVICE BUSINESSES.

OPTUMRX

THE INCREASE IN OPTUMRX REVENUES FOR

2011

WAS DUE TO INCREASED PRESCRIPTION VOLUMES, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN CUSTOMERS SERVED THROUGH MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS BY OUR UNITEDHEALTHCARE MEDICARE & RETIREMENT BUSINESS, AND A FAVORABLE MIX OF HIGHER REVENUE SPECIALTY DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS. INTERSEGMENT REVENUES ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION WERE

$16.7 BILLION

AND

$14.4 BILLION

FOR

2011

AND

2010

, RESPECTIVELY.

OPTUMRX EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGINS FOR

2011

DECREASED AS THE MIX OF LOWER MARGIN SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS AND MEDICAID BUSINESS AND INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH INITIATIVES INCLUDING THE IN-SOURCING OF OUR COMMERCIAL PHARMACY BENEFIT PROGRAMS MORE THAN OFFSET THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION FROM HIGHER REVENUES AND GREATER USE OF GENERIC MEDICATIONS.

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY

INTRODUCTION

WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY. WE CONTINUALLY FORECAST AND MANAGE OUR CASH, INVESTMENTS, WORKING CAPITAL BALANCES AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO MEET THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE PRINCIPALLY FROM EARNINGS BEFORE NON-CASH EXPENSES.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH JURISDICTION, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST OF THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH MODEL REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE NAIC. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS, THESE STANDARDS GENERALLY PERMIT DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID FROM STATUTORY UNASSIGNED SURPLUS OF THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARY AND ARE LIMITED BASED ON THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARY’S LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. THESE DIVIDENDS ARE REFERRED TO AS “ORDINARY DIVIDENDS” AND GENERALLY CAN BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF THE DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DIVIDENDS PAID WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED STATUTORY LIMIT OR IS PAID FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN EARNED SURPLUS, THE ENTIRE DIVIDEND IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AN “EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDEND” AND MUST RECEIVE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IN 2012, BASED ON THE 2011 STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVELS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ORDINARY DIVIDENDS WHICH COULD BE PAID BY OUR U.S. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES WAS

$4.6 BILLION.

IN

2012

, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES PAID THEIR PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF

$4.9 BILLION

, INCLUDING

$1.2 BILLION

OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS. IN

2011

, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES PAID THEIR PARENT COMPANIES DIVIDENDS OF

$4.5 BILLION

, INCLUDING

$1.1 BILLION

OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS.

OUR NON-REGULATED BUSINESSES ALSO GENERATE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE. CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THESE ENTITIES, COMBINED WITH DIVIDENDS FROM OUR REGULATED ENTITIES AND FINANCING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF LONG TERM DEBT AS WELL AS ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OR DRAWINGS UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. WE USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, REPAY DEBT, AND RETURN CAPITAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHAREHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND/OR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

2012 CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO 2011 CASH FLOWS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR

2012

INCREASED

$187 MILLION

, OR

3%

FROM 2011 DUE TO INCREASED NET INCOME AND RELATED TAX ACCRUALS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PAYMENT IN 2012 OF 2011 PREMIUM REBATE OBLIGATIONS AS 2012 WAS THE FIRST YEAR REBATE PAYMENTS WERE MADE UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH FLOWS USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED

$4.5 BILLION

, OR

107%

, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN ACQUISITIONS IN 2012. SEE NOTE 6 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON 2012 ACQUISITIONS.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED

$3.0 BILLION

PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND COMMON STOCK ISSUANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN CASH PAID FOR CUSTOMER FUNDS RELATED TO PART D AND INCREASED SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. THE INCREASES IN LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND COMMON STOCK ISSUANCES WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE AMIL ACQUISITION.

2011 CASH FLOWS COMPARED TO 2010 CASH FLOWS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED

$695 MILLION

, OR

11%

, FROM 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN NET EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN VARIOUS WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNTS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN UNEARNED REVENUES DUE TO THE EARLY RECEIPT OF CERTAIN 2011 STATE MEDICAID PREMIUM PAYMENTS IN 2010, WHICH INCREASED 2010 CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

CASH FLOWS USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED

$1.2 BILLION

, OR

22%

, PRIMARILY DUE TO RELATIVELY LOWER INVESTMENTS IN ACQUISITIONS IN 2011 AND A DECREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS.

CASH FLOWS USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED

$879 MILLION

, OR

55%

, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASES AND CASH DIVIDENDS IN 2011, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET BORROWINGS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENT AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT BALANCES OF

$28.3 BILLION

INCLUDED

$8.4 BILLION

OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (OF WHICH

$1.1 BILLION

WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED ENTITIES),

$19.2 BILLION

OF DEBT SECURITIES AND

$677 MILLION

OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO HELD IN CASH EQUIVALENTS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL POSITION. THE USE OF DIFFERENT MARKET ASSUMPTIONS OR VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE USED IN VALUING OUR

$241 MILLION

OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE LEVEL 3 SECURITIES (THOSE SECURITIES PRICED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS), MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS OF OUR INVESTMENTS. DUE TO THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS, THE ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE ACTUAL EXIT PRICE IF WE HAD SOLD THE INVESTMENT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, PRIMARILY FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY OUR BANK CREDIT FACILITIES, REDUCE THE NEED TO SELL INVESTMENTS DURING ADVERSE MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE NOTE 4 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” FOR FURTHER DETAIL OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAD A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DURATION OF 2.1 YEARS AND A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF “AA” AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. INCLUDED IN THE DEBT SECURITIES BALANCE WAS $1.9 BILLION OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE GUARANTEED BY A NUMBER OF THIRD PARTIES. DUE TO THE HIGH UNDERLYING CREDIT RATINGS OF THE ISSUERS, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF THESE SECURITIES WITH AND WITHOUT THE GUARANTEE WAS “AA” AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE GUARANTOR (NEITHER INDIRECT THROUGH THE GUARANTEES, NOR DIRECT THROUGH INVESTMENT IN THE GUARANTOR). WHEN MULTIPLE CREDIT RATINGS ARE AVAILABLE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SECURITY, THE AVERAGE OF THE AVAILABLE RATINGS IS USED TO DETERMINE THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CREDIT RATING.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND USES OF LIQUIDITY

IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES AND USES OF LIQUIDITY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

COMMERCIAL PAPER.

WE MAINTAIN A COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING PROGRAM, WHICH FACILITATES THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF UNSECURED DEBT THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM IS SUPPORTED BY THE BANK CREDIT FACILITIES DESCRIBED BELOW. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WE HAD

$1.6 BILLION

OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AT A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE OF

0.3%.

BANK CREDIT FACILITIES.

WE HAVE

$3.0 BILLION

FIVE-YEAR AND $1.0 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING BANK CREDIT FACILITIES WITH

21

BANKS, WHICH MATURE IN

NOVEMBER 2017

AND NOVEMBER 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THESE FACILITIES PROVIDE LIQUIDITY SUPPORT FOR OUR $4.0 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. THE INTEREST RATES ON BORROWINGS ARE VARIABLE DEPENDING ON TERM AND ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE LIBOR PLUS A CREDIT SPREAD BASED ON OUR SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATES ON THESE FACILITIES, HAD THEY BEEN DRAWN, WOULD HAVE RANGED FROM

1.0%

TO

1.3%.

OUR BANK CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS, INCLUDING REQUIRING US TO MAINTAIN A DEBT TO DEBT-PLUS-EQUITY RATIO OF NOT MORE THAN 50%. OUR DEBT TO DEBT-PLUS-EQUITY RATIO, CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS’

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUITY, WHICH REASONABLY APPROXIMATES THE ACTUAL COVENANT RATIO, WAS

PERIODICALLY, WE ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AND ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, FOR EXAMPLE, TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, TO REFINANCE DEBT, TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS OR FOR SHARE REPURCHASES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE AMIL ACQUISITION, WE ASSUMED VARIABLE RATE DEBT DENOMINATED IN BRAZILIAN REAIS, AMIL’S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THE TOTAL BRAZILIAN REAL DENOMINATED LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 WAS

$611 MILLION

, AND HAD AN AGGREGATE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 9%. FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE AMIL DEBT SEE NOTE 8 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.”

THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING IN THE FORM OF DEBT OR EQUITY IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR PROFITABILITY, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, DEBT LEVELS, CREDIT RATINGS, DEBT COVENANTS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING FOR US OR LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL. WE HAVE ADOPTED STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS TOWARD MAINTAINING FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH FACTORS ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ AUTHORIZATION, WE MAINTAIN A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR OTHER TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING PREPAID OR STRUCTURED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS), SUBJECT TO CERTAIN BOARD RESTRICTIONS. IN

JUNE 2012

, OUR BOARD RENEWED AND EXPANDED OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WITH AN AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO

110 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WE HAD BOARD AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL

85 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. FOR DETAILS OF OUR 2012 SHARE REPURCHASES, SEE NOTE 10 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.”

DIVIDENDS.

IN

JUNE 2012

, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED OUR CASH DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE OF

$0.85

PER SHARE, PAID QUARTERLY. SINCE

MAY 2011

, WE HAD PAID AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF

$0.65

PER SHARE, PAID QUARTERLY. DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD AND MAY BE ADJUSTED AS BUSINESS NEEDS OR MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. FOR DETAILS OF OUR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SEE NOTE 10 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.”

AMIL TENDER OFFER.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, WE PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 65% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF AMIL FOR $3.5 BILLION. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 25% OWNERSHIP INTEREST DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013 THROUGH A TENDER OFFER FOR AMIL’S PUBLICLY TRADED SHARES. THE TENDER OFFER PRICE WILL BE AT THE SAME PRICE PAID TO AMIL’S CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS, ADJUSTED FOR STATUTORY INTEREST UNDER BRAZILIAN LAW FROM THE DATE OF PAYMENT TO THE CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS TO THE DATE OF PAYMENT TO THE TENDERING MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.

WE DO NOT HAVE OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR COMMITMENTS THAT REQUIRE CASH RESOURCES; HOWEVER, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS. THIS INCLUDES INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS, AND MAY INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS (AS THAT PHRASE IS DEFINED BY SEC RULES APPLICABLE TO THIS REPORT) WHICH HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECENTLY ISSUED, BUT NOT YET ADOPTED, ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE THOSE ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CHALLENGING, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE THEY MUST ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERIODS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVE JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE AND MAY RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.

MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE

EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE EITHER NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED OR PROCESSED AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM PROCESSING BACKLOGS, SEASONAL VARIANCES IN MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE UTILIZATION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS, MEMBERSHIP VOLUME AND DEMOGRAPHICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, BENEFIT PLAN CHANGES, AND BUSINESS MIX CHANGES RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHY. DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AND TYPE OF SERVICE, THE TYPICAL BILLING LAG FOR SERVICES CAN BE UP TO 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO MEDICAL CARE SERVICES ARE KNOWN AND SETTLED WITHIN NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, OUR DAYS OUTSTANDING IN MEDICAL PAYABLES WAS 49 DAYS.

EACH PERIOD, WE RE-EXAMINE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES AND INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS. IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL DECREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL INCREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). MEDICAL COSTS IN

2012

,

2011

, AND

2010

INCLUDED FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS OF

$860 MILLION

,

$720 MILLION

AND

$800 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.

IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES, WE APPLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATION METHODS DEPENDING ON THE MONTH FOR WHICH INCURRED CLAIMS ARE BEING ESTIMATED. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ACTUARIALLY CALCULATE COMPLETION FACTORS USING AN ANALYSIS OF CLAIM ADJUDICATION PATTERNS OVER THE MOST RECENT 36-MONTH PERIOD. A COMPLETION FACTOR IS AN ACTUARIAL ESTIMATE, BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ANALYSIS OF CURRENT TRENDS, OF THE PERCENTAGE OF INCURRED CLAIMS DURING A GIVEN PERIOD THAT HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED BY US AT THE DATE OF ESTIMATION. FOR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE APPLY THE COMPLETION FACTORS TO ACTUAL CLAIMS ADJUDICATED-TO-DATE TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF ULTIMATE INCURRED CLAIMS FOR THOSE MONTHS. FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE ESTIMATE CLAIM COSTS INCURRED PRIMARILY BY APPLYING OBSERVED MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS TO THE AVERAGE PER MEMBER PER MONTH (PMPM) MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED IN PRIOR MONTHS FOR WHICH MORE COMPLETE CLAIM DATA IS AVAILABLE, SUPPLEMENTED BY A REVIEW OF NEAR-TERM COMPLETION FACTORS. THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

COMPLETION FACTORS.

COMPLETION FACTORS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS WE USE IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR OLDER PERIODS, GENERALLY PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS. THE COMPLETION FACTOR INCLUDES JUDGMENTS IN RELATION TO CLAIM SUBMISSIONS SUCH AS THE TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM INVENTORY LEVELS AND CLAIM PROCESSING BACKLOGS AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS. IF ACTUAL CLAIMS SUBMISSION RATES FROM PROVIDERS (WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING PROVIDER MIX AND ELECTRONIC VERSUS MANUAL SUBMISSIONS) OR OUR CLAIM PROCESSING PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT THAN ESTIMATED, OUR RESERVES MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE FACTORS AND THE ESTIMATED POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR THOSE PERIODS AS OF

MEDICAL COST PMPM TREND FACTORS.

MEDICAL COST PMPM TREND FACTORS ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS WE USE IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS. MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS ARE DEVELOPED THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF CLAIMS INCURRED IN PRIOR MONTHS, PROVIDER CONTRACTING AND EXPECTED UNIT COSTS, BENEFIT DESIGN, AND BY REVIEWING A

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BROAD SET OF HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION INDICATORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PHARMACY UTILIZATION TRENDS, INPATIENT HOSPITAL CENSUS DATA AND INCIDENCE DATA FROM THE NATIONAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. WE ALSO CONSIDER MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES SUCH AS GROSS-DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, EMPLOYMENT AND DISPOSABLE INCOME. A LARGE NUMBER OF FACTORS CAN CAUSE THE MEDICAL COST TREND TO VARY FROM OUR ESTIMATES INCLUDING: OUR ABILITY AND PRACTICES TO MANAGE MEDICAL COSTS, CHANGES IN LEVEL AND MIX OF SERVICES UTILIZED, MIX OF BENEFITS OFFERED INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES, CHANGES IN MEDICAL PRACTICES, CATASTROPHES AND EPIDEMICS.

THE ANALYSES ABOVE INCLUDE OUTCOMES THAT ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY LIKELY BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE ESTIMATING LIABILITIES FOR INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED BENEFIT CLAIMS.

OUR ESTIMATE OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT’S BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR LIABILITY FOR UNPAID MEDICAL COSTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, DEVELOPED USING CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACTUARIAL METHODS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE IS REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE TO COVER OUR LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

; HOWEVER, ACTUAL CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL 1% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR

DECEMBER 31, 2012

ESTIMATES OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, EXCLUDING AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE AND ANY POTENTIAL OFFSETTING IMPACT FROM PREMIUM REBATES,

2012

NET EARNINGS WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY $62 MILLION.

REVENUES

REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY DERIVED FROM HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS. WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY BILLED MONTHLY AT A CONTRACTED RATE PER ELIGIBLE PERSON MULTIPLIED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES, AS RECORDED IN OUR RECORDS.

EFFECTIVE IN 2011, U.S. COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS WITH MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS ON FULLY INSURED PRODUCTS, AS CALCULATED UNDER THE DEFINITIONS IN THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, THAT FALL BELOW CERTAIN TARGETS ARE REQUIRED TO REBATE RATABLE PORTIONS OF THEIR PREMIUMS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS ANNUALLY. PREMIUM REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED PREMIUMS EARNED NET OF PROJECTED REBATES BECAUSE WE ARE ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE PREMIUMS OF THESE CONTRACTS. EACH PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE PREMIUM REBATES BASED ON THE EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTS WITHIN EACH DEFINED AGGREGATION SET (E.G., BY STATE, GROUP SIZE AND LICENSED SUBSIDIARY). THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN ESTIMATING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ARE CURRENT AND FUTURE PREMIUMS AND MEDICAL CLAIM EXPERIENCE, EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND EXPECTED CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX. THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE PREMIUM IS REVISED EACH PERIOD TO REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED EXPERIENCE.

OUR MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND PART D PREMIUM REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC ADJUSTMENT UNDER CMS’ RISK ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT METHODOLOGY. THE CMS RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL PROVIDES HIGHER PER MEMBER PAYMENTS FOR ENROLLEES DIAGNOSED WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND LOWER PAYMENTS FOR ENROLLEES WHO ARE HEALTHIER. WE AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COLLECT, CAPTURE, AND SUBMIT AVAILABLE DIAGNOSIS DATA TO CMS WITHIN PRESCRIBED DEADLINES. CMS USES SUBMITTED DIAGNOSIS CODES, DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, AND SPECIAL STATUSES TO DETERMINE THE RISK SCORE FOR MOST MEDICARE ADVANTAGE BENEFICIARIES. CMS ALSO RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTS RISK SCORES DURING THE YEAR BASED ON ADDITIONAL DATA. WE ESTIMATE RISK ADJUSTMENT REVENUES BASED UPON THE DATA SUBMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CMS. AS A RESULT OF THE VARIABILITY OF FACTORS THAT DETERMINE SUCH ESTIMATIONS, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF CMS’ RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS COULD BE MATERIALLY MORE OR LESS THAN OUR ESTIMATES. THIS MAY RESULT IN FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR MEDICARE PREMIUM REVENUE AND, ACCORDINGLY, OUR PROFITABILITY. RISK ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PLANS IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING AUDIT BY REGULATORS. SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE AUDITS.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO THE UNDERLYING IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED, WE PERFORM A MULTI-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. FIRST, WE CAN ELECT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE WHETHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SUPPORT A DETERMINATION THAT THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE GREATER THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IF THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, OR IF WE ELECT TO PROCEED DIRECTLY WITH QUANTITATIVE TESTING, WE WILL THEN MEASURE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS AND COMPARE THEM TO THEIR AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN THE IMPLIED VALUE OF GOODWILL WOULD BE CALCULATED AND COMPARED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED.

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS INCLUDE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF FREE CASH FLOW (INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND INCOME TAXES), LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES FOR DETERMINING TERMINAL VALUE BEYOND THE DISCRETELY FORECASTED PERIODS, AND DISCOUNT RATES. FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT, COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE RESULTS OF OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TEST.

FORECASTS AND LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES USED FOR OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH, AND USE INPUTS FROM, OUR INTERNAL LONG-TERM BUSINESS PLAN AND STRATEGY. KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THESE FORECASTS INCLUDE.

•

REVENUE TRENDS.

KEY DRIVERS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT ARE DETERMINED AND ASSESSED. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS INCLUDE: MEMBERSHIP GROWTH, MEDICAL TRENDS, AND THE IMPACT AND EXPECTATIONS OF REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS. ADDITIONAL MACRO-ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AROUND UNEMPLOYMENT, GDP GROWTH, INTEREST RATES, AND INFLATION ARE ALSO EVALUATED AND INCORPORATED.

•

MEDICAL COST TRENDS.

SEE FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MEDICAL COSTS TRENDS WITHIN MEDICAL COSTS ABOVE. SIMILAR FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING OUR LONG-TERM MEDICAL TRENDS AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL.

•

OPERATING PRODUCTIVITY.

WE FORECAST EXPECTED OPERATING COST LEVELS BASED ON HISTORICAL LEVELS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE OPERATING COST PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES.

•

CAPITAL LEVELS.

THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH BUSINESS IS CONSIDERED.

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS USED ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, DUE TO THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE FORECASTS THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THOSE PROJECTIONS. THAT UNCERTAINTY IS INCREASED BY THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1, “BUSINESS - GOVERNMENT REGULATION”. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING HOW THE ENACTMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND HOW OTHER FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND THE RELATED LONG-TERM FORECASTS, SEE ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS” IN PART I AND “REGULATORY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES” ABOVE.

DISCOUNT RATES ARE DETERMINED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT AND INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPLIED RISK INHERENT IN THEIR FORECASTS. THIS RISK IS EVALUATED USING COMPARISONS TO MARKET INFORMATION SUCH AS PEER COMPANY WEIGHTED AVERAGE COSTS OF CAPITAL AND PEER COMPANY STOCK PRICES IN THE FORM OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES. BEYOND OUR SELECTION OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE RISK-FREE RATES AND EQUITY RISK PREMIUMS, OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINATIONS INVOLVE OUR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PEER COMPANY WEIGHTED AVERAGE COSTS OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECT REPORTING UNIT-SPECIFIC FACTORS. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE THE ADDITION OF SIZE PREMIUMS AND COMPANY-SPECIFIC RISK PREMIUMS INTENDED TO COMPENSATE FOR APPARENT FORECAST RISK. WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO DECREASE A DISCOUNT RATE BELOW THE CALCULATED PEER COMPANY WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT. COMPANY-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCOUNT RATES ARE SUBJECTIVE AND THUS ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE WITH CERTAINTY.

THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY IN REGARDS TO THE REPORTING UNITS’ OPERATIONS COULD CAUSE THESE ASSUMPTIONS TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

WE ELECTED TO BYPASS THE OPTIONAL QUALITATIVE REPORTING UNIT FAIR VALUE ASSESSMENT AND COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL QUANTITATIVE TESTS FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF JANUARY 1, 2013. ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS HAD FAIR VALUES SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES, THUS WE CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL BALANCES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

SEPARATELY-IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ARE ASSETS THAT REPRESENT FUTURE EXPECTED BENEFITS BUT LACK PHYSICAL SUBSTANCE (E.G., MEMBERSHIP LISTS, CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, TRADEMARKS AND TECHNOLOGY). OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES, WHILE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. BOTH FINITE-LIVED AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL PERIODS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT MAY INDICATE IMPAIRMENT. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLES, WHICH REPRESENT

77%

OF OUR TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSET BALANCE OF

$4.7 BILLION.

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CUSTOMER-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ARE TYPICALLY VALUED USING AN INCOME APPROACH BASED ON DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CUSTOMERS THAT EXIST AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUATION OF CUSTOMER-RELATED ASSETS INCLUDE: PROJECTED REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH, RETENTION RATE, PERPETUITY GROWTH RATE AND DISCOUNT RATE. THESE INITIAL VALUATIONS AND THE EMBEDDED ASSUMPTIONS CONTAIN UNCERTAINTY TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES MAY ULTIMATELY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS (E.G., CUSTOMER TURNOVER MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE ASSUMED RETENTION RATE SUGGESTED).

OUR FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN ASSET’S (OR ASSET GROUP’S) CARRYING VALUE MAY EXCEED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS INCLUDING: CHANGES IN THE USE OF THE ASSETS, CHANGES IN LEGAL OR OTHER BUSINESS FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT VALUE, EXPERIENCED OR EXPECTED OPERATING CASH-FLOW DETERIORATION OR LOSSES, ADVERSE CHANGES IN CUSTOMER POPULATIONS, ADVERSE COMPETITIVE OR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT COULD IMPACT VALUE, AND OTHER FACTORS. FOLLOWING THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS, WE WOULD CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET (OR ASSET GROUP) USING THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET OR RELATED GROUP OF ASSETS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WOULD BE RECORDED AS AN IMPAIRMENT.

OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS EXIST. TO DETERMINE IF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED, WE ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXISTENCE OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. IF, AFTER ASSESSING THE TOTALITY OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTS AND NO FURTHER TESTING IS PERFORMED. IF WE CONCLUDE OTHERWISE, WE WOULD PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS BY COMPARING ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE RECORDED FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE NOT IMPAIRED IN

2012.

INVESTMENTS

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WE HAD INVESTMENTS WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF

$21 BILLION

, PRIMARILY HELD IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. WE EXCLUDE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS FROM EARNINGS AND REPORT NET UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, OUR INVESTMENTS HAD GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS OF

$825 MILLION

AND GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES OF

$9 MILLION.

FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF WE INTEND TO EITHER SELL OR DETERMINE THAT WE WILL BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OR MATURITY OF THE SECURITY, WE RECOGNIZE THE ENTIRE IMPAIRMENT IN EARNINGS. IF WE DO NOT INTEND TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY AND WE DETERMINE THAT WE WILL NOT BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE IMPAIRMENT IS BIFURCATED INTO THE AMOUNT ATTRIBUTED TO THE CREDIT LOSS, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, AND ALL OTHER CAUSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, WE RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IF WE EXPECT TO HOLD THE EQUITY SECURITY UNTIL FAIR VALUE INCREASES TO AT LEAST THE EQUITY SECURITY’S COST BASIS AND WE EXPECT THAT INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE TO OCCUR IN A REASONABLY FORECASTED PERIOD. IF WE INTEND TO SELL THE EQUITY SECURITY OR IF WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE TO COST WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE NEAR TERM, WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPAIRMENT IN OUR INCOME STATEMENT.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES RELATED TO INVESTMENTS ARE RELATED TO DETERMINATION OF THEIR FAIR VALUES AND THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR VALUES.

FAIR VALUES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. WE OBTAIN ONE PRICE FOR EACH SECURITY PRIMARILY FROM A THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE), WHICH GENERALLY USES QUOTED OR OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE PRICING SERVICE NORMALLY DERIVES THE SECURITY PRICES THROUGH RECENTLY REPORTED TRADES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR SECURITIES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE REPORTING DATE BASED UPON AVAILABLE OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. FOR SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED, THE PRICING SERVICE MAY USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES, INCORPORATING INPUTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKETS FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES. INPUTS THAT ARE OFTEN USED IN THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, BENCHMARK YIELDS, CREDIT SPREADS, DEFAULT RATES AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, AND NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES. AS WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, WE PERFORM QUARTERLY ANALYSES ON THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PRICES ARE REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. SPECIFICALLY, WE COMPARE.

THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE TO PRICES REPORTED BY A SECONDARY PRICING SERVICE, ITS CUSTODIAN, ITS INVESTMENT CONSULTANT AND/OR THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT ADVISORS; AND

•

CHANGES IN THE REPORTED MARKET VALUES AND RETURNS TO RELEVANT MARKET INDICES AND OUR EXPECTATIONS TO TEST THE REASONABLENESS OF THE REPORTED PRICES.

BASED ON OUR INTERNAL PRICE VERIFICATION PROCEDURES AND OUR REVIEW OF THE FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICE, WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY ADJUSTED THE PRICES OBTAINED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT.

INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES WITH FAIR VALUES LOWER THAN COSTS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: OUR INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY OR THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST, THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT OF IMPAIRMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER. OTHER FACTORS INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT INCLUDE THE TYPE AND NATURE OF THE SECURITIES AND LIQUIDITY. GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES, HISTORICAL IMPAIRMENTS WERE LARGELY MARKET RELATED (E.G., INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ETC.) AS OPPOSED TO CREDIT RELATED. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT TREND TO CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM. OUR LARGE CASH HOLDINGS REDUCE THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL A SECURITY. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT TO SELL A SECURITY MAY CHANGE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.

WE BELIEVE WE WILL COLLECT THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DUE ON OUR DEBT SECURITIES WITH AN AMORTIZED COST IN EXCESS OF FAIR VALUE. THE UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $9 MILLION AND $32 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY, WERE PRIMARILY CAUSED BY MARKET INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND NOT BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT STANDING. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR MARKET SECTOR, AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES; STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES; MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF INVESTMENT-GRADE QUALITY. SECURITIES DOWNGRADED BELOW POLICY MINIMUMS AFTER PURCHASE WILL BE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INVESTMENT POLICY. TOTAL OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS DURING

2012

,

2011

AND

2010

WERE

$6 MILLION

,

$12 MILLION

AND

$23 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CASH EQUIVALENT AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAD A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DURATION OF 2.1 YEARS AND A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE CREDIT RATING OF “AA” AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. WE HAVE MINIMAL SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY SUB-PRIME OR ALT-A SECURITIES, AND A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS IN DEFAULT.

THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES RELATED TO FAIR VALUE AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT MAY ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE DUE TO MANY FACTORS INCLUDING: CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME, INDUSTRY SECTOR AND MARKET FACTORS MAY DIFFER FROM EXPECTATIONS AND ESTIMATES OR WE MAY ULTIMATELY SELL A SECURITY WE PREVIOUSLY INTENDED TO HOLD. OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER MAY ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE AS TIME PASSES AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE INCLUDING CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGING, OR AS UNKNOWN OR ESTIMATED UNLIKELY TRENDS DEVELOP.

AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN ITEM 7A “QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK” A 1% INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY $656 MILLION.

INCOME TAXES

OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS REFLECT OUR ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED FUTURE TAXES TO BE PAID ON ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS FOR TAX PURPOSES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) FOR WHICH IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT SOME PORTION, OR ALL, OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS RECOGNIZED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTIONS OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS. WE PREPARE AND FILE TAX RETURNS BASED ON OUR INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND RECORD ESTIMATES BASED ON THESE JUDGMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, OUR TAX RETURNS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES. SUCH

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXAMINATIONS MAY RESULT IN FUTURE TAX AND INTEREST ASSESSMENTS BY THESE TAXING AUTHORITIES. INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN ESTIMATES OF TAX POSITIONS DUE TO CHANGES IN TAX LAW RESULTING FROM LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND/OR AS CONCLUDED THROUGH THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS’ TAX COURT SYSTEMS.

THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR ULTIMATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN EACH YEAR. A HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE OR DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 1% ON OUR 2012 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET EARNINGS TO CHANGE BY $86 MILLION.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE ROUTINELY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS DISPUTES, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS WHERE APPROPRIATE. OUR ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL, IF APPROPRIATE, AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERING OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR SUCH MATTERS.

ESTIMATES OF COSTS RESULTING FROM LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING US ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE MATTERS: INVOLVE INDETERMINATE CLAIMS FOR MONETARY DAMAGES OR MAY INVOLVE FINES, PENALTIES OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OR REPRESENT A SHIFT IN REGULATORY POLICY; INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS OR REGULATORY BODIES; ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS; OR COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN BUSINESS PRACTICES. ACCORDINGLY, IN MANY CASES, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE LOSSES OR RANGES OF LOSSES FOR THOSE MATTERS WHERE THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OR IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED. SIMILARLY, THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF ASSERTION OF UNASSERTED CLAIMS INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

GIVEN THIS INHERENT UNCERTAINTY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS. WE EVALUATE OUR RELATED DISCLOSURES EACH REPORTING PERIOD. SEE NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8, “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS” FOR DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSSES OR RANGE OF LOSS COULD BE DETERMINED.

LEGAL MATTERS

A DESCRIPTION OF OUR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 12 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.”

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY SUBJECT US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE MANAGED UNDER AN INVESTMENT POLICY AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS POLICY LIMITS THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE INVESTED IN ANY ONE ISSUER AND GENERALLY LIMITS OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE LIMITED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYER GROUPS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT CONSTITUTE OUR CLIENT BASE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE

$1.9 BILLION

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF OUR GOLDEN RULE FINANCIAL CORPORATION LIFE AND ANNUITY BUSINESS IN 2005. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORD THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AMOUNTS ARE DEEMED PROBABLE OF RECOVERY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE REINSURER WAS RATED BY A.M. BEST AS “A+.” AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

OUR PRIMARY MARKET RISKS ARE EXPOSURES TO (A) CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND DEBT, (B) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK OF THE U.S. DOLLAR PRIMARILY TO THE BRAZILIAN REAL AND (C) CHANGES IN EQUITY PRICES THAT IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WE HAD

$9.4 BILLION

OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS ON WHICH THE INTEREST RATES RECEIVED VARY WITH MARKET INTEREST RATES, WHICH MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT INCOME. ALSO,

$6.7 BILLION

OF OUR DEBT AND DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

WERE AT INTEREST RATES THAT VARY WITH MARKET RATES, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE USE OF RELATED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND DEBT ALSO VARIES WITH MARKET INTEREST RATES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

$19.1 BILLION

OF OUR INVESTMENTS WERE FIXED-RATE DEBT SECURITIES AND $13.6 BILLION OF OUR DEBT WAS NON-SWAPPED FIXED-RATE TERM DEBT. AN INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES DECREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-RATE DEBT. CONVERSELY, A DECREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES INCREASES THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED-RATE INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-RATE DEBT.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MANAGE EXPOSURE TO MARKET INTEREST RATES BY DIVERSIFYING INVESTMENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT FIXED INCOME MARKET SECTORS AND DEBT ACROSS MATURITIES, AS WELL AS ENDEAVORING TO MATCH OUR FLOATING-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OVER TIME, EITHER DIRECTLY OR PERIODICALLY THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE THE IMPACT OF HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE ENTIRE YIELD CURVE BY 1% OR 2% AS OF

(A)

GIVEN THE LOW ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF SHORT-TERM MARKET RATES ON OUR FLOATING-RATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE ASSUMED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES DOES NOT REFLECT THE FULL 100 BASIS POINT REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCOME OR INTEREST EXPENSE AS THE RATE CANNOT FALL BELOW ZERO AND THUS THE 200 BASIS POINT REDUCTION IS NOT MEANINGFUL.

(B)

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAD INTEREST RATES BELOW 2% SO THE ASSUMED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS DOES NOT REFLECT THE FULL 200 BASIS POINT REDUCTION.

WITH THE AMIL ACQUISITION, WE HAVE AN EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE BRAZILIAN REAL TO THE U.S. DOLLAR IN TRANSLATION OF AMIL’S OPERATING RESULTS AT THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE OVER THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD, AND AMIL’S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE SPOT RATE AT THE END OF THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD. THE GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

AN APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE BRAZILIAN REAL REDUCES THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS DENOMINATED IN BRAZILIAN REAL. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 A HYPOTHETICAL 10% INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE BRAZILIAN REAL WOULD CAUSE A REDUCTION IN NET ASSETS OF $510 MILLION. WE MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK BY CONDUCTING OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS PRIMARILY IN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. WE FUNDED CERTAIN CASH NEEDS OF AMIL THROUGH INTERCOMPANY NOTES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE HAD CURRENCY SWAPS WITH A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $256 MILLION HEDGING THE U.S. DOLLAR TO THE BRAZILIAN REAL TO PROVIDE A CASH FLOW HEDGE ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE INTERCOMPANY NOTES TO AMIL.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, WE HAD

$677 MILLION

OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN RELATED INVESTMENTS OF

$348 MILLION

AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS, A PORTION OF WHICH WERE INVESTED IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE OR TECHNOLOGY STOCKS WILL IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE “COMPANY”) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND 2011, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION AND OUR REPORT DATED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEE NOTE 13 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND HOW THE SEGMENTS GENERATE THEIR REVENUES.

2.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, USE OF ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE COMPANY HAS PREPARED THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDING TO UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S.) GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND HAS INCLUDED THE ACCOUNTS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY HAS ELIMINATED INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS BASED ON THE COMPANY’S BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANY’S MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, PREMIUM REBATES AND RISK-ADJUSTED AND RISK-SHARING PROVISIONS RELATED TO REVENUES,

VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ESTIMATES OF OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES AND OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES, VALUATIONS OF INVESTMENTS, AND ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS RELATED TO INCOME TAXES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND WILL LIKELY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS ADJUSTED.

REVENUES

PREMIUM REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS TYPICALLY AT A FIXED RATE PER INDIVIDUAL SERVED FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, AND THE COMPANY ASSUMES THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING ITS CUSTOMERS’ HEALTH CARE AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

PREMIUM REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS. HEALTH CARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM ITS CUSTOMERS IN ADVANCE OF THE SERVICE PERIOD ARE RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUES. EFFECTIVE IN 2011, U.S. COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS WITH MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS ON FULLY INSURED PRODUCTS, AS CALCULATED UNDER THE DEFINITIONS IN THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND A RECONCILIATION MEASURE, THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 (TOGETHER, HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION) AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS, THAT FALL BELOW CERTAIN TARGETS ARE REQUIRED TO REBATE RATABLE PORTIONS OF THEIR PREMIUMS ANNUALLY. PREMIUM REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED PREMIUMS EARNED NET OF PROJECTED REBATES BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE PREMIUMS OF THESE CONTRACTS. EACH PERIOD, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES PREMIUM REBATES BASED ON THE EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTS WITHIN EACH DEFINED AGGREGATION SET (E.G., BY STATE, GROUP SIZE AND LICENSED SUBSIDIARY). THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN ESTIMATING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ARE CURRENT AND FUTURE PREMIUMS AND MEDICAL CLAIM EXPERIENCE, EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND EXPECTED CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX. THE ESTIMATED ULTIMATE PREMIUM IS REVISED EACH PERIOD TO REFLECT CURRENT AND PROJECTED EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS PREMIUM REVENUES FROM CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS AT ITS OPTUMHEALTH BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANY’S MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND PART D PREMIUM REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC ADJUSTMENT UNDER THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES’ (CMS) RISK ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT METHODOLOGY. CMS DEPLOYS A RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL THAT APPORTIONS PREMIUMS PAID TO ALL HEALTH PLANS ACCORDING TO HEALTH SEVERITY AND CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. THE CMS RISK ADJUSTMENT MODEL PROVIDES HIGHER PER MEMBER PAYMENTS FOR ENROLLEES DIAGNOSED WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND LOWER PAYMENTS FOR ENROLLEES WHO ARE HEALTHIER. UNDER THIS RISK ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY, CMS CALCULATES THE RISK ADJUSTED PREMIUM PAYMENT USING DIAGNOSIS DATA FROM HOSPITAL INPATIENT, HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT AND PHYSICIAN TREATMENT SETTINGS. THE COMPANY AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COLLECT, CAPTURE, AND SUBMIT THE NECESSARY AND AVAILABLE DIAGNOSIS DATA TO CMS WITHIN PRESCRIBED DEADLINES. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES RISK ADJUSTMENT REVENUES BASED UPON THE DIAGNOSIS DATA SUBMITTED AND EXPECTED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CMS.

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S PLANS IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING AUDIT BY REGULATORS. SEE NOTE 12 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE AUDITS.

SERVICE REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FEES DERIVED FROM SERVICES PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE HEALTH CARE COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES’ DEPENDANTS. UNDER SERVICE FEE CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. THE CUSTOMERS RETAIN THE RISK OF FINANCING HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES’ DEPENDANTS, AND THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMER FUNDS TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS FROM CUSTOMER-FUNDED BANK ACCOUNTS. AS THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER THE OBLIGATION FOR FUNDING THE HEALTH CARE COSTS, NOR THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING THE MEDICAL CARE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUE AND MEDICAL COSTS FOR THESE CONTRACTS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR BOTH RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES; TRANSACTION PROCESSING; CUSTOMER, CONSUMER AND CARE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; AND ACCESS TO CONTRACTED NETWORKS OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. THESE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED THROUGHOUT THE CONTRACT PERIOD.

FOR THE COMPANY’S OPTUMRX PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT (PBM) BUSINESS, REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH A CONTRACTED NETWORK OF RETAIL PHARMACIES OR MAIL SERVICES, AND FROM ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING CLAIMS PROCESSING AND FORMULARY DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT. PRODUCT REVENUES INCLUDE INGREDIENT COSTS (NET OF REBATES), A NEGOTIATED DISPENSING FEE AND CUSTOMER CO-PAYMENTS FOR DRUGS DISPENSED THROUGH THE COMPANY’S MAIL-SERVICE PHARMACY. IN RETAIL PHARMACY TRANSACTIONS, REVENUES RECOGNIZED EXCLUDE THE MEMBER’S APPLICABLE CO-PAYMENT. PRODUCT REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE DISPENSED THROUGH THE RETAIL NETWORK OR RECEIVED BY CONSUMERS THROUGH THE COMPANY’S MAIL-SERVICE PHARMACY. SERVICE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRESCRIPTION CLAIM IS ADJUDICATED. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO RETAIL SERVICE CONTRACTS IN WHICH IT IS PRIMARILY OBLIGATED TO PAY ITS NETWORK PHARMACY PROVIDERS FOR BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS REGARDLESS IF THE COMPANY IS PAID. THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING THE PRICES CHARGED BY RETAIL PHARMACIES, DETERMINING WHICH DRUGS WILL BE INCLUDED IN FORMULARY LISTINGS AND SELECTING WHICH RETAIL PHARMACIES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE NETWORK OFFERED TO PLAN SPONSORS’ MEMBERS. AS A RESULT, REVENUES ARE REPORTED ON A GROSS BASIS.

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF THE COMPANY’S OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS, BUT FOR WHICH CLAIMS HAVE EITHER NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED OR PROCESSED, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM PROCESSING BACKLOGS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE UTILIZATION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH PERIOD, THE COMPANY RE-EXAMINES PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS DEVELOP, THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES AND INCLUDES THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. MEDICAL COSTS ALSO INCLUDE THE DIRECT COST OF PATIENT CARE RENDERED THROUGH OPTUMHEALTH.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES THEIR CARRYING VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT MATURITY OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAD CHECKS OUTSTANDING OF

$1.3 BILLION

AND

$1.5 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED AS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE CHANGE IN THIS BALANCE HAS BEEN REFLECTED AS CHECKS OUTSTANDING WITHIN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE OUTSTANDING CHECKS ARE ALL RELATED TO ZERO BALANCE ACCOUNTS; THE COMPANY DOES NOT NET CHECKS OUTSTANDING WITH DEPOSITS IN OTHER ACCOUNTS.

INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. BECAUSE OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MATURITY DATE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THESE INVESTMENTS AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTS THEM AT AMORTIZED COST. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE.

THE COMPANY EXCLUDES UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES FROM EARNINGS AND REPORTS THEM AS COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY. TO CALCULATE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES THE COST OF EACH INVESTMENT SOLD.

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY EVALUATES AN INVESTMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT BY CONSIDERING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST OR AMORTIZED COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER AND THE COMPANY’S INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY OR THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST.

•

FOR DEBT SECURITIES, IF THE COMPANY INTENDS TO EITHER SELL OR DETERMINES THAT IT WILL BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL A SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OR MATURITY OF THE SECURITY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE ENTIRE IMPAIRMENT IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME. IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY AND IT DETERMINES THAT IT WILL NOT BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BUT IT DOES NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS, THE IMPAIRMENT IS BIFURCATED INTO THE AMOUNT ATTRIBUTED TO THE CREDIT LOSS, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, AND ALL OTHER CAUSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

•

FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES IMPAIRMENTS IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IF IT EXPECTS TO HOLD THE SECURITY UNTIL FAIR VALUE INCREASES TO AT LEAST THE SECURITY’S COST BASIS AND IT EXPECTS THAT INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE TO OCCUR IN A REASONABLY FORECASTED PERIOD. IF THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SELL THE EQUITY SECURITY OR IF IT BELIEVES THAT RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE TO COST WILL NOT OCCUR IN A REASONABLY FORECASTED PERIOD, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE IMPAIRMENT IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME.

NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE THESE JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT ITS EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR MARKET SECTOR, AND LARGELY LIMITS ITS INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES; STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES; MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES; AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH ARE INVESTMENT GRADE QUALITY. SECURITIES DOWNGRADED BELOW POLICY MINIMUMS AFTER PURCHASE WILL BE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTMENT POLICY.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY PROVIDES HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF AARP UNDER A SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (THE AARP PROGRAM), AND TO AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS UNDER SEPARATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND MEDICARE PART D ARRANGEMENTS. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER THE AARP PROGRAM INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL MEDICARE BENEFITS (AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE), HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE, INCLUDING INSURANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN 50 TO 64 YEARS OF AGE, AND OTHER RELATED PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY’S ARRANGEMENTS WITH AARP EXTEND TO DECEMBER 31, 2017 FOR THE AARP PROGRAM AND GIVE THE COMPANY AN EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE THE AARP BRAND ON THE COMPANY’S MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND MEDICARE PART D OFFERINGS UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2014, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCLUSIONS.

PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY’S AGREEMENT, AARP PROGRAM ASSETS ARE MANAGED SEPARATELY FROM ITS GENERAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT THE COMPANY’S DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED BY AARP. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND, UPON TRANSFER OF THE AARP PROGRAM CONTRACT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSFER CASH EQUAL IN AMOUNT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER TO THAT ENTITY. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THESE ASSETS IS TO FUND THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, THE RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF) LIABILITIES AND OTHER RELATED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AARP CONTRACT, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS, CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE LIABILITIES. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF. ACCORDINGLY, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S EARNINGS. INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO THE RSF AND WERE

$109 MILLION

,

$99 MILLION

AND

$107 MILLION

IN

2012

,

2011

AND

2010

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM ALSO ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF BALANCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF SUCH CHANGES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE RSF, SEE “OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES” BELOW.

OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES

OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES INCLUDE AMOUNTS DUE FROM PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS FOR REBATES AND MEDICARE PART D DRUG DISCOUNTS, REINSURANCE AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS AMOUNTS DUE TO THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY’S PBM BUSINESSES CONTRACT WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, SOME OF WHOM PROVIDE REBATES BASED ON USE OF THE MANUFACTURERS’ PRODUCTS BY ITS PBM BUSINESSES’ AFFILIATED AND NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES REBATES AS THEY ARE EARNED BY ITS CLIENTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTS, HISTORICAL DATA AND CURRENT ESTIMATES. THE PBM BUSINESSES BILL THESE REBATES TO THE MANUFACTURERS ON A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS DEPENDING ON THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE PBM BUSINESSES RECORD REBATES ATTRIBUTABLE TO AFFILIATED CLIENTS AS A REDUCTION TO MEDICAL COSTS. REBATES ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AFFILIATED CLIENTS ARE ACCRUED AS REBATES RECEIVABLE AND A REDUCTION OF COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD WITH A CORRESPONDING PAYABLE FOR THE AMOUNTS OF THE REBATES TO BE REMITTED TO NON-AFFILIATED CLIENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR CONTRACTS AND RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS A REDUCTION OF PRODUCT REVENUE. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECEIVES REBATES FROM TWO TO FIVE MONTHS AFTER BILLING.

FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPANY’S MEDICARE PART D RECEIVABLES SEE “MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS” BELOW.

FOR DETAILS ON THE COMPANY’S REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE SEE “FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE” BELOW.

MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS

THE COMPANY SERVES AS A PLAN SPONSOR OFFERING MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDER CONTRACTS WITH CMS. UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, THERE ARE SEVEN SEPARATE ELEMENTS OF PAYMENT RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PLAN YEAR. THESE PAYMENT ELEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

•

CMS PREMIUM.

CMS PAYS A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM PER MEMBER TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.

•

MEMBER PREMIUM.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN MEMBERS PAY A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.

•

LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY.

FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS SOME OR ALL OF THE MEMBER’S MONTHLY PREMIUMS TO THE COMPANY ON THE MEMBER’S BEHALF.

•

CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY

. CMS PAYS THE COMPANY A COST REIMBURSEMENT ESTIMATE MONTHLY TO FUND THE CMS OBLIGATION TO PAY APPROXIMATELY

80%

OF THE COSTS INCURRED BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS IN EXCESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM. A SETTLEMENT IS MADE WITH CMS BASED ON ACTUAL COST EXPERIENCE, AFTER THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.

•

LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY.

FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS ON THE MEMBER’S BEHALF SOME OR ALL OF A MEMBER’S COST SHARING AMOUNTS, SUCH AS DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE. THE COST SHARING SUBSIDY IS FUNDED BY CMS THROUGH MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS AND PAYS THE SUBSIDIZED PORTION OF THE CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CMS, AND A SETTLEMENT PAYMENT IS MADE BETWEEN CMS AND THE COMPANY BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS AND PREMIUM EXPERIENCE, AFTER THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.

•

CMS RISK-SHARE.

PREMIUMS FROM CMS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK CORRIDOR PROVISIONS THAT COMPARE COSTS TARGETED IN THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL BIDS BY PRODUCT AND REGION TO ACTUAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, LIMITED TO ACTUAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED UNDER THE STANDARD COVERAGE AS DEFINED BY CMS. VARIANCES OF MORE THAN

5%

ABOVE OR BELOW THE ORIGINAL BID SUBMITTED BY THE COMPANY MAY RESULT IN CMS MAKING ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY OR REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REFUND TO CMS A PORTION OF THE PREMIUMS IT RECEIVED. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES AND RECOGNIZES AN ADJUSTMENT TO PREMIUM REVENUES RELATED TO THE RISK CORRIDOR PAYMENT SETTLEMENT BASED UPON PHARMACY CLAIMS EXPERIENCE TO DATE. THE ESTIMATE OF THE SETTLEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISK CORRIDOR PROVISIONS REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO CONSIDER FACTORS THAT MAY NOT BE CERTAIN, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF ELIGIBLE PHARMACY COSTS AND MEMBER ELIGIBILITY STATUS DIFFERENCES WITH CMS. THE COMPANY RECORDS RISK-SHARE ADJUSTMENTS TO PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES OR OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

•

DRUG DISCOUNT.

BEGINNING IN 2011, HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION MANDATED A CONSUMER DISCOUNT OF

50%

ON BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR PART D PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE COVERAGE GAP. THIS DISCOUNT IS FUNDED BY CMS AND PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS WHILE THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS THE APPLICATION OF THESE FUNDS. AMOUNTS RECEIVED ARE NOT REFLECTED AS PREMIUM REVENUES, BUT RATHER ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN AMOUNTS ARE RECEIVED FROM CMS AND A RECEIVABLE WHEN THE COMPANY BILLS THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. RELATED CASH FLOWS ARE PRESENTED AS CUSTOMER FUNDS ADMINISTERED WITHIN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

THE CMS PREMIUM, THE MEMBER PREMIUM, AND THE LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY REPRESENT PAYMENTS FOR THE COMPANY’S INSURANCE RISK COVERAGE UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM AND, THEREFORE, ARE RECORDED AS PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. PREMIUM REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS. THE COMPANY RECORDS PREMIUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE APPLICABLE SERVICE PERIOD IN UNEARNED REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY AND THE LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY (SUBSIDIES) REPRESENT COST REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM. AMOUNTS RECEIVED FOR THESE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT REFLECTED AS PREMIUM REVENUES, BUT RATHER ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS RECEIVABLES AND/OR DEPOSITS. RELATED CASH FLOWS ARE PRESENTED AS CUSTOMER FUNDS ADMINISTERED WITHIN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS UNDER THE CONTRACT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN MEDICAL COSTS AND OPERATING COSTS, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN 2012.

THE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE BEGINS AT

IN 2012.

THE ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM INCREASED TO

$4,750

FROM

$4,700

IN 2012.

THE DISCOUNTS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WITHIN THE COVERAGE GAP INCREASED TO 52.5% FROM 50% IN 2012 FOR BRAND NAME DRUGS AND TO 21% FROM 14% IN 2012 FOR GENERIC DRUGS.

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE STATED AT COST, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE CONSISTS OF CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND APPLICABLE PAYROLL COSTS OF EMPLOYEES DEVOTED TO SPECIFIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE FOR EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IT MIGHT NOT RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED.

THE COMPANY CALCULATES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE USEFUL LIVES FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE.

FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT

3 TO 7 YEARS

BUILDINGS

35 TO 40 YEARS

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

7 YEARS OR LENGTH OF LEASE TERM, WHICHEVER IS SHORTER

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

3 TO 5 YEARS

GOODWILL

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED TO THE UNDERLYING IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT IS SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. TESTS ARE PERFORMED MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.

TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED, THE COMPANY PERFORMS A MULTI-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. FIRST, THE COMPANY CAN ELECT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO DETERMINE WHETHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SUPPORT A DETERMINATION THAT THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE GREATER THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IF THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS NOT CONCLUSIVE, OR IF THE COMPANY ELECTS TO PROCEED DIRECTLY WITH QUANTITATIVE TESTING, IT WILL THEN MEASURE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS AND COMPARE THEM TO THEIR AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN THE IMPLIED VALUE OF GOODWILL WOULD BE CALCULATED AND COMPARED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUES OF ITS REPORTING UNITS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS INCLUDE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF FREE CASH FLOW (INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND INCOME TAXES), LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES FOR DETERMINING TERMINAL VALUE, AND DISCOUNT RATES. COMPARATIVE MARKET MULTIPLES ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE RESULTS OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TEST.

THE COMPANY ELECTED TO BYPASS THE OPTIONAL QUALITATIVE REPORTING-UNIT FAIR VALUE ASSESSMENT AND COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF JANUARY 1, 2013. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, NO REPORTING UNIT HAD A FAIR VALUE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE AND THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT OF ITS GOODWILL BALANCES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

SEPARATELY-IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ARE ASSETS THAT REPRESENT FUTURE EXPECTED BENEFITS BUT LACK PHYSICAL SUBSTANCE (E.G., MEMBERSHIP LISTS, CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, TRADEMARKS AND TECHNOLOGY). THE COMPANY’S INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES. FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES.

THE COMPANY’S INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN INTANGIBLE ASSET’S (OR ASSET GROUP’S) MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY’S INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ALSO TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012.

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES INCLUDE THE RSF ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM (DESCRIBED BELOW), HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT DEPOSITS, DEPOSITS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM (SEE “MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS” ABOVE), ACCRUALS FOR PREMIUM REBATE PAYMENTS UNDER THE HEALTH REFORM LEGISLATION, THE CURRENT PORTION OF FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND CUSTOMER BALANCES. CUSTOMER BALANCES REPRESENT EXCESS CUSTOMER PAYMENTS AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS UNDER EXPERIENCE-RATED CONTRACTS. AT THE CUSTOMER’S OPTION, THESE BALANCES MAY BE REFUNDED OR USED TO PAY FUTURE PREMIUMS OR CLAIMS UNDER ELIGIBLE CONTRACTS.

UNDERWRITING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE AARP PROGRAM ARE DIRECTLY RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF AND ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS, UNLESS CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES WERE TO EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE PREMIUM REVENUE, MEDICAL COSTS, INVESTMENT INCOME, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, MEMBER SERVICE EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. TO THE EXTENT UNDERWRITING LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, LOSSES WOULD BE BORNE BY THE COMPANY. DEFICITS MAY BE RECOVERED BY UNDERWRITING GAINS IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FUND ANY UNDERWRITING DEFICITS. CHANGES IN THE RSF ARE REPORTED IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

AND

2011

, THE BALANCE IN THE RSF WAS

$1.3 BILLION.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND LAWS. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT GENERALLY REFLECTS THE NET CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING THE YEAR, EXCLUDING ANY DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION REFLECTS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES CURRENTLY TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE ON VARIOUS INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEAR REPORTED.

FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE

FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS REPRESENT ACCOUNT BALANCES THAT ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS, EXCLUDING SURRENDER CHARGES, FOR UNIVERSAL LIFE AND INVESTMENT ANNUITY PRODUCTS AND FOR LONG-DURATION HEALTH POLICIES SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS FOR WHICH SOME OF THE PREMIUM RECEIVED IN THE EARLIER YEARS IS INTENDED TO PAY BENEFITS TO BE INCURRED IN FUTURE YEARS. AS A RESULT OF THE 2005 SALE OF THE LIFE AND ANNUITY BUSINESS WITHIN THE COMPANY’S GOLDEN RULE FINANCIAL CORPORATION SUBSIDIARY UNDER AN INDEMNITY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED A LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REINSURED CONTRACTS, AS IT REMAINS PRIMARILY LIABLE TO THE POLICYHOLDERS, AND HAS RECORDED A CORRESPONDING REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE PURCHASER. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE

$1.9 BILLION

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE, OF WHICH

$135 MILLION

WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND

$1.8 BILLION

WAS RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011

, THE COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE

$1.9 BILLION

REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE, OF WHICH

$125 MILLION

WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES AND

$1.8 BILLION

WAS RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORDS THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT OF PROBABLE RECOVERY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE REINSURER WAS RATED BY A.M. BEST AS “A+.”

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN OPERATIONS DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES AS OF THE END OF EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD. RELATED REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES DURING THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD. THE GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE COMPANY’S SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE REDEMPTION IS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY ARE CLASSIFIED AS TEMPORARY EQUITY. THE REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO HOLDERS OF AMIL PARTICIPAÇÕES S.A. (AMIL) SHARES. AMIL WAS ACQUIRED IN 2012, SEE NOTE 6 FOR MORE INFORMATION. DURING 2012, THE COMPANY PURCHASED NONCONTROLLING INTEREST SHARES FOR

$319 MILLION

, OF WHICH

$11 MILLION

WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. FOR THE YEAR

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY’S NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS WAS NIL AND OTHER NONCONTROLLING INTEREST ACTIVITY WAS NOT MATERIAL.

POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

THE COMPANY’S SHORT DURATION HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY HAVE A ONE-YEAR TERM AND MAY BE CANCELED BY THE CUSTOMER WITH AT LEAST 30 DAYS NOTICE. COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND RENEWAL OF SHORT DURATION CUSTOMER CONTRACTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) AND RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (COLLECTIVELY, RESTRICTED SHARES), ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD (GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD) OF THE AWARD, OR TO AN EMPLOYEE’S ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT DATE UNDER THE AWARD AGREEMENT, IF EARLIER. RESTRICTED SHARES VEST RATABLY, PRIMARILY OVER

THREE

TO

FOUR

YEARS AND COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED SHARES IS BASED ON THE SHARE PRICE ON DATE OF GRANT. STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS VEST RATABLY OVER

FOUR

TO

SIX

YEARS AND MAY BE EXERCISED UP TO

10

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS IS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE AT DATE OF GRANT, WHICH IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING A BINOMIAL OPTION-PRICING MODEL. UNDER THE COMPANY’S EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (ESPP) ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY’S STOCK AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE, WHICH IS

85%

OF THE LOWER MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK AT THE BEGINNING OR AT THE END OF THE SIX-MONTH PURCHASE PERIOD. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED IN OPERATING COSTS IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

THE COMPANY COMPUTES BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. THE COMPANY DETERMINES DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD, ADJUSTED FOR POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTIONS, SARS, RESTRICTED SHARES AND THE ESPP, USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD ASSUMES A HYPOTHETICAL ISSUANCE OF SHARES TO SETTLE THE SHARE-BASED AWARDS, WITH THE ASSUMED PROCEEDS USED TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK AT THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE FOR THE PERIOD. ASSUMED PROCEEDS INCLUDE THE AMOUNT THE EMPLOYEE MUST PAY UPON EXERCISE, ANY UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST AND ANY RELATED EXCESS TAX BENEFIT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF SHARES ASSUMED ISSUED AND NUMBER OF SHARES ASSUMED PURCHASED REPRESENTS THE DILUTIVE SHARES.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN MAY 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) NO. 2011-04, “FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): AMENDMENTS TO ACHIEVE COMMON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN U.S. GAAP AND IFRSS”

(ASU 2011-04). THIS UPDATE PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT SHOULD BE APPLIED WHERE EXISTING GAAP ALREADY REQUIRES OR PERMITS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IN ADDITION, ASU 2011-04 REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES REGARDING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ASU 2011-04 BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY’S FISCAL YEAR 2012. THE ADOPTION OF THE MEASUREMENT GUIDANCE OF ASU 2011-04 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE NEW DISCLOSURES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE COMPANY’S FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 4.

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2011-05,

“COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220) - PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME” (ASU 2011-05). ASU 2011-05 REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT THE TOTAL OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, THE COMPONENTS OF NET INCOME, AND THE COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME EITHER IN A SINGLE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS AND ELIMINATES THE OPTION TO PRESENT THE COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS A PART OF THE STATEMENT OF EQUITY. ASU 2011-05 BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY’S FISCAL YEAR 2012. THE COMPANY PRESENTED SEPARATE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH APPEAR CONSECUTIVE TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER RECENTLY ADOPTED OR ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT HAD OR WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE UNREALIZED LOSSES FROM ALL SECURITIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

WERE GENERATED FROM APPROXIMATELY

1,300

POSITIONS OUT OF A TOTAL OF

18,000

POSITIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL COLLECT THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DUE ON ITS INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE AN AMORTIZED COST IN EXCESS OF FAIR VALUE. THE UNREALIZED LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND NOT BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SECURITIES. AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANY EVALUATES SECURITIES FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN ITS AMORTIZED COST. THE COMPANY EVALUATED THE UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY AND CREDIT RATINGS OF THE ISSUERS, NOTING NEITHER A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION SINCE PURCHASE NOR OTHER FACTORS LEADING TO AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI). AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL ANY OF THE SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION.

A PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS CONSISTS OF INVESTMENTS HELD IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NONPUBLIC COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY STOCKS WILL LIKEWISE IMPACT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S EQUITY PORTFOLIO. THE EQUITY SECURITIES AND VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS WERE EVALUATED FOR SEVERITY AND DURATION OF UNREALIZED LOSS, OVERALL MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

FAIR VALUE

CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR HAVE FAIR VALUES DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED INTO ONE OF THREE LEVELS OF A HIERARCHY DEFINED BY GAAP. IN INSTANCES IN WHICH THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE FALL INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS CATEGORIZED IN ITS ENTIRETY BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR ITEM TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE CONSIDERATION OF INPUTS SPECIFIC TO THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1

— QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS/LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 2

— OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, INCLUDING.

•

QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS/LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS;

•

QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS/LIABILITIES IN NON-ACTIVE MARKETS (E.G., FEW TRANSACTIONS, LIMITED INFORMATION, NON-CURRENT PRICES, HIGH VARIABILITY OVER TIME);

•

INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET/LIABILITY (E.G., INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES, IMPLIED VOLATILITIES, CREDIT SPREADS); AND

•

INPUTS THAT ARE CORROBORATED BY OTHER OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

LEVEL 3

— UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS, IF ANY, ARE RECORDED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE TRANSFER OCCURS; THERE WERE

NO

TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1, 2 OR 3 OF ANY FINANCIAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DURING

2012

OR

2011.

NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS WHEN THE COMPANY RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED DURING THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2012

,

2011

, AND

2010.

THE FOLLOWING METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE AND DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY CLASSIFICATION OF EACH CLASS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT INCLUDED IN THE TABLES BELOW.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AS MATURITIES ARE LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. FAIR VALUES OF CASH EQUIVALENT INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT TRADE ON A REGULAR BASIS IN ACTIVE MARKETS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

FAIR VALUES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE. THE COMPANY OBTAINS ONE PRICE FOR EACH SECURITY PRIMARILY FROM A THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICE (PRICING SERVICE), WHICH GENERALLY USES QUOTED OR OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE. THE PRICING SERVICE NORMALLY DERIVES THE SECURITY PRICES THROUGH RECENTLY REPORTED TRADES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR SECURITIES, AND, IF NECESSARY, MAKES ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE REPORTING DATE BASED UPON AVAILABLE OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION. FOR SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED, THE PRICING SERVICE MAY USE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES, INCORPORATING INPUTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKETS FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES. INPUTS THAT ARE OFTEN USED IN THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, BENCHMARK YIELDS, CREDIT SPREADS, DEFAULT RATES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES. AS THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE, IT PERFORMS QUARTERLY ANALYSES ON THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PRICES ARE REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE. SPECIFICALLY, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE PRICES RECEIVED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE TO A SECONDARY PRICING SOURCE, PRICES REPORTED BY ITS CUSTODIAN, ITS INVESTMENT CONSULTANT AND THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT ADVISORS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY COMPARES CHANGES IN THE REPORTED MARKET VALUES AND RETURNS TO RELEVANT MARKET INDICES TO TEST THE REASONABLENESS OF THE REPORTED PRICES. THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL PRICE VERIFICATION PROCEDURES AND REVIEWS OF FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN ADJUSTMENT IN THE PRICES OBTAINED FROM THE PRICING SERVICE.

FAIR VALUES OF DEBT SECURITIES THAT DO NOT TRADE ON A REGULAR BASIS IN ACTIVE MARKETS BUT ARE PRICED USING OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES FOR LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 EQUITY SECURITIES ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR ACTIVELY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES AND/OR OTHER MARKET DATA FOR THE SAME OR COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS IN ESTABLISHING THE PRICES.

THE COMPANY’S LEVEL 3 EQUITY SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY INVESTMENTS IN VENTURE CAPITAL SECURITIES. THE FAIR VALUES OF LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS IN VENTURE CAPITAL PORTFOLIOS ARE ESTIMATED USING A MARKET VALUATION TECHNIQUE THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS AND QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, THE FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANY’S VARIOUS VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE COMPUTED USING LIMITED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS OF ACTIVITY FOR SIMILAR COMPANIES IN THE CURRENT MARKET. THE COMPANY’S MARKET MODELING UTILIZES, AS APPLICABLE, TRANSACTIONS FOR COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN SIMILAR INDUSTRIES AND HAVING SIMILAR REVENUE AND GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS; AND SIMILAR PREFERENCES IN THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE. KEY SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN THE MARKET TECHNIQUE INCLUDE IMPLIED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA) MULTIPLES AND REVENUE MULTIPLES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S VENTURE CAPITAL SECURITIES ARE BASED OFF OF RECENT TRANSACTIONS IN INACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR SECURITIES. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE INPUTS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER OR HIGHER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

THROUGHOUT THE PROCEDURES DISCUSSED ABOVE IN RELATION TO THE COMPANY’S PROCESSES FOR VALIDATING THIRD PARTY PRICING INFORMATION, THE COMPANY VALIDATES THE UNDERSTANDING OF ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS USED IN SECURITY PRICING AND DETERMINES THE PROPER CLASSIFICATION IN THE HIERARCHY BASED ON THAT UNDERSTANDING.

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AARP PROGRAM-RELATED INVESTMENTS.

AARP PROGRAM-RELATED INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES HELD TO FUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM AND ARE PRICED AND CLASSIFIED USING THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE COMPANY’S DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS.

FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANY’S SWAPS ARE ESTIMATED USING THE TERMS OF THE SWAPS AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION INCLUDING MARKET YIELD CURVES. BECAUSE THE SWAPS ARE UNIQUE AND NOT ACTIVELY TRADED BUT ARE VALUED USING OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS, THE FAIR VALUES ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

LONG-TERM DEBT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM DEBT IS ESTIMATED AND CLASSIFIED USING THE SAME METHODOLOGIES AS THE COMPANY’S INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES.

AARP PROGRAM-RELATED OTHER LIABILITIES.

AARP PROGRAM-RELATED OTHER LIABILITIES CONSIST OF LIABILITIES THAT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF NET INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO AARP PROGRAM-RELATED INVESTMENTS THAT ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BY LEVEL AND CARRYING VALUES FOR ITEMS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS EXCLUDING AARP RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED IN A SEPARATE TABLE BELOW.

$31,286

IN OCTOBER 2012, THE COMPANY PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF AMIL FOR APPROXIMATELY

$3.2 BILLION

IN A PRIVATE TRANSACTION. LATER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL

17.8 MILLION

SHARES OF AMIL FOR

$0.3 BILLION

, BRINGING THE STAKE IN AMIL ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY TO APPROXIMATELY 65% OF AMIL’S OUTSTANDING SHARES. AMIL IS A HEALTH CARE COMPANY LOCATED IN BRAZIL, PROVIDING HEALTH AND DENTAL BENEFITS, HOSPITAL AND CLINICAL SERVICES, AND ADVANCED CARE MANAGEMENT RESOURCES TO MORE THAN

5 MILLION

PEOPLE. THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID AND FAIR VALUE OF THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED BY

$5.9 BILLION

, OF WHICH

$1.0 BILLION

HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

$0.6 BILLION

TO INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND

$4.3 BILLION

TO GOODWILL. TO ESTIMATE THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF

$2.2 BILLION

, THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE PUBLIC SHARE PRICE AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WERE MEASURED BASED ON THE PROBABLE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AMIL HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND THE RESULTS OF THE UNITEDHEALTHCARE REPORTABLE SEGMENT SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE PRO-FORMA EFFECTS OF THIS ACQUISITION ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 2012 PURCHASES, THE COMPANY GENERATED BRAZILIAN TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.7 BILLION.

BECAUSE OF THE ACQUISITION OF A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN AMIL, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED BY BRAZILIAN LAW TO COMMENCE A MANDATORY TENDER OFFER FOR THE REMAINING PUBLICLY TRADED SHARES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 25% OWNERSHIP INTEREST DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013 THROUGH THIS TENDER OFFER. THE TENDER OFFER PRICE WILL BE AT THE SAME PRICE PAID TO AMIL’S CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS, ADJUSTED FOR STATUTORY INTEREST UNDER BRAZILIAN LAW FROM THE DATE OF PAYMENT TO THE CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS TO THE DATE OF PAYMENT TO THE TENDERING MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS. THE REMAINING 10% STAKE IN AMIL IS HELD BY SHAREHOLDERS, INCLUDING AMIL’S CEO, WHO HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS SINCE OCTOBER 2012, WHO HAVE COMMITTED TO RETAIN THE SHARES FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT THE SHARES TO THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO CALL THESE SHARES UPON EXPIRATION OF THE FIVE YEAR TERM, UNLESS ACCELERATED UPON CERTAIN EVENTS, AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION, AMIL’S CEO INVESTED APPROXIMATELY

$470 MILLION

THE COMPANY’S BANK CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS INCLUDING REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A DEBT TO DEBT-PLUS-EQUITY RATIO NOT MORE THAN

50%

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS

IN 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS TO CONVERT A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM FIXED RATES TO FLOATING RATES TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST EXPENSE WITH INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENT AND VARIABLE RATE INVESTMENT BALANCES. THE FLOATING RATES ARE BENCHMARKED TO LIBOR. THE SWAPS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES ON THE COMPANY’S FIXED-RATE DEBT. SINCE THE CRITICAL TERMS OF THE SWAPS MATCH THOSE OF THE DEBT BEING HEDGED, THEY ARE ASSUMED TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEDGES AND ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS ARE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED DEBT WITH NO NET IMPACT RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. BOTH THE HEDGE FAIR VALUE CHANGES AND THE OFFSETTING DEBT ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THESE SWAPS WAS

$3 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2012 AND IS RECORDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS FOR

$14 MILLION

AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES FOR

$11 MILLION

IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IN DECEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS DENOMINATED IN BRAZILIAN REAL. THE CURRENCY SWAPS HAVE A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF

$256 MILLION

AND MATURE ON DECEMBER 31, 2013. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CURRENCY SWAP LIABILITY WAS

$3 MILLION

, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012 THE COMPANY HAD

$94 MILLION

OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED IN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. BECAUSE THESE EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED, NO U.S. TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN ACCRUED RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF THESE EARNINGS.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

THE COMPANY’S REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH JURISDICTION, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST OF THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH MODEL REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDS, THESE STANDARDS GENERALLY PERMIT DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID FROM STATUTORY UNASSIGNED SURPLUS OF THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARY AND ARE LIMITED BASED ON THE REGULATED SUBSIDIARY’S LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. THESE DIVIDENDS ARE REFERRED TO AS “ORDINARY DIVIDENDS” AND GENERALLY CAN BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IF THE DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DIVIDENDS PAID WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS, EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED STATUTORY LIMIT OR IS PAID FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN EARNED SURPLUS, IT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AN “EXTRAORDINARY DIVIDEND” AND MUST RECEIVE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL. IN 2012, BASED ON THE 2011 STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVELS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ORDINARY DIVIDENDS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PAID BY THE COMPANY’S U.S. REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES WAS

LEGAL MATTERS

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF ITS BUSINESSES, THE COMPANY IS FREQUENTLY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS AND REGULATORY INQUIRIES, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS AND SUITS BROUGHT BY MEMBERS, CARE PROVIDERS, CUSTOMERS AND REGULATORS, RELATING TO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER SERVICES. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE, EMPLOYMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ANTITRUST, PRIVACY AND CONTRACT CLAIMS, AND CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE AND OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR ITS ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS WHERE APPROPRIATE. ESTIMATES OF COSTS RESULTING FROM LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING THE COMPANY ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, PARTICULARLY WHERE THE MATTERS: INVOLVE INDETERMINATE CLAIMS FOR MONETARY DAMAGES OR MAY INVOLVE FINES, PENALTIES OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; PRESENT NOVEL LEGAL THEORIES OR REPRESENT A SHIFT IN REGULATORY POLICY; INVOLVE A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS OR REGULATORY BODIES; ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS; OR COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN BUSINESS PRACTICES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY IS OFTEN UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE LOSSES OR RANGES OF LOSSES FOR THOSE MATTERS WHERE THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OR IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

LITIGATION MATTERS

OUT-OF-NETWORK REIMBURSEMENT LITIGATION.

THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS CHALLENGING REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS FOR NON-NETWORK HEALTH CARE SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANY’S USE OF A DATABASE PREVIOUSLY MAINTAINED BY INGENIX, INC. (NOW KNOWN AS OPTUMINSIGHT), INCLUDING PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS AND MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF MEMBERS OF AETNA AND WELLPOINT. THESE SUITS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE DATABASE LICENSED TO THESE COMPANIES BY INGENIX WAS FLAWED AND THAT INGENIX CONSPIRED WITH THESE COMPANIES TO UNDERPAY THEIR MEMBERS’ CLAIMS AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND TREBLE DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF, INTEREST, COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THESE SUITS. IN 2012, THE COMPANY WAS DISMISSED AS A PARTY FROM A SIMILAR LAWSUIT INVOLVING CIGNA AND ITS MEMBERS. THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF LOSS, IF ANY, THAT MAY RESULT FROM THESE MATTERS DUE TO THE PROCEDURAL STATUS OF THE CASES, DISPOSITIVE MOTIONS THAT REMAIN PENDING, THE ABSENCE OF CLASS CERTIFICATION IN ANY OF THE CASES, THE LACK OF A FORMAL DEMAND ON THE COMPANY BY THE PLAINTIFFS, AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES AS DEFENDANTS.

CALIFORNIA CLAIMS PROCESSING MATTER.

ON JANUARY 25, 2008, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (CDI) ISSUED AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE TO PACIFICARE LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF CERTAIN INSURANCE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO AN ALLEGED FAILURE TO INCLUDE CERTAIN LANGUAGE IN STANDARD CLAIMS CORRESPONDENCE,

84

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TIMELINESS AND ACCURACY OF CLAIMS PROCESSING, INTEREST PAYMENTS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION, CARE PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS. THE MATTER HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING BEFORE A CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE SINCE DECEMBER 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CDI HAS NEVER ISSUED A PENALTY IN EXCESS OF

$8 MILLION

, CDI IS SEEKING A PENALTY OF APPROXIMATELY

$325 MILLION

IN THIS MATTER. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING AGAINST THE CLAIMS IN THIS MATTER AND BELIEVES THAT THE PENALTY REQUESTED BY CDI IS EXCESSIVE AND WITHOUT MERIT. AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUES A RULING AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, EXPECTED IN EARLY 2013, THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER MAY ACCEPT, REJECT OR MODIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE’S RULING, ISSUE HIS OWN DECISION, AND IMPOSE A FINE OR PENALTY. THE COMMISSIONER’S DECISION IS SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE IN COURT. THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF LOSS, IF ANY, THAT MAY RESULT FROM THIS MATTER GIVEN THE PROCEDURAL STATUS OF THE DISPUTE, THE NOVEL LEGAL ISSUES PRESENTED (INCLUDING THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS), THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING REGULATORY FINES AND PENALTIES, AND THE VARIOUS REMEDIES AND LEVELS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY IN THE EVENT A FINE OR PENALTY IS ASSESSED.

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AND IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (OIG), THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC), U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ), U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), THE BRAZILIAN SECURITIES REGULATOR - COMISSÃO DE VALORES MOBILIÁRIOS (CVM), IRS, SRF, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL), THE FDIC AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN REVIEWED OR ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW, INCLUDING FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPLIANCE WITH CODING AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE RISK-ADJUSTMENT MODEL.

IN FEBRUARY 2012, CMS ANNOUNCED A FINAL RADV AUDIT AND PAYMENT ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY AND THAT IT WILL CONDUCT RADV AUDITS BEGINNING WITH THE 2011 PAYMENT YEAR. THESE AUDITS INVOLVE A REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS MAINTAINED BY CARE PROVIDERS AND MAY RESULT IN RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO HEALTH PLANS. CMS HAS NOT COMMUNICATED HOW THE FINAL PAYMENT ADJUSTMENT UNDER ITS METHODOLOGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

WE MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT) THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS (I) RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN SEC RULES AND FORMS; AND (II) ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, MANAGEMENT EVALUATED, UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL AS OF

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, WE USED THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED F

RAMEWORK. MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING EXCLUDED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF AMIL PARTICIPAÇÕES S.A AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (AMIL). SUCH EXCLUSION WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION GUIDANCE THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF A RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESS MAY BE OMITTED IN MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE YEAR OF ACQUISITION. WE ACQUIRED A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN AMIL DURING OCTOBER 2012. AMIL REPRESENTED 10% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS AND 1% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL REVENUES AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT AND THE COSO CRITERIA, WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE COMPANY’S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS AUDITED THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012

, AS STATED IN THE REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, APPEARING UNDER ITEM 9A, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE “COMPANY”) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. AS DESCRIBED IN REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED FROM ITS ASSESSMENT THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT AMIL PARTICIPAÇÕES S.A AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (AMIL), WHICH WAS ACQUIRED DURING OCTOBER 2012 AND WHOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF TOTAL ASSETS AND 1% OF TOTAL REVENUES OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012. ACCORDINGLY, OUR AUDIT DID NOT INCLUDE THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT AMIL. THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANY’S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORTS DATED

FEBRUARY 6, 2013
