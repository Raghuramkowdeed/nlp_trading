EXPANSION AND DIVESTITURE OF

WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES

OFFERING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES

MAY INCLUDE ACQUIRING BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR

EXISTING OPERATIONS. WE ALSO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION TO

INTERNALLY DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE HEALTH

AND WELL-BEING SECTOR AS WE HAVE BROADLY DEFINED IT. DURING

2003, WE COMPLETED SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS AND CEASED OFFERING SOME

PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN MARKETS, ALL AS PART OF OUR ONGOING EMPHASIS

ON OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE

REGULATED. THIS REGULATION CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY

AGENCIES GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND

INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING CONSIDERED, AND THE

INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE

PERIODICALLY. THESE REVISIONS COULD AFFECT OUR CONSOLIDATED

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. ENACTMENT OF FEDERAL AND STATE

HEALTH BENEFIT LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR

BUSINESSES.

FEDERAL REGULATION

OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT, WHICH INCLUDES

UNITEDHEALTHCARE, OVATIONS, AND AMERICHOICE. OVATIONS HAS

MEDICARE ADVANTAGE CONTRACTS THAT ARE REGULATED BY CMS. CMS HAS

THE RIGHT TO AUDIT OUR PERFORMANCE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE

COMPLIANCE WITH CMS CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE

QUALITY OF CARE BEING GIVEN TO MEMBERS. OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES

SEGMENT ALSO HAS MEDICAID AND STATE CHILDRENS HEALTH

INSURANCE PROGRAM CONTRACTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND

STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID

ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF

THESE PROGRAMS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF REGULATION

SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COMPLIANCE. IN ADDITION,

BECAUSE A PORTION OF INGENIX BUSINESS INCLUDES CLINICAL

RESEARCH, IT IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FDA. WE BELIEVE WE

ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. WE BELIEVE WE

ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS.

STATE REGULATION

ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER

INSURANCE AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE PRODUCTS REGULATE THOSE

PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THESE STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL

REPORTS FROM US AND IMPOSE MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH

RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. MANY OF OUR HEALTH PLANS AND EACH OF OUR

INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGULATED UNDER STATE INSURANCE

HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRE

REGISTRATION WITH APPLICABLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND

THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CERTAIN INTER-COMPANY

TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE

INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR

REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTER-COMPANY

TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE

REGULATED COMPANIES AND THEIR PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES OR

AFFILIATES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR PRODUCTS

MAY BE SUBJECT TO PPO, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION

(MCO) OR TPA-RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE

REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER GREATLY FROM STATE TO

STATE, BUT GENERALLY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING, PRODUCT AND

RATE, FINANCIAL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. MANY STATES ALSO

HAVE ENACTED LAWS AND/OR ADOPTED REGULATIONS GOVERNING

UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EXTERNAL APPEALS ACTIVITIES, AND THESE

LAWS MAY APPLY TO SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE

ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DELIVERY OF SERVICES, PROMPT PAYMENT OF CLAIMS,

CONFIDENTIALITY OF CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION AND COVERED

BENEFITS AND SERVICES.

HIPAA

THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF

THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996,

AS AMENDED (HIPAA), APPLY TO BOTH THE GROUP AND

INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING SELF-FUNDED

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. FEDERAL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT

TO HIPAA ARE NOW EFFECTIVE. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE MINIMUM

STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND CODE SETS, AND FOR THE

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. WE BELIEVE

THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS. NEW STANDARDS

FOR NATIONAL PROVIDER AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFIERS ARE CURRENTLY

BEING DEVELOPED BY REGULATORS. WE INTEND TO BE IN COMPLIANCE BY

THE ENFORCEMENT DATES. HOWEVER, WHERE THE LAW IS FAR-REACHING

AND COMPLEX OR THE GOVERNMENT DELAYS IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON

SOME ASPECTS OF THE LAW, THE TIMELINESS OF OUR COMPLIANCE

EFFORTS MAY BE AFFECTED. ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO

HIPAAS PROVISIONS AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES IN

THE DIFFERENT STATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO

STANDARDIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS STATE LINES.

ERISA

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF

1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), REGULATES HOW GOODS AND

SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF

EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A COMPLEX SET

OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

INTERPRETATION BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AS WELL

AS THE FEDERAL COURTS. ERISA PLACES CONTROLS ON HOW OUR BUSINESS

UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT MAINTAIN

SELF-FUNDED PLANS. DURING 2003, WE PROCESSED AND ADMINISTERED

THE PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $25 BILLION OF MEDICAL CLAIMS

ON BEHALF OF CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE MEDICAL COSTS OF

THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES DEPENDENTS. ERISA

CLAIM REGULATIONS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JULY 2002 REQUIRE

ONGOING MODIFICATIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS.

FRAUD AND ABUSE

THE REGULATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS

APPLICABLE TO PARTICIPANTS IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ARE COMPLEX AND CHANGING.

WE CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE OUR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE EFFORTS FOR

THESE PROGRAMS, BUT ONGOING VIGOROUS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

HIGHLY TECHNICAL NATURE OF THE REGULATIONS MEAN THAT COMPLIANCE

EFFORTS IN THIS ARENA WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, STATES HAVE BEGUN TO FOCUS THEIR

ANTI-FRAUD EFFORTS ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE

ORGANIZATIONS. SOME STATES NOW REQUIRE FILING AND APPROVAL OF

ANTI-FRAUD PLANS AND MAY MONITOR COMPLIANCE AS PART OF ANY

MARKET CONDUCT EXAMINATION. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS.

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE ARE REGULARLY SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS,

INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT

ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL

FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF

LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT

PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, A STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OR OTHER

STATE OR FEDERAL AUTHORITY (INCLUDING CMS, THE OFFICE OF THE

INSPECTOR GENERAL AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL) MAY FROM TIME TO

TIME BEGIN A SPECIAL AUDIT OF ONE OF OUR HEALTH PLANS, OUR

INSURANCE PLANS OR ONE OF OUR OTHER OPERATIONS TO INVESTIGATE

ISSUES SUCH AS UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT; FINANCIAL, ELIGIBILITY OR

OTHER DATA REPORTING; PROMPT CLAIMS PAYMENT; OR COVERAGE

DETERMINATIONS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY ROOM

CARE. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE,

REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS,

STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR

GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. WE

DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY OF THE CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS,

AUDITS OR REVIEWS,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

OUR INGENIX, UNIPRISE AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES

SEGMENTS HAVE LIMITED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEGAL AND

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING

VARIOUS TAX, TARIFF AND TRADE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS

EMPLOYMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INVESTMENT RULES AND LAWS.

MARKETING

OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IS DEFINED AND COORDINATED

BY EACH BUSINESS DEDICATED MARKETING STAFF. WITHIN THESE

BUSINESSES, PRIMARY MARKETING RESPONSIBILITY GENERALLY RESIDES

WITH A MARKETING LEADER AND A DIRECT SALES FORCE. IN ADDITION,

SEVERAL OF THE SEGMENTS ALSO RELY UPON INDEPENDENT INSURANCE

AGENTS AND BROKERS TO SELL SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTS. MARKETING

EFFORTS ALSO INCLUDE PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORTS AND ADVERTISING

PROGRAMS THAT MAY USE TELEVISION, RADIO, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES,

BILLBOARDS, DIRECT MAIL AND TELEMARKETING.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES

COMPANY WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR

COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, INSURANCE

COMPANIES, THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS AND BUSINESS SERVICES

OUTSOURCING COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE FORMED

NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS, SPECIALTY BENEFIT

PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, AND VARIOUS INFORMATION AND

CONSULTING COMPANIES. FOR OUR UNIPRISE AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES

BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA, ANTHEM, CIGNA, COVENTRY,

HUMANA, PACIFICARE, OXFORD, WELLPOINT, NUMEROUS FOR PROFIT AND

NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE

BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER ENTERPRISES

CONCENTRATED IN MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. OUR SPECIALIZED

CARE SERVICES AND INGENIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A

NUMBER OF BUSINESSES. NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

COMPETE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THESE MARKETS, ALSO

CONTRIBUTE TO A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING US AND THE SALES AND

PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION,

CONSUMER SATISFACTION, THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, NETWORK CAPABILITIES, PRICE, MARKET SHARE, PRODUCT

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS,

FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS ARE

ENHANCED BY OUR CUSTOMER FOCUS RESULTING FROM OUR OPERATIONAL

ALIGNMENT. EACH UNITEDHEALTH GROUP BUSINESS REPRESENTS A

STRATEGIC PLATFORM FROM WHICH WE CAN PENETRATE MORE DEEPLY INTO

SPECIFIC MARKETS USING OUR THREE CORE COMPETENCIES: NETWORK

MANAGEMENT, KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION AND SERVICE

INFRASTRUCTURE. OTHER STRENGTHS INCLUDE THE BREADTH AND QUALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE AND DIVERSITY, THE SCOPE

AND DEPTH OF OUR DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH CARE COSTS

AND CONSUMPTION, OUR EFFECTIVE USE OF PROPRIETARY TOOLS AND

PRODUCTS TO COORDINATE AND FACILITATE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO

REALIZE APPROPRIATELY LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS, OUR DISCIPLINED

UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PRACTICES AND STAFF, OUR SIGNIFICANT

MARKET POSITION IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THE STRENGTH OF OUR

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OUR GENERALLY

LARGE PROVIDER NETWORKS THAT PROVIDE MORE CONSUMER CHOICE AND

MINIMIZE BARRIERS TO ACCESS, OUR POINT-OF-SERVICE PRODUCTS AND

OUR STRONG MARKETPLACE REPUTATION. HOWEVER, IN SOME MARKETS WE

MAY BE AT A DISADVANTAGE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING

COMPETITORS WITH MORE RESOURCES, LONGER OPERATING HISTORIES,

LARGER MARKET SHARES, BROADER NETWORKS, NARROWER NETWORKS (WHICH

MAY ALLOW GREATER COST CONTROL AND LOWER PRICES) OR MORE

ESTABLISHED NAMES AND REPUTATIONS.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE EMPLOYED

APPROXIMATELY 33,000 INDIVIDUALS. WE BELIEVE OUR EMPLOYEE

RELATIONS ARE FAVORABLE.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K, AND IN THE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

OTHER SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS INCORPORATED

BY REFERENCE IN THIS FORM 10-K, INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (THE PSLRA). WHEN USED

IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN FUTURE FILINGS BY

US WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, IN OUR PRESS

RELEASES, PRESENTATIONS TO SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, AND

IN ORAL STATEMENTS MADE BY OR WITH THE APPROVAL OF ONE OF OUR

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE WORDS OR PHRASES BELIEVES,

ANTICIPATES, INTENDS, WILL LIKELY

RESULT, ESTIMATES, PROJECTS OR

SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS CERTAIN

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS THAT INVESTORS AND

OTHERS SHOULD CONSIDER. THIS DISCUSSION IS INTENDED TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE

PSLRA. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL

SECURITIES LAWS, IN MAKING THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS, WE DO

NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS OR UPDATE EACH FACTOR IN FUTURE FILINGS

OR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATING RESULTS,

AND DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS HOW ANY OF THESE FACTORS MAY

HAVE CAUSED RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM DISCUSSIONS OR INFORMATION

CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS. IN ADDITION,

ANY OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW MAY HAVE AFFECTED OUR PAST,

AS WELL AS CURRENT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT FUTURE

RESULTS. ANY OR ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS

FORM 10-K, IN THE 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND

IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY TURN OUT TO BE WRONG.

THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR

BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS

DISCUSSED BELOW WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS.

CONSEQUENTLY, NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE GUARANTEED.

ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS

EXPRESSED IN OUR PRIOR COMMUNICATIONS.

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR HEALTH CARE

COSTS.

UNDER RISK-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME

THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR

CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM

RISK-BASED PRODUCTS (EXCLUDING AARP) COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 75%

OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. WE USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO

85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE

SERVICES DELIVERED TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR

RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO

ACCURATELY PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HEALTH

CARE COSTS. TOTAL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER

OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE.

OUR PREMIUM REVENUE IS TYPICALLY FIXED IN PRICE FOR A 12-MONTH

PERIOD AND IS GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE

CONTRACT COMMENCEMENT. SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AND RELATED COSTS

ARE INCURRED WHEN THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. ALTHOUGH WE BASE THE

PREMIUMS WE CHARGE ON OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS

OVER THE FIXED PREMIUM PERIOD, INFLATION, REGULATIONS AND OTHER

FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND

REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED USE

OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES,

CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY

TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER

REGULATORY CHANGES, INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND

SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. RELATIVELY

SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS AS

A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MEDICAL COSTS

INCREASED BY ONE PERCENT FOR UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL

INSURED PRODUCTS, OUR ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2003 WOULD HAVE

BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE

FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE

ESTIMATES OF COSTS INCURRED FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING CLAIMS HAVE

NOT BEEN RECEIVED BY US OR FOR WHICH THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN

RECEIVED BUT NOT PROCESSED. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO HIGH OR

TOO LOW, THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE WILL BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE

RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN MANY OF OUR

MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN

COMPETITORS.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

STATES AND FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC

MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. FOR OUR UNIPRISE AND HEALTH CARE

SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA, ANTHEM, CIGNA,

COVENTRY, HUMANA, PACIFICARE, OXFORD, WELLPOINT, NUMEROUS FOR

PROFIT AND NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES

FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER

ENTERPRISES CONCENTRATED IN MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. OUR

SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES AND INGENIX BUSINESSES ALSO COMPETE

WITH A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES. MOREOVER, WE BELIEVE THAT BARRIERS

TO ENTRY IN MANY MARKETS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL, SO THE ADDITION OF

NEW COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CUSTOMERS ENJOY

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS. IN

PARTICULAR MARKETS, THESE COMPETITORS MAY HAVE CAPABILITIES THAT

GIVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. GREATER MARKET SHARE,

ESTABLISHED REPUTATION, SUPERIOR SUPPLIER ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER FACTORS ALL CAN PROVIDE A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND

ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE

OPERATE, BOTH AS TO OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS IN THESE

INDUSTRIES. THIS LEVEL OF CONSOLIDATION MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS, TO IMPROVE THE TERMS ON

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND TO MAINTAIN OR

ADVANCE PROFITABILITY.

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP IS SIGNIFICANT TO

OUR OVATIONS BUSINESS.

UNDER OUR 10-YEAR CONTRACT WITH AARP WHICH WE

ENTERED INTO IN 1998, WE PROVIDE MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND

HOSPITAL INDEMNITY HEALTH INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP

MEMBERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, OUR PORTION OF

AARPS INSURANCE PROGRAM REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY

$4.1 BILLION IN ANNUAL NET PREMIUM REVENUE FROM

APPROXIMATELY 3.8 MILLION AARP MEMBERS. THE AARP CONTRACT

MAY BE TERMINATED EARLY BY US OR AARP UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING A MATERIAL BREACH BY EITHER PARTY,

INSOLVENCY OF EITHER PARTY, A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF EITHER PARTY, AND BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENT DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR

ABILITY TO SERVICE AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

COMPETITIVELY, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND STATE

REGULATORY CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, EVENTS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT

AARP OR ONE OF ITS OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS FOR ITS MEMBER

INSURANCE PROGRAM COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE SUCCESS OF

OUR ARRANGEMENT WITH AARP. FOR EXAMPLE, IF CUSTOMERS WERE

DISSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCTS AARP OFFERED OR ITS REPUTATION,

IF FEDERAL LEGISLATION LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MEDICARE

MARKET, OR IF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY AARPS OTHER

BUSINESS PARTNERS WERE UNACCEPTABLE, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW MEDICARE REFORM

LEGISLATION ON OUR BUSINESS ARE UNCERTAIN.

RECENTLY ENACTED MEDICARE REFORM LEGISLATION IS

COMPLEX AND WIDE-RANGING. THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROVISIONS IN THE

LEGISLATION THAT WILL INFLUENCE OUR BUSINESS, ALTHOUGH AT THIS

EARLY STAGE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR

BUSINESS WILL BE AFFECTED. WHILE UNCERTAIN AS TO IMPACT, WE

BELIEVE THE INCREASED FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE LEGISLATION WILL

INTENSIFY COMPETITION IN THE SENIORS HEALTH SERVICES MARKET.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO INTENSE GOVERNMENT

SCRUTINY AND WE MUST RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO

FREQUENT CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE,

LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR

BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT

TO FREQUENT CHANGE. BROAD LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES

ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND

RULES COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT

REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR

LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE

DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. WE

MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF

OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS

AND TO CONSUMMATE OUR ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. DELAYS IN

OBTAINING OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS

COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE PARTICIPATE IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS

GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT

MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE

THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR

ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. SUCH

CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN THE PAST AND MAY

DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS

ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES. LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS AT

STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS MAY AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR

BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND

OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT METHODS

AND PAYMENT RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; CLAIM PAYMENTS AND

PROCESSING; USE AND MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE

HEALTH INFORMATION; AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS. WE CANNOT

PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME

BINDING LAW OR REGULATION, OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS WILL

BE, BUT THEIR ENACTMENT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO

EXPANDED LIABILITY, REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE

CONDUCT BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR A LOSS OF BUSINESS.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL

INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. SUCH OVERSIGHT COULD RESULT

IN OUR LOSS OF LICENSURE OR OUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN

PROGRAMS, OR THE IMPOSITION OF CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES,

PENALTIES AND OTHER SANCTIONS. IN ADDITION, DISCLOSURE OF ANY

ADVERSE INVESTIGATION OR AUDIT RESULTS OR SANCTIONS COULD DAMAGE

OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

US TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED

IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS.

THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS,

AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

SERVICES, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND

STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE

OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL.

WE DEPEND ON OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH

PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS,

PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR FAVORABLE

PRICES. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE ADVOCATING FOR LEGISLATION

THAT WOULD EXEMPT CERTAIN OF THESE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE

PROFESSIONALS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. IN ANY

PARTICULAR MARKET, THESE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE

PROFESSIONALS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS,

OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTH CARE

COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY

MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME

MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS,

PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN

GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES

THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART.

THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO

SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION RISKS AND OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT

BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER SOME OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

LITIGATION.

PERIODICALLY, WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF

LEGAL ACTIONS THAT CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT

AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER

SUITS, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN

ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE

ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO

THE DESIGN, MANAGEMENT AND OFFERINGS OF OUR SERVICES. THESE

MATTERS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATED TO

HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS,

CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN

BUSINESS PRACTICES. IN 1999, A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

WERE FILED AGAINST US AND VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE

HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS. THE SUITS ARE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS

ON BEHALF OF PHYSICIANS FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF FEDERAL

STATUTES, INCLUDING ERISA AND THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED CORRUPT

ORGANIZATION ACT (RICO). ALTHOUGH THE EXPENSES WHICH

WE HAVE INCURRED TO DATE IN DEFENDING THE 1999 CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL

CONTINUE TO INCUR EXPENSES IN THE DEFENSE OF THE 1999 CLASS

ACTION LITIGATION AND OTHER MATTERS, EVEN IF THEY ARE WITHOUT

MERIT.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001,

THE COST OF BUSINESS INSURANCE COVERAGE HAS INCREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF RISK

THAT WE SELF-INSURE, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS

INCIDENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY

INSURED FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE; HOWEVER,

CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARE NOT

COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF

THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS. ALTHOUGH

WE BELIEVE THE LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED FOR THESE RISKS ARE

ADEQUATE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES MAY

EXCEED THE LIABILITIES RECORDED.

OUR BUSINESSES DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON

EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN

OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, PROVIDE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES,

WE HAVE ACQUIRED ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS. WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS

TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE UPGRADED AND

EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. IF THE

INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WAS FOUND TO BE

INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVELY

OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY, WE COULD LOSE

EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS,

HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND

ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE CUSTOMER AND PHYSICIAN

AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER DISPUTES, HAVE REGULATORY

PROBLEMS, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER

ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.

WE DEPEND ON INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS

IBM AND MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., WITH WHOM WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS, FOR SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR DATA

CENTER OPERATIONS AND PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT AND

PROCESSING, RESPECTIVELY. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE APPROPRIATE

PROVISIONS IN OUR AGREEMENT WITH IBM AND MEDCO, INCLUDING

PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE STANDARDS,

COVENANTS, WARRANTIES, AUDIT RIGHTS, INDEMNIFICATION, AND OTHER

PROVISIONS, OUR DEPENDENCE ON THESE THIRD PARTIES MAKES OUR

OPERATIONS VULNERABLE TO THEIR FAILURE TO PERFORM ADEQUATELY

UNDER THE CONTRACTS, DUE TO INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL FACTORS.

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS

WITH THE SIZE, SCALE AND CAPABILITIES TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE

CERTAIN OF THESE SERVICES, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO PHARMACY

BENEFITS PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER

ORGANIZATIONS COULD PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES ON COMPARABLE

TERMS. A CHANGE IN SERVICE PROVIDERS, HOWEVER, COULD RESULT IN A

DECLINE IN SERVICE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OR LESS FAVORABLE

CONTRACT TERMS.

WE MUST COMPLY WITH EMERGING RESTRICTIONS ON

PATIENT PRIVACY, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE BY

OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHO OBTAIN ACCESS TO SENSITIVE PATIENT

INFORMATION WHEN PROVIDING SERVICES TO US.

THE USE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR

BUSINESSES IS REGULATED AT INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL AND STATE

LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE CHANGED FREQUENTLY BY

LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS

ADDRESS THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE

HEALTH DATA. MOST ARE DERIVED FROM THE PRIVACY PROVISIONS IN THE

FEDERAL GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND HIPAA. HIPAA ALSO IMPOSES

GUIDELINES ON OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES (AS THIS TERM IS DEFINED

IN THE HIPAA REGULATIONS). EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR

APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS

ASSOCIATES, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND

PRACTICES. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE PROPOSALS AND NEW REGULATIONS

MAY RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES,

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, AND THE EFFECTS

OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. THEY ALSO

MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR USE OF PATIENT

IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT IS HOUSED IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR

ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES.

OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED

BUSINESSES DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED

PRODUCTS.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS,

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND OUR TRADE

SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY

RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR

PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION

REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE

INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY

SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF

PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH

LITIGATION AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

THE EFFECTS OF THE WAR ON TERROR AND FUTURE

TERRORIST ATTACKS COULD HAVE A SEVERE IMPACT ON THE HEALTH CARE

INDUSTRY.

THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED ON

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE WAR ON TERRORISM, THE THREAT OF

FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AND THE RELATED CONCERNS OF CUSTOMERS

AND PROVIDERS HAVE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO

NEGATIVELY AFFECT, THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND OUR

INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY. DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENTS

ACTIONS AND THE RESPONSIVENESS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND

INSURANCE COMPANIES, FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AND BIO-TERRORISM

COULD LEAD TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASED USE OF HEALTH CARE

SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, HOSPITAL AND PHYSICIAN

SERVICES; LOSS OF MEMBERSHIP IN HEALTH PLANS WE ADMINISTER AS A

RESULT OF LAY-OFFS OR OTHER REDUCTIONS OF EMPLOYMENT; ADVERSE

EFFECTS UPON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR BUSINESS OF EMPLOYERS

WHO SPONSOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES; DISRUPTION

OF OUR INFORMATION AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS; INCREASED HEALTH CARE

COSTS DUE TO RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO CARVE OUT CERTAIN

CATEGORIES OF RISK, SUCH AS ACTS OF TERRORISM; AND DISRUPTION OF

THE FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE MARKETS IN GENERAL.

THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE

PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS IN

WHICH WE OPERATE.

THE MARKET PRICES OF THE SECURITIES OF THE

PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE

SHOWN VOLATILITY AND SENSITIVITY IN RESPONSE TO MANY EXTERNAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING GENERAL MARKET TRENDS, PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS

REGARDING MANAGED CARE, LITIGATION AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS,

LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS,

PRICING TRENDS, COMPETITION, EARNINGS, MEMBERSHIP REPORTS OF

PARTICULAR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY.

DESPITE OUR SPECIFIC OUTLOOK OR PROSPECTS, THE MARKET PRICE OF

OUR COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT OF ANY OF THESE

EXTERNAL FACTORS. BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION, OUR STOCK PRICE HAS

RANGED FROM $35.33 ON DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO $58.18 ON

DECEMBER 31, 2003 (AS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT STOCK SPLITS AND

DIVIDENDS).

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE LEASED

APPROXIMATELY 6.6 MILLION AND OWNED APPROXIMATELY 250,000

AGGREGATE SQUARE FEET OF SPACE IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.

OUR LEASES EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH MAY 31, 2025.

OUR VARIOUS SEGMENTS USE THIS SPACE EXCLUSIVELY FOR THEIR

RESPECTIVE BUSINESS PURPOSES AND WE BELIEVE THESE CURRENT

FACILITIES ARE SUITABLE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE USES AND ARE

ADEQUATE FOR OUR ANTICIPATED FUTURE NEEDS.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

IN RE: MANAGED CARE LITIGATION: MDL

NO. 1334.

BEGINNING IN 1999, A

SERIES OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST US AND

VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS. A

MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL HAS CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL

LITIGATION CASES INVOLVING UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND OUR AFFILIATES

IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF FLORIDA, MIAMI DIVISION. IN

DECEMBER 2000, THE UNITEDHEALTH GROUP LITIGATION WAS

CONSOLIDATED WITH LITIGATION INVOLVING OTHER INDUSTRY MEMBERS.

GENERALLY, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS

OF ERISA AND RICO IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED UNDISCLOSED

POLICIES INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS. OTHER ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE

BREACH OF STATE PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO TIMELY REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR MEDICAL

SERVICES RENDERED. THE CONSOLIDATED SUITS SEEK INJUNCTIVE,

COMPENSATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF AS WELL AS RESTITUTION, COSTS,

FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. DISCOVERY COMMENCED ON

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

GRANTED THE INDUSTRY DEFENDANTS PETITION TO REVIEW THE

CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER. THAT APPEAL IS PENDING. ON

APRIL 7, 2003, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DETERMINED

THAT THE RICO CLAIMS AGAINST PACIFICARE AND

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITEDHEALTHCARE SHOULD BE ARBITRATED. ON

SEPTEMBER 15, 2003, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED IN PART AND

DENIED IN PART THE INDUSTRY DEFENDANTS FURTHER MOTION TO

COMPEL ARBITRATION. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE COURT DENIED THE INDUSTRY

DEFENDANTS MOTION WITH RESPECT TO PLAINTIFFS

DERIVATIVE RICO CLAIMS. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2003, THE INDUSTRY

DEFENDANTS APPEALED THE DISTRICT COURTS ARBITRATION ORDER

TO THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT. A TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR

SEPTEMBER 13, 2004.

THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ET AL.

V. METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, UNITED HEALTHCARE

SERVICES, INC. AND UNITEDHEALTH

GROUP.

THIS LAWSUIT WAS FILED ON

MARCH 15, 2000, IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF

NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK. ON APRIL 13, 2000,

WE REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE SUIT ALLEGES CAUSES OF

ACTION BASED ON ERISA, AS WELL AS BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE

IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS

AND PRACTICES, AND TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE

CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR

NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS. THE SUIT SEEKS DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE

AND COMPENSATORY RELIEF AS WELL AS COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST

PAYMENTS. AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 25,

2000, WHICH ALLEGED TWO CLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS, AN ERISA CLASS

AND A NON-ERISA CLASS. AFTER THE COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN ERISA

CLAIMS AND THE CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

ASSOCIATION, A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED. ON

OCTOBER 25, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN

PART OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT. WE ARE

ENGAGED IN DISCOVERY IN THIS MATTER.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE

ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO LAWSUITS ALLEGING VARIOUS CAUSES OF ACTION.

SOME OF THESE SUITS MAY INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL

NON-ECONOMIC, TREBLE OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. WE RECORD LIABILITIES

FOR OUR ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS.

ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF PENDING LITIGATION ARE ALWAYS UNCERTAIN,

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING

THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE, OR ANY OTHER TYPES OF ACTIONS, CURRENTLY

THREATENED OR PENDING, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
