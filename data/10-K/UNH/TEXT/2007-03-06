EXPLANATORY NOTE

IN THIS FORM 10-K, UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED (UNITEDHEALTH GROUP OR THE

COMPANY) IS RESTATING ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THIS FORM 10-K ALSO REFLECTS

THE RESTATEMENT OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA IN ITEM 6 FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, AND THE AMENDMENT OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS PRESENTED IN THE COMPANYS FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AS IT RELATED TO THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004.

IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY FILED AN AMENDED QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q/A FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 AND

QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THESE FORMS 10-Q/A AND 10-Q CONTAIN RESTATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2005 AND THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31,

2006.

PREVIOUSLY FILED ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K AND QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q (OTHER THAN FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2006, WHICH HAS

BEEN AMENDED BY THE FORM 10-Q/A) HAVE NOT BEEN AMENDED AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON.

BACKGROUND OF THE RESTATEMENT

IN MARCH 2006, MEDIA REPORTS QUESTIONED WHETHER A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING UNITEDHEALTH GROUP, HAD ENGAGED IN BACKDATING STOCK OPTION GRANTS. SHORTLY THEREAFTER,

THE COMPANY WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC) HAD COMMENCED AN INQUIRY INTO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC PRACTICES CONCERNING STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

ON APRIL 4, 2006, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE BOARD) CREATED AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF THREE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS TO REVIEW

THE COMPANYS OPTION GRANT PRACTICES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1994 THROUGH 2005 (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PERIOD). THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE ENGAGED THE LAW FIRM OF WILMER CUTLER PICKERING HALE AND DORR LLP (WILMERHALE) AS

COUNSEL FOR ITS INDEPENDENT REVIEW, AND WILMERHALE RETAINED INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING ADVISORS. WILMERHALE HAS ADVISED THAT, IN THE COURSE OF ITS REVIEW, IT EXAMINED PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS COMPRISING MORE THAN 26 MILLION PAGES OF

MATERIAL AND CONDUCTED OVER 80 INTERVIEWS.

WILMERHALES REPORT OF ITS FINDINGS (THE WILMERHALE REPORT) WAS FURNISHED TO THE BOARD AND

PUBLICLY ISSUED ON OCTOBER 15, 2006. THE COMPLETE TEXT OF THE WILMERHALE REPORT IS AVAILABLE ON THE COMPANYS WEB SITE, WWW.UNITEDHEALTHGROUP.COM, AND IS INCLUDED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THE COMPANYS CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K FILED WITH

THE SEC ON OCTOBER 16, 2006.

AFTER SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETING ITS ANALYSIS OF THE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE FINDINGS OF THE

WILMERHALE REPORT, ON NOVEMBER 8, 2006, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SEC A CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K REPORTING MANAGEMENTS CONCLUSION, WHICH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD HAD APPROVED, THAT  DUE SOLELY TO THE COMPANYS

HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES  THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 THROUGH 2005, THE INTERIM PERIODS CONTAINED THEREIN, THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 AND ALL EARNINGS AND PRESS

RELEASES, INCLUDING FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND SIMILAR COMMUNICATIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY FOR SUCH PERIODS, AND THE RELATED REPORTS OF THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM, SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON. THE FORM 8-K ALSO REPORTED THAT MANAGEMENT HAD RE-EVALUATED ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND HAD CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD

A MATERIAL WEAKNESS SOLELY RELATING TO STOCK OPTION PLAN ADMINISTRATION AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND DISCLOSURE OF STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FORM 8-K ALSO DISCLOSED THAT CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND FORMER SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAD AGREED TO

INCREASE THE EXERCISE PRICE OF ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO THAT EXECUTIVE WITH STATED GRANT DATES BETWEEN 1994 AND 2002 TO ELIMINATE ANY FINANCIAL BENEFIT RESULTING FROM WHAT THE WILMERHALE REPORT CONCLUDED WAS THE LIKELY BACKDATING OF GRANTS THAT

THEY RECEIVED.

AFTER COMPLETING ITS INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR ALL OPTION GRANTS, AND FOLLOWING CONSULTATION ON CERTAIN INTERPRETIVE

ACCOUNTING ISSUES WITH THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ACCOUNTANT OF THE SEC, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD HAS APPROVED THE CONCLUSION, THAT THE COMPANY USED INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES AND MADE OTHER ERRORS DESCRIBED BELOW

IN ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THAT THE COMPANYS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOULD BE RESTATED IN THIS FORM 10-K.

SUMMARY OF THE RESTATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (FAS 123R), USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, ALL PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE RESTATED TO RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST IN THE

AMOUNTS HISTORICALLY DISCLOSED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123). PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTED FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION GRANTED UNDER ITS STOCK OPTION PLANS USING THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES (APB 25). UNDER APB

25, A COMPANY WAS NOT REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES IF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE

MEASUREMENT DATE. APB 25 DEFINED THE MEASUREMENT DATE AS THE FIRST DATE ON WHICH BOTH THE NUMBER OF SHARES AN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE WAS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE OPTION OR PURCHASE PRICE, IF ANY, WERE KNOWN.

THE RESTATEMENT IN THIS FORM 10-K PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS UNDER BOTH FAS 123R, THE COMPANYS

CURRENT ACCOUNTING METHOD, AND APB 25, THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING METHOD, RELATING TO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THE RESTATEMENT ALSO REFLECTS CERTAIN OTHER ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS

UNRELATED TO HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, WHICH ARE NOT MATERIAL EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE TO THE CURRENT OR PRIOR PERIODS.

THE

PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE RESTATEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS.

REVISED MEASUREMENT DATES.

BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE

METHODOLOGIES DESCRIBED BELOW TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATES UNDER BOTH FAS 123 AND APB 25 FOR GRANTS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: (1) GRANTS OF APPROXIMATELY 80 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS TO

SECTION 16 OFFICERS (SECTION 16 GRANTS); (2) GRANTS OF APPROXIMATELY 260 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS TO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES (BROAD-BASED GRANTS); AND (3) GRANTS OF

APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS IN CONNECTION WITH THE HIRING OR PROMOTION OF EMPLOYEES (NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS). AS A RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT, IN MOST CASES, THE STATED

GRANT DATE WAS NOT THE CORRECT MEASUREMENT DATE.



SECTION 16 GRANTS

 SECTION 16 GRANTS, GENERALLY MADE TO EIGHT TO TWELVE OFFICERS, REQUIRED APPROVAL BY THE COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES

COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD (THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE).

FOR THE MAJORITY OF SECTION 16 GRANTS, COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE APPROVAL WAS REFLECTED IN WRITTEN ACTIONS. THE WILMERHALE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE WRITTEN ACTIONS WERE GENERALLY EXECUTED SUBSEQUENT TO THE STATED GRANT DATES. (UNDER MINNESOTA CORPORATE LAW, IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO MAKE A WRITTEN ACTION

EFFECTIVE AS OF A DATE OTHER THAN THE DATE ON WHICH THE LAST OF THE REQUIRED SIGNERS AFFIXES HIS OR HER SIGNATURE, EVEN IF THAT EFFECTIVE DATE IS BEFORE THE LAST SIGNATURE AFFIXED.) BASED ON THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT

THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR EACH OF THESE SECTION 16 GRANTS IS THE EARLIER OF (A) THE DATE ON WHICH A FORM 4 (OR OTHER STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP) WAS FILED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO A

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARTICULAR OFFICERS GRANT OR (B) THE DATE ON WHICH THE WRITTEN ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THAT GRANT WAS LIKELY EXECUTED BY A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS

OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.

AS TO CERTAIN OTHER SECTION 16 GRANTS, COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVAL OCCURRED AT A MEETING OR THERE

WAS GENERAL COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF THE SECTION 16 GRANT TOGETHER WITH A DELEGATION TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE THE FINAL AMOUNT OF STOCK OPTIONS, GRANT DATE AND EXERCISE PRICE FOR EACH SECTION 16

OFFICER RECEIVING OPTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED, BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THESE SECTION 16 GRANTS IS THE EARLIER OF (A) THE DATE ON WHICH A FORM 4 (OR OTHER STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN

BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP) WAS FILED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR OFFICERS GRANT OR (B) THE DATE ON WHICH A RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO THAT GRANT WAS ADOPTED AT A MEETING OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OR A DECISION WAS MADE BY THE

CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, IF SO DELEGATED.

FOR OPTION GRANTS WITH STATED GRANT DATES IN OCTOBER 1999 THAT WERE MADE IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ENTRY OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS FOR OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OUR CURRENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (BOTH OF WHOM HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THAT DATE), THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE

MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE DATE ON WHICH THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WERE EXECUTED ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WITH RESPECT TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS WITH A STATED GRANT DATE IN OCTOBER 1999 THAT REPRESENTED THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS NECESSARY TO

EQUAL THE MINIMUM ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT PROVIDED FOR PURSUANT TO EACH SUCH EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE LAST DAY OF 1999, THE CALENDAR YEAR IN WHICH THE COMPANY WAS CONTRACTUALLY

OBLIGATED TO MAKE THE GRANTS.



BROAD-BASED GRANTS

 BETWEEN 1,500 AND 4,000 MIDDLE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES PERIODICALLY AND CUSTOMARILY RECEIVED OPTIONS. AS DESCRIBED IN THE

WILMERHALE REPORT, OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ACTING PURSUANT TO AUTHORITY DELEGATED TO HIM BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, CHOSE THE GRANT DATES AND OVERALL AMOUNTS FOR BROAD-BASED GRANTS AND ULTIMATELY REFLECTED THE BROAD-BASED GRANTS IN

CEO CERTIFICATES.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWED SEPARATE ALLOCATION PROCESSES TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR RECIPIENTS AND

INDIVIDUAL OPTION AMOUNTS OF GRANTS TO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. IN THE MAJORITY OF BROAD-BASED GRANTS, THE PROCESS OF ALLOCATING STOCK OPTION GRANTS AMONG INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES IN BOTH MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR

MANAGEMENT CONTINUED BEYOND THE STATED GRANT DATE. AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL GRANTING ACTIVITIES WERE COMPLETED, THERE WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHANGES TO OPTION AWARDS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE EFFECTIVE

CANCELLATION OF A GRANT BECAUSE OF AN EMPLOYEES TERMINATION, ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR CORRECTIONS, PROMOTION OR INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE REASSESSMENT.

BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR BROAD-BASED GRANTS WAS THE LATER OF THE FOLLOWING TWO DATES: (A) THE DATE ON WHICH THE EVIDENCE IDENTIFIED BY

THE COMPANY INDICATED THAT A COMMUNICATION TO OR FROM OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REFERS TO A PARTICULAR GRANT, OR THE GRANT WAS PRESENTED TO THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OR (B) THE DATE ON WHICH THE ALLOCATION OF THE OPTIONS TO INDIVIDUAL

EMPLOYEES AND GRANT PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROAD-BASED GRANT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE. WHERE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO EVIDENCE EITHER (A) OR (B) ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE TO BE THE

DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY DETERMINED, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THAT THE CEO CERTIFICATE FOR SUCH GRANT WAS LIKELY EXECUTED. WHERE OPTION AWARD AMOUNTS CHANGED SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE THE ALLOCATION PROCESS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, THE

COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT EACH AWARD THAT WAS CHANGED IS A SEPARATE GRANT WITH ITS OWN MEASUREMENT DATE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE THAT THE GRANTING PROCESS WAS NOT COMPLETE.



NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS

 DURING THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PERIOD, THE COMPANY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS TO APPROXIMATELY 2,500 EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION

WITH THEIR HIRE OR PROMOTION (NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS).

FOR NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS MADE PRIOR TO

2002, THE COMPANY TYPICALLY CHOSE GRANT DATES BY DETERMINING THE LOWEST CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN THE DATE OF AN EVENT IN

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE RECRUITMENT OF THE NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEE (E.G., DATE OF FIRST CONTACT, DATE OF AN OFFER LETTER) OR PROMOTION OF THE EMPLOYEE AND THE END OF THE QUARTER IN

WHICH THE EMPLOYEE STARTED WORK OR WAS PROMOTED. AS A RESULT OF THIS PRACTICE, SOME EMPLOYEES RECEIVED STOCK OPTIONS WITH GRANT DATES THAT WERE EARLIER THAN THAT EMPLOYEES START DATE. IN 2002, THE COMPANY CHANGED TO A PRACTICE OF DETERMINING

GRANT DATES FOR NEW HIRES AND PROMOTIONS TO BE THE DATE OF THE LOWEST CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN THE START DATE OF EMPLOYMENT OR DATE OF PROMOTION AND THE END OF THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE STARTED WORK OR WAS

PROMOTED. THE COMPANY HISTORICALLY USED THESE STATED GRANT DATES AS THE MEASUREMENT DATES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY HAS

CONCLUDED THAT THE MEASUREMENT DATES USED WITH RESPECT TO NEARLY ALL OF THE NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS DURING THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PERIOD WERE NOT CORRECT BECAUSE THE COMPANYS PRACTICE WAS TO DETERMINE GRANT DATES WITH THE BENEFIT OF

HINDSIGHT. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR EACH NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANT WAS THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY SET THE TERMS OF THE AWARD OR, IF THE COMPANY COULD NOT IDENTIFY SUCH DATE BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE

EVIDENCE, THE LAST DATE OF THE FISCAL QUARTER IN WHICH A PARTICULAR NEW HIRE OR PROMOTION GRANT WAS MADE.

1999 GRANT OF SUPPLEMENTAL

OPTIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999, FOLLOWING A DECLINE IN ITS STOCK PRICE, THE COMPANY GRANTED SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE 2.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK (17.6 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED

BASIS) TO A BROAD GROUP OF EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OTHER SECTION 16 OFFICERS. THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS WERE GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUSPENSION OF THE VESTING AND EXERCISABILITY OF AN EQUAL NUMBER OF

OPTIONS WITH EXERCISE PRICES ABOVE $46.50 ($5.8125 ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS) THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GRANTED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES (THE SUSPENDED OPTIONS). THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS HAD A STATED GRANT DATE OF OCTOBER 13, 1999 AND AN

EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO $40.125 ($5.0156 ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS).

AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE SUSPENDED OPTIONS, THE

COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT, UNDER APB 25, THE GRANT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS CONSTITUTED AN EFFECTIVE RE-PRICING SUBJECT TO VARIABLE ACCOUNTING FOR EACH OPTION UNTIL EXERCISE, FORFEITURE OR EXPIRATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED

THAT, UNDER FAS 123, THE GRANT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS WAS A MODIFICATION THAT REQUIRED AN INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE CHARGE TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE RELATED VESTING PERIOD.

2000 REACTIVATION OF SUSPENDED OPTIONS.

IN 2000, THE COMPANY REACTIVATED THE VESTING AND EXERCISABILITY OF THE SUSPENDED OPTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT, UNDER APB 25 AND FAS 123, THE

REACTIVATION OF THE VESTING AND EXERCISABILITY OF THE SUSPENDED OPTIONS WAS A NEW STOCK OPTION GRANT THAT SHOULD HAVE HAD A NEW MEASUREMENT DATE, AND THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE DATE GRANTEES WERE AGAIN

PERMITTED TO EXERCISE THEIR PREVIOUSLY VESTED AWARDS.

CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS.

PRIOR TO APRIL 2000, THE COMPANY GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES CERTAIN

STOCK OPTIONS THAT VESTED 100% ON THE SIXTH OR NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT (THE CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE OPTIONS, THE COMPANY COULD ELECT TO ACCELERATE THE VESTING OF ALL OR A PORTION OF THE CLIFF VESTING

OPTIONS AT ITS DISCRETION. THE COMPANY FOLLOWED A POLICY OF ACCELERATING THE VESTING OF A CONSISTENT PERCENTAGE OF THE CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS, UNLESS THE OPTION HOLDER WAS SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR PERFORMING AT A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY

LEVEL. THIS RESULTED IN NEARLY ALL OPTION HOLDERS HAVING THEIR CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS ACCELERATED SO THEY ACTUALLY VESTED AS IF THEY HAD A 20% OR 25% PER YEAR TIME-BASED VESTING SCHEDULE (I.E., A FOUR-YEAR OR FIVE-YEAR VESTING PERIOD).



GRANT OF CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS.

UNDER APB 25, AN AWARD SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PERFORMANCE AWARD IF ITS CLIFF VESTING TERMS ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE

SUBSTANTIVE. BASED ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EVALUATION OF EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATES, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE NINE-YEAR VESTING TERM WAS NOT SUBSTANTIVE IN GRANTS AFTER JANUARY 1995 TO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE

OPTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO VARIABLE ACCOUNTING UNTIL EACH OF THEIR VESTING DATES. WITH RESPECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CLIFF VESTING TERM IS SUBSTANTIVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



ACCELERATION OF CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INTERPRETATION NO. 44, ACCOUNTING

FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING STOCK COMPENSATION (AN INTERPRETATION OF APB OPINION NO. 25) (FIN 44), SUBSEQUENT TO JULY 1, 2000, THE ACCELERATION OF THE SIX- OR NINE-YEAR CLIFF VESTING TERM OF A STOCK OPTION

CONSTITUTED A MODIFICATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE MEASURED THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE AWARD AT THE DATE OF THE MODIFICATION AND RECOGNIZED THIS AMOUNT AS COMPENSATION COST ON THE TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT IF, ABSENT THE ACCELERATION,

THE AWARD WOULD HAVE BEEN FORFEITED PURSUANT TO ITS ORIGINAL TERMS. UNDER FAS 123, THE PERFORMANCE TARGETS WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARD AND THEREFORE THE ACCELERATION OF VESTING WAS NOT

CONSIDERED TO BE A MODIFICATION OF THE TERMS.

OTHER MODIFICATIONS OF OPTION TERMS.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT

CERTAIN OTHER ACTIONS WERE TAKEN THAT RESULTED IN THE MODIFICATION OF OPTION TERMS, AS FOLLOWS.



OPTIONS MODIFIED UPON TERMINATIONS.

ON APPROXIMATELY 75 OCCASIONS FROM 1998 TO 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AMENDED EMPLOYMENT OR SEPARATION AGREEMENTS

WITH EMPLOYEES THAT RESULTED IN THE MODIFICATION OF VESTING OR CANCELLATION TERMS OF THEIR STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS. UNDER APB 25, THE POTENTIAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF THE MODIFICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEASURED AT THE DATE OF THE MODIFICATION AND

RECOGNIZED IF THE EMPLOYEE ULTIMATELY RECEIVED A BENEFIT ON THE TERMINATION DATE. UNDER FAS 123, THE MODIFICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF THE MODIFICATION BASED UPON THE INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEE.



1999 CANCELLATION AND REISSUANCE OF OPTIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999, THE COMPANY ISSUED STOCK OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE AN AGGREGATE OF 400,000 SHARES OF

COMPANY COMMON STOCK (3.2 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS) TO APPROXIMATELY 65 EMPLOYEES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE CANCELLATION OF AN EQUAL NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GRANTED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES AT VARIOUS TIMES EARLIER IN

1999. THE REISSUED STOCK OPTIONS HAD A STATED GRANT DATE OF OCTOBER 13, 1999 AND AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO $40.125 ($5.0156 ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS), WHICH WAS LOWER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE CANCELLED OPTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS

DETERMINED THAT, UNDER APB 25, THIS CONSTITUTED A RE-PRICING, RESULTING IN VARIABLE ACCOUNTING FOR EACH OPTION UNTIL EXERCISE, FORFEITURE OR EXPIRATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT, UNDER FAS 123, THIS WOULD ALSO BE

VIEWED AS A MODIFICATION TO THE AWARD AND THE INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINALLY MEASURED FAIR VALUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

RELATED TAX ADJUSTMENTS.

THE RESTATEMENT IN THIS FORM 10-K ALSO REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF CERTAIN TAX DEDUCTIONS AND ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE

RELATED TO THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS THAT  AS A RESULT OF THE REVISION OF MEASUREMENT DATESNO LONGER QUALIFY AS DEDUCTIBLE PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 162(M).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

NOTE 3 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K SETS FORTH, ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS, THE IMPACT UNDER FAS 123R AND APB 25 OF RECOGNIZING ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND

RELATED TAX EFFECTS AS A RESULT OF HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONDUCTED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO ASSESS HOW THE RESTATEMENT

ADJUSTMENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS FORM 10-K WOULD HAVE CHANGED UNDER TWO ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR DETERMINING MEASUREMENT DATES FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE DURING THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PERIOD. SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PRESENTED IN ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K, FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE INCREMENTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST THAT WOULD RESULT FROM USING ALTERNATE MEASUREMENT DATE DETERMINATION

METHODOLOGIES. SEE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS IN ITEM 7 FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES.

ITEM 9A OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES MANAGEMENTS CONCLUSION, IN LIGHT OF THE FINDINGS OF THE WILMERHALE REPORT AND THE RESTATEMENT REFLECTED IN THIS FORM 10-K AND AS REPORTED IN A CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K

HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY. SEVERAL OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY AMERICHOICE WITH THE HELP OF LEADING RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS AT ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS.

HELP OPTIMIZE THE USE OF APPROPRIATE QUALITY PHARMACEUTICALS AND CONCURRENTLY MANAGE PHARMACY EXPENDITURES TO LEVELS APPROPRIATE TO THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL SITUATIONS. FOR STATE CUSTOMERS, THE AMERICHOICE PERSONAL CARE MODEL MEANS INCREASED ACCESS TO

CARE AND IMPROVED QUALITY FOR THEIR BENEFICIARIES, IN A MEASURABLE SYSTEM THAT REDUCES THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND LOWERS THEIR COSTS.

AMERICHOICE

CONSIDERS A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN DETERMINING IN WHICH STATE PROGRAMS TO PARTICIPATE AND ON WHAT BASIS, INCLUDING THE STATES EXPERIENCE AND CONSISTENCY OF SUPPORT FOR ITS MEDICAID PROGRAM IN TERMS OF SERVICE INNOVATION AND FUNDING, THE

POPULATION BASE IN THE STATE, THE WILLINGNESS OF THE PHYSICIAN/PROVIDER COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE AMERICHOICE PERSONAL CARE MODEL, AND THE PRESENCE OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN PARTNER WITH AMERICHOICE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS

MEMBERS. USING THESE CRITERIA, AMERICHOICE ENTERED THREE NEW MARKETS IN 2006, SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO EXPAND IN ONE EXISTING MARKET IN 2007, AND IS EXAMINING SEVERAL OTHERS. CONVERSELY, IN RECENT YEARS, AMERICHOICE HAS EXITED SEVERAL MARKETS BECAUSE

OF, AMONG OTHER REASONS, THE LACK OF CONSISTENT DIRECTION AND SUPPORT FROM THE SPONSORING STATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

MOST OF OUR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES ARE REGULATED BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT GENERALLY HAVE DISCRETION TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND INTERPRET AND ENFORCE LAWS AND RULES. THIS REGULATION CAN VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE CONTINUALLY BEING CONSIDERED, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES ALSO MAY CHANGE PERIODICALLY. COMPLYING WITH NEW LAWS AND RULES, OR

CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND RULES, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS.

FEDERAL REGULATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REGULATION.

OVATIONS MEDICARE BUSINESS AND AMERICHOICES MEDICAID BUSINESS ARE REGULATED BY CMS. CMS HAS THE RIGHT TO AUDIT PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CMS CONTRACTS AND REGULATIONS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE BEING GIVEN TO MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES. OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENT, THROUGH AMERICHOICE, ALSO HAS MEDICAID AND STATE CHILDRENS HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM CONTRACTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO MEDICAID

ENROLLEES, PAYMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE MANY REGULATIONS SURROUNDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID COMPLIANCE. IN ADDITION, THE PORTION OF INGENIXS BUSINESS THAT INCLUDES CLINICAL RESEARCH IS SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

STATE REGULATION

AMERICHOICE IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE THE PROVISION OF BENEFITS BY AMERICHOICE TO ITS BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, ALL OF THE STATES IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OFFER INSURANCE AND

HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION PRODUCTS REGULATE THOSE PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS. THESE STATES REQUIRE PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS AND ESTABLISH MINIMUM CAPITAL OR RESTRICTED CASH RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

REGULATED UNDER STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS. SUCH REGULATIONS GENERALLY REQUIRE REGISTRATION WITH APPLICABLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE AND THE FILING OF REPORTS THAT DESCRIBE CAPITAL STRUCTURE, OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SOME STATE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ACQUISITIONS AND MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN THE REGULATED COMPANIES AND THEIR PARENT HOLDING COMPANIES OR AFFILIATES. THESE LAWS MAY RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR BUSINESS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO PPO,

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION (MCO), UTILIZATION REVIEW (UR) OR THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR-RELATED REGULATIONS AND LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATIONS DIFFER FROM STATE TO STATE, BUT MAY CONTAIN NETWORK, CONTRACTING, PRODUCT AND RATE, FINANCIAL AND

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR DELIVERY OF SERVICES, PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, FRAUD PREVENTION, PROTECTION OF CONSUMER HEALTH INFORMATION AND COVERED BENEFITS AND SERVICES. OUR PHARMACY ACTIVITIES

ARE GENERALLY REGULATED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND MAY REQUIRE REGISTRATION OR LICENSURE WITH CERTAIN STATE BOARDS OF PHARMACY. ADDITIONALLY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY AND INSURANCE REGULATION AND VARYING ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHIES

IN THE DIFFERENT STATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO STANDARDIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACROSS STATE LINES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PACIFICARE

ACQUISITION, WHICH CLOSED ON DECEMBER 20, 2005, AS TYPICALLY OCCURS IN CONNECTION WITH A TRANSACTION OF THIS SIZE, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO VARIOUS COMMITMENTS WITH STATE REGULATORY DEPARTMENTS, PRINCIPALLY IN CALIFORNIA. WE

BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

HIPAA

THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROVISIONS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996, AS AMENDED (HIPAA), APPLY TO BOTH THE GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS, INCLUDING

SELF-FUNDED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. HIPAA REQUIRES GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS AND CERTAIN ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. IT ALSO REQUIRES GUARANTEED RENEWABILITY FOR MOST EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS AND LIMITS EXCLUSIONS BASED ON

PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. FEDERAL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO HIPAA INCLUDE

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AND CODE SETS, AND FOR THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION. NEW STANDARDS FOR NATIONAL

PROVIDER IDENTIFIERS ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED BY REGULATORS.

ERISA

THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (ERISA), REGULATES HOW GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO OR THROUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF EMPLOYER-SPONSORED HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. ERISA IS A SET OF LAWS AND

REGULATIONS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC INTERPRETATION BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL COURTS. ERISA PLACES CONTROLS ON HOW OUR BUSINESS UNITS MAY DO BUSINESS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO SPONSOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT HEALTH PLANS, PARTICULARLY

THOSE THAT MAINTAIN SELF-FUNDED PLANS. REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RULES FOR CLAIMS PAYMENT AND MEMBER APPEALS UNDER HEALTH CARE PLANS GOVERNED BY ERISA. ADDITIONALLY, SOME STATES REQUIRE LICENSURE OR

REGISTRATION OF COMPANIES PROVIDING THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FOR HEALTH CARE PLANS.

AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS

WE TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN AND ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS,

AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. SUCH GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. WE

ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES BY THE SEC, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND A RELATED REVIEW BY THE SPECIAL LITIGATION

COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY, AND WE HAVE RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS FROM U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 7LEGAL MATTERS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE MINNESOTA ATTORNEY

GENERAL, WE GENERALLY HAVE COOPERATED AND WILL CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THESE REGULATORY INQUIRIES, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES AS WELL AS OTHER SANCTIONS OR

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATION

SOME OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, INCLUDING INGENIXS I3 BUSINESS, HAVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THESE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS,

INCLUDING VARIOUS TAX, TARIFF AND TRADE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INVESTMENT RULES AND LAWS.

COMPETITION

AS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES COMPANY, WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE

MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATORS AND BUSINESS SERVICES OUTSOURCING COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE FORMED NETWORKS TO DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH EMPLOYERS, SPECIALTY BENEFIT PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENT

ENTITIES, DISEASE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, AND VARIOUS HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONSULTING COMPANIES. FOR OUR UNIPRISE AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESSES, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER

PERMANENTE, AND WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER ENTERPRISES CONCENTRATED IN MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. OUR SPECIALIZED CARE

SERVICES AND INGENIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BUSINESSES. NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THESE MARKETS, ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS THAT CAN IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES RELATE TO THE SALES, MARKETING AND PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; PRODUCT INNOVATION; CONSUMER SATISFACTION; THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; CARE DELIVERY; NETWORK

CAPABILITIES; MARKET SHARE; PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OPERATIONS; FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND MARKETPLACE REPUTATION.

JANUARY 1, 2006, RATE INCREASES ON PREMIUM-BASED AND FEE-BASED SERVICES AND GROWTH IN INDIVIDUALS SERVED ACROSS OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF 2006 CONSOLIDATED REVENUE TRENDS FOR EACH OF OUR REVENUE COMPONENTS.

ACQUISITIONS, CONSOLIDATED PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY $8.8 BILLION, OR 21%, OVER 2005. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PREMIUM RATE INCREASES AND THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT DECREASE IN

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OUR COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS.

UNITEDHEALTHCARE PREMIUM REVENUES IN 2006 TOTALED $33.5 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$7.6 BILLION, OR 29%, OVER 2005. EXCLUDING PREMIUM REVENUES FROM BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005, UNITEDHEALTHCARE PREMIUM REVENUES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT COMPARED TO 2005. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AVERAGE NET PREMIUM RATE INCREASES

OF APPROXIMATELY 8% OR ABOVE ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RENEWING COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, OFFSET BY LOWER PREMIUM YIELDS FROM NEW BUSINESS DUE PRIMARILY TO A LARGER PORTION OF NEW CUSTOMER SALES GENERATED FROM HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE LOWER-PREMIUM

PRODUCTS (WITH CORRESPONDINGLY LOWER MEDICAL COSTS), AND A 5% DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS INTERNAL PRICING DECISIONS IN A COMPETITIVE

COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRICING ENVIRONMENT AND THE CONVERSION OF CERTAIN GROUPS TO FEE-BASED PRODUCTS. OVATIONS PREMIUM REVENUES IN 2006 TOTALED $24.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $15.2 BILLION, OR 165%, OVER 2005. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS,

OVATIONS PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $8.3 BILLION, OR 92%, OVER 2005. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, WHICH HAD PREMIUM REVENUES OF $5.7 BILLION FOR 2006, AND AN INCREASE IN

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES ON THESE PRODUCTS. SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES PREMIUM REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION OVER 2005. THIS WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION AND STRONG GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY SEVERAL SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES BUSINESSES UNDER PREMIUM-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. THE REMAINING PREMIUM REVENUE INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM MEMBERSHIP

GROWTH AND PREMIUM REVENUE RATE INCREASES IN AMERICHOICES MEDICAID PROGRAMS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED PREMIUM REVENUE INCREASES OF APPROXIMATELY $278 MILLION, OR 8%, OVER 2005 EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS.

SERVICE REVENUES

SERVICE REVENUES IN 2006 TOTALED $4.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $602 MILLION, OR 16%, OVER

2005. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, SERVICE REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 12% OVER 2005. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AGGREGATE GROWTH OF 8% IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNIPRISE AND

UNITEDHEALTHCARE UNDER FEE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS DURING 2006, AS WELL AS ANNUAL RATE INCREASES. IN ADDITION, INGENIX SERVICE REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 23% DUE TO NEW BUSINESS GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES

AND FROM BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005.

PRODUCT REVENUES

PRODUCT REVENUES IN 2006 TOTALED $737 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$579 MILLION OVER 2005. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PHARMACY REVENUES AT OUR PBM BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN DECEMBER 2005 WITH THE PURCHASE OF PACIFICARE.

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME

INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME DURING 2006 TOTALED $871 MILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $366 MILLION OVER 2005. INTEREST INCOME INCREASED BY $372 MILLION IN 2006, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF

INCREASED LEVELS OF CASH AND FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS DURING THE YEAR, DUE IN PART TO THE ACQUISITION OF PACIFICARE, AS WELL AS HIGHER YIELDS ON FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. NET CAPITAL GAINS ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE $4 MILLION IN 2006, COMPARED

WITH NET CAPITAL GAINS OF $10 MILLION IN 2005.

MEDICAL COSTS

THE COMBINATION OF PRICING, BENEFIT DESIGNS, CONSUMER HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE FACILITATION EFFORTS IS REFLECTED IN THE MEDICAL CARE RATIO (MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES). THE CONSOLIDATED MEDICAL

CARE RATIO INCREASED FROM 80.0% IN 2005 TO 81.2% IN 2006. THIS MEDICAL CARE RATIO INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF PACIFICARE AND LAUNCH OF THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, BOTH OF WHICH CARRY A HIGHER MEDICAL CARE RATIO

THAN THE HISTORIC UNITEDHEALTH GROUP BUSINESSES.

FOR EACH PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF REVISIONS IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED

TO ALL PRIOR PERIODS. CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS, RESULTING FROM MORE COMPLETE CLAIM INFORMATION AND OTHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS

REPORTED FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2006 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $430 MILLION OF FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2005 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION OF FAVORABLE MEDICAL

COST DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. THE INCREASE IN FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN MEDICAL PAYABLES DUE TO ORGANIC GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005.

MEDICAL COSTS FOR 2006 INCREASED $19.6 BILLION, OR 58%, TO $53.3 BILLION, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005, MEDICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE NEW MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM AND A MEDICAL COST TREND OF 7% TO 8% ON COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED BUSINESS. MEDICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM FOR 2006 WERE $4.9 BILLION. MEDICAL TREND WAS DUE TO BOTH MEDICAL INFLATION

AND INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE CONSUMPTION.

OPERATING COSTS

THE OPERATING COST RATIO (OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES) FOR 2006 OF 14.0%, IMPROVED FROM 15.4% IN 2005. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REVENUE MIX CHANGES, WITH PREMIUM REVENUES GROWING AT A FASTER RATE THAN

SERVICE REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEW MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM AND THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION. OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF FEE-BASED REVENUES. THE

DECREASE IN THE OPERATING COST RATIO REFLECTED PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND OTHER COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES, INCLUDING COST SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION INTEGRATION, AND AN INSURANCE RECOVERY OF $43

MILLION. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $22 MILLION CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNITED HEALTH FOUNDATION AND APPROXIMATELY $44 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CASH EXPENSES RELATED TO THE STOCK OPTION REVIEW, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FAS 123R COMPENSATION

EXPENSE.

2006 (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS), GROWTH IN SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES AND INGENIX, GENERAL OPERATING COST INFLATION, AND THE SPECIFIC ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT, COST SAVINGS

ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION INTEGRATIONS AND OTHER COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD

COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD IN 2006 TOTALED $599 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $510 MILLION OVER 2005. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PHARMACY SALES AT OUR PBM BUSINESS, WHICH

WAS ACQUIRED IN DECEMBER 2005 WITH THE PURCHASE OF PACIFICARE.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN 2006 WAS $670 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $217 MILLION, OR 48%, OVER 2005. APPROXIMATELY $85 MILLION OF THIS INCREASE WAS RELATED TO

INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM PACIFICARE AND OTHER BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005. THE REMAINING INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AS A

RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS, BUSINESS GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005.

LAUNCH OF THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, WHICH HAD PREMIUM REVENUES OF $5.7 BILLION FOR 2006, AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES ON THESE PRODUCTS. THE

REMAINING INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES REVENUES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN 8% INCREASE IN AMERICHOICE REVENUES, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY MEMBERSHIP GROWTH AND PREMIUM REVENUE RATE INCREASES ON MEDICAID PRODUCTS.

A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF FEE-BASED REVENUES. ADDITIONALLY, THE DECREASE IN THE OPERATING COST RATIO REFLECTS PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND OTHER

COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES.

REMAINING INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS AND BUSINESS GROWTH.

INCOME TAXES

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 36.3% IN 2005,

COMPARED TO 35.4% IN 2004. THE INCREASE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS OF PRIOR YEAR TAX RETURNS DURING 2004 AND AN INCREASE IN 2005 STATE TAXES.

BILLION IN 2005, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $7.3 BILLION, OR 22%, OVER 2004. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, HEALTH CARE SERVICES REVENUES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION, OR 11%, OVER 2004. UNITEDHEALTHCARE ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION OF THIS INCREASE, DRIVEN BY AVERAGE PREMIUM RATE INCREASES OF APPROXIMATELY 8% TO 9% ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RENEWING COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS. OVATIONS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION TO THE REVENUE

ADVANCE OVER 2004 LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OVATIONS MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS PROVIDED TO AARP MEMBERS AND BY ITS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS RATE INCREASES ON THESE PRODUCTS. THE

REMAINING INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE SERVICES REVENUES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN 8% INCREASE IN AMERICHOICES REVENUES, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PREMIUM REVENUE RATE INCREASES ON MEDICAID PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HEALTH CARE SERVICES EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2005 WERE $3.7 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $976 MILLION, OR

36%, OVER 2004. THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS ON UNITEDHEALTHCARES RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL FEE-BASED PRODUCTS,

AND THE ACQUISITIONS OF OXFORD AND MAMSI DURING 2004. UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL MEDICAL CARE RATIO DECREASED TO 78.6% IN 2005 FROM 79.3% IN 2004 MAINLY DUE TO CHANGES IN PRODUCT, BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER MIX. HEALTH CARE SERVICES 2005

OPERATING MARGIN WAS 9.2%, AN INCREASE FROM 8.2% IN 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY THE LOWER COMMERCIAL MEDICAL CARE RATIO AS WELL AS CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER MIX.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY HEALTH CARE SERVICES, BY MAJOR MARKET SEGMENT AND FUNDING ARRANGEMENT, AS OF DECEMBER 31 (1).

INCLUDES COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED MEMBERSHIP OF 2.34 MILLION, COMMERCIAL FEE-BASED MEMBERSHIP OF 95,000 AND MEDICARE MEMBERSHIP OF 755,000 RELATED TO THE DECEMBER 2005 ACQUISITION OF

PACIFICARE.

THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, EXCLUDING THE

PACIFICARE ACQUISITION, INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 700,000 OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF 590,000 IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH FEE-BASED PRODUCTS DRIVEN BY THE ADDITION OF APPROXIMATELY 335,000 INDIVIDUALS SERVED

RESULTING FROM NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND CUSTOMERS CONVERTING FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS TO FEE-BASED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY 255,000 INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY A BENEFITS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COMPANY ACQUIRED IN DECEMBER 2005. IN

ADDITION, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED WITH COMMERCIAL RISK-BASED PRODUCTS INCREASED BY 110,000 DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE ADDITION OF APPROXIMATELY 130,000 INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PARTNERSHIP, ACQUIRED IN SEPTEMBER 2005, AND A

SLIGHT INCREASE IN NET NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS MORE THAN OFFSET BY CUSTOMERS CONVERTING FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS TO FEE-BASED PRODUCTS.

EXCLUDING THE

PACIFICARE ACQUISITION, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY OVATIONS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCTS INCREASED BY 65,000, OR 20%, OVER 2004 DUE PRIMARILY TO NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. AMERICHOICES MEDICAID ENROLLMENT DECREASED BY 10,000

FROM 2004 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPATION IN ONE MARKET DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS SINCE 2004.

UNIPRISE

UNIPRISE REVENUES IN 2005 WERE $4.9 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $575 MILLION, OR 13%, OVER 2004.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, UNIPRISE REVENUES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 11% OVER 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH OF 7% IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY UNIPRISE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, AND ANNUAL

SERVICE FEE RATE INCREASES FOR SELF-INSURED CUSTOMERS. UNIPRISE SERVED 10.5 MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND 9.9 MILLION INDIVIDUALS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

UNIPRISE EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2005 WERE $740 MILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $116 MILLION, OR 19%, OVER 2004. OPERATING MARGIN FOR 2005 IMPROVED TO 15.1% FROM 14.5% IN 2004. UNIPRISE HAS EXPANDED ITS

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATING MARGIN THROUGH OPERATING COST EFFICIENCIES DERIVED FROM PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT AND COST MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES THAT HAVE

REDUCED LABOR AND OCCUPANCY COSTS IN ITS TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, BILLING AND ENROLLMENT FUNCTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, UNIPRISES INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE SCALED EFFICIENTLY, ALLOWING ITS BUSINESS TO GROW REVENUES AT A

PROPORTIONATELY HIGHER RATE THAN THE ASSOCIATED GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES.

SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES

SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES REVENUES OF $2.8 BILLION INCREASED BY $510 MILLION, OR 22%, OVER 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY AN 11% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY ITS SPECIALTY BENEFIT BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, AND RATE INCREASES RELATED TO THESE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2005 OF $541 MILLION INCREASED $96 MILLION, OR 22%, OVER 2004. SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES OPERATING MARGIN WAS 19.3% IN 2005, DOWN FROM

19.4% IN 2004. THIS DECREASE WAS DUE TO A BUSINESS MIX SHIFT TOWARD HIGHER REVENUE, LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED GAINS IN QUALITY INITIATIVES AND OPERATING COST EFFICIENCIES.

INGENIX

INGENIX 2005 REVENUES OF $807 MILLION INCREASED BY $100

MILLION, OR 14%, OVER 2004. THIS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES AS WELL AS BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2005 WERE $135 MILLION, UP $34 MILLION, OR 34%, FROM 2004. INGENIXS OPERATING MARGIN WAS 16.7% IN 2005, UP FROM 14.3% IN 2004. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING

MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INFORMATION AND CONTRACT RESEARCH BUSINESSES, IMPROVING GROSS MARGINS DUE TO EFFECTIVE COST MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2004.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE MANAGE OUR CASH, INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE SO WE ARE ABLE TO MEET THE

SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS WHILE MAINTAINING STRONG FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIQUIDITY. WE FORECAST, ANALYZE AND MONITOR OUR CASH FLOWS TO ENABLE PRUDENT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND FINANCING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR FINANCIAL

STRATEGY.

OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. A MAJORITY OF THE ASSETS HELD BY OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE IN

THE FORM OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS. AFTER CONSIDERING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE GENERALLY INVEST CASH OF REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED OUR SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS IN LONGER TERM, INVESTMENT-GRADE,

MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT RETURN. FACTORS WE CONSIDER IN MAKING THESE INVESTMENT DECISIONS INCLUDE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED INVESTMENT POLICY, REGULATORY LIMITATIONS, RETURN OBJECTIVES, TAX

IMPLICATIONS, RISK TOLERANCE AND MATURITY DATES. OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR SALE TO MEET SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY AND OTHER NEEDS. CASH IN EXCESS OF THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR REGULATED ENTITIES IS PAID TO THEIR NON-REGULATED PARENT

COMPANIES, TYPICALLY IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS, FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, WHEN AND AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.

OUR NON-REGULATED BUSINESSES

ALSO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FROM OPERATIONS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE. CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THESE ENTITIES, COMBINED WITH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, LONG-TERM DEBT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, FURTHER STRENGTHEN

OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESSES IN THE FORM OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF OUR SERVICES THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, AND TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK, DEPENDING

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON MARKET CONDITIONS. IN AUGUST 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD NOT PURCHASE SHARES UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM UNTIL WE HAD COMPLETED OUR

RESTATEMENT (WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THIS FORM 10-K) AND BECOME CURRENT IN OUR PERIODIC SEC FILINGS. AS A RESULT, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES THROUGH THIS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED PROGRAM FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006.

CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, ARE PRINCIPALLY FROM NET EARNINGS, PRIOR TO DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND OTHER

NON-CASH EXPENSES. AS A RESULT, ANY FUTURE DECLINE IN OUR PROFITABILITY MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. THE LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED INSURED BUSINESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY PREDICT AND PRICE

FOR HEALTH CARE AND OPERATING COST INCREASES. THIS RISK IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY THE DIVERSITY OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF OUR RISK-BASED BUSINESS AND OUR DISCIPLINED UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PROCESSES, WHICH SEEK TO MATCH

PREMIUM RATE INCREASES WITH ESTIMATED FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS. IN 2006, A HYPOTHETICAL UNEXPECTED 1% INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL INSURED MEDICAL COSTS WOULD HAVE REDUCED NET EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION.

THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING IN THE FORM OF DEBT OR EQUITY IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR PROFITABILITY, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, DEBT LEVELS, DEBT RATINGS,

DEBT COVENANTS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND MARKET CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS TOWARD MAINTAINING FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY MITIGATE MUCH OF THIS RISK. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN

RATINGS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING FOR THE COMPANY OR LIMIT THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO CAPITAL. SEE  CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES  CREDIT RATINGS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

CASH AND INVESTMENTS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WERE $6.5 BILLION IN 2006, AN INCREASE OVER $4.1 BILLION IN 2005. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM AN INCREASE OF $1.3 BILLION IN NET INCOME PRIOR TO

DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NONCASH ITEMS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION IN CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES. WE GENERATED

OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES OF $1.6 BILLION IN 2006 AND $412 MILLION IN 2005. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE COMPANY RECEIVING TWELVE MONTHLY MEDICARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS DURING 2006 FROM CMS RATHER THAN

THE ELEVEN MONTHLY PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN 2005, POSITIVELY IMPACTING THE CHANGE IN REPORTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS BY $275 MILLION, ALONG WITH GROWTH IN MEDICAL PAYABLES DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OVERALL GROWTH OF THE INSURED

BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED TAXES PAYABLE DUE LARGELY TO AN INCREASE IN PRE-TAX EARNINGS.

WE MAINTAINED A STRONG FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY POSITION, WITH CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF $20.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. TOTAL CASH AND INVESTMENTS INCREASED BY $5.6 BILLION SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG OPERATING CASH FLOWS, CASH

RECEIVED FROM DEBT AND COMMON STOCK ISSUANCES, AND CASH AND INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED THROUGH BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2006, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, CASH PAID FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

AS FURTHER DESCRIBED UNDER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS THAT

RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION OF OUR $20.6 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES AND WAS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES

IN ADDITION TO OUR STRONG CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE USE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE OPERATING AND

FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, WE HAD COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING OF APPROXIMATELY $7.5 BILLION AND $7.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO WAS 26.4% AND 28.5% AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005,

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESPECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE THE PRUDENT USE OF DEBT OPTIMIZES OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND RETURN ON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WHILE MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE

LIQUIDITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER HAD INTEREST RATES OF APPROXIMATELY 5.3% TO 5.5%.

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT ACQUIRED THE STUDENT INSURANCE DIVISION (STUDENT RESOURCES) OF THE MEGA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE

COMPANY THROUGH AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE ISSUED A 10-YEAR, 5.4% PROMISSORY NOTE FOR APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION AND PAID APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION IN CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR THE NET ASSETS OF STUDENT

RESOURCES.

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006, OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT ACQUIRED JOHN DEERE HEALTH CARE, INC. (JDHC). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PAID APPROXIMATELY $515 MILLION IN CASH, INCLUDING TRANSACTION COSTS, IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF JDHC. WE ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FINANCE THE JDHC PURCHASE PRICE. JDHC HAS BEEN RENAMED UNITEDHEALTHCARE

SERVICES COMPANY OF THE RIVER VALLEY, INC.

ON DECEMBER 20, 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED PACIFICARE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, PACIFICARE

SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED 1.1 SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK AND $21.50 IN CASH FOR EACH SHARE OF PACIFICARE COMMON STOCK THEY OWNED. TOTAL CONSIDERATION ISSUED FOR THE TRANSACTION WAS APPROXIMATELY $8.8 BILLION, COMPOSED OF

APPROXIMATELY 99.2 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK (VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS SHARE CLOSING PRICE FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE, THE DAY OF AND TWO DAYS AFTER THE

ACQUISITION ANNOUNCEMENT DATE OF JULY 6, 2005), APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION IN CASH, $960 MILLION IN CASH PAID TO RETIRE PACIFICARES EXISTING DEBT AND UNITEDHEALTH GROUP VESTED COMMON STOCK OPTIONS WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $420 MILLION ISSUED IN EXCHANGE FOR PACIFICARES OUTSTANDING VESTED COMMON STOCK OPTIONS.

ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2005, OUR HEALTH CARE

SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT ACQUIRED NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PARTNERSHIP (NHP). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PAID APPROXIMATELY $185 MILLION IN CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF NHP. WE ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO

FINANCE THE NHP PURCHASE PRICE.

ON OCTOBER 16, 2006, WE EXECUTED A $7.5 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE

COMPANYS IMMEDIATE AND CONTINUED ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, IF NECESSARY. THE CREDIT FACILITY IS AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AS WELL AS TO PAY OR REPAY ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF THE COMPANY. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENTS

TO THIS CREDIT FACILITY TO PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL TIME TO DELIVER TO THE LENDERS THIS 10-K AND OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR $7.5 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY.

IN MARCH 2006, WE

REFINANCED OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BY ISSUING $650 MILLION OF FLOATING-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2009, $750 MILLION OF 5.3% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2011, $750 MILLION OF 5.4% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2016 AND $850 MILLION OF 5.8% FIXED-RATE

NOTES DUE MARCH 2036. THE FLOATING-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2009 ARE BENCHMARKED TO THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) AND HAD AN INTEREST RATE OF 5.5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

IN DECEMBER 2005, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR $1.0 BILLION FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY SUPPORTING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. WE INCREASED THE CREDIT FACILITY TO $1.3 BILLION AND EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE

TO DECEMBER 2010. WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENTS TO OUR $1.3 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY TO PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL TIME TO DELIVER TO THE LENDERS OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006

AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, TO OBTAIN OUR LENDERS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE DELIVERY OF A NOTICE OF DEFAULT OR NOTICE OF ACCELERATION UNDER ANY INDENTURE OR CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT

IS BEING CONTESTED BY THE COMPANY IN GOOD FAITH DOES NOT CAUSE A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND TO OBTAIN A WAIVER OF ANY POTENTIAL DEFAULT THAT MAY ARISE AS A RESULT OF OUR DETERMINATION THAT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL

INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AND AS A RESULT OF

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR RESTATEMENT OF OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR $1.3 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY.

IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2005, WE ISSUED $2.6 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PACIFICARE

ACQUISITION DESCRIBED ABOVE AND TO RETIRE A PORTION OF THE PACIFICARE DEBT AT THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS TO REFINANCE CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT.

IN OCTOBER 2005, WE EXECUTED A $3.0 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO SUPPORT A $3.0 BILLION INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM IN ORDER TO FINANCE THE CASH PORTION OF THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION. WE

TERMINATED THE 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN MARCH 2006.

IN MARCH 2005, WE ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 4.9% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2015. WE USED THE

PROCEEDS FROM THIS BORROWING FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST COSTS WITH THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE RECEIVED ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO CONVERT THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM A FIXED

RATE TO A VARIABLE RATE. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS HAVE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $4.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WITH VARIABLE RATES THAT ARE BENCHMARKED TO

LIBOR, AND ARE RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY, RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, FOR ALL EXISTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS APPROXIMATELY $73 MILLION. THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR USING THE SHORT-CUT METHOD UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (FAS 133), WHEREBY THE HEDGES ARE REPORTED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

FAIR VALUE, AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT IS ADJUSTED FOR AN OFFSETTING AMOUNT REPRESENTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK. SINCE THESE AMOUNTS COMPLETELY OFFSET, WE HAVE REPORTED BOTH THE SWAP LIABILITY AND THE

DEBT LIABILITY WITHIN DEBT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO NET GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE RATES USED TO ACCRUE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THESE

AGREEMENTS RANGED FROM 4.9% TO 5.7%.

OUR DEBT ARRANGEMENTS AND CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS, THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRE US TO

MAINTAIN A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO (CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) BELOW 50%. AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT

AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS THAT WE OBTAINED FROM OUR LENDERS, WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR DEBT COVENANTS. ON AUGUST 28, 2006 WE RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF DEFAULT FROM PERSONS CLAIMING TO HOLD CERTAIN OF OUR

DEBT SECURITIES ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF OUR INDENTURE GOVERNING OUR DEBT SECURITIES. THIS FOLLOWED OUR ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WOULD DELAY FILING OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. ON OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 2,

2006, WE RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF ACCELERATION FROM THE HOLDERS WHO PREVIOUSLY SENT THE NOTICE OF DEFAULT THAT PURPORTS TO DECLARE AN ACCELERATION OF OUR 5.8% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2036 AS A RESULT OF OUR NOT FILING OUR

QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. OUR INDENTURE REQUIRES US TO PROVIDE TO THE TRUSTEE COPIES OF THE REPORTS WE ARE REQUIRED TO FILE WITH THE SEC, SUCH AS OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS, WITHIN 15 DAYS OF FILING SUCH

REPORTS WITH THE SEC. ON OCTOBER 25, 2006, WE FILED AN ACTION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT FEDERAL COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT WE ARE NOT IN DEFAULT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDENTURE. IMMEDIATELY

PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, WE FILED OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AS WELL AS AN AMENDMENT TO OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2006. SHOULD

THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THIS MATTER, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RETIRE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE $850 MILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 2036. WE INTEND TO PROSECUTE THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION VIGOROUSLY.

PACIFICARE HAD APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION PAR VALUE OF 3% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES (CONVERTIBLE NOTES), WHICH WERE CONVERTIBLE INTO

APPROXIMATELY 5.2 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS COMMON STOCK AND $102 MILLION OF CASH AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005, WE INITIATED A CONSENT SOLICITATION TO ALL OF THE HOLDERS OF OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES

PURSUANT TO WHICH WE OFFERED TO COMPENSATE ALL HOLDERS WHO ELECTED

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO CONVERT THEIR NOTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING TERMS AND CONSENT TO AN AMENDMENT TO A COVENANT IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE

COMPENSATION CONSISTED OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST THROUGH OCTOBER 18, 2007, THE EARLIEST REDEMPTION DATE, PLUS A PRO RATA SHARE OF $1 MILLION. ON JANUARY 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY 91% OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE TENDERED PURSUANT TO

THE OFFER, FOR WHICH WE ISSUED 4.8 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK, VALUED AT $282 MILLION, AND CASH OF $93 MILLION.

OUR SENIOR

DEBT IS RATED A WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY STANDARD & POORS (S&P), A WITH A NEGATIVE WATCH BY FITCH, AND A3 WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY MOODYS. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER IS RATED A-1

WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY S&P, F-1 WITH A NEGATIVE WATCH BY FITCH, AND P-2 WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY MOODYS. MOODYS DOWNGRADED OUR RATING IN OCTOBER 2006 CITING CONCERNS ABOUT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FOLLOWING

THE RELEASE OF THE WILMERHALE REPORT (SEE NOTE 3 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS MOODYS DOWNGRADE TO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR BORROWING CAPACITY OR COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR DEBT OR

COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BORROWING CAPACITY AND COSTS. SEE   CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES  CREDIT RATINGS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, WE MAINTAIN A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON VOLUME, PRICING AND TIMING. THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED EXPIRATION DATE FOR THE PROGRAM. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE REPURCHASED 40.2 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $56

PER SHARE AND AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 136.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

PROGRAM IS DISCRETIONARY AS WE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REPURCHASE SHARES. WE REPURCHASE SHARES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS A PRUDENT USE OF CAPITAL. THE COMPANY SUSPENDED PURCHASES UNDER ITS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006

PENDING COMPLETION OF OUR RESTATEMENT (WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THIS FORM 10-K) AND BECOMING CURRENT IN OUR PERIODIC SEC FILINGS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO RESUME ITS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2007.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE $1.0 BILLION REMAINING UNDER OUR UNIVERSAL S-3 SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT (FOR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT SECURITIES AND OTHER SECURITIES),

ALTHOUGH WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ISSUE SECURITIES ON FORM S-3 ON A PRIMARY BASIS UNTIL WE HAVE TIMELY FILED ALL REPORTS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC FOR A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD. WE MAY OFFER SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME AT PRICES AND TERMS TO BE

DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF OFFERING. UNDER OUR S-4 ACQUISITION SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WE HAVE REMAINING ISSUING CAPACITY OF 48.6 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. WE FILED A SEPARATE S-4

REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE 99.2 MILLION SHARES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DECEMBER 2005 ACQUISITION OF PACIFICARE DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY.

WE COMMITTED TO MAKE $50 MILLION IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS, WHICH HAS BEEN ACCRUED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ADDITIONALLY, WE AGREED TO INVEST $200 MILLION IN CALIFORNIAS HEALTH

CARE INFRASTRUCTURE TO FURTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND INVESTMENTS ARE AT OUR DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO THE ADVICE AND OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES; HOWEVER, OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THE INVESTMENT COMMITMENT FULLY FUNDED BY THE END OF 2010. THE INVESTMENT COMMITMENT REMAINS IN PLACE FOR 20 YEARS AFTER FULL FUNDING. WE HAVE COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS TOTALING $12 MILLION

OF THE $50 MILLION CHARITABLE COMMITMENT AT THIS TIME.

DUE TO THE FINANCIAL RESTATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN

OPTIONS EXERCISED BY NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES IN 2006 WERE DISCOUNT OPTIONS SUBJECT TO SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY NOTIFIED THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) ON FEBRUARY 28, 2007 THAT IT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE

IRSS RESOLUTION PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO PAY ITS EMPLOYEES ADDITIONAL TAX COSTS UNDER SECTION 409A. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY WILL TAKE A CHARGE, NET OF TAX BENEFIT, OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR COMMITMENTS THAT REQUIRE CASH RESOURCES; HOWEVER,

WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS. THIS INCLUDES INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS, AND MAY INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS.

MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN SERVING AS A PLAN

SPONSOR OFFERING MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDER A CONTRACT WITH CMS. THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH CMS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. UNDER MEDICARE PART D, MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO A STANDARD DRUG BENEFIT THAT FEATURES A MONTHLY

PREMIUM, TYPICALLY WITH AN INITIAL ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE, COINSURANCE OF 25% FOR THE MEMBER AND 75% FOR THE COMPANY UP TO AN INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT OF $2,250 OF ANNUAL DRUG COSTS, NO INSURANCE COVERAGE BETWEEN $2,250 AND $5,100 (EXCEPT THE MEMBER GETS

THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT DRUG DISCOUNTS), AND CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE FOR ANNUAL DRUG COSTS IN EXCESS OF $5,100 COVERED APPROXIMATELY 80% BY CMS, 15% BY THE COMPANY AND 5% BY THE MEMBER UP TO AN ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM OF

$3,600.

THE COMPANYS CONTRACT WITH CMS INCLUDES RISK-SHARING PROVISIONS, WHEREIN CMS RETAINS APPROXIMATELY 75% TO 80% OF THE LOSSES OR PROFITS

OUTSIDE A PRE-DEFINED RISK CORRIDOR. THE RISK-SHARING PROVISIONS TAKE EFFECT IF ACTUAL PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS ARE MORE THAN 2.5% ABOVE OR BELOW EXPECTED COST LEVELS AS SUBMITTED BY THE COMPANY IN ITS INITIAL CONTRACT APPLICATION.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2006, MEMBERS WERE PERMITTED TO ENROLL OR DISENROLL IN A MEDICARE PART D PLAN UNTIL MAY 15, 2006. ONCE

ENROLLED, MOST MEMBERS WERE ALLOWED TO SWITCH PLANS ONCE BEFORE MAY 15, 2006 (ALTHOUGH LOW-INCOME MEMBERS ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE PLANS MONTHLY). CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY NON-CANCELABLE BY ENROLLEES AFTER

MAY 15, 2006. AFTER THAT DATE, ENROLLEES MAY CHANGE PLANS ONCE EVERY YEAR BETWEEN NOVEMBER 15 AND DECEMBER 31 TO TAKE EFFECT JANUARY 1 OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

AS A RESULT OF THE MEDICARE PART D BENEFIT DESIGN, THE COMPANY INCURS BENEFIT COSTS UNEVENLY DURING THE ANNUAL CONTRACT YEAR. WHILE THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A MAJORITY OF A MEDICARE MEMBERS DRUG COSTS UP

TO $2,250, THE MEMBER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DRUG COSTS FROM $2,250 UP TO $5,100 (AT THE COMPANYS DISCOUNTED PURCHASE PRICE). AS SUCH, THE COMPANY INCURS DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER BENEFIT CLAIMS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE CONTRACT YEAR AS

COMPARED WITH LAST HALF OF THE CONTRACT YEAR, WHEN COMPARATIVELY MORE MEMBERS WILL BE INCURRING CLAIMS ABOVE THE $2,250 INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY ALSO INCURS COSTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ANNUAL PHARMACY CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF $5,100,

THESE COSTS REPRESENT A MUCH SMALLER PORTION OF TOTAL CONTRACT COSTS, AND WILL BE INCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THE UNEVEN TIMING OF MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFIT CLAIMS RESULTS IN LOSSES IN THE FIRST HALF OF YEAR THAT

ENTITLE THE COMPANY TO RISK-SHARE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS FROM CMS. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THE CONTRACT YEAR WE RECORD A NET RISK-SHARE RECEIVABLE FROM CMS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND A

CORRESPONDING RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT IN PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. THIS REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT PAYABLE BY CMS TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE RISK-SHARE CONTRACT PROVISIONS IF THE PROGRAM WERE

TERMINATED BASED ON ESTIMATED COSTS INCURRED THROUGH THAT INTERIM PERIOD. THOSE LOSSES REVERSE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND FINAL RISK-SHARE AMOUNTS DUE TO OR FROM CMS, IF ANY, ARE SETTLED APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CONTRACT YEAR-END.

THE PROJECTED NET RISK-SHARE PAYABLE TO BE PAID TO CMS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION.

AARP

IN JANUARY 1998, WE ENTERED INTO A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT WITH AARP TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF AARP. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE

PROVIDED TO SUPPLEMENT BENEFITS COVERED UNDER TRADITIONAL MEDICARE (MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE), HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE, HEALTH INSURANCE FOCUSED ON PERSONS BETWEEN 50 TO 64 YEARS OF AGE, AND OTHER PRODUCTS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS MEDICARE

SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE CONTRACT, WE ARE COMPENSATED FOR TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND OTHER SERVICES AS WELL AS FOR ASSUMING UNDERWRITING RISK. WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO COMPLEMENT THE INSURANCE OFFERINGS UNDER THIS

PROGRAM. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM THESE AARP SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH INSURANCE OFFERINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY $5.0 BILLION IN 2006, $4.9 BILLION IN 2005 AND $4.5 BILLION IN 2004.

THE UNDERWRITING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE BUSINESS ARE DIRECTLY RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO A RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF). THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE

UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE PREMIUM REVENUE, MEDICAL COSTS, INVESTMENT INCOME, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. UNDERWRITING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF AND

ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS, UNLESS CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES WERE TO EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF. TO THE EXTENT UNDERWRITING LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, WE WOULD HAVE TO FUND THE DEFICIT. ANY DEFICIT WE FUND

COULD BE RECOVERED BY UNDERWRITING GAINS IN FUTURE PERIODS OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FUND ANY UNDERWRITING DEFICITS. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE RSF BALANCE IS REPORTED

IN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE BELIEVE THE RSF BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 IS CURRENTLY SUFFICIENT TO COVER POTENTIAL FUTURE UNDERWRITING AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT.

UNDER A SEPARATE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH AARP, WE SELL MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT PLANS UNDER THE AARP BRAND NAME. WE ASSUME ALL OPERATIONAL AND

UNDERWRITING RISKS AND LOSSES FOR THESE PLANS.

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS

(NAIC). THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER

DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A REGULATED SUBSIDIARY, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS LIMITED BASED ON THE ENTITYS LEVEL

OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. WE MAINTAIN AN AGGREGATE STATUTORY CAPITAL LEVEL FOR OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM LEVEL REGULATORS REQUIRE.

IN 2006, BASED ON 2005 STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS LEVELS, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS WHICH COULD BE PAID WITHOUT PRIOR REGULATORY

APPROVAL WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANYS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES PAID OVER $2.5 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION OF SPECIAL DIVIDENDS

APPROVED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS.

THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANYS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES WOULD IMPACT

THE SCALE TO WHICH WE COULD REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, THE INABILITY TO PAY REGULATED DIVIDENDS COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO REPAY OUR

DEBT; HOWEVER, OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES GENERATED FROM OUR NON-REGULATED BUSINESSES GREATLY MITIGATE THIS RISK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION OF OUR $20.6 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY

NON-REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CHALLENGING, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE THEY MUST ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS

OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVE JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SENSITIVE TO RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND

CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MEDICAL COSTS

EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE OUR

OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE EITHER NOT YET RECEIVED OR PROCESSED CLAIMS, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP

ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM

BACKLOGS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. DEPENDING ON THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND TYPE OF SERVICE, THE TYPICAL BILLING LAG FOR SERVICES CAN RANGE FROM TWO TO 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF

SERVICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO MEDICAL CARE SERVICES ARE KNOWN AND SETTLED WITHIN NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SERVICE. WE ESTIMATE LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF

POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES.

EACH PERIOD, WE RE-EXAMINE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS

PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE LIABILITY ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS BECOME MORE EXACT, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES, AND INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN

MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS. IF THE

REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WILL DECREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). IF THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF PRIOR PERIOD MEDICAL COSTS IS MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS

ESTIMATE, WE WILL INCREASE REPORTED MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT). HISTORICALLY, THE NET IMPACT OF ESTIMATE DEVELOPMENTS HAS REPRESENTED LESS THAN 1% OF ANNUAL MEDICAL COSTS, LESS THAN 5% OF ANNUAL EARNINGS FROM

OPERATIONS AND LESS THAN 4% OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE.

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES, WE APPLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATION METHODS DEPENDING ON THE MONTH FOR WHICH

INCURRED CLAIMS ARE BEING ESTIMATED. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ACTUARIALLY CALCULATE COMPLETION FACTORS USING AN ANALYSIS OF CLAIM ADJUDICATION PATTERNS OVER THE MOST RECENT 36-MONTH PERIOD. A COMPLETION FACTOR IS AN ACTUARIAL ESTIMATE, BASED UPON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, OF THE PERCENTAGE OF INCURRED CLAIMS DURING A GIVEN PERIOD THAT HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED BY THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE OF ESTIMATION. FOR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE APPLY THE COMPLETION FACTORS TO ACTUAL CLAIMS

ADJUDICATED-TO-DATE IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF ULTIMATE INCURRED CLAIMS FOR THOSE MONTHS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT COMPLETION FACTORS ARE A RELIABLE BASIS FOR ESTIMATING CLAIMS INCURRED FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS AS THERE IS

TYPICALLY INSUFFICIENT CLAIM DATA AVAILABLE FOR THOSE MONTHS TO CALCULATE CREDIBLE COMPLETION FACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS, WE ESTIMATE CLAIM COSTS INCURRED PRIMARILY BY APPLYING OBSERVED MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS TO THE

AVERAGE PER MEMBER PER MONTH (PMPM) MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED IN PRIOR MONTHS FOR WHICH MORE COMPLETE CLAIM DATA IS AVAILABLE, SUPPLEMENTED BY A REVIEW OF NEAR-TERM COMPLETION FACTORS. MEDICAL COST TREND FACTORS ARE DEVELOPED THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE

ANALYSIS OF CLAIMS INCURRED IN PRIOR MONTHS FOR WHICH MORE COMPLETE CLAIM DATA IS AVAILABLE AND BY REVIEWING A BROAD SET OF HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION INDICATORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PHARMACY UTILIZATION TRENDS, INPATIENT HOSPITAL CENSUS DATA

AND INCIDENCE DATA FROM THE NATIONAL CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. WE ALSO CONSIDER COMPLETION FACTORS IN DEVELOPING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTHS. THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

COMPLETION FACTORS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS WE USE IN DEVELOPING OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR OLDER PERIODS, GENERALLY PERIODS PRIOR TO THE MOST

RECENT THREE MONTHS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE FACTORS AND THE ESTIMATED POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES FOR THOSE PERIODS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006.

EXPERIENCE IN ESTIMATING ITS LIABILITIES FOR INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED BENEFIT CLAIMS.

IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST

ESTIMATES FOR ANY PARTICULAR DISCRETE PERIOD, ONE SHOULD CONSIDER BOTH THE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD PERTAINING TO PRIOR PERIODS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS PERTAINING TO THE CURRENT

NOT YET DETERMINABLE AS THE AMOUNT OF PRIOR PERIOD DEVELOPMENT RECORDED IN 2007 WILL CHANGE AS OUR DECEMBER 31, 2006 MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATE DEVELOPS THROUGHOUT 2007.

OUR ESTIMATE OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE COMPANYS LIABILITY FOR UNPAID MEDICAL COSTS AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, DEVELOPED USING CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACTUARIAL METHODS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE IS REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE TO COVER THE COMPANYS LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006; HOWEVER, ACTUAL CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES. THE INCREASE IN FAVORABLE MEDICAL COST DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN THE SIZE OF THE MEDICAL COST BASE AND RELATED MEDICAL PAYABLES DUE TO ORGANIC

GROWTH AND BUSINESSES ACQUIRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2005. AS OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATE INCREASES IN AMOUNT DUE TO INCREASES IN THE FULLY INSURED CONSUMER BASE AND INFLATIONARY INCREASES IN MEDICAL COSTS, THE ABSOLUTE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF

SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THAT ESTIMATE WILL INCREASE EVEN IF THE ACCURACY OF OUR MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATE REMAINS CONSISTENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE. ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL 1% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR DECEMBER 31, 2006

ESTIMATES OF MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, EXCLUDING THE AARP BUSINESS, 2006 EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BY $71 MILLION AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BY $0.03

PER SHARE.

HISTORIC STOCK OPTION MEASUREMENT DATES

THE SELECTION BY THE COMPANY OF THE METHODOLOGIES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO DETERMINE THE MEASUREMENT DATES OF HISTORIC STOCK OPTION GRANTS INVOLVED JUDGMENT AND CAREFUL EVALUATION OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EACH HISTORICAL GRANT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS USED THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY ALSO CONDUCTED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO ASSESS HOW THE RESTATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS WOULD HAVE CHANGED

UNDER TWO ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR DETERMINING MEASUREMENT DATES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE INCREMENTAL EFFECT ON EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM USING THE ALTERNATE MEASUREMENT DATE DETERMINATION METHODOLOGIES

DESCRIBED BELOW.



COMMUNICATION DATE.

THIS METHODOLOGY WOULD SELECT AS THE MEASUREMENT DATE THE DATE ON WHICH STOCK OPTION GRANTS WERE COMMUNICATED TO

EMPLOYEES, ASSUMING THAT THE COMMUNICATION DATE IS READILY

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IDENTIFIABLE. THIS WAS GENERALLY THE DATE ON WHICH STOCK OPTION AWARDS BECAME VIEWABLE BY ALL OPTIONEES ON THE COMPANYS INTRANET PORTAL FOR EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS. IN THE EVENT THE COMMUNICATION DATE WAS NOT READILY AVAILABLE, WITH RESPECT TO SECTION 16 OFFICERS, THIS ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY WOULD SELECT AS THE MEASUREMENT DATE THE DATE ON WHICH A SECTION 16 OFFICER FILED A FORM 4 (OR OTHER

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP) WITH RESPECT TO A SPECIFIC GRANT AND, FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT SECTION 16 OFFICERS, THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CEO CERTIFICATE WAS LIKELY EXECUTED BY THE FORMER CEO OF

THE COMPANY.



LEGAL EXECUTION DATE.

THIS METHODOLOGY WOULD SELECT AS THE MEASUREMENT DATE THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE

LEGAL DOCUMENTATION APPROVING A GRANT WAS LIKELY EXECUTED, BASED ON EVALUATION OF ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION. FOR SECTION 16 OFFICERS, THIS DATE IS TYPICALLY THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE WRITTEN ACTION OF THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WAS LIKELY EXECUTED BY A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND, FOR ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES, THIS DATE IS TYPICALLY THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CEO CERTIFICATE WAS LIKELY EXECUTED BY

THE FORMER CEO OF THE COMPANY.

REVENUES

REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY DERIVED FROM HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS. WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE TYPICALLY BILLED MONTHLY AT A CONTRACTED RATE

PER ELIGIBLE PERSON MULTIPLIED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES, AS RECORDED IN OUR RECORDS. EMPLOYER GROUPS GENERALLY PROVIDE US WITH CHANGES TO THEIR ELIGIBLE POPULATION ONE MONTH IN ARREARS. EACH BILLING INCLUDES AN

ADJUSTMENT FOR PRIOR MONTH CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY STATUS THAT WERE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR PREVIOUS BILLING. WE ESTIMATE AND ADJUST THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ACCORDINGLY. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS,

PREMIUMS BILLED, THE LEVEL OF CONTRACT RENEWAL ACTIVITY AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. WE REVISE ESTIMATES OF REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS EACH PERIOD AND RECORD CHANGES IN THE PERIOD THEY BECOME KNOWN.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, OF $20.6 BILLION. WE REVIEW OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, AND WE REVIEW

OUR REMAINING LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS AND CHANGES IN

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE WE MIGHT NOT RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ASSESS THEIR RECOVERABILITY, WE

MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE UTILITY AND ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IN TURN ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING MARGINS. IF THESE

ESTIMATES OR THEIR RELATED ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT

OCCURS.

INVESTMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $10.3 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY HELD IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. WE EXCLUDE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE FROM EARNINGS AND REPORT THEM TOGETHER, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR INVESTMENTS HAD GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS OF $79 MILLION AND GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $53 MILLION. IF ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, BASED ON

ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT FACTORS, WE RECORD A REALIZED LOSS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS INVOLVED IN EVALUATING WHETHER A DECLINE IN AN INVESTMENTS FAIR VALUE IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. WE ANALYZE RELEVANT

FACTORS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY

INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT TIME IN ORDER TO ENABLE RECOVERY OF OUR COST. NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE THESE JUDGMENTS. WE REVISE IMPAIRMENT

JUDGMENTS WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN OR WHEN WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HOLDING THE INVESTMENT UNTIL RECOVERY AND RECORD ANY RESULTING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AT THAT TIME. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR

INDUSTRY AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE ROUTINELY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS

DISPUTES, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS. OUR ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL AND ARE BASED

UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERING OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, IF ANY, FOR SUCH MATTERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR

ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS. SEE  CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE RISKS RELATED TO OUR PENDING REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND LITIGATION.

INFLATION

THE CURRENT NATIONAL HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION RATE

SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE GENERAL INFLATION RATE. WE USE VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO LESSEN THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION. THESE INCLUDE SETTING COMMERCIAL PREMIUMS BASED ON ANTICIPATED HEALTH CARE COSTS AND COORDINATING CARE WITH PHYSICIANS

AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, WE EMPHASIZE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE, APPROPRIATE USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, EDUCATION AND CLOSING

GAPS IN CARE.

WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

SUCCESSFUL. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, NEW HEALTH CARE AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, DEMANDS FROM PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS, MAJOR EPIDEMICS, AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS MAY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION. BECAUSE OF THE NARROW OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN MEDICAL COST TRENDS THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED IN ESTABLISHING PREMIUM RATES CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

LEGAL MATTERS RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES

REGULATORY INQUIRIES

IN MARCH 2006, WE RECEIVED AN INFORMAL INQUIRY FROM THE SEC RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES.

ON MAY 17, 2006, WE RECEIVED A DOCUMENT REQUEST FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATING TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND OTHER COMPENSATION FOR THE

PERSONS WHO FROM 2003 TO THE PRESENT WERE THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN OUR ANNUAL PROXY STATEMENTS.

ON MAY 17, 2006, WE RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM

THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM 1999 TO THE PRESENT RELATING TO OUR STOCK OPTION PRACTICES.

ON

JUNE 6, 2006, WE RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM JANUARY 1, 1997 TO THE PRESENT CONCERNING OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. AFTER FILING AN ACTION IN

RAMSEY COUNTY COURT, STATE OF MINNESOTA, CAPTIONED

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED VS. STATE OF MINNESOTA, BY LORI SWANSON, ATTORNEY GENERAL

, WE FILED A MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER WHICH WAS DENIED BY THE TRIAL COURT. WE ARE PURSUING AN

APPEAL OF THE ORDER DENYING THE PROTECTIVE ORDER.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2006, WE RECEIVED FROM THE STAFF OF THE SEC ENFORCEMENT DIVISION A FORMAL ORDER OF

INVESTIGATION INTO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES.

WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS FROM U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVES.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE MINNESOTA

ATTORNEY GENERAL, WE HAVE GENERALLY COOPERATED AND WILL CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THESE REGULATORY INQUIRIES, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, AS WELL AS OTHER

SANCTIONS OR OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL.

LITIGATION MATTERS

ON MARCH 29, 2006, THE FIRST OF SEVERAL SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS WAS FILED AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. THE ACTION HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH SIX OTHER ACTIONS AND IS CAPTIONED

IN RE UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION

GENERALLY ALLEGES THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE COMPANY, WERE UNJUSTLY ENRICHED, AND VIOLATED THE SECURITIES LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED

THE POWER TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS RAISED IN THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS AND A SHAREHOLDER DEMAND, AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE COMPANYS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES SHOULD BE PURSUED. BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF OUR SPECIAL LITIGATION COMMITTEE, DEFENDANTS

ON AUGUST 28, 2006, WE RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF DEFAULT FROM PERSONS CLAIMING TO HOLD CERTAIN OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF OUR INDENTURE

GOVERNING OUR DEBT SECURITIES. THIS FOLLOWS OUR ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WOULD DELAY FILING OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. ON OCTOBER 25, 2006, WE FILED AN ACTION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

MILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 2036. WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY PROSECUTE THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION.

OTHER LEGAL MATTERS

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE

OFFERINGS. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM THESE MATTERS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND

CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES.

BEGINNING IN 1999, A SERIES OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST BOTH UNITEDHEALTHCARE

AND PACIFICARE, AND VIRTUALLY ALL MAJOR ENTITIES IN THE HEALTH BENEFITS BUSINESS. IN DECEMBER 2000, A MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL LITIGATION CASES INVOLVING THE COMPANY AND OUR AFFILIATES IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF

FLORIDA, MIAMI DIVISION. GENERALLY, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF ERISA AND THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED CORRUPT ORGANIZATION ACT (RICO) IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED UNDISCLOSED POLICIES INTENDED TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS. OTHER

ALLEGATIONS INCLUDE BREACH OF STATE PROMPT PAYMENT LAWS AND BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO TIMELY REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES RENDERED. THE CONSOLIDATED SUITS SEEK INJUNCTIVE, COMPENSATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF AS WELL AS

RESTITUTION, COSTS, FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND THAT ORDER WAS REVIEWED BY THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE CLASS

ACTION STATUS OF THE RICO CLAIMS, BUT REVERSED AS TO THE

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BREACH OF CONTRACT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT AND PROMPT PAYMENT CLAIMS. DURING THE COURSE OF THE LITIGATION, THERE HAVE BEEN CO-DEFENDANT SETTLEMENTS. ON

JANUARY 31, 2006, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED ALL REMAINING CLAIMS AGAINST PACIFICARE, AND ON JUNE 19, 2006, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED ALL REMAINING CLAIMS AGAINST UNITEDHEALTHCARE BROUGHT BY THE LEAD PLAINTIFF. THE TAG-ALONG LAWSUITS REMAIN

OUTSTANDING. ON JULY 27, 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS CHALLENGING THE DISMISSAL OF THE CLAIMS AGAINST UNITEDHEALTHCARE. WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THE ACTION.

ON MARCH 15, 2000, THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK. ON

APRIL 13, 2000, WE REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THE SUIT ALLEGES CAUSES OF ACTION BASED ON ERISA, AS WELL AS BREACH OF CONTRACT AND THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR

DEALING, DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES, AND TRADE LIBEL IN CONNECTION WITH THE CALCULATION OF REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON-NETWORK PROVIDERS. THE SUIT SEEKS DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE AND COMPENSATORY RELIEF AS WELL AS COSTS,

FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 25, 2000, WHICH ALLEGED TWO CLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS, AN ERISA CLASS AND A NON-ERISA CLASS. AFTER THE COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN ERISA CLAIMS AND THE CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE AMERICAN

MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON JANUARY 11, 2002. ON OCTOBER 25, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON MAY 21, 2003, WE FILED A

COUNTERCLAIM COMPLAINT IN THIS MATTER ALLEGING ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS AGAINST THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND ASSERTING CLAIMS BASED ON IMPROPER BILLING PRACTICES AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER PLAINTIFF. ON MAY 26, 2004, WE FILED A MOTION

FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT SEEKING THE DISMISSAL OF CERTAIN CLAIMS AND PARTIES BASED, IN PART, DUE TO LACK OF STANDING. ON JULY 16, 2004, PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, SEEKING TO ASSERT RICO VIOLATIONS. ON

DECEMBER 29, 2006, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT. WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THE ACTION.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES OR EQUITY PRICES. THE COMPANYS PRIMARY MARKET RISK IS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAT COULD IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM DEBT.

APPROXIMATELY $20.3 BILLION OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WERE DEBT SECURITIES. ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL AND IMMEDIATE 1% INCREASE OR

DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS WOULD DECREASE OR INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $337 MILLION. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO

LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR INDUSTRY AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE.

TO MITIGATE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH THE INTEREST RATES OF OUR

LONG-TERM DEBT WITH THOSE OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY $6.1 BILLION OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT HAD VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST AND APPROXIMATELY

$1.4 BILLION HAD FIXED RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. A HYPOTHETICAL 1% INCREASE OR DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD $312 MILLION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, A PORTION OF WHICH WERE HELD BY OUR UNITEDHEALTH CAPITAL BUSINESS IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC

COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE OR TECHNOLOGY STOCKS WILL LIKEWISE IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SUCH AS MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY SUBJECT UNITEDHEALTH GROUP TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. OUR INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE MANAGED UNDER

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AN INVESTMENT POLICY AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THIS POLICY LIMITS THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE INVESTED IN ANY ONE ISSUER AND GENERALLY LIMITS OUR

INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE LIMITED DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYER GROUPS THAT CONSTITUTE OUR CUSTOMER BASE. AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 5 OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE HAVE AN AGGREGATE $2.0 BILLION REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF OUR LIFE AND ANNUITY

BUSINESS. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORD THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AMOUNTS ARE DEEMED PROBABLE OF RECOVERY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES

MATTERS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, INCLUDING REGULATORY INQUIRIES, LITIGATION MATTERS, DOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, AND POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL CASH AND NONCASH CHARGES

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

AS DESCRIBED IN THE EXPLANATORY NOTE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PART I, ITEM 1, AND IN NOTE 3

RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K, IN EARLY 2006, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INITIATED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION PRACTICES FROM

1994 TO 2005. THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED BY THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, WILMERHALE, AND INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING ADVISORS. ON OCTOBER 15, 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE AND

WILMERHALE HAD COMPLETED THEIR REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND REPORTED THE FINDINGS TO THE NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT OF OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, WE RESTATED, IN THIS FORM 10-K, OUR

PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY INQUIRIES, LITIGATION MATTERS AND CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADES, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CASH AND NONCASH CHARGES, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON US.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORY INQUIRIES

THE SEC IS CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. IN MAY 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATING TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND OTHER

COMPENSATION FOR THE PERSONS WHO FROM 2003 TO THE PRESENT WERE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE COMPANYS ANNUAL PROXY STATEMENTS. WE ALSO RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IN MAY 2006 REQUESTING

DOCUMENTS FROM 1999 TO THE PRESENT RELATING TO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM JANUARY 1, 1997 TO

THE PRESENT CONCERNING THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED DOCUMENT REQUESTS FROM U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE ISSUES. WE HAVE NOT RESOLVED ANY OF THESE

MATTERS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ADVERSE PUBLICITY, REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, AS WELL AS OTHER SANCTIONS OR OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OR ADVERSE CUSTOMER REACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH

THESE MATTERS. SEE ITEM 7  LEGAL MATTERS FOR A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THESE INQUIRIES AND DOCUMENT REQUESTS.

LITIGATION

MATTERS

WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE DEFENDANTS IN A CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL SECURITIES CLASS ACTION, AN ERISA

CLASS ACTION, AND STATE AND FEDERAL SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTIONS RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. WE ALSO HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL SHAREHOLDER DEMANDS RELATING TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS

DESIGNATED AN UNAFFILIATED SPECIAL LITIGATION COMMITTEE, CONSISTING OF TWO FORMER MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS RAISED IN THE DERIVATIVE ACTIONS AND SHAREHOLDER DEMANDS, AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIMS SHOULD BE

PURSUED.

IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING OUR ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WOULD DELAY FILING OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2006, WE

RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF DEFAULT FROM PERSONS CLAIMING TO HOLD CERTAIN OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF THE INDENTURE GOVERNING OUR DEBT SECURITIES. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE FILED AN ACTION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

MINNESOTA, SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT IN DEFAULT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDENTURE. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF ACCELERATION FROM THESE HOLDERS WHO PREVIOUSLY SENT THE NOTICE OF DEFAULT THAT

PURPORTS TO DECLARE AN ACCELERATION OF THE COMPANYS 5.80% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2036, OF WHICH AN AGGREGATE OF $850 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IS OUTSTANDING.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEPARTURE OF WILLIAM W. MCGUIRE, M.D., OUR FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WE RECEIVED AN ORDER FROM THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA IN NOVEMBER 2006 GRANTING

A JOINT MOTION FOR TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF MADE BY PLAINTIFFS AND DR. MCGUIRE. ACCORDING TO THE ORDER, DR. MCGUIRE IS PRELIMINARILY ENJOINED FROM EXERCISING ANY COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS WITHOUT COURT APPROVAL, AND THE COMPANY AND

DR. MCGUIRE ARE PRELIMINARILY ENJOINED FROM TAKING ANY FURTHER ACTION PURSUANT TO OR HAVING ANY EFFECT ON DR. MCGUIRES EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, AND OTHER RELATED AGREEMENTS, AND WHILE THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IS IN EFFECT,

NO PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE TO DR. MCGUIRE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING ANY PAYMENTS UNDER DR. MCGUIRES SUPPLEMENTAL EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN.

THESE ACTIONS ARE IN PRELIMINARY STAGES, AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THEIR ULTIMATE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE ITEM 7  LEGAL

MATTERS FOR A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND SHAREHOLDER DEMANDS.

IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LITIGATION OR

OTHER PROCEEDINGS OR ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEES REVIEW, THE SPECIAL LITIGATION COMMITTEES REVIEW AND THE RELATED RESTATEMENT OF OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. LITIGATION AND ANY POTENTIAL REGULATORY

PROCEEDING OR ACTION MAY BE TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND DISTRACTING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS. THE ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF ANY SPECIFIC LAWSUIT OR ANY POTENTIAL REGULATORY PROCEEDING OR ACTION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CREDIT RATINGS

AS A

RESULT OF THEIR CONCERNS RELATED TO OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, MOODYS DOWNGRADED OUR A2 SENIOR DEBT RATING TO A3 WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK IN OCTOBER 2006 AND AM BEST DOWNGRADED OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS FROM A+ TO A WITH A

NEGATIVE OUTLOOK IN NOVEMBER 2006. STANDARD & POORS AND FITCHRATINGS CONFIRMED THEIR EXISTING RATINGS AND THEIR NEGATIVE OUTLOOK (STANDARD & POORS) AND NEGATIVE WATCH (FITCHRATINGS) ON THE COMPANYS RATINGS. IF OUR

BUSINESS RESULTS DETERIORATE SIGNIFICANTLY, OR IF THERE IS AN EVENT, OUTCOME OR ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND DOCUMENT REQUESTS OR THE PENDING CIVIL LITIGATION, WHICH IS MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY

BE FURTHER DOWNGRADED. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN RATINGS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING FOR THE COMPANY OR LIMIT THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL CASH AND NONCASH CHARGES

AS DESCRIBED IN THE EXPLANATORY NOTE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PART I, ITEM 1, AND IN NOTE 3

RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY, AFTER COMPLETING ITS INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF ALL STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND AFTER

CONSULTATION WITH THE SECS OFFICE OF THE CHIEF ACCOUNTANT ON CERTAIN INTERPRETIVE ACCOUNTING ISSUES, RECORDED ADDITIONAL CASH AND NONCASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS, WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN PAST STOCK OPTION

GRANTS, AND RESTATED PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-K. WHILE WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE APPROPRIATE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE FINANCIAL AND TAX IMPACTS OF OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, WE CANNOT PROVIDE

ASSURANCE THAT THE SEC OR THE IRS WILL AGREE WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH WE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED, OR NOT REPORTED, THE FINANCIAL AND TAX IMPACTS. IF THE SEC OR THE IRS DISAGREES WITH OUR FINANCIAL OR TAX ADJUSTMENTS AND SUCH DISAGREEMENT

RESULTS IN MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE MAY HAVE TO FURTHER RESTATE OUR PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AMEND PRIOR FILINGS WITH THE SEC, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS NOT CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED.

IN ADDITION, OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-OPERATING CASH CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOLUTION OF STOCK OPTION-RELATED MATTERS ARISING UNDER LITIGATION,

AND REGULATORY REVIEWS BY THE SEC, IRS, U.S. ATTORNEY, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AND MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE UNCERTAIN BUT WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS

WE MUST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS.

UNDER OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. WE GENERALLY USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO 85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY

THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HEALTH CARE COSTS. TOTAL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTED

BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM REVENUE IS TYPICALLY FIXED IN PRICE FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. WE BASE THE PREMIUMS WE

CHARGE ON OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE HEALTH CARE COSTS OVER THE FIXED PREMIUM PERIOD; HOWEVER, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, REGULATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE

INCREASED USE OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES, CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES, INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND

SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. AS A MEASURE OF THE IMPACT OF MEDICAL COST ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES CAN RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED BY 1% WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL CHANGE IN RELATED REVENUES FOR UNITEDHEALTHCARES COMMERCIAL INSURED PRODUCTS, OUR ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2006 WOULD HAVE BEEN

REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR WHICH CLAIMS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. IF THESE

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ESTIMATES PROVE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW, THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE WILL BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE RESULTS. THAT CHANGE CAN BE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE

TO OUR RESULTS.

WE FACE COMPETITION IN MANY OF OUR MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND FACE COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. FOR OUR UNIPRISE

AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES SEGMENTS, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE AND WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER

LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. OUR SPECIALIZED CARE SERVICES AND INGENIX SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES. THE ADDITION OF NEW COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR

RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CUSTOMERS ENJOY SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS. IN PARTICULAR MARKETS, COMPETITORS MAY HAVE CAPABILITIES OR RESOURCES THAT GIVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. GREATER MARKET SHARE, ESTABLISHED REPUTATION,

SUPERIOR SUPPLIER OR PROVIDER ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER FACTORS ALL CAN PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR TO THEIR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED

IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BOTH AS TO OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES. CONSOLIDATION MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS, TO IMPROVE THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, OR

TO MAINTAIN OR ADVANCE PROFITABILITY.

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP IS IMPORTANT.

UNDER A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT WITH AARP, WHICH COMMENCED IN 1998, WE PROVIDE MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE, HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE, HEALTH INSURANCE FOCUSED ON THOSE

AGES 50 TO 64 AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY $5.0 BILLION IN ANNUAL NET PREMIUM REVENUE FROM APPROXIMATELY 3.8 MILLION AARP MEMBERS. WE ALSO

HAVE A SEPARATE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH AARP TO BRAND CERTAIN OF OUR MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS. THE AARP CONTRACTS MAY BE TERMINATED BY US OR AARP AT THE END OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INITIAL TERMS AND MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED EARLY UNDER

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING A MATERIAL BREACH BY EITHER PARTY, INSOLVENCY OF EITHER PARTY, A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF EITHER PARTY, AND BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON

OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COMPETITIVELY, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY CHANGES.

SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN MEDICARE REMAIN UNCERTAIN.

THE CHANGES IN MEDICARE AS A RESULT OF THE MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (MMA) AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER ARE COMPLEX AND WIDE-RANGING AND CONTINUE TO AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES. WE HAVE

TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THE MMA TO PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REGIONAL PPOS, PRIVATE FEE FOR SERVICE PLANS AND SPECIAL NEEDS PLANS FOR

CHRONICALLY ILL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. WE HAVE INVESTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES IN CREATING NEW MEDICARE PRODUCT OFFERINGS FOR THESE INITIATIVES AND IN ANALYZING HOW TO BEST ADDRESS UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND

OTHER CHANGES ARISING FROM THE MMA. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES TO THESE PROGRAMS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US. ADDITIONALLY, OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM DEPENDS IN PART ON COORDINATION OF

INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS BETWEEN US, CMS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. THE INABILITY TO RECEIVE CORRECT INFORMATION DUE TO SYSTEMS ISSUES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENT OR US COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

ADDITIONALLY, OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM IS BASED UPON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT, UTILIZATION, PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MATERIALLY INCORRECT, EITHER AS A

RESULT OF UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE, OUR RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. ANY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM AS A WHOLE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON US AS A

RESULT OF THE SIZE OF OUR ENROLLMENT IN OUR MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUNDING RISKS WITH RESPECT TO REVENUE RECEIVED FROM PARTICIPATION IN MEDICARE AND

MEDICAID PROGRAMS.

WE PARTICIPATE AS A PAYER IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND RECEIVE REVENUES FROM THE MEDICARE

AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE BENEFITS UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. REVENUES FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON ANNUAL FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENTS. FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS

OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AT THE FEDERAL OR APPLICABLE STATE LEVEL AND GENERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AND PRIORITIES. AN UNEXPECTED REDUCTION IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO ROUTINE GOVERNMENT SCRUTINY, AND WE MUST RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO FREQUENT

CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING

OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. BROAD LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND RULES COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT

REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. WE MUST OBTAIN

AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS. DELAYS IN OBTAINING APPROVALS OR OUR

FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE PARTICIPATE IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH

CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR

HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. SUCH CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES. LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROPOSALS AT STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS MAY AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF

OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT METHODS AND PAYMENT RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; MANDATED BENEFITS AND MINIMUM MEDICAL EXPENDITURES; CLAIM PAYMENTS AND

PROCESSING; DRUG UTILIZATION AND PATIENT SAFETY EFFORTS; USE AND MAINTENANCE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION; MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LITIGATION; AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS. WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL

ULTIMATELY BECOME LAW, OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS OR THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO SUCH LAWS WILL BE, BUT THEIR ENACTMENT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO EXPANDED LIABILITY, REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT

BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS.

WE TYPICALLY ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE MAY INCLUDE

ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, EXAMINATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE

OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. SUCH GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE WAY WE CONDUCT

BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, PUBLIC PERCEPTION OR PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ROUTINE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS

MARKETS OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR COMPETITIVE PRICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THESE COMPETITIVE PRICES. IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, THESE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS COULD

REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDER THE TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT, THE PROVIDER RECEIVES A

FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM TO COVER ALL THE MEDICAL COSTS PROVIDED TO THE CAPITATED MEMBER. UNDER SOME CAPITATED ARRANGEMENTS, THE PROVIDER MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FROM RISK SHARING AND OTHER INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS. CAPITATION

ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS, BUT EXPOSE US TO RISK RELATED TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL CARE RESOURCES OF THE PROVIDER. TO THE EXTENT THAT A CAPITATED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION FACES FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID HEALTH CARE CLAIMS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAPITATED PROVIDER AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE

ALREADY PAID THE PROVIDER UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT.

THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO LITIGATION RISKS.

PERIODICALLY, WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF LEGAL ACTIONS THAT CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT

DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER SUITS, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A

VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO

DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO PARTY TO CERTAIN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY PROVIDER GROUPS. SEE  LEGAL MATTERS FOR A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF OUR PENDING LITIGATION MATTERS.

THE COMPANY IS LARGELY SELF-INSURED WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION RISKS; HOWEVER, WE MAINTAIN EXCESS LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH OUTSIDE INSURANCE CARRIERS TO MINIMIZE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH CATASTROPHIC CLAIMS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY INSURED FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR

ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED FOR THESE RISKS ARE ADEQUATE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES MAY EXCEED THE LIABILITIES RECORDED.

OUR BUSINESSES PROVIDING PBM SERVICES FACE REGULATORY AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THAT MAY DIFFER

FROM THE RISKS OF PROVIDING MANAGED CARE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PACIFICARE MERGER, WE ACQUIRED A PBM BUSINESS,

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO PROVIDE PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH UNITEDHEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS. PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS AND UNITEDHEALTH PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE ANTI-KICKBACK AND OTHER

LAWS THAT GOVERN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATURES REGULARLY CONSIDER NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES,

INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OR REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. WHILE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PBM IS A FIDUCIARY, IF A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT OUR PBM BUSINESS ACTS AS A FIDUCIARY UNDER ERISA, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO

CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF FORMULARIES, PREFERRED DRUG LISTINGS AND DRUG MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, CONTRACTING NETWORK PRACTICES, SPECIALTY DRUG DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. OUR PBM ALSO CONDUCTS

BUSINESS AS A MAIL ORDER PHARMACY, WHICH SUBJECTS IT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS RISKS INHERENT IN THE PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO

THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE OUR PBM SUBSIDIARY TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. WE ALSO FACE POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED ERRORS BY OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR BUSINESSES DEPEND ON EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND TO

ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES, CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS

TO CONSOLIDATE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. IF THE INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WERE FOUND TO BE INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS,

PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, HAVE REGULATORY PROBLEMS, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. IN ADDITION, FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE OUR SYSTEMS SUCCESSFULLY COULD RESULT IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED COSTS

AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS TIME AND ENERGY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY BECOME IMPAIRED.

DUE LARGELY TO OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR ASSETS. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY $18.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. IF WE MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS IT IS LIKELY

THAT WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON OUR BOOKS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY NO LONGER BE RECOVERABLE, IN WHICH CASE A CHARGE TO

EARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY. ANY FUTURE EVALUATIONS REQUIRING AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

A MATERIAL DECREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY COULD, IN TURN, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DEBT RATINGS OR POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS.

OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND OUR TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT

PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE MUST COMPLY WITH RESTRICTIONS ON PATIENT PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHO

OBTAIN ACCESS TO SENSITIVE PATIENT INFORMATION MAINTAIN ITS CONFIDENTIALITY.

THE USE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES IS

REGULATED AT THE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE CHANGED FREQUENTLY BY LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS ADDRESS THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA. MOST

ARE DERIVED FROM THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS IN THE FEDERAL GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE IMPOSE PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS ON OUR

BUSINESS ASSOCIATES (AS THIS TERM IS DEFINED IN THE HIPAA REGULATIONS). EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND PRACTICES. COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE PROPOSALS, REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, AND THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. THEY ALSO

MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR USE OF PATIENT IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT IS HOUSED IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES.

1.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED (ALSO

REFERRED TO AS UNITEDHEALTH GROUP, THE COMPANY, WE, US, AND OUR) IS A DIVERSIFIED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING COMPANY DEDICATED TO MAKING HEALTH CARE WORK BETTER. THROUGH STRATEGICALLY ALIGNED,

MARKET-DEFINED BUSINESSES, WE DESIGN PRODUCTS, PROVIDE SERVICES AND APPLY TECHNOLOGIES THAT IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING SERVICES, SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE, PROMOTE QUALITY AND MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE.

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF

PRESENTATION

WE HAVE PREPARED THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA AND HAVE INCLUDED THE ACCOUNTS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE ELIMINATED ALL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS.

USE

OF ESTIMATES

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES

REQUIRE US TO APPLY COMPLEX ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND WILL LIKELY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO MEDICAL

COSTS, MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, HISTORIC STOCK OPTION MEASUREMENT DATES, REVENUES, INTANGIBLE ASSET VALUATIONS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. WE ADJUST THESE ESTIMATES EACH PERIOD, AS MORE CURRENT INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE

IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IS INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS ADJUSTED.

REVENUES

PREMIUM REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM RISK-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE PREMIUM IS FIXED, TYPICALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD,

AND WE ASSUME THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUNDING OUR CUSTOMERS HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE RECORD

HEALTH CARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS IN ADVANCE OF THE SERVICE PERIOD AS UNEARNED PREMIUMS.

SERVICE REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

FEES DERIVED FROM SERVICES PERFORMED FOR CUSTOMERS THAT SELF-INSURE THE MEDICAL COSTS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. UNDER SERVICE FEE CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PERFORMED BASED UPON THE FEE

CHARGED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CUSTOMERS RETAIN THE RISK OF FINANCING MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES DEPENDENTS, AND WE ADMINISTER THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMER FUNDS TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FROM

CUSTOMER-FUNDED BANK ACCOUNTS. BECAUSE WE NEITHER HAVE THE OBLIGATION FOR FUNDING THE MEDICAL EXPENSES, NOR DO WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DELIVERING THE MEDICAL CARE, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE PREMIUM REVENUE AND MEDICAL COSTS FOR THESE CONTRACTS IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR BOTH PREMIUM RISK-BASED AND FEE-BASED CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, WE PROVIDE COORDINATION AND FACILITATION OF MEDICAL

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS

PAYABLE

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF

INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH WE HAVE EITHER NOT YET RECEIVED OR PROCESSED CLAIMS, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL

PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION AND

OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. WE ESTIMATE LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH PERIOD, WE RE-EXAMINE

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS THE LIABILITY ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS BECOME MORE EXACT, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES, AND

INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT GENERALLY HAVE AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES THEIR CARRYING VALUE BECAUSE OF THE

SHORT MATURITY OF THE INSTRUMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. WE MAY SELL INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM BEFORE THEIR MATURITIES TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES. BECAUSE OF

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR MATURITY DATE. WE CLASSIFY THESE INVESTMENTS AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORT THEM AT AMORTIZED COST. ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES.

WE EXCLUDE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE FOR SALE FROM

EARNINGS AND REPORT THEM, NET OF INCOME TAX EFFECTS, AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS IN AN UNREALIZED

LOSS POSITION, WE ANALYZE RELEVANT FACTORS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT TIME TO RECOVER OUR COST. NEW INFORMATION AND THE PASSAGE OF TIME CAN CHANGE THESE JUDGMENTS. WE REVISE

IMPAIRMENT JUDGMENTS WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN OR WHEN WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HOLDING THE INVESTMENT UNTIL THE FORECASTED RECOVERY. IF ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN VALUE THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, BASED

ON ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT FACTORS, WE RECORD A REALIZED LOSS IN INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER OR INDUSTRY AND LARGELY LIMIT OUR

INVESTMENTS TO U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, STATE AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INVESTMENT GRADE. TO CALCULATE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS, WE USE THE SPECIFIC COST OR AMORTIZED

COST OF EACH INVESTMENT SOLD.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

WE ADMINISTER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AARPS INSURANCE PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 13). PURSUANT TO OUR AGREEMENT, AARP ASSETS ARE MANAGED SEPARATELY FROM OUR GENERAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM.

THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT OUR DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES APPROVED BY AARP. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND, UPON TRANSFER OF THE AARP CONTRACT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, WE WOULD TRANSFER CASH EQUAL IN

AMOUNT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE OF TRANSFER TO THAT ENTITY. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THESE ASSETS IS TO FUND THE MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE, THE RATE STABILIZATION FUND (RSF) LIABILITIES AND OTHER RELATED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED

WITH THE AARP CONTRACT, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS, CONSISTENT WITH THE CLASSIFICATION OF THESE LIABILITIES. INTEREST EARNINGS AND REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF

THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS THROUGH THE RSF. ACCORDINGLY, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR EARNINGS.

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE

PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE STATED AT COST, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE CONSISTS OF

CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND PAYROLL COSTS OF EMPLOYEES DEVOTED TO SPECIFIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

WE CALCULATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE USEFUL LIVES FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE ARE: FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS FOR FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT; FROM 35 TO 40 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS; THE SHORTER OF THE USEFUL LIFE OR REMAINING LEASE TERM FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS; AND FROM THREE TO NINE YEARS FOR

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $966 MILLION AND $932 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET BOOK VALUE OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE WAS $928 MILLION AND $715 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE PURCHASE PRICE OF BUSINESSES WE

HAVE ACQUIRED EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE ASSETS AND SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF THESE BUSINESSES. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT ARE TESTED AT LEAST

ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DISCRETE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE WE MIGHT NOT RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED FUTURE UTILITY AND CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSETS, TO MAKE THIS DECISION. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED

FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH AN ASSETS CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. WE RECORD ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE, LESS ANY COSTS FOR THE FINAL SETTLEMENT.

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES

OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES INCLUDE THE RSF

ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 13), DEPOSITS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM (SEE NOTE 4), CUSTOMER BALANCES RELATED TO EXPERIENCE-RATED INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE CURRENT PORTION OF FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND

ANNUITY CONTRACTS. CUSTOMER BALANCES REPRESENT EXCESS CUSTOMER PAYMENTS AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS UNDER EXPERIENCE-RATED CONTRACTS. AT THE CUSTOMERS OPTION, THESE BALANCES MAY BE REFUNDED OR USED TO PAY FUTURE PREMIUMS OR CLAIMS UNDER ELIGIBLE

CONTRACTS.

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND INCOME TAX REPORTING BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON ENACTED TAX RATES AND LAWS. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT

GENERALLY REFLECTS THE NET CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DURING THE YEAR, EXCLUDING ANY DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION REFLECTS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF

REVENUES AND EXPENSES CURRENTLY TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE ON VARIOUS INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEAR REPORTED.

FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR LIFE AND ANNUITY

CONTRACTS AND REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES

FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS REPRESENT ACCOUNT BALANCES THAT ACCRUE TO THE

BENEFIT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS, EXCLUDING SURRENDER CHARGES, FOR UNIVERSAL LIFE AND INVESTMENT ANNUITY PRODUCTS. AS A RESULT OF THE OCTOBER 2005 SALE OF THE LIFE AND ANNUITY BUSINESS WITHIN OUR SUBSIDIARY GOLDEN RULE FINANCIAL CORPORATION (GOLDEN

RULE) UNDER AN INDEMNITY REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5, WE HAVE MAINTAINED A LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REINSURED CONTRACTS, AS WE REMAIN PRIMARILY LIABLE TO THE POLICYHOLDERS, AND HAVE RECORDED A CORRESPONDING REINSURANCE

RECEIVABLE DUE FROM THE PURCHASER ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE REINSURER AND ONLY RECORD THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT OF PROBABLE RECOVERY.

POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

OUR COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACTS

TYPICALLY HAVE A ONE-YEAR TERM AND MAY BE CANCELLED UPON 30 DAYS NOTICE BY EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE CUSTOMER. COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION AND RENEWAL OF CUSTOMER CONTRACTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (FAS 123R). FAS 123R SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO

EMPLOYEES (APB 25). UNDER APB 25, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS IF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE

MEASUREMENT DATE. FAS 123R REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE RELATED EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION VESTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED

FAS 123R EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. ALL PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER

JANUARY 1, 1995. SEE NOTE 3 FOR THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE ON OUR PRIOR YEARS.

NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

WE COMPUTE BASIC NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BY DIVIDING NET EARNINGS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.

WE DETERMINE DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD, ADJUSTED FOR POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXERCISE OF COMMON STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK-SETTLED SARS

AND THE CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AS PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN FIXED AND

VARIABLE RATES TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED IS ACCRUED AND

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE AGREEMENTS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR EXISTING INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS CONVERT A MAJORITY OF OUR INTEREST FROM A FIXED TO A VARIABLE RATE AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE SHORT CUT METHOD AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR EXISTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 9.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN THE NORMAL

COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE INVEST IN VARIOUS FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCUR VARIOUS FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS INVOLVING DERIVATIVE SECURITIES.

FAIR VALUES ARE DISCLOSED FOR ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR WHICH IT IS PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH VALUES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WHERE AVAILABLE, MANAGEMENT OBTAINS QUOTED MARKET

PRICES FOR THESE DISCLOSURES; OTHERWISE, FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED USING VALUATION TECHNIQUES.

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS FOR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, PREMIUM AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, UNEARNED PREMIUMS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, AND CERTAIN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.

THE FOLLOWING METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH CLASS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.



CURRENT AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AT FAIR VALUE: THE CARRYING AMOUNT IS STATED AT FAIR VALUE, BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, WHERE AVAILABLE.

FOR SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED, FAIR VALUES WERE ESTIMATED USING VALUES OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT PRICING SERVICES OR QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS.



SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES: ESTIMATED BASED ON THIRD-PARTY QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR THE SAME OR SIMILAR ISSUES.



COMMERCIAL PAPER: THE CARRYING AMOUNT FOR COMMERCIAL PAPER APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AS THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS HAVE VARIABLE INTEREST RATES AT MARKET VALUE.



INTEREST RATE SWAPS: THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS THE COUNTERPARTY TO THE

SWAP.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WE ADOPTED FAS 123R, WHICH REVISES FAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123). SEE NOTE 3 FOR DETAILS ON ITS IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108, CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN

CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (SAB 108). SAB 108 PROVIDES INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE ON HOW THE EFFECTS OF THE CARRYOVER OR REVERSAL OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN QUANTIFYING A CURRENT YEAR MISSTATEMENT. UNDER SAB

108, REGISTRANTS SHOULD QUANTIFY ERRORS USING BOTH A BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT APPROACH (DUAL APPROACH) AND EVALUATE WHETHER EITHER APPROACH RESULTS IN A MISSTATEMENT THAT IS MATERIAL WHEN ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED. WE ADOPTED SAB 108 ON DECEMBER 31, 2006.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANSAN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) (FAS 158). THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES BALANCE SHEET RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR

UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND RECOGNITION, AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, THE GAINS OR LOSSES AND PRIOR SERVICE COSTS OR CREDITS THAT ARISE DURING THE PERIOD BUT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS

COMPONENTS

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST. FAS 158 ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ADOPTED FAS 158 ON

DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN

INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109 (FIN 48), WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FIN 48 PROVIDES THAT THE TAX EFFECTS FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ARE RECOGNIZED ONLY IF IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR 2007 FISCAL YEAR. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING FIN 48 ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTING THIS INTERPRETATION WILL BE RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO RETAINED EARNINGS. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (FAS 157), WHICH ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR

REPORTING FAIR VALUE AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. FAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR 2008 FISCAL YEAR. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED FAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 PERMITS AN ENTITY TO ELECT FAIR VALUE AS THE INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR MANY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ENTITIES ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE IN EARNINGS. ENTITIES ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE REQUIRED TO DISTINGUISH, ON THE FACE OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED AND

SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING ANOTHER MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE. FAS 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR 2008. THE ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE DATE OF INITIAL ADOPTION. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF FAS 159 ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

3.

RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN MARCH 2006,

MEDIA REPORTS QUESTIONED WHETHER A NUMBER OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING UNITEDHEALTH GROUP, HAD ENGAGED IN BACKDATING STOCK OPTION GRANTS. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE COMPANY WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC) HAD

COMMENCED AN INQUIRY INTO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC PRACTICES CONCERNING STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

ON APRIL 4, 2006, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS (THE BOARD) CREATED AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF THREE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS TO REVIEW THE COMPANYS OPTION GRANT PRACTICES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1994 THROUGH 2005 (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PERIOD). THE

INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE ENGAGED THE LAW FIRM OF WILMER CUTLER PICKERING HALE AND DORR LLP (WILMERHALE) AS COUNSEL FOR ITS INDEPENDENT REVIEW, AND WILMERHALE RETAINED INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING ADVISORS.

WILMERHALES REPORT OF ITS FINDINGS (THE WILMERHALE REPORT) WAS FURNISHED TO THE BOARD AND PUBLICLY ISSUED ON OCTOBER 15, 2006. WILMERHALES

FINDINGS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT MANY OF THE STOCK OPTION GRANTS IT REVIEWED WERE LIKELY BACKDATED, THAT A 1999 SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS WAS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR CORRECTLY IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THAT THE

COMPANYS CONTROLS WITH RESPECT TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS WERE INADEQUATE.

AFTER SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETING ITS ANALYSIS OF THE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE FINDINGS OF THE WILMERHALE REPORT, ON NOVEMBER 8, 2006, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SEC A CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K REPORTING MANAGEMENTS CONCLUSION, WHICH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD HAD APPROVED, THAT

 DUE SOLELY TO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES  THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECEMBER 31, 1994 THROUGH 2005, THE INTERIM PERIODS CONTAINED THEREIN, THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2006 AND ALL EARNINGS AND PRESS RELEASES,

INCLUDING FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND SIMILAR COMMUNICATIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY FOR SUCH PERIODS, AND THE RELATED REPORTS OF THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, SHOULD

NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON. THE FORM 8-K ALSO REPORTED THAT MANAGEMENT HAD RE-EVALUATED ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND HAD CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS SOLELY RELATING TO STOCK OPTION PLAN ADMINISTRATION AND ACCOUNTING FOR AND DISCLOSURE OF STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

AFTER COMPLETING ITS INTERNAL

REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR ALL OPTION GRANTS, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD HAS APPROVED THE CONCLUSION, THAT THE COMPANY USED INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES AND MADE OTHER ERRORS DESCRIBED BELOW IN

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THAT THE COMPANYS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOULD BE RESTATED.

SUMMARY OF THE

RESTATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 123R, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. UNDER THIS

METHOD, ALL PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE RESTATED TO RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST IN THE AMOUNTS HISTORICALLY DISCLOSED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER FAS 123. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTED FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION GRANTED UNDER ITS STOCK OPTION PLANS USING THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF APB 25. UNDER APB 25, A COMPANY WAS NOT REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

IF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. APB 25 DEFINED THE MEASUREMENT DATE AS THE FIRST DATE ON WHICH BOTH THE NUMBER OF SHARES

THAT AN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE WAS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AND THE OPTION OR PURCHASE PRICE, IF ANY, WERE KNOWN.

THE RESTATEMENT PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS ADDITIONAL

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS UNDER BOTH FAS 123R, THE COMPANYS CURRENT ACCOUNTING METHOD, AND APB 25, THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING METHOD, RELATING TO THE COMPANYS HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES.

THE RESTATEMENT ALSO REFLECTS CERTAIN OTHER ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS UNRELATED TO HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, WHICH ARE NOT MATERIAL EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE TO THE CURRENT OR PRIOR PERIODS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE RESTATEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS.

REVISED

MEASUREMENT DATES.

BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE METHODOLOGIES DESCRIBED BELOW TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATES UNDER BOTH FAS 123 AND APB 25 FOR GRANTS IN THE

FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: (1) GRANTS OF APPROXIMATELY 80 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS TO SECTION 16 OFFICERS (SECTION 16 GRANTS); (2) GRANTS OF APPROXIMATELY 260 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS TO MIDDLE

MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES (BROAD-BASED GRANTS); AND (3) GRANTS OF APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS IN CONNECTION WITH THE HIRING OR PROMOTION OF EMPLOYEES (NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION

GRANTS). AS A RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT, IN MOST CASES, THE STATED GRANT DATE WAS NOT THE CORRECT MEASUREMENT DATE.



SECTION 16 GRANTS

 SECTION 16 GRANTS, GENERALLY MADE TO EIGHT TO TWELVE OFFICERS, REQUIRED APPROVAL BY THE COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES

COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD (THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE).

FOR THE MAJORITY OF SECTION 16 GRANTS, COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE APPROVAL WAS REFLECTED IN WRITTEN ACTIONS. THE WILMERHALE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE WRITTEN ACTIONS WERE GENERALLY EXECUTED SUBSEQUENT TO THE STATED GRANT DATES. (UNDER MINNESOTA CORPORATE LAW, IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO MAKE A WRITTEN ACTION

EFFECTIVE AS OF A DATE OTHER THAN THE DATE ON WHICH THE LAST OF THE REQUIRED SIGNERS AFFIXES HIS OR HER SIGNATURE, EVEN IF THAT EFFECTIVE DATE IS BEFORE THE LAST SIGNATURE AFFIXED.) BASED ON THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT

THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR EACH OF THESE SECTION 16 GRANTS IS THE EARLIER OF (A) THE DATE ON WHICH A FORM 4 (OR OTHER STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP) WAS FILED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR

OFFICERS GRANT OR (B) THE DATE ON WHICH THE WRITTEN ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THAT GRANT WAS LIKELY EXECUTED BY A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS TO CERTAIN OTHER SECTION 16 GRANTS, COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVAL OCCURRED AT A MEETING OR

THERE WAS GENERAL COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF THE SECTION 16 GRANT TOGETHER WITH A DELEGATION TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE THE FINAL AMOUNT OF STOCK OPTIONS, GRANT DATE AND EXERCISE PRICE FOR EACH

SECTION 16 OFFICER RECEIVING OPTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED, BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THESE SECTION 16 GRANTS IS THE EARLIER OF (A) THE DATE ON WHICH A FORM 4 (OR OTHER STATEMENT

OF CHANGES IN BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP) WAS FILED WITH THE SEC WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR OFFICERS GRANT OR (B) THE DATE ON WHICH A RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO THAT GRANT WAS ADOPTED AT A MEETING OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OR A DECISION

WAS MADE BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, IF SO DELEGATED.

FOR OPTION GRANTS WITH STATED GRANT DATES IN OCTOBER 1999 THAT

WERE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENTRY OF EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS FOR OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OUR CURRENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (BOTH OF WHOM HAD BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THAT DATE), THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE

APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE DATE ON WHICH THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WERE EXECUTED ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WITH RESPECT TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS WITH A STATED GRANT DATE IN OCTOBER 1999 THAT REPRESENTED THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS

NECESSARY TO EQUAL THE MINIMUM ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANT PROVIDED FOR PURSUANT TO EACH SUCH EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE LAST DAY OF 1999, THE CALENDAR YEAR IN WHICH THE COMPANY WAS

CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO MAKE THE GRANTS.



BROAD-BASED GRANTS

 BETWEEN 1,500 AND 4,000 MIDDLE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES PERIODICALLY AND CUSTOMARILY RECEIVED OPTIONS. AS DESCRIBED IN THE

WILMERHALE REPORT, OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ACTING PURSUANT TO AUTHORITY DELEGATED TO HIM BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, CHOSE THE GRANT DATES AND OVERALL AMOUNTS FOR BROAD-BASED GRANTS AND ULTIMATELY REFLECTED THE BROAD-BASED GRANTS IN

CEO CERTIFICATES.

THE COMPANY FOLLOWED SEPARATE ALLOCATION PROCESSES TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR RECIPIENTS AND

INDIVIDUAL OPTION AMOUNTS OF GRANTS TO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. IN THE MAJORITY OF BROAD-BASED GRANTS, THE PROCESS OF ALLOCATING STOCK OPTION GRANTS AMONG INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES IN BOTH MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR

MANAGEMENT CONTINUED BEYOND THE STATED GRANT DATE. AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL GRANTING ACTIVITIES WERE COMPLETED, THERE WERE AN INSIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHANGES TO OPTION AWARDS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE EFFECTIVE

CANCELLATION OF A GRANT BECAUSE OF AN EMPLOYEES TERMINATION, ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR CORRECTIONS, PROMOTION OR INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE REASSESSMENT.

BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR BROAD-BASED GRANTS WAS THE LATER OF THE FOLLOWING TWO DATES: (A) THE DATE ON WHICH THE EVIDENCE IDENTIFIED BY

THE COMPANY INDICATED THAT A COMMUNICATION TO OR FROM OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REFERS TO A PARTICULAR GRANT, OR THE GRANT WAS PRESENTED TO THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OR (B) THE DATE ON WHICH THE ALLOCATION OF THE OPTIONS TO INDIVIDUAL

EMPLOYEES AND GRANT PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROAD-BASED GRANT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE. WHERE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO EVIDENCE EITHER (A) OR (B) ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE TO BE THE

DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY DETERMINED, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE CEO CERTIFICATE FOR SUCH GRANT WAS LIKELY EXECUTED. WHERE OPTION AWARD AMOUNTS CHANGED SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE THE ALLOCATION PROCESS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, THE

COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT EACH AWARD THAT WAS CHANGED IS A SEPARATE GRANT WITH ITS OWN MEASUREMENT DATE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE THAT THE GRANTING PROCESS WAS NOT COMPLETE.



NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS

 DURING THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PERIOD, THE COMPANY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS TO APPROXIMATELY 2,500 EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION

WITH THEIR HIRE OR PROMOTION (NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS).

FOR NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION GRANTS MADE PRIOR TO

2002, THE COMPANY TYPICALLY CHOSE GRANT DATES BY DETERMINING THE LOWEST CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN THE DATE OF AN EVENT IN THE RECRUITMENT OF THE NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEE (E.G., DATE OF FIRST CONTACT, DATE OF AN OFFER

LETTER) OR PROMOTION OF THE EMPLOYEE AND THE END OF THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE STARTED WORK OR WAS PROMOTED. AS A RESULT OF THIS PRACTICE, SOME EMPLOYEES RECEIVED STOCK OPTIONS WITH GRANT DATES THAT WERE EARLIER THAN THAT EMPLOYEES

START

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DATE. IN 2002, THE COMPANY CHANGED TO A PRACTICE OF DETERMINING GRANT DATES FOR NEW HIRES AND PROMOTIONS TO BE THE DATE OF THE LOWEST CLOSING PRICE OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN THE START DATE OF EMPLOYMENT OR DATE OF PROMOTION AND THE END OF THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE STARTED WORK OR WAS PROMOTED. THE COMPANY HISTORICALLY USED THESE STATED GRANT DATES AS THE MEASUREMENT DATES FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MEASUREMENT DATES USED WITH RESPECT TO NEARLY ALL OF THE NEW HIRE AND PROMOTION

GRANTS DURING THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PERIOD WERE NOT CORRECT BECAUSE THE COMPANYS PRACTICE WAS TO DETERMINE GRANT DATES WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR EACH NEW HIRE AND

PROMOTION GRANT WAS THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY SET THE TERMS OF THE AWARD, OR WHERE THE COMPANY COULD NOT IDENTIFY SUCH DATE BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, THE LAST DATE OF THE FISCAL QUARTER IN WHICH A PARTICULAR NEW HIRE OR PROMOTION GRANT

WAS MADE.

1999 GRANT OF SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999, FOLLOWING A DECLINE IN ITS STOCK PRICE,

THE COMPANY GRANTED SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE 2.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK (17.6 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS) TO A BROAD GROUP OF EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

OTHER SECTION 16 OFFICERS. THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS WERE GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUSPENSION OF THE VESTING AND EXERCISABILITY OF AN EQUAL NUMBER OF OPTIONS WITH EXERCISE PRICES ABOVE $46.50 ($5.8125 ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS) THAT HAD

PREVIOUSLY BEEN GRANTED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES (THE SUSPENDED OPTIONS). THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS HAD A STATED GRANT DATE OF OCTOBER 13, 1999 AND AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO $40.125 ($5.0156 ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS).

AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE SUSPENDED OPTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT, UNDER APB 25, THE GRANT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS

CONSTITUTED AN EFFECTIVE RE-PRICING SUBJECT TO VARIABLE ACCOUNTING FOR EACH OPTION UNTIL EXERCISE, FORFEITURE OR EXPIRATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT, UNDER FAS 123, THE GRANT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS WAS A MODIFICATION THAT

REQUIRED AN INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE CHARGE TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE RELATED VESTING PERIOD.

2000 REACTIVATION OF SUSPENDED

OPTIONS.

IN 2000, THE COMPANY REACTIVATED THE VESTING AND EXERCISABILITY OF THE SUSPENDED OPTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT, UNDER APB 25 AND FAS 123, THE REACTIVATION OF THE VESTING AND EXERCISABILITY OF THE

SUSPENDED OPTIONS WAS A NEW STOCK OPTION GRANT THAT SHOULD HAVE HAD A NEW MEASUREMENT DATE, AND THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE DATE GRANTEES WERE AGAIN PERMITTED TO EXERCISE THEIR PREVIOUSLY VESTED AWARDS.

CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS.

PRIOR TO APRIL 2000, THE COMPANY GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES CERTAIN STOCK OPTIONS THAT VESTED 100%

ON THE SIXTH OR NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF GRANT (THE CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE OPTIONS, THE COMPANY COULD ELECT TO ACCELERATE THE VESTING OF ALL OR A PORTION OF THE CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS AT ITS DISCRETION. THE

COMPANY FOLLOWED A POLICY OF ACCELERATING THE VESTING OF A CONSISTENT PERCENTAGE OF THE CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS, UNLESS THE OPTION HOLDER WAS SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR PERFORMING AT A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY LEVEL. THIS RESULTED IN NEARLY ALL

OPTION HOLDERS HAVING THEIR CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS ACCELERATED SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY VESTED AS IF THEY HAD A 20% OR 25% PER YEAR TIME-BASED VESTING SCHEDULE (I.E., A FOUR-YEAR OR FIVE-YEAR VESTING PERIOD).



GRANT OF CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS.

UNDER APB 25, AN AWARD SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PERFORMANCE AWARD IF ITS CLIFF VESTING TERMS ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE

SUBSTANTIVE. BASED ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EVALUATION OF EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATES, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE NINE-YEAR VESTING TERM WAS NOT SUBSTANTIVE IN GRANTS AFTER JANUARY 1995 TO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE

OPTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO VARIABLE ACCOUNTING UNTIL EACH OF THEIR VESTING DATES. WITH RESPECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OTHER CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CLIFF VESTING TERM IS SUBSTANTIVE.



ACCELERATION OF CLIFF VESTING OPTIONS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INTERPRETATION NO. 44, ACCOUNTING

FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING STOCK COMPENSATION (AN INTERPRETATION OF APB OPINION NO. 25) (FIN 44), SUBSEQUENT TO JULY 1, 2000, THE ACCELERATION OF THE SIX- OR NINE-YEAR CLIFF VESTING TERM OF A STOCK OPTION CONSTITUTED A

MODIFICATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE MEASURED THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE AWARD AT THE DATE OF THE MODIFICATION AND RECOGNIZED THIS AMOUNT AS

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPENSATION COST ON THE TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT IF, ABSENT THE ACCELERATION, THE AWARD WOULD HAVE BEEN FORFEITED PURSUANT TO ITS ORIGINAL TERMS. UNDER

FAS 123, THE PERFORMANCE TARGETS WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARD AND THEREFORE THE ACCELERATION OF VESTING WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A MODIFICATION OF THE TERMS.

OTHER MODIFICATIONS OF OPTION TERMS.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN OTHER ACTIONS WERE TAKEN THAT RESULTED IN THE

MODIFICATION OF OPTION TERMS, AS FOLLOWS.



OPTIONS MODIFIED UPON TERMINATIONS.

ON APPROXIMATELY 75 OCCASIONS FROM 1998 TO 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AMENDED EMPLOYMENT OR SEPARATION AGREEMENTS

WITH EMPLOYEES THAT RESULTED IN THE MODIFICATION OF VESTING OR CANCELLATION TERMS OF THEIR STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS. UNDER APB 25, THE POTENTIAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF THE MODIFICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEASURED AT THE DATE OF THE MODIFICATION AND

RECOGNIZED IF THE EMPLOYEE ULTIMATELY RECEIVED A BENEFIT ON THE TERMINATION DATE. UNDER FAS 123, THE MODIFICATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF THE MODIFICATION BASED UPON THE INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE PROVIDED TO THE EMPLOYEE.



1999 CANCELLATION AND REISSUANCE OF OPTIONS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999, THE COMPANY ISSUED STOCK OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE AN AGGREGATE OF 400,000 SHARES OF

COMPANY COMMON STOCK (3.2 MILLION SHARES ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS) TO APPROXIMATELY 65 EMPLOYEES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE CANCELLATION OF AN EQUAL NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GRANTED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES AT VARIOUS TIMES EARLIER IN

1999. THE REISSUED STOCK OPTIONS HAD A STATED GRANT DATE OF OCTOBER 13, 1999 AND AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO $40.125 ($5.0156 ON A SPLIT-ADJUSTED BASIS), WHICH WAS LOWER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE CANCELLED OPTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS

DETERMINED THAT, UNDER APB 25, THIS CONSTITUTED A RE-PRICING, RESULTING IN VARIABLE ACCOUNTING FOR EACH OPTION UNTIL EXERCISE, FORFEITURE OR EXPIRATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT, UNDER FAS 123, THIS WOULD ALSO BE

VIEWED AS A MODIFICATION TO THE AWARD AND THE INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINALLY MEASURED FAIR VALUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD.

RELATED TAX ADJUSTMENTS.

THE RESTATEMENT IN THIS FORM 10-K ALSO REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF CERTAIN TAX DEDUCTIONS AND ADDITIONAL

INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS THAT  AS A RESULT OF THE REVISION OF MEASUREMENT DATES  NO LONGER QUALIFY AS DEDUCTIBLE PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION

IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 162(M).

RESTATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH, ON A YEAR-BY-YEAR BASIS, THE IMPACT UNDER FAS 123R AND APB 25 OF RECOGNIZING ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS AS A RESULT OF HISTORIC STOCK OPTION

PRACTICES AS WELL AS IMMATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS UNRELATED TO HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. THE IMPACT UNDER FAS 123R OF ALL ERRORS IS $43 MILLION ($57 MILLION NET OF

TAX) IN 2005, $40 MILLION ($44 MILLION NET OF TAX) IN 2004, AND AN AGGREGATE OF $453 MILLION ($313 MILLION NET OF TAX) FOR 2003 AND ALL PRIOR YEARS. THE IMPACT UNDER APB 25 OF ALL ERRORS IS $304 MILLION ($238 MILLION NET OF TAX) IN 2005, $200

MILLION ($158 MILLION NET OF TAX) IN 2004, AND AN AGGREGATE OF $1,056 MILLION ($738 MILLION NET OF TAX) FOR 2003 AND ALL PRIOR YEARS.

ADDITIONALLY,

ON JANUARY 1, 2006, OUR UNIPRISE BUSINESS SEGMENT BEGAN REPORTING PREMIUMS AND EXPENSES ON A GROSS BASIS FOR A LARGE ACCOUNT WHERE WE HAVE EMPLOYED THIRD-PARTY REINSURANCE. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACCOUNT WERE

REPORTED NET OF AMOUNTS CEDED TO AN UNAFFILIATED REINSURER. WHILE THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, RECENT ACCOUNTING INTERPRETATIONS SUGGEST THIS REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT BE PRESENTED ON A GROSS VERSUS NET BASIS.

PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE 2006 PRESENTATION. THE RESTATEMENT HAS NO EFFECT ON OUR NET EARNINGS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.

MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFITS CONTRACT

BEGINNING

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN SERVING AS A PLAN SPONSOR OFFERING MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG INSURANCE COVERAGE UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS). UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM,

THERE ARE SIX SEPARATE ELEMENTS OF PAYMENT RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PLAN YEAR. THESE PAYMENT ELEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.



CMS PREMIUM  CMS PAYS A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM PER MEMBER TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.



MEMBER PREMIUM  ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN MEMBERS PAY A FIXED MONTHLY PREMIUM TO THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE PLAN YEAR.



LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY  FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS SOME OR ALL OF THE MEMBERS MONTHLY PREMIUMS TO THE COMPANY ON THE MEMBERS

BEHALF.



CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY  CMS PAYS THE COMPANY A COST REIMBURSEMENT ESTIMATE MONTHLY TO FUND THE CMS OBLIGATION TO PAY APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE COSTS

INCURRED BY INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS IN EXCESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM OF $3,600. A SETTLEMENT IS MADE BASED ON ACTUAL COST EXPERIENCE SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.



LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY  FOR QUALIFYING LOW-INCOME MEMBERS, CMS PAYS ON THE MEMBERS BEHALF SOME OR ALL OF A MEMBERS COST SHARING

AMOUNTS, SUCH AS DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE. THE COST SHARING SUBSIDY IS FUNDED BY CMS THROUGH MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ADMINISTERS AND PAYS THE SUBSIDIZED PORTION OF THE CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CMS, AND A SETTLEMENT PAYMENT IS MADE

BETWEEN CMS AND THE COMPANY BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR.



CMS RISK-SHARE  IF THE ULTIMATE PER MEMBER PER MONTH BENEFIT COSTS OF ANY MEDICARE PART D REGIONAL PLAN VARIES MORE THAN 2.5% ABOVE OR BELOW THE LEVEL

ESTIMATED IN THE ORIGINAL BID SUBMITTED BY THE COMPANY AND APPROVED BY CMS, THERE IS A RISK-SHARE SETTLEMENT WITH CMS THAT IS SETTLED SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE PLAN YEAR. THE RISK-SHARE ADJUSTMENT, IF ANY, IS RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO PREMIUM

REVENUES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES OR LIABILITIES.

THE CMS PREMIUM, THE MEMBER PREMIUM, AND THE LOW-INCOME PREMIUM SUBSIDY REPRESENT

PAYMENTS FOR THE COMPANYS INSURANCE RISK COVERAGE UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM AND THEREFORE ARE RECORDED AS PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. PREMIUM REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH

ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS. WE RECORD PREMIUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE APPLICABLE SERVICE PERIOD AS UNEARNED PREMIUMS.

THE CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE SUBSIDY AND THE LOW-INCOME MEMBER COST SHARING SUBSIDY REPRESENT COST REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM. THE COMPANY IS FULLY REIMBURSED BY CMS FOR COSTS INCURRED FOR THESE

CONTRACT ELEMENTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO INSURANCE RISK TO THE COMPANY. AMOUNTS RECEIVED FOR THESE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT REFLECTED AS PREMIUM REVENUES, BUT RATHER ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DEPOSITS, WITH THE RELATED LIABILITY RECORDED IN OTHER POLICY

LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RELATED CASH FLOWS ARE PRESENTED AS CUSTOMER FUNDS ADMINISTERED WITHIN FINANCING CASH FLOWS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS UNDER THE CONTRACT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN MEDICAL COSTS AND OPERATING COSTS, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS A RESULT OF THE MEDICARE PART D PRODUCT BENEFIT DESIGN, THE COMPANY INCURS A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF PHARMACY BENEFIT COSTS EARLY IN THE CONTRACT

YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 67% OF A MEDICARE PART D BENEFICIARYS DRUG COSTS UP TO $2,250, WHILE THE BENEFICIARY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 100% OF THEIR DRUG COSTS FROM $2,250 UP TO $5,100 (AT THE COMPANYS

DISCOUNTED PURCHASE PRICE). CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY INCURS A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT COSTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE CONTRACT YEAR AS COMPARED WITH

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE LAST HALF OF THE CONTRACT YEAR, WHEN COMPARATIVELY MORE MEMBERS WILL BE INCURRING CLAIMS ABOVE THE $2,250 INITIAL COVERAGE LIMIT. THE UNEVEN TIMING OF

MEDICARE PART D PHARMACY BENEFIT CLAIMS RESULTS IN LOSSES IN THE FIRST HALF OF YEAR THAT ENTITLE THE COMPANY TO RISK-SHARE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS FROM CMS. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THE CONTRACT YEAR WE RECORD A NET RISK-SHARE

RECEIVABLE FROM CMS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND A CORRESPONDING RETROSPECTIVE PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT IN PREMIUM REVENUES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THIS REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT PAYABLE BY CMS

TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE RISK-SHARE CONTRACT PROVISIONS IF THE PROGRAM WERE TERMINATED BASED ON ESTIMATED COSTS INCURRED THROUGH THAT INTERIM PERIOD. THOSE LOSSES REVERSE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND FINAL RISK-SHARE AMOUNTS DUE TO OR FROM

CMS, IF ANY, ARE SETTLED APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CONTRACT YEAR-END. THE PROJECTED NET RISK-SHARE PAYABLE TO BE PAID TO CMS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS $350 MILLION.

PRIMARILY OF MEMBER LISTS AND PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL NETWORKS, WITH AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE USEFUL LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 15 YEARS. THE ACQUIRED GOODWILL IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THIS ANALYSIS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AGENCY OBLIGATIONS

AND THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS DO NOT PERMIT THE ISSUER TO SETTLE THE SECURITIES AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE INVESTMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR AMORTIZED COST.

THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WERE

MAINLY CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND NOT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SECURITIES. WE EVALUATE IMPAIRMENT AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD FOR EACH OF THE SECURITIES

WHERE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN ITS COST. THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS ARE EITHER GUARANTEED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AN AGENCY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE

SECURITIES WOULD NOT BE SETTLED AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE COST OF OUR INVESTMENT. WE EVALUATED THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE STATE AND MUNICIPAL OBLIGATIONS AND THE CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS, NOTING NEITHER A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION SINCE PURCHASE NOR

OTHER FACTORS LEADING TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT.

A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES CONSISTS OF INVESTMENTS HELD BY

OUR UNITEDHEALTH CAPITAL BUSINESS IN VARIOUS PUBLIC AND NONPUBLIC COMPANIES CONCENTRATED IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. MARKET CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE VALUE OF HEALTH CARE AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY STOCKS

WILL LIKEWISE IMPACT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO. THE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE EVALUATED FOR SEVERITY AND DURATION OF UNREALIZED LOSS, OVERALL MARKET VOLATILITY AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

WE ANALYZE RELEVANT FACTORS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN COMBINATION INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER AS WELL AS SPECIFIC EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ISSUER, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT TIME TO RECOVER OUR COST. WE REVISE

IMPAIRMENT JUDGMENTS WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN OR WHEN WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HOLDING THE INVESTMENT UNTIL RECOVERY. IF ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, BASED ON ANALYSIS

OF RELEVANT FACTORS, WE RECORD A REALIZED LOSS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON EACH OF THE INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE

MEDICAL COSTS AND MEDICAL

COSTS PAYABLE INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR MEDICAL CARE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED ON BEHALF OF INSURED CONSUMERS BUT FOR WHICH WE HAVE EITHER NOT YET RECEIVED OR PROCESSED CLAIMS, AND FOR LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND

OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES. WE DEVELOP ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL COSTS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED USING AN ACTUARIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED, CENTRALLY CONTROLLED AND AUTOMATED. THE ACTUARIAL MODELS CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS TIME FROM DATE

OF SERVICE TO CLAIM RECEIPT, CLAIM BACKLOGS, CARE PROVIDER CONTRACT RATE CHANGES, MEDICAL CARE CONSUMPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL COST TRENDS. WE ESTIMATE LIABILITIES FOR PHYSICIAN, HOSPITAL AND OTHER MEDICAL COST DISPUTES BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF

POTENTIAL OUTCOMES, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. EACH PERIOD, WE RE-EXAMINE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AS

THE LIABILITY ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS BECOME MORE EXACT, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATES, AND INCLUDE THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CHANGE IS IDENTIFIED. FOR EXAMPLE, IN EVERY REPORTING PERIOD

OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF MORE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED MEDICAL COSTS PAYABLE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PERIODS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON OCTOBER 16, 2006, WE EXECUTED A $7.5 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE

COMPANYS IMMEDIATE AND CONTINUED ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY. THE CREDIT FACILITY IS AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AS WELL AS TO PAY OR REPAY ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF THE COMPANY. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENTS TO OUR $7.5

BILLION CREDIT FACILITY TO PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL TIME TO DELIVER TO THE LENDERS OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2006. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR $7.5 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY.

IN MARCH 2006, WE REFINANCED

OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER BY ISSUING $650 MILLION OF FLOATING-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2009, $750 MILLION OF 5.3% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2011, $750 MILLION OF 5.4% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2016 AND $850 MILLION OF 5.8% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE

MARCH 2036. THE FLOATING-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2009 ARE BENCHMARKED TO THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR) AND HAD AN INTEREST RATE OF 5.5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

IN DECEMBER 2005, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR $1.0 BILLION FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY SUPPORTING OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. WE INCREASED THE CREDIT FACILITY TO $1.3 BILLION AND EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE

TO DECEMBER 2010. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENTS TO OUR $1.3 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY TO PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL TIME TO DELIVER TO THE LENDERS OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, TO OBTAIN OUR LENDERS AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE DELIVERY OF A NOTICE OF DEFAULT OR NOTICE OF ACCELERATION UNDER ANY INDENTURE OR CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT IS

BEING CONTESTED BY THE COMPANY IN GOOD FAITH DOES NOT CAUSE A DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND TO OBTAIN A WAIVER OF ANY POTENTIAL DEFAULT THAT MAY ARISE AS A RESULT OF OUR DETERMINATION THAT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL

INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AND AS A RESULT OF OUR RESTATEMENT OF OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR $1.3 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY.

IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2005, WE ISSUED $2.6 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION

DESCRIBED ABOVE AND TO RETIRE A PORTION OF THE PACIFICARE DEBT AT THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS TO REFINANCE CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT.

IN OCTOBER 2005, WE EXECUTED A $3.0 BILLION 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO SUPPORT A $3.0 BILLION INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM IN ORDER TO FINANCE THE CASH PORTION OF THE PACIFICARE ACQUISITION. WE TERMINATED THE 364-DAY

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN MARCH 2006.

IN MARCH 2005, WE ISSUED $500 MILLION OF 4.9% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE MARCH 2015. WE USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS

BORROWING FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

TO MORE

CLOSELY ALIGN INTEREST COSTS WITH THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE RECEIVED ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO CONVERT THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE FROM A FIXED RATE TO A VARIABLE

RATE. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS HAVE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF $4.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WITH VARIABLE RATES THAT ARE BENCHMARKED TO LIBOR, AND ARE

RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY, RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, FOR ALL EXISTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS APPROXIMATELY $73 MILLION. THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE

SHORT-CUT METHOD UNDER FAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (FAS 133), WHEREBY THE HEDGES ARE REPORTED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE, AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT IS

ADJUSTED FOR AN OFFSETTING AMOUNT REPRESENTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK. SINCE THESE AMOUNTS COMPLETELY OFFSET, WE HAVE REPORTED BOTH THE SWAP LIABILITY AND THE DEBT LIABILITY WITHIN DEBT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS, AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO NET GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE RATES USED TO ACCRUE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THESE AGREEMENTS RANGED FROM 4.9% TO 5.7%.

OUR DEBT ARRANGEMENTS AND CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN VARIOUS COVENANTS, THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRE US TO

MAINTAIN A DEBT-TO-TOTAL-CAPITAL RATIO (CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND DEBT DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) BELOW 50%. AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS THAT

WE OBTAINED FROM OUR LENDERS, WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL DEBT COVENANTS. ON AUGUST 28, 2006, WE RECEIVED A PURPORTED NOTICE OF DEFAULT FROM PERSONS CLAIMING TO HOLD CERTAIN OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES ALLEGING A

VIOLATION OF OUR INDENTURE GOVERNING OUR DEBT SECURITIES. THIS FOLLOWED OUR ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE WOULD DELAY FILING OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2006. ON OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 2, 2006, WE RECEIVED A

PURPORTED NOTICE OF ACCELERATION FROM THE HOLDERS WHO PREVIOUSLY SENT THE NOTICE OF DEFAULT THAT PURPORTS TO DECLARE AN ACCELERATION OF OUR 5.8% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2036. OUR INDENTURE REQUIRES US TO PROVIDE TO THE TRUSTEE

COPIES OF THE REPORTS WE ARE REQUIRED TO FILE WITH THE SEC, SUCH AS OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS, WITHIN 15 DAYS OF FILING SUCH REPORTS WITH THE SEC. ON OCTOBER 25, 2006, WE FILED AN ACTION IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

MINNESOTA SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT WE ARE NOT IN DEFAULT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INDENTURE. IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, WE FILED OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER

30, 2006, AS WELL AS AN AMENDMENT TO OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2006. SHOULD THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THIS MATTER, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RETIRE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE $850 MILLION OF

SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 2036. WE INTEND TO PROSECUTE THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION VIGOROUSLY.

PACIFICARE HAD APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION PAR

VALUE OF 3% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES (CONVERTIBLE NOTES) WHICH WERE CONVERTIBLE INTO APPROXIMATELY 5.2 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUPS COMMON STOCK AND $102 MILLION OF CASH AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN DECEMBER 2005,

WE INITIATED A CONSENT SOLICITATION TO ALL OF THE HOLDERS OF OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES PURSUANT TO WHICH WE OFFERED TO COMPENSATE ALL HOLDERS WHO ELECTED TO CONVERT THEIR NOTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING TERMS AND CONSENT TO AN AMENDMENT TO A

COVENANT IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE COMPENSATION CONSISTED OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST THROUGH OCTOBER 18, 2007, THE EARLIEST REDEMPTION DATE, PLUS A PRO RATA SHARE OF $1 MILLION. ON JANUARY 31, 2006,

APPROXIMATELY 91% OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE TENDERED PURSUANT TO THE OFFER, FOR WHICH WE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 4.8 MILLION SHARES OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP COMMON STOCK, VALUED AT $282 MILLION, AND CASH OF $93 MILLION.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND

RESTRICTIONS

WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL

ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC). THESE STANDARDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER

DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A REGULATED SUBSIDIARY, WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, IS LIMITED BASED ON THE ENTITYS LEVEL

OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION OF OUR $20.6 BILLION OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY NON-REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES AND AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE USE, INCLUDING

ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES HAD AGGREGATE STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF APPROXIMATELY

$8.2 BILLION, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE AGGREGATE MINIMUM REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION, WE MAINTAIN A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON VOLUME, PRICING AND TIMING. DURING 2006, WE REPURCHASED 40.2 MILLION SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $56 PER SHARE AND AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 136.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY SUSPENDED PURCHASES UNDER THIS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 PENDING COMPLETION OF THE

RESTATEMENT (WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THIS FORM 10-K) AND BECOMING CURRENT IN ITS PERIODIC SEC FILINGS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO RESUME ITS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2007.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

AS

FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, WE ADOPTED FAS 123R AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006. FAS 123R REQUIRES COMPANIES TO MEASURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (INCLUDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND RESTRICTED STOCK)

AT FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THE EXPENSE OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD. WE ADOPTED FAS 123R USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD, UNDER WHICH ALL PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE RESTATED TO RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST IN THE

AMOUNTS HISTORICALLY DISCLOSED UNDER FAS 123.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 83.0 MILLION SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS OF

STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCENTIVE OR NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. OUR EXISTING STOCK-BASED AWARDS CONSIST

MAINLY OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS). STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER FOUR YEARS AND MAY BE EXERCISED UP TO 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK OPTION AND SAR ACTIVITY IS

SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE BELOW (SHARES IN MILLIONS).

TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD GRANT IS

ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL. TO ESTIMATE THE 2006, 2005 AND 2004 FAIR VALUE OF OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND SAR GRANTS, WE UTILIZE A BINOMIAL MODEL. THE PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS WE USED IN APPLYING THE OPTION-PRICING

MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS BASED ON U.S. TREASURY YIELDS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF GRANT. EXPECTED VOLATILITIES ARE

BASED ON A BLEND OF THE IMPLIED VOLATILITIES FROM TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE OPTION AND SAR EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS WITHIN THE VALUATION MODEL.

THE EXPECTED TERM OF OPTIONS AND SARS GRANTED REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE AWARDS GRANTED ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING BASED ON HISTORICAL EXERCISE PATTERNS.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS GRANTED WAS $11 PER SHARE, $14 PER SHARE AND $12 PER SHARE FOR 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS THAT

VESTED DURING 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WAS $371 MILLION, $350 MILLION AND $322 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS WAS $4.6 BILLION, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING

CONTRACTUAL TERM OF 6.0 YEARS. THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF EXERCISABLE STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS AT THAT SAME DATE WAS $4.0 BILLION, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM OF 4.8 YEARS. THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUE OF OPTIONS AND SARS

EXERCISED DURING 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WAS $753 MILLION, $847 MILLION AND $951 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER

TWO TO FOUR YEARS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD ON THE DATE OF GRANT. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD ACTIVITY IS SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE BELOW (SHARES IN MILLIONS).

WE RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS, INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, SARS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD (GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD) OF THE AWARD, OR TO AN EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT DATE UNDER THE AWARD AGREEMENT, IF EARLIER. FOR 2006, 2005 AND 2004, WE

RECOGNIZED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OF $404 MILLION ($259 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS), $306 MILLION ($194 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS) AND $244 MILLION ($155 MILLION NET OF TAX EFFECTS), RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED WITHIN OPERATING COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR 2006 INCLUDED $31 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASH SETTLEMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS EXPIRING OR FORFEITING

DURING THE PERIOD. OUR REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WHICH COVERS ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK UPON STOCK OPTION EXERCISE, WAS UNAVAILABLE AS A RESULT OF THE DETERMINATION THAT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WAS $634 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO STOCK AWARDS THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE OVER A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY 1.4 YEARS.

FOR 2006, 2005 AND 2004, THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS WAS $287 MILLION, $311 MILLION AND $304 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2006, 15 EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO OPTIONS REPRICING AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS NO POTENTIAL FOR

FINANCIAL GAIN FROM THE INCORRECT DATING OF ANY OPTION THE EXECUTIVES HAD RECEIVED IN LIGHT OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE WILMERHALE REPORT, AS WELL AS TO AVOID POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL SURTAX LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

(SECTION 409A). THESE REPRICINGS INCREASED THE EXERCISE PRICES OF CERTAIN AWARDS TO EITHER THE HIGHEST CLOSING PRICE OF THE STATED GRANT YEAR OR TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENT DATE. THERE WAS NO

INCREMENTAL FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MODIFICATIONS.

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10, WE MAINTAIN A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM IS TO OPTIMIZE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, COST OF CAPITAL AND RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS, AS WELL AS TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF SHARES ISSUED FOR STOCK-BASED AWARD EXERCISES.

OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO PURCHASE THE COMPANYS STOCK AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE BASED ON THE LOWER OF THE PRICE ON THE FIRST DAY OR THE LAST DAY OF THE SIX-MONTH PURCHASE PERIOD. THE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED AND DISCUSSED ABOVE. WE ALSO OFFER A 401(K) PLAN FOR ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATING TO THIS PLAN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

WE HAVE PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFITS (SERPS), WHICH ARE NON-QUALIFIED

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS, FOR OUR CURRENT CEO, FORMER CEO AND CERTAIN NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES (WHICH WERE ASSUMED IN AN ACQUISITION). NO ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS WILL ACCRUE UNDER THE SERPS TO OUR FORMER CEO AND CURRENT CEO. THE SERPS ARE

NON-CONTRIBUTORY, UNFUNDED AND PROVIDE BENEFITS BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND COMPENSATION DURING EMPLOYMENT. PENSION EXPENSE IS DETERMINED USING VARIOUS ACTUARIAL METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL BENEFITS ULTIMATELY PAYABLE TO EXECUTIVES, AND IS

ALLOCATED TO SERVICE PERIODS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE PENSION COSTS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY. PENSION EXPENSE WAS $4 MILLION, $3 MILLION AND $9 MILLION FOR THE YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL SERP LIABILITY WAS

$131 MILLION AND $128 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, AND IS RECORDED WITHIN OTHER LONG TERM LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS NON-QUALIFIED, UNFUNDED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS, WHICH ALLOW CERTAIN SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVES TO DEFER PORTIONS OF THEIR SALARY OR BONUS AND RECEIVE CERTAIN COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS ON SUCH DEFERRALS, SUBJECT TO PLAN LIMITATIONS. THE DEFERRALS ARE RECORDED WITHIN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH AN EQUAL OFFSETTING AMOUNT IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE TOTAL DEFERRALS ARE

DISTRIBUTABLE BASED UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER PERIODS AS ELECTED UNDER THE PLANS, AND ARE $212 MILLION AND $179 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3, THE COMPANY HAS RESTATED ITS PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO REFLECT ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND RELATED TAX EFFECTS FOLLOWING AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF ITS

HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2003 TO 2005 ARE CURRENTLY BEING EXAMINED BY THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS). ADDITIONALLY, OUR 2006 TAX YEAR RETURN IS UNDER ADVANCE REVIEW BY THE IRS UNDER ITS COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROGRAM (CAP). THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO HAVE ONGOING AUDITS WITH VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL

JURISDICTIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

AARP

IN JANUARY 1998, WE ENTERED INTO A TEN-YEAR CONTRACT WITH

AARP TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEMBERS OF AARP. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO SUPPLEMENT BENEFITS COVERED UNDER TRADITIONAL MEDICARE (MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE), HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE, HEALTH

INSURANCE FOCUSED ON PERSONS BETWEEN 50 AND 64 YEARS OF AGE, AND OTHER PRODUCTS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, WE ARE COMPENSATED FOR TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND OTHER SERVICES AS WELL AS FOR ASSUMING UNDERWRITING RISK. WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO COMPLEMENT THE INSURANCE OFFERINGS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM THESE AARP INSURANCE OFFERINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY $5.0 BILLION IN 2006, $4.9 BILLION IN 2005 AND $4.5 BILLION IN 2004.

THE UNDERWRITING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE AARP MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE BUSINESS ARE DIRECTLY RECORDED AS AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO A RATE STABILIZATION FUND

(RSF). THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE UNDERWRITING RESULTS ARE PREMIUM REVENUE, MEDICAL COSTS, INVESTMENT INCOME, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, MEMBER SERVICE EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES AND PREMIUM TAXES. UNDERWRITING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS AN

INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE RSF AND ACCRUE TO THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF THE AARP POLICYHOLDERS, UNLESS CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES WERE TO EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF. TO THE EXTENT UNDERWRITING LOSSES EXCEED THE BALANCE IN THE RSF, WE WOULD HAVE TO FUND

THE DEFICIT. ANY DEFICIT WE FUND COULD BE RECOVERED BY UNDERWRITING GAINS IN FUTURE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERIODS OF THE CONTRACT. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FUND ANY UNDERWRITING DEFICITS. THE RSF BALANCE IS REPORTED IN OTHER POLICY LIABILITIES IN THE

ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CHANGES IN THE RSF ARE REPORTED IN MEDICAL COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THE RSF BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 IS CURRENTLY SUFFICIENT TO COVER POTENTIAL FUTURE

UNDERWRITING OR OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT.

PURSUANT TO OUR AGREEMENT, AARP ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE MANAGED SEPARATELY FROM OUR GENERAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE USED TO PAY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM. THESE ASSETS ARE INVESTED AT OUR DISCRETION, WITHIN INVESTMENT

GUIDELINES APPROVED BY AARP. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY RATES OF INVESTMENT RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS AND, UPON TRANSFER OF THE AARP CONTRACT TO ANOTHER ENTITY, WE WOULD TRANSFER CASH EQUAL IN AMOUNT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE DATE

OF TRANSFER TO THAT ENTITY. INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE RECORDED AS AN INCREASE TO THE AARP RSF AND WERE $94 MILLION, $90 MILLION AND $103 MILLION IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. ASSETS

UNDER MANAGEMENT ARE REPORTED AT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED DIRECTLY IN THE RSF ASSOCIATED WITH THE AARP PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE AMORTIZED COST, GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

WE LEASE FACILITIES, COMPUTER

HARDWARE AND OTHER EQUIPMENT UNDER LONG-TERM OPERATING LEASES THAT ARE NONCANCELABLE AND EXPIRE ON VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2025. RENT EXPENSE UNDER ALL OPERATING LEASES WAS $209 MILLION IN 2006, $152 MILLION IN 2005 AND $137 MILLION IN 2004. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, FUTURE MINIMUM ANNUAL LEASE PAYMENTS, NET OF SUBLEASE INCOME, UNDER ALL NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE AS FOLLOWS: $156 MILLION IN 2007, $144 MILLION IN 2008, $129 MILLION IN 2009, $99 MILLION IN 2010, $68 MILLION IN

2011, AND $370 MILLION THEREAFTER. IN 2006, WE SIGNED A FACILITY LEASE AGREEMENT, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN MARCH 2009 WITH TOTAL ESTIMATED LEASE PAYMENTS OF $229 MILLION OVER A 20 YEAR PERIOD. THESE ESTIMATED LEASE PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN

2012. EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AGREEMENTS WERE $281 MILLION IN 2006, $241 MILLION IN 2005 AND $266 MILLION IN 2004. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, FUTURE MINIMUM OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR NONCANCELABLE CONTRACTS WERE AS FOLLOWS: $182

MILLION IN 2007, $94 MILLION IN 2008, $50 MILLION IN 2009, $22 MILLION IN 2010, $8 MILLION IN 2011 AND $5 MILLION THEREAFTER.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

PACIFICARE ACQUISITION WE COMMITTED TO MAKE $50 MILLION IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS, WHICH HAS BEEN ACCRUED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ADDITIONALLY, WE AGREED TO INVEST $200 MILLION IN

CALIFORNIAS HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE TO FURTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND INVESTMENTS ARE AT OUR DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO THE ADVICE

AND OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES; HOWEVER, OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THE INVESTMENT COMMITMENT FULLY FUNDED BY THE END OF 2010. THE INVESTMENT COMMITMENT REMAINS IN PLACE FOR 20 YEARS AFTER FULL FUNDING. WE HAVE COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS

TOTALING $12 MILLION OF THE $50 MILLION CHARITABLE COMMITMENT AT THIS TIME.

DUE TO THE FINANCIAL RESTATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, THE COMPANY HAS

DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN OPTIONS EXERCISED BY NONEXECUTIVE OFFICER EMPLOYEES IN 2006 WERE DISCOUNT OPTIONS SUBJECT TO SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY NOTIFIED THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) ON FEBRUARY 28, 2007 THAT IT

WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE IRSS RESOLUTION PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO PAY ITS EMPLOYEES ADDITIONAL TAX COSTS UNDER SECTION 409A. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY WILL TAKE A CHARGE, NET OF TAX BENEFIT, OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

WE HAVE VARIOUS OUTSTANDING, UNUSED LETTERS OF CREDIT WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH AN AGGREGATE COMMITMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $57

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE, MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES.

FEES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 25, 2000, WHICH ALLEGED TWO CLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS, AN ERISA CLASS AND A NON-ERISA CLASS. AFTER THE COURT DISMISSED CERTAIN ERISA CLAIMS AND THE CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE AMERICAN

MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON JANUARY 11, 2002. ON OCTOBER 25, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART OUR MOTION TO DISMISS THE THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON MAY 21, 2003, WE FILED A

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR

BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. BROAD LATITUDE IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS. STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONGRESS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE ISSUES AS THE SUBJECT OF

PROPOSED LEGISLATION. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND RULES COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN

FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. FURTHER, WE MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS.

WE TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN AND ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS, AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND

HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS, STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND U.S. ATTORNEYS. SUCH

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS CAN RESULT IN ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO A FORMAL INVESTIGATION OF

OUR HISTORIC STOCK OPTION PRACTICES BY THE SEC, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND A RELATED REVIEW BY THE SPECIAL LITIGATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY, AND WE HAVE RECEIVED

REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS FROM U.S. CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND FROM THE MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL, WE GENERALLY HAVE COOPERATED AND WILL CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. AT THE

CONCLUSION OF THESE REGULATORY INQUIRIES, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES AS WELL AS OTHER SANCTIONS OR OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS DEFINED IN RULES

13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

(III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, WE USED

THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO) IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT AND THOSE CRITERIA, WE BELIEVE THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM HAS AUDITED

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, AS STATED IN THE REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, APPEARING UNDER ITEM 9A,

WHICH EXPRESSES UNQUALIFIED OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES.

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT, THAT UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT

AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR

FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND

FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION

OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF

THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY

BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED MARCH 5, 2007 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL
