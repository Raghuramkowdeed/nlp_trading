well-being services on behalf of local employers and consumers
nationwide. UnitedHealthcare&#146;s products are primarily
marketed to small and mid-size employers with up to 5,000
employees. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, this business served
approximately 8.3&nbsp;million individuals. With its risk-based
product offerings, UnitedHealthcare assumes the risk of both
medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for
a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate for a
one-year period. UnitedHealthcare also provides administrative
and other management services to customers that self-insure the
medical costs of their employees and their dependents, for which
UnitedHealthcare receives a fee. These customers retain the risk
of financing medical benefits for their employees, and
UnitedHealthcare administers the payment of customer funds to
physicians and other health care providers from customer-funded
bank accounts. Small employer groups are more likely to purchase
risk-based products because they are generally unable or
unwilling to bear a greater potential liability for health care
expenditures. UnitedHealthcare offers its products through
affiliates that are usually licensed as insurance companies or
as health maintenance organizations, depending upon a variety of
factors, including state regulations.

chronic conditions; and prescription drug management, which
promotes safe use of medications. UnitedHealthcare has designed
its programs to encourage consumers to be engaged and active
participants in managing their own health and well-being.
Further, UnitedHealthcare offers Web sites that provide access

holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require
registration with applicable state Departments of Insurance and
the filing of reports that describe capital structure,

for national provider and employer identifiers are currently
being developed by regulators. We intend to be in compliance by
the enforcement dates. However, where the law is far-reaching
and complex or the government delays in providing guidance on
some aspects of the law, the timeliness of our compliance

interpretation by the United States Department of Labor as well
as the federal courts. ERISA places controls on how our business
units may do business with employers who sponsor employee
benefit health plans, particularly those that maintain
self-funded plans. During 2003, we processed and administered
the payment of approximately $25&nbsp;billion of medical claims
on behalf of customers that self-insure the medical costs of

concentrated in more limited geographic areas. Our Specialized

financial strength and marketplace reputation.

large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and
minimize barriers to access, our point-of-service products and
our strong marketplace reputation. However, in some markets we
may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons, including
competitors with more resources, longer operating histories,

in this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K and in future filings by
us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">We must effectively manage our health care
costs.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Under risk-based product arrangements, we assume
the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our
customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from
risk-based products (excluding AARP) comprise approximately 75%
of our total consolidated revenues. We use approximately 80% to
85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care
services delivered to our customers. The profitability of our
risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to
accurately predict, price for, and effectively manage health
care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number
of individual services rendered and the cost of each service.
Our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month
period and is generally priced one to four months before
contract commencement. Services are delivered and related costs
are incurred when the contract commences. Although we base the
premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs
over the fixed premium period, inflation, regulations and other
factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and
reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use
of services, increased cost of individual services,
catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly
treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other
regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and
seasonal changes in the level of health care use. Relatively
small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as
a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant
changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs
increased by one percent for UnitedHealthcare&#146;s commercial
insured products, our annual net earnings for 2003 would have
been reduced by approximately $75&nbsp;million. In addition, the
financial results we report for any particular period include
estimates of costs incurred for which the underlying claims have
not been received by us or for which the claims have been
received but not processed. If these estimates prove too high or
too low, the effect of the change will be included in future
results.

<B><FONT size="2">We face intense competition in many of our
markets and customers have flexibility in moving between
competitors.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our businesses compete throughout the United
States and face significant competition in all of the geographic
markets in which they operate. For our Uniprise and Health Care
Services businesses, competitors include Aetna, Anthem, Cigna,
Coventry, Humana, PacifiCare, Oxford, WellPoint, numerous for
profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses
from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other
enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas. Our
Specialized Care Services and Ingenix businesses also compete
with a number of businesses. Moreover, we believe that barriers
to entry in many markets are not substantial, so the addition of
new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy
significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In
particular markets, these competitors may have capabilities that
give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share,
established reputation, superior supplier arrangements, existing
business relationships, and other factors all can provide a
competitive advantage. In addition, significant merger and
acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we
operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these
industries. This level of consolidation makes it more difficult
for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on
which we do business with our suppliers, and to maintain or
advance profitability.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">Our relationship with AARP is significant to
our Ovations business.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Under our 10-year contract with AARP which we
entered into in 1998, we provide Medicare Supplement and
Hospital Indemnity health insurance and other products to AARP
members. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, our portion of
AARP&#146;s insurance program represented approximately
$4.1&nbsp;billion in annual net premium revenue from
approximately 3.8&nbsp;million AARP members. The AARP contract
may be terminated early by us or AARP under certain
circumstances, including a material breach by either party,
insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the
financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement.
The success of our AARP arrangement depends, in part, on our
ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional
products and services, price the products and services
competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state
regulatory changes. Additionally, events that adversely affect
AARP or one of its other business partners for its member
insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of
our arrangement with AARP. For example, if customers were
dissatisfied with the products AARP offered or its reputation,
if federal legislation limited opportunities in the Medicare
market, or if the services provided by AARP&#146;s other
business partners were unacceptable, our business could be
adversely affected.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">The effects of the new Medicare reform
legislation on our business are uncertain.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Recently enacted Medicare reform legislation is
complex and wide-ranging. There are numerous provisions in the
legislation that will influence our business, although at this
early stage, it is difficult to predict the extent to which our
business will be affected. While uncertain as to impact, we
believe the increased funding provided in the legislation will
intensify competition in the seniors health services market.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">Our business is subject to intense government
scrutiny and we must respond quickly and appropriately to
frequent changes in government regulations.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our business is regulated at the federal, state,
local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our
business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject
to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies
administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and
rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict
revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and
administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our
liability in federal and state courts for coverage
determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We
must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of
our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products
and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in
obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals
could reduce our revenue or increase our costs.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We participate in federal, state and local
government health care coverage programs. These programs
generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that
may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce
the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our
administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such
changes have adversely affected our financial results and
willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may
do so in the future.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">State legislatures and Congress continue to focus
on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at
state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our
business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and
other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods
and payment rates; coverage determinations; claim payments and
processing; use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health information; and government-sponsored programs. We cannot
predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become
binding law or regulation, or, if enacted, what their terms will
be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to
expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we
conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We are also subject to various governmental
investigations, audits and reviews. Such oversight could result
in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain
programs, or the imposition of civil or criminal fines,
penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any
adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage
our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for
us to sell our products and services. We are currently involved
in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews.
These include routine, regular and special investigations,
audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, state insurance and health and welfare departments and
state attorneys general, the Office of Personnel Management, the
Office of the Inspector General and U.S.&nbsp;Attorney General.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">We depend on our relationships with
physicians, hospitals and other health care providers.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We contract with physicians, hospitals,
pharmaceutical benefit service providers and pharmaceutical
manufacturers, and other health care providers for favorable
prices. A number of organizations are advocating for legislation
that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care
professionals from federal and state antitrust laws. In any
particular market, these physicians and health care
professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments,
or take other actions that could result in higher health care
costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty
meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some
markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals,
physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician
groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies
that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">The nature of our business exposes us to
significant litigation risks and our insurance coverage may not
be sufficient to cover some of the costs associated with
litigation.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Periodically, we become a party to the types of
legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment
and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit
claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder
suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In
addition, because of the nature of our business, we are
routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to
the design, management and offerings of our services. These
matters include, but are not limited to, claims related to
health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions,
contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain
business practices. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits
were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the
health benefits business. The suits are purported class actions
on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal
statutes, including ERISA and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organization Act (&#147;RICO&#148;). Although the expenses which
we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action
lawsuits have not been material to our business, we will
continue to incur expenses in the defense of the 1999 class
action litigation and other matters, even if they are without
merit.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Following the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001,
the cost of business insurance coverage has increased
significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk
that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters
incidental to our business. We believe that we are adequately
insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance; however,
certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not
covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of
the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. Although
we believe the liabilities established for these risks are
adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may
exceed the liabilities recorded.

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">Our businesses depend significantly on
effective information systems and the integrity of the data in
our information systems.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our ability to adequately price our products and
services, provide effective and efficient service to our
customers, and to accurately report our financial results
depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our
information systems. As a result of our acquisition activities,
we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps
to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and
expanded our information systems capabilities. If the
information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be
inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively
our information systems and data integrity, we could lose
existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers,
have problems in determining medical cost estimates and
establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician
and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory
problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other
adverse consequences.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We depend on independent third parties, such as
IBM and Medco Health Solutions,&nbsp;Inc., with whom we have
entered into agreements, for significant portions of our data
center operations and pharmacy benefits management and
processing, respectively. Even though we have appropriate
provisions in our agreement with IBM and Medco, including
provisions with respect to specific performance standards,
covenants, warranties, audit rights, indemnification, and other
provisions, our dependence on these third parties makes our
operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately
under the contracts, due to internal or external factors.
Although there are a limited number of service organizations
with the size, scale and capabilities to effectively provide
certain of these services, especially with regard to pharmacy
benefits processing and management, we believe that other
organizations could provide similar services on comparable
terms. A change in service providers, however, could result in a
decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable
contract terms.

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">We must comply with emerging restrictions on
patient privacy, including taking steps to ensure compliance by
our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient
information when providing services to us.</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The use of individually identifiable data by our
businesses is regulated at international, federal and state
levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by
legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws
address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the
federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA. HIPAA also imposes
guidelines on our business associates (as this term is defined
in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for
appropriate protections through our contracts with our business
associates, we still have limited control over their actions and
practices. Compliance with these proposals and new regulations
may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes,
the development of new administrative processes, and the effects
of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also
may impose further restrictions on our use of patient
identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our
administrative databases.

<FONT size="2">The terrorist attacks launched on
September&nbsp;11, 2001, the war on terrorism, the threat of
future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers
and providers have negatively affected, and may continue to
negatively affect, the U.S.&nbsp;economy in general and our
industry specifically. Depending on the government&#146;s
actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and
insurance companies, future acts of terrorism and bio-terrorism
could lead to, among other things, increased use of health care
services including, without limitation, hospital and physician
services; loss of membership in health plans we administer as a
result of lay-offs or other reductions of employment; adverse
effects upon the financial condition or business of employers
who sponsor health care coverage for their employees; disruption
of our information and payment systems; increased health care
costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain
categories of risk, such as acts of terrorism; and disruption of
the financial and insurance markets in general.

<FONT size="2">The market prices of the securities of the
publicly-held companies in the industry in which we operate have
shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many external
factors, including general market trends, public communications
regarding managed care, litigation and judicial decisions,
legislative or regulatory actions, health care cost trends,
pricing trends, competition, earnings, membership reports of
particular industry participants and acquisition activity.
Despite our specific outlook or prospects, the market price of
our common stock may decline as a result of any of these
external factors. By way of illustration, our stock price has
ranged from $35.33 on December&nbsp;31, 2001 to $58.18 on
December&nbsp;31, 2003 (as adjusted to reflect stock splits and
dividends).

series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and
virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. A
multi-district litigation panel has consolidated several
litigation cases involving UnitedHealth Group and our affiliates
in the Southern District Court of Florida, Miami division. In
December 2000, the UnitedHealth Group litigation was
consolidated with litigation involving other industry members.
Generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations
of ERISA and RICO in connection with alleged undisclosed
policies intended to maximize profits. Other allegations include
breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract
claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical
services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive,
compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs,
fees and interest payments. Discovery commenced on
September&nbsp;30, 2002. In November 2002, the Eleventh Circuit
granted the industry defendants&#146; petition to review the
class certification order. That appeal is pending. On

March&nbsp;15, 2000, in the Supreme Court of the State of
New&nbsp;York, County of New&nbsp;York. On April&nbsp;13, 2000,
we removed this case to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New&nbsp;York. The suit alleges causes of
action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts
and practices, and trade libel in connection with the
calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for
non-network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive
and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest
payments. An amended complaint was filed on August&nbsp;25,
2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class
and a non-ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA
claims and the claims brought by the American Medical
Association, a third amended complaint was filed. On
October&nbsp;25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in
part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. We are
engaged in discovery in this matter.
