its products through subsidiaries that are usually licensed as
health maintenance organizations (&#147;HMOs&#148;), preferred
provider organizations (&#147;PPOs&#148;) or insurers, depending
upon state regulations. It also provides administrative and
other management services to health plans and self-funded
customers for which UnitedHealthcare receives a fee, as it does
not assume the risk of health care costs.

support for individuals at risk of needing intensive treatment;
continuous coordination for people with chronic conditions; and
prescription drug management, which promotes safe use of

life address their unique needs for preventative and acute
health care services, deal with chronic disease and respond to
specialized issues relating to their overall well-being.
Ovations is one of the few enterprises fully dedicated to this
market segment. As a part of this business, in January 1998, we
began a 10-year partnership with AARP, the nation&#146;s largest
organization for older Americans, and currently provide Medicare
supplement and hospital indemnity insurance to more than
3.5&nbsp;million AARP members. Ovations expanded services by
instituting AARP Eye Health Services, which offers affordable
eye exams, complimentary glaucoma screenings and discounts on
eyewear to AARP members. In addition, Ovations&#146; Medicare
Supplement Pharmacy Service addresses one of the most
significant cost problems facing older Americans&nbsp;&#151;
prescription drug costs, providing AARP members cost-savings and
greater access to prescription drugs and health and well-being
products. Ovations also developed an offering with lower cost
Medicare supplement coverage that provides consumers with a
hospital network and 24-hour access to health care information
from nurses. In June 2001, Ovations expanded its service
relationship with AARP to include AARP Pharmacy Services, the
country&#146;s largest pharmacy discount card program, offering
prescription drugs, over-the-counter products and drug store
products through a retail network and mail order service. AARP
Pharmacy Services is part of Ovations&#146; health and
well-being division, which provides consumers with access to
health care products, services and supporting health
information. In February 2002, Ovations expanded its AARP Nurse
HealthLine Services to cover beneficiaries of all AARP Medicare
products, providing 24-hour access to health information from
nurses. Ovations, through its licensed affiliates, provides its
products and services in all 50&nbsp;states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Medicare, Medicaid and private-pay long-term care products and
programs, EverCare is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life
and maximizing well-being for this unique population, while
preserving financial resources and ultimately minimizing
associated costs. EverCare offers a continuum of services
through innovative programs such as EverCare Choice, EverCare
Select and EverCare Connections. EverCare Choice is a Medicare
product that offers enhanced medical coverage to frail, elderly
and chronically ill populations in both nursing homes and

jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Federal and state regulatory
agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and
interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws

interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change
periodically. These revisions could affect our operations and
financial results. Enactment of federal and state health benefit
laws and regulations can also affect our businesses. Examples of
such laws and regulations include: health plan liability laws;
physician and provider prompt pay laws; data privacy; mandated
benefits; limits on contractual terms with physicians and other
health care providers, including audit, payment and termination
provisions; implementation of a mandatory third party review
process for coverage denials; and other laws and limits on
utilization management and restrictions on our ability to carve
out certain categories of risk, such as acts of terrorism.
Further, as our businesses continue to implement their

UnitedHealthcare and Ovations, has Medicare+Choice contracts
that are regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (&#147;CMS&#148;). CMS has the right to audit such
health plans in order to determine each plan&#146;s compliance
with CMS&#146; contracts and regulations and the quality of care
being given to members. The significant level of regulations
surrounding Medicare and Medicaid makes compliance in this
product line a continuing challenge. Our Health Care Services
segment also has Medicaid and State Children&#146;s Health
Insurance Program contracts that are subject to federal and

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer
insurance and HMO products regulate the activities of those
products and operations. Most states require periodic financial
reports and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve
requirements. Many of UnitedHealthcare&#146;s health plans and
each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state
insurance holding company regulations. Such regulations
generally require registration with the state department of
insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital
structure, ownership, financial condition, certain inter-company
transactions and general business operations. Some state
insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior
regulatory approval or, in some circumstances, prior notice of
acquisitions and material inter-company transfers of assets, as
well as transactions between the regulated companies and their
parent holding companies or affiliates. In addition, some of our
subsidiaries or products may by subject to PPO, managed care
organization (&#147;MCO&#148;) or third party administrator
(&#147;TPA&#148;) related regulations and licensure
requirements. These regulations differ greatly from state to
state, but generally contain network, contracting, financial and
reporting requirements. Many states also have enacted laws
and/or adopted regulations governing utilization review and
external appeals activities, and these laws may apply to some of
our operations. Additionally, there are laws and regulations
that set specific standards for delivery of services, prompt
payment of claims, confidentiality of consumer health
information and covered benefits and services. To date, these
various laws and regulations have not materially affected our

(&#147;HIPAA&#148;) apply to both the group and individual
health insurance markets, including self-funded employee benefit
plans. Covered entities must be compliant with standards for
electronic transactions and code sets by October 2002, and with
standards for privacy of protected health information by April
2003. New standards for health information security and national
provider and employer identifiers are currently being developed
by regulators. We are in the process of updating our business
practices to comply with these standards. We plan to be in
material compliance by the enforcement dates; however, the law
is far-reaching and complex and the government&#146;s delay in
providing guidance may affect the timeliness of our compliance
efforts. Additionally, different approaches to HIPAA&#146;s
provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different
states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our

These businesses are anchored in a common pursuit of improved

However, in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a
number of reasons, including competitors with more resources,
longer operating histories, larger market shares, broader

<B><FONT size="2">Health Care Costs</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We use a large portion of our premium revenues to
pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to
our customers. Total health care costs are affected by the
number of individual services rendered and the cost of each
service. Much of our premium revenue is priced before services
are delivered and the related costs are incurred, usually on a
prospective annual basis. Although we base the premiums we
charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the
fixed premium period, inflation, regulations and other factors
may cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated
and reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased
use of services, increased cost of individual services,
catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly
treatments, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes,
insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the
level of health care use. In addition, the financial results we
report for any particular period include estimates of costs
incurred that have not yet been reported to us. Because of these
estimates, our earnings may be adjusted later to reflect the
actual costs. Relatively small changes in medical costs as a
percentage of premium revenues and our ability to properly
estimate future health care costs over fixed premium periods can
create significant changes in our financial results because of
the relatively narrow margins of our insurance products.

<B><FONT size="2">Industry Factors</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The managed care industry receives significant
negative publicity and has been the subject of large jury
awards. This publicity has been accompanied by litigation,
legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of
industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our
ability to market our products or services, may require us to
change our products and services, and may increase the
regulatory burdens under which we operate, further increasing
our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our

<B><FONT size="2">Competition</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">In many of our geographic or product markets, we
compete with a number of other entities, some of which may have
certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a
competitive advantage. We believe the barriers to entry in these
markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors
can occur relatively easily, and consumers enjoy significant
flexibility in moving to new providers of health and well-being
services. Certain of our customers may decide to perform for
themselves functions or services we provide, which would
decrease our revenues. Certain of our contracted physicians and
other health care providers may decide to market products and
services to our customers in competition with us. In addition,
significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the
industry in which we operate as well as in industries that act
as suppliers to us, such as the hospital, physician,
pharmaceutical, medical device and health information systems
industries. To the extent that there is strong competition or
that competition intensifies in any market, our ability to
retain or increase customers or contracted physicians and other
health care providers, or maintain or increase our revenue
growth, pricing flexibility, control over medical cost trends
and marketing expenses may be adversely affected.

the federal, state and local levels and internationally. The
laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of
those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad
latitude is given to the agencies administering those
regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force us to
change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment
growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and
capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and
state courts for coverage determinations, contract
interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain
regulatory approvals to market many of our products. Delays in
obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could
adversely affect our revenue or could increase our costs. We
participate in federal, state and local government health care
coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to
frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of
persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement
or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care
costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected
our financial results and willingness to participate in such
programs in the past and may also do so in the future.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">State legislatures and Congress continue to focus
on health care issues. Congress is considering Patients&#146;
Bill of Rights legislation that, if adopted, could fundamentally
alter ERISA&#146;s treatment of liability for noncompliance,
fiduciary breach of contract and improper benefit coverage
denials. Other bills and regulations at state and federal levels
may affect certain aspects of our business including physician
and other health care provider contracting, claim payments and
processing, confidentiality of health information and
government-sponsored programs. While we cannot predict if any of
these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or
regulation, or if enacted, what their terms will be, their
enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded
liability, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct
business or put us at risk for a loss of business to new health
care funding arrangements. Further, as our businesses continue
to implement their e-commerce initiatives, uncertainty
surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this
area will make it difficult to ensure compliance.

adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage
our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for
us to sell our products and services. We are currently involved
in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews.
These include routine, regular and special investigations,

contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care

these providers, we believe our aggregate exposure to provider
relations issues is limited. A number of organizations are
advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these
providers from federal and state antitrust laws, the adoption of
which could affect this assessment. In any particular market,
these providers could refuse to contract, demand higher
payments, or take other actions that could result in higher
health care costs, less desirable products for customers or
difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In
some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals,
physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician
groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We may be a party to a variety of legal actions
that affect any business, such as employment and employment
discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of
contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, including
securities fraud, and intellectual property related litigation.
In addition, because of the nature of our businesses, we are
routinely party to a variety of legal actions related to the
design, management and offerings of our services. These matters
include: claims related to health care benefits coverage;
medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti-competitive and
unfair business activities; disputes over compensation and
termination of contracts including those with physicians and
other health care providers; disputes related to our
administrative services, including actions alleging claim
administration errors and failure to disclose rate discounts and
other fee and rebate arrangements; disputes over benefit
copayment calculations; claims related to disclosure of certain
business practices; and claims relating to customer audits and
contract performance. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits
were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the
health benefits business. The suits are purported class actions
on behalf of certain customers and physicians for alleged
breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and the Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (&#147;RICO&#148;). While we
believe these suits against us are without merit and we intend
to defend our position vigorously, we will incur expenses in the
defense of these matters and we cannot predict their outcome.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Recent court decisions and legislative activity
may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In
some cases, substantial non-economic, treble or punitive damages
may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of
these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not
be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the
amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages
awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive
damages, may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage
for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or
prohibitively expensive in the future.

<B><FONT size="2">Information Systems</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our businesses depend significantly on effective
information systems. Our information systems require an ongoing
commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance
existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with
continuing changes in information processing technology,
evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing
customer preferences. For example, the administrative
simplification provisions of HIPAA and the Department of
Labor&#146;s ERISA claim processing regulations may require

<FONT size="2">changes to current systems. In addition, we
obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other
services or facilities from independent third parties, which may
make our operations vulnerable to such third parties&#146;
failure to perform adequately. As a&nbsp;result of our
acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems and
have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems and have
upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities.
Failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems
could cause the loss of existing customers, difficulty in
attracting new customers, issues in determining medical cost
estimates, customer and physician and other health care provider
disputes, regulatory problems, increases in administrative
expenses or other adverse consequences.

<B><FONT size="2">Data and Proprietary Information</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Many of our products and services depend
significantly on the integrity of the data on which they are
based. If the information contained in our databases were found
or perceived to be inaccurate, or if such information were
generally perceived to be unreliable, commercial acceptance of
our database-related products would be adversely and materially
affected. Furthermore, the use of individually identifiable data
by our businesses is regulated at international, federal, state
and local levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by
legislation or administrative interpretation. These restrictions
could adversely affect revenues from certain of our products or
services and, more generally, affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">There are various recently adopted state laws
that address the use and maintenance of individually
identifiable health data. Most enact privacy provisions from the
federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Additionally, new federal
regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA are now effective with
compliance required by April 2003. Compliance with these
proposals and new regulations could result in cost increases due
to necessary systems changes and the development of new
administrative processes and may impose further restrictions on
our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or
more of our administrative databases. The success of our
knowledge and information-related businesses also depends
significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to
our databases and related products. We rely on our agreements
with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and
our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our
proprietary rights. We cannot assure that these legal
protections and precautions will prevent misappropriation of our
proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation
regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software
industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly
subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of
products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such
litigation could have an adverse effect on the ability of our
businesses to market and sell products and services and on our
financial condition and results of operations.

<B><FONT size="2">Administration and Management</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Efficient and cost-effective administration of
our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive
positioning. While we manage expenses, staff-related and other
administrative expenses may increase from time to time due to
business or product start-ups or expansions, growth or changes
in business or the mix of products purchased by customers,
acquisitions, regulatory requirements or other reasons.
Unanticipated expense increases may adversely affect our
financial results. Further, we believe we currently have an
experienced, capable management and technical staff. The market
for management and technical personnel, including information
systems professionals, in the health care industry is very
competitive. Loss of certain key employees or a number of
managers or technical staff could adversely affect our ability
to administer and manage our business.

<FONT size="2">We have an active ongoing acquisition and
disposition program under which we may engage in transactions
involving the acquisition or disposition of assets, products or
businesses, some or all of which may be material. These
transactions may entail certain risks and uncertainties and may
affect ongoing business operations because of unknown
liabilities, unforeseen administrative needs or increased
efforts to integrate the acquired operations. Failure to
identify liabilities, anticipate additional administrative needs
or effectively integrate acquired operations could result in
reduced revenues, increased administrative and other costs and
customer dissatisfaction.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The terrorist attacks launched on
September&nbsp;11, 2001, the war on terrorism, the threat of
future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers
and providers have negatively affected, and may continue to
negatively affect, the U.S.&nbsp;economy in general and our
industry specifically. Depending on the government&#146;s
actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and
insurance companies, future acts of terrorism and bio-terrorism
could adversely affect our Company through, among other things,
increased use of health care services including, without
limitation, hospital and physician services, ancillary testing
and procedures, increased prescriptions for certain drugs,
mental health and other services; loss of membership as a result
of lay-offs or other reductions of employment; adverse effects
upon the financial condition or business of employers who
sponsor health care coverage for their employees; disruption of
our information and payment systems; increased health care costs
due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain
categories of risk, such as acts of terrorism; and disruption of
the financial and insurance markets in general.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">From time to time in press releases and
otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other forward-looking
statements regarding our future results, including estimated
revenues, net earnings and other operating and financial
metrics. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various
assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant
uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may
prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast
depends on numerous risks and other factors (including those
described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our
control. As a result, we cannot assure that our performance will
be consistent with any management forecasts or that the
variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse.
You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our
business and prospects upon isolated predictions, but instead
are encouraged to utilize the entire publicly available mix of
historical and forward-looking information, as well as other
available information affecting us and our services, when
evaluating our prospective results of operations.

<FONT size="2">Changes in economic conditions could affect our
business and results of operations. The state of the economy
could affect our employer group renewal prospects and our
ability to increase prices in some of our businesses. Although
we are continuously striving to diversify our product offerings
to address the changing needs of consumers, there can be no
assurance that the effects of the current or a future downturn
in economic conditions will not cause our existing customers to
seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will
not result in significant loss of customers, or decreased
margins on our continuing customers.

Proceedings</I></FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">In September 1999, a group of plaintiffs&#146;
trial lawyers publicly announced that they were targeting the
managed care industry by way of class action litigation. Since
that time, we have received several purported class action
matters that generally challenge managed care practices
including cost containment mechanisms, disclosure obligations
and payment methodologies. We intend to defend vigorously all of
these cases.

<FONT size="2">In Re: Managed Care Litigation: MDL
No.&nbsp;1334. The multi-district litigation panel has
consolidated several litigation matters involving UnitedHealth
Group and its affiliates in the Southern District of Florida,
Miami division. The UnitedHealth Group matters have been
consolidated with litigation involving other industry members
for the coordination of pre-trial proceedings. The litigation
has been divided into two tracks, with one track comprising
consumer claims and the other health care provider claims.
Generally, the claims made in this consolidated litigation
allege violations of ERISA and RICO in connection with alleged
undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits. The
litigation also asserts breach of state prompt payment laws and
breach of contract claims alleging that UnitedHealth Group
affiliates fail to timely reimburse providers for medical
services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive,
compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs,
fees and interest payments. Following the Court&#146;s initial
decisions on industry members&#146; motions to dismiss the
complaints, amended complaints were filed in both tracks. On
February&nbsp;20, 2002 the Court granted in part and denied in
part the industry defendants&#146; motion to dismiss the amended
complaint in the member track litigation. In significant part,
the Court limited the RICO and ERISA claims that could be
brought by the plaintiffs, and dismissed entirely the common law
claims for civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment. On March 14,
2002, the Court certified to the 11th Circuit the threshold
issue of whether plaintiffs have standing to assert their RICO
claims. The 11th Circuit has not ruled as to whether they will
review the issue. All activity was stayed in the health care
provider track pending resolution of a threshold appeal to
determine which of the health care provider claims must be
arbitrated. On March&nbsp;14, 2002, the 11th Circuit affirmed
the trial court&#146;s arbitration ruling and it is anticipated
that the stay will be lifted. In both tracks, decisions are
pending on

<FONT size="2">The American Medical Association et al. v.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, United HealthCare Services,
Inc. and UnitedHealth Group was filed on March&nbsp;15, 2000 in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York.
On April&nbsp;13, 2000, we removed this case to federal court.
The suit alleges breach of contract and the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and
trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and
customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. The
suit seeks declaratory, injunctive, exemplary and compensatory
relief as well as costs, fees and interest payments. An amended
complaint was filed on August&nbsp;25, 2000, which alleged two
classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class and a non-ERISA class.
After the Court dismissed certain ERISA claims and the claims
brought by the American Medical Association, a third amended
complaint was filed. We have filed a motion to dismiss the third
amended complaint.
