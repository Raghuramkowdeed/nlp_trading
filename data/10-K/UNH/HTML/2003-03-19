<FONT size="2">UnitedHealthcare coordinates health and
well-being services on behalf of local employers and consumers
nationwide. UnitedHealthcare&#146;s products are primarily
marketed to small and mid-size employers with up to 5,000
employees. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, this business served
approximately 7.8&nbsp;million individuals. With its risk-based
product offerings, UnitedHealthcare assumes the risk of both
medical and administrative costs for its customers in return for
a monthly premium, which is typically at a fixed rate for a
one-year period. UnitedHealthcare also provides administrative
and other management services to customers that self-insure the
medical costs of their employees and their dependents, for which
UnitedHealthcare receives a fee. These customers retain the risk
of financing medical benefits for their employees, and
UnitedHealthcare administers the payment of customer funds to
physicians and other health care providers from customer-funded
bank accounts. Small employer groups are more likely to purchase
risk-based products because they are generally unable or
unwilling to bear a greater potential liability for health care
expenditures. UnitedHealthcare offers its products through
affiliates that are usually licensed as insurance companies or
as health maintenance organizations, depending upon a variety of
factors, including state regulations.

to care through more than 380,000 physicians and 3,500 hospitals

Services, which offers affordable eye exams, complimentary
glaucoma screenings and discounts on eyewear to AARP members and
an expanded AARP Nurse Health Line Service to cover
beneficiaries of all AARP Medicare products, providing 24-hour

health care information from nurses. Ovations&#146; revenues
from the AARP insurance offerings were approximately
$3.7&nbsp;billion in 2002.

coverage for the senior market primarily through the
Medicare+Choice program administered by the Centers for Medicare

these services were offered through UnitedHealthcare). Through
these programs, 225,000 Medicare beneficiaries were served as of
December&nbsp;31, 2002. The Medicare+Choice offerings in 2002
included additional benefits such as more extensive preventative

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">All of the states in which our subsidiaries offer
insurance and health maintenance products regulate those
products and operations. Most states require periodic financial
reports from us and impose minimum capital or restricted cash
reserve requirements. Many of our health plans and each of our
insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance
holding company regulations. Such regulations generally require
registration with applicable state Departments of Insurance and
the filing of reports that describe capital structure,
ownership, financial condition, certain inter-company
transactions and general business operations. Some state
insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior
regulatory approval of acquisitions and material inter-company
transfers of assets, as well as transactions between the
regulated companies and their parent holding companies or
affiliates. In addition, some of our subsidiaries or products
may be subject to PPO, managed care organization
(&#147;MCO&#148;) or TPA-related regulations and licensure
requirements. These regulations differ greatly from state to
state, but generally contain network, contracting, financial and
reporting requirements. Many states also have enacted laws
and/or adopted regulations governing utilization review and
external appeals activities, and these laws may apply to some of
our operations. Additionally, there are laws and regulations
that set specific standards for delivery of services, prompt
payment of claims, confidentiality of consumer health
information and covered benefits and services. To date, these
various laws and regulations have not materially affected our

to HIPAA are now effective, with compliance required by April
2003. These regulations include minimum standards for electronic
transactions and code sets, and for the privacy and security of
protected health information. We are currently in compliance
with these regulations. New standards for national provider and
employer identifiers are currently being developed by
regulators. We intend to be in compliance by the enforcement
dates; however, the law is far-reaching and complex and the
government&#146;s delay in providing guidance on some aspects of
the law may affect the timeliness of our compliance efforts.
Additionally, different approaches to HIPAA&#146;s provisions

We continue to emphasize our regulatory compliance efforts for

highly technical nature of the regulations mean that compliance
efforts in this arena will continue to require significant

insurance plans and products or one of our other operations to
investigate issues such as utilization management; financial,

<B><FONT size="2">Health Care Costs</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We use a large portion of our premium revenues to
pay the costs of health care services delivered to our
customers. Accordingly, the profitability of our risk-based
products depends in large part on our ability to accurately
predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs.
Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual
services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium
revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month period and is
generally priced three months before contract commencement.
Services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the
contract commences. Although we base the premiums we charge on
our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium
period, inflation, regulations and other factors may cause
actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and
reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use
of services, increased cost of individual services,
catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly
treatments, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes,
insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the
level of health care use. Relatively small differences between
predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium
revenues can result in significant changes in our financial
results because of the relatively narrow operating margins of
our risk-based arrangements. In addition, the financial results
we report for any particular period include estimates of costs
incurred for which the underlying claims have not been received
by us or for which the claims have been received but not
processed. If these estimates prove too high or too low, our
earnings may be adjusted later based on actual costs.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The health and well-being industries receive
significant negative publicity and have been the subject of
large jury verdicts. This publicity has been accompanied by
litigation, legislative activity, regulation and governmental
review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect
our ability to market our products or services, may require us
to change our products and services, and may increase the
regulatory burdens under which we operate, further increasing
our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our
profitability.

<B><FONT size="2">Competition</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">In many of our geographic or product markets, we
compete with a number of other entities, some of which may have
certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a
competitive advantage. We believe the barriers to entry in
certain markets are not substantial, so the addition of new
competitors can occur relatively easily, and consumers enjoy
significant flexibility in moving to competitors. Some of our
customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or
services we provide, which would decrease our revenues. Some of
our contracted physicians and other health care providers may
decide to market products and services to our customers in
competition with us. In addition, significant merger and
acquisition activity has occurred in the industry in which we
operate as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us,
such as the hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, medical device
and health information systems industries. To the extent that
there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in
any market, our ability to retain or increase customers or
contracted physicians and other health care providers, or
maintain or increase our revenue growth, pricing flexibility,
control over medical cost trends and marketing expenses may be
adversely affected.

(SCHIP) operations depend on a number of factors, including
program reimbursement increases, government regulations, benefit
design, physician and other health care provider contracting,
state budgetary pressures (Medicaid and SCHIP) and other
factors. There can be no assurance that any or all of our
government program operations will be profitable in future
periods.

<B><FONT size="2">Government Regulation</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our business is regulated at the federal, state,
local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our
business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject
to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies
administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and
rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict
revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and
administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our
liability in federal and state courts for coverage
determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We
must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of
our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products
and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in
obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals
could reduce our revenue or increase our costs.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We participate in federal, state and local
government health care coverage programs. These programs
generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that
may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce
the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our
administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such
changes have adversely affected our financial results and
willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may
do so in the future.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">State legislatures and Congress continue to focus
on health care issues. Bills and regulations at state and
federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business,
including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other
health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and
payment rates; coverage determinations; claim payments and
processing; use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health information; medical malpractice litigation reform; and
government-sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these
initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation,
or, if enacted, what their terms will be, but their enactment
could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability,
require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or
put us at risk for a loss of business to new health care funding
arrangements.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We are also subject to various governmental
investigations, audits and reviews. Such oversight could result
in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain
programs, or the imposition of civil or criminal fines,
penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any
adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage
our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for
us to sell our products and services. We are currently involved
in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews.
These include routine, regular and special investigations,
audits and reviews by the CMS, state and health insurance
departments and state attorneys general, the Office of Personnel
Management, the Office of the Inspector General and U.S.
Attorneys. Although the results of pending matters are always
uncertain, we do not believe the results of any of the current
investigations, audits or reviews, individually

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our operations are conducted through our
subsidiaries. These companies are subject to state regulations
that, among other things, may require the maintenance of minimum
levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and may
restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other
distributions that may be paid to their respective parent
companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that
may be paid by our regulated subsidiaries, without prior
approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on
the subsidiary&#146;s level of statutory net income, statutory
capital and surplus. We use cash generated from operations,
commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and
financial flexibility. The agencies that assess our
creditworthiness also consider statutory capital levels when
establishing our debt ratings. We maintain an aggregate
statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is
significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require.

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">Physician, Hospital and Other Health Care
Provider Relations</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">One of the significant techniques we use to
contain health care costs and facilitate care delivery is to
contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit
managers and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care
providers for favorable prices. A number of organizations are
advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these
physicians and health care professionals from federal and state
antitrust laws. In any particular market, these physicians and
health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand
higher payments, or take other actions that could result in
higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers
or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements.
In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly
hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty
physician groups, may have significant market positions or near
monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on
our part.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">Litigation and Insurance</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Sometimes we become a party to the types of legal
actions that can affect any business, such as employment and
employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit
claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder
suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In
addition, because of the nature of our businesses, we are
routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to
the design, management and offerings of our services. These
matters include, but are not limited to, claims related to
health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions,
contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain
business practices. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits
were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the
health benefits business. The suits are purported class actions
on behalf of certain customers and physicians for alleged
breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and the Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (&#147;RICO&#148;). We will
incur expenses in the defense of these matters, even if they are
without merit.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Recent court decisions and legislative activity
may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In
some cases, substantial non-economic, treble or punitive damages
may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of
these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not
be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the
amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages
awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive
damages, may not be covered by insurance. The cost of general
business insurance coverage has increased significantly
following the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001. As a result, we
have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure,
particularly with respect to routine matters incidental to our
business. We record liabilities for our estimates of the
probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. Although we
believe the liabilities established for these risks are
adequate, there can be no assurance that the level of actual
losses will not exceed the liabilities recorded.

<B><FONT size="2">Data Integrity and Information
Systems</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Our businesses depend significantly on effective
information systems and the integrity of the data we use to run
these businesses. Our ability to adequately price our products
and services, provide effective and efficient service to our
customers, and to accurately report our financial results
depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our
information systems. As a result of our acquisition activities,
we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps
to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and
expanded our information systems capabilities. If the
information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be
inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively
our information systems and data integrity, we could lose
existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers,
have problems in determining medical cost estimates and
establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician
and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory
problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other
adverse consequences. Our information systems require an ongoing
commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance
existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with
continuing changes in information processing technology,
evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing
customer preferences. For example, the administrative
simplification provisions of HIPAA and the Department of
Labor&#146;s ERISA claim processing regulations require changes
to our current systems.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We depend on independent third parties for
significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment,
facilities, and certain data, including data center operations,
data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data
processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to
such third parties&#146; failure to perform adequately under the
contract, due to internal or external factors. Although there
are a limited number of service organizations with the size,
scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these
services, especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing
and management, we believe that other organizations could
provide similar services on comparable terms. A change in
service providers, however, could result in a decline in service
quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which
could adversely affect our operating results.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><FONT size="2">Proprietary Information and Privacy
Regulations</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The use of individually identifiable data by our
businesses is regulated at international, federal, state and
local levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by
legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws
address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable
health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the
federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA. HIPAA also imposes
guidelines on our business associates (as this term is defined
in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for
appropriate protections through our contracts with our business
associates, we still have limited control over their actions and
practices. Compliance with these proposals and new regulations
may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes,
the development of new administrative processes, and the effects
of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also
may impose further restrictions on our use of patient
identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our
administrative databases.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">The success of our knowledge and
information-related businesses also depends significantly on our
ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and
related products. We rely on our agreements with customers,
confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade
secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary
rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent
misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition,
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights
exists in the software industry, and we expect software products
to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as
the number of products and competitors in this industry segment
grows. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the
ability of our businesses to market and sell products and
services and on our consolidated results of operations.

<FONT size="2">Efficient and cost-effective administration of
our operations is essential to our profitability and competitive
positioning. Staff-related and other operating expenses may
increase from time to time due to business or product start-ups
or expansions, growth or changes in business or the mix of
products purchased by customers, acquisitions, regulatory
requirements or other reasons. Unanticipated expense increases
may adversely affect our financial results. We believe we
currently have an experienced, capable management and technical
staff. The market for management and technical personnel,
including information systems professionals, in the health care
industry is very competitive. Loss of key employees or a number
of managers or technical staff could adversely affect our
ability to administer and manage our business.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We market our products and services through both
employed sales people and independent sales agents. The
departure of key sales employees or agents or a large subset of
these individuals could impair our ability to retain existing
customers. Some of our customers or potential customers consider
our debt ratings, accreditation or certification by various
private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or
important. Some of our health plans or other business units may
not have obtained or maintained, or may not desire or be able to
obtain or maintain, such ratings, accreditation or
certification, which could adversely affect our ability to
obtain or acquire or retain business from these customers and
potential customers.

<B><FONT size="2">Acquisitions and Dispositions</FONT></B>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">We have an active ongoing acquisition and
disposition program under which we may engage in transactions
involving the acquisition or disposition of assets, products or
businesses, some or all of which may be material. These
transactions may entail risks and uncertainties and may affect
ongoing business operations because of unknown liabilities,
unforeseen administrative needs or the use of resources to
integrate the acquired operations. Failure to identify
liabilities, anticipate additional administrative needs or
effectively integrate acquired operations could result in
reduced revenues, increased administrative and other costs and
customer dissatisfaction.

future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers
and providers have negatively affected, and may continue to
negatively affect, the U.S. economy in general and our industry
specifically. Depending on the government&#146;s actions and the
responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance
companies, future acts of terrorism and bio-terrorism could
adversely affect us through, among other things, increased use
of health care services including, without limitation, hospital
and physician services; loss of membership in health plans we
administer as a result of lay-offs or other reductions of
employment; adverse effects upon the financial condition or
business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their
employees; disruption of our information and payment systems;
increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability
to carve out certain categories of risk, such as acts of
terrorism; and disruption of the financial and insurance markets
in general.

<FONT size="2">In September 1999, a group of plaintiffs&#146;
trial lawyers publicly announced that they were targeting the
managed care industry by way of class action litigation. Since
that time, several claims against us have been alleged that
generally challenge managed care practices, including cost
containment mechanisms, disclosure obligations and payment
methodologies. These claims are described in the following
paragraph. We intend to defend vigorously all of these claims.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><FONT size="2">In Re: Managed Care Litigation: MDL
No.&nbsp;1334. </FONT></I><FONT size="2">A multi-district
litigation panel has consolidated several litigation cases
involving UnitedHealth Group and our affiliates in the Southern
District Court of Florida, Miami division. The first of these
suits was initiated in February 2000. In December 2000, the
UnitedHealth Group litigation was consolidated with litigation
involving other industry members for the coordination of
pre-trial proceedings. The litigation has been divided into two
tracks, with one track comprising consumer claims and the other
health care provider claims. Generally, the claims made in this
consolidated litigation allege violations of ERISA and RICO in
connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to
maximize profits. The litigation also asserts breach of state
prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims alleging that
UnitedHealth Group affiliates fail to timely reimburse providers
for medical services rendered. The consolidated suits seek
injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as
restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. Following the
Court&#146;s initial decisions on industry members&#146; motions
to dismiss the complaints, amended complaints were filed in both
tracks. On February&nbsp;20, 2002, the Court granted in part and
denied in part the industry defendants&#146; motion to dismiss
the amended complaint in the consumer track litigation. In
significant part, the Court limited the RICO and ERISA claims
that could be brought by the plaintiffs, and dismissed entirely
the common law claims for civil conspiracy and unjust
enrichment. On September&nbsp;26, 2002, the trial court denied
the consumer track plaintiffs&#146; motion for class
certification while granting the health care provider track
plaintiffs&#146;

tracks of the litigation on September&nbsp;30, 2002. The
Eleventh Circuit granted the industry defendants&#146; petition
seeking review of the district court&#146;s certification order
in the health care provider track litigation. On
February&nbsp;24, 2003, the United States Supreme Court heard

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, United HealthCare Services,

lawsuit was filed on March&nbsp;15, 2000, in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York. On April&nbsp;13,
2000, we removed this case to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes
of action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts
and practices, and trade libel in connection with the
calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for
non-network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive
and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest
payments. An amended complaint was filed on August&nbsp;25,
2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class
and a non-ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA
claims and the claims brought by the American Medical
Association, a third amended complaint was filed. On
October&nbsp;25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in
part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. We are
engaged in discovery in this matter.
