PROPOSED HEALTH CARE REFORMS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, FINANCIAL POSITION AND OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS HAVE RECENTLY PASSED BILLS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE REFORM, WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN

RECONCILED WITH EACH OTHER AND SIGNED INTO LAW. EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSALS INCLUDE POLICY CHANGES THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING HAVING THE FEDERAL OR ONE OR MORE STATE GOVERNMENTS ASSUME A LARGER

ROLE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SUCH AS COMPETING WITH PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS, IMPOSING NEW AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON HEALTH INSURERS AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, GUARANTEED COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, ELIMINATION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITION

EXCLUSIONS OR ANNUAL LIFETIME MAXIMUM LIMITS, RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO PRICE PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, OR RESTRUCTURING THE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID PROGRAMS, INCLUDING REDUCING PAYMENTS TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE

ADVANTAGE OVER THE INTERMEDIATE TERM. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED VARIOUS FORMS OF MANAGED CARE REFORM LEGISLATION, WHICH, IF ADOPTED, COULD FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF COVERAGE DECISIONS UNDER ERISA.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS LEGISLATIVE INTEREST IN MODIFYING ERISAS PREEMPTIVE EFFECT ON STATE LAWS. IF ADOPTED, SUCH LIMITATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR LIABILITY EXPOSURE AND COULD PERMIT GREATER STATE REGULATION OF OUR OPERATIONS.

A NUMBER OF STATE LEGISLATURES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, NEW YORK, OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA, HAVE CONTEMPLATED BUT HAVE NOT ENACTED

SIGNIFICANT REFORM OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. OTHER STATES ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIDER SIGNIFICANT REFORM OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS AS WELL AS MORE MODEST REFORMS AIMED AT EXPANDING MEDICAID AND/OR SCHIP ELIGIBILITY AND NEW

COVERAGE OPTIONS FOR THOSE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE PROVISIONS AFFECTING BOTH PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND PRIVATELY FINANCED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. STATES ALSO ARE CONSIDERING PROPOSALS THAT

WOULD REFORM THE UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING PRACTICES OF INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS BY, FOR EXAMPLE, PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON RATING AND PRICING AND MANDATING MINIMUM MEDICAL BENEFIT COST RATIOS.

THE ENACTMENT OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL MAY AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS,

HOSPITALS AND/OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; MEDICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER COSTS; PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT METHODS AND PAYMENT RATES; PREMIUM RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; MANDATED BENEFITS; MINIMUM MEDICAL EXPENDITURES; CLAIM

PAYMENTS AND PROCESSING; DRUG UTILIZATION AND PATIENT SAFETY EFFORTS; COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, MAINTENANCE AND DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION; PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS; CONSUMER-DRIVEN HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH SAVINGS

ACCOUNTS AND INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS; AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS.

WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME

LAW, OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS OR THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO SUCH LAWS WILL BE. ANY HEALTH CARE REFORMS ENACTED MAY BE PHASED IN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT, IF ENACTED, COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES, INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO

EXPANDED LIABILITY AND REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL,

AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH CHANGES.

IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY ESTIMATE, PRICE FOR AND MANAGE OUR

MEDICAL COSTS, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COULD DECLINE AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

UNDER OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. WE GENERALLY USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO 85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO

PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE MEDICAL COSTS.

WE MANAGE MEDICAL COSTS THROUGH UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, PRODUCT DESIGN, NEGOTIATION

OF FAVORABLE PROVIDER CONTRACTS AND CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. TOTAL MEDICAL COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM REVENUE ON COMMERCIAL POLICIES IS TYPICALLY FIXED FOR A

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. OUR REVENUE ON MEDICARE POLICIES IS BASED ON BIDS SUBMITTED IN JUNE THE YEAR BEFORE THE CONTRACT YEAR. WE

BASE THE PREMIUMS WE CHARGE AND OUR MEDICARE BIDS ON OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE MEDICAL COSTS OVER THE FIXED CONTRACT PERIOD; HOWEVER, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, REGULATION AND OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND

REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS OR BIDS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED USE OF SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES, CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER

REGULATORY CHANGES, INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. AS A MEASURE OF THE IMPACT OF MEDICAL COSTS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL

COSTS OR UTILIZATION RATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED BY 1% WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL CHANGE IN RELATED REVENUES FOR COMMERCIAL INSURED PRODUCTS, OUR

ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2009 WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY

PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR WHICH CLAIMS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE AN EXTENSIVE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO LOW, THEY WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE

RESULTS.

OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLY REGULATED; NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR THEIR

ENFORCEMENT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT

THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2009, CMS IMPLEMENTED A REDUCTION IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

REIMBURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY 5% FOR 2010. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ADJUSTED MEMBERS BENEFITS AND PREMIUMS ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, TERMINATED BENEFIT PLANS IN CERTAIN COUNTIES, AND INTENSIFIED BOTH OUR MEDICAL AND OPERATING COST MANAGEMENT IN RESPONSE

TO THESE RATE REDUCTIONS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY ON THESE OR OTHER STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH REDUCTIONS.

THE BROAD LATITUDE THAT IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR

BUSINESS, AS WELL AS FUTURE LAWS AND RULES, COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND

STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN OCTOBER 2008 CONGRESS ENACTED THE PAUL WELLSTONE AND PETE DOMENICI MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2008 (MHPAEA), WHICH REQUIRES

INSURERS TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER BENEFITS UNDER TERMS THAT ARE NO MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THOSE APPLIED TO MEDICAL AND SURGICAL BENEFITS. THE MHPAEA SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED THE SECRETARIES OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

AND THE TREASURY TO ISSUE REGULATIONS TO EFFECTUATE THE LEGISLATION. ALTHOUGH REGULATIONS REGARDING HOW THE MHPAEA WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WERE ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2010 IN THE FORM OF AN INTERIM FINAL RULE, FINAL REGULATIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

PUBLISHED. BECAUSE OF THE BROAD RANGE OF TREATMENT LIMITATIONS TO WHICH PARITY IS EXPECTED TO APPLY UNDER THE REGULATIONS, THE REGULATIONS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH INSURED AND SELF-INSURED PLANS FOR

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND SERVICES AND IMPACT OUR MARKET FOR CARVE-OUT HEALTH BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS.

WE MUST ALSO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, INCLUDING

INTEGRATION OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. DELAYS IN OBTAINING APPROVALS OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

IN AUGUST 2007, WE ENTERED INTO A MULTI-STATE NATIONAL AGREEMENT WITH REGULATORY OFFICES IN 39 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RELATING TO UNITEDHEALTHCARES FULLY INSURED COMMERCIAL BUSINESS

ADMINISTERED ON THE

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORGANIZATIONS MAIN PROCESSING PLATFORMS. THE AGREEMENT COVERS SEVERAL KEY AREAS OF REVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CLAIMS PAYMENT ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, APPEALS AND

GRIEVANCES RESOLUTION TIMELINESS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL NETWORK/SERVICE, UTILIZATION REVIEW, EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS ACCURACY, AND OVERSIGHT AND DUE DILIGENCE OF CONTRACTED ENTITIES AND VENDOR PERFORMANCE. THE AGREEMENT ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED

PAST REGULATORY MATTERS RELATED TO THE AREAS OF REVIEW PRIOR TO AUGUST 2007 AND ESTABLISHES A TRANSPARENT FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING AND REGULATING PERFORMANCE THROUGH DECEMBER 2010. THE AGREEMENT IS SIMILAR TO A CUSTOMER PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE,

WHEREBY WE SELF REPORT QUARTERLY AND ANNUALLY OUR CURRENT OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ON A SET OF NATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AGREED TO BY THE PARTICIPATING STATES. WE MUST PERFORM TO THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, OR BE SUBJECT TO FINES

AND PENALTIES.

WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ROUTINE,

REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, U.S.

CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE IRS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2007, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE EXAMINED OUR PACIFICARE HEALTH

INSURANCE PLAN IN CALIFORNIA. THE EXAMINATION FINDINGS RELATED TO CLAIMS PROCESSING ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INTEREST PAYMENTS, TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF PROVIDER CONTRACTS, TIMELY, ACCURATE PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND OTHER

RELATED MATTERS. THE MATTER IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF OUR ADMINISTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WITH

RESPECT TO ERISA COMPLIANCE. REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS SORT CAN LEAD TO GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE

WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, INCLUDING NEGATIVE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ROUTINE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK

PRICE, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND RESULT IN INCREASED REGULATION AND LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES, WHICH MAY FURTHER INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY BY ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR

ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, REQUIRING US TO CHANGE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR INCREASING THE REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES, SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE CURRENT RECESSIONARY U.S. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT

RATES AND SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT LAYOFFS AND DOWNSIZINGS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO LEAD TO LOWER ENROLLMENT IN OUR EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS, LOWER ENROLLMENT IN OUR NON-EMPLOYER INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND A HIGHER NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OPTING OUT OF OUR

EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS. ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE EMPLOYERS TO STOP OFFERING CERTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OR ELECT TO OFFER THIS COVERAGE ON A VOLUNTARY, EMPLOYEE-FUNDED BASIS AS A MEANS

TO REDUCE THEIR OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EMPLOYER GROUP RENEWAL PROSPECTS AND OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PREMIUMS AND COULD RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY OUR

CUSTOMERS. ALL OF THESE COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN OUR MEMBERSHIP LEVELS AND PREMIUM AND FEE REVENUES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF

HOSPITALS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS AND THEREFORE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONTRACTED RATES WITH THESE PARTIES AND INCREASE OUR MEDICAL COSTS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, RESULTING IN

REDUCED REIMBURSEMENTS OR PAYMENTS IN OUR FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND SCHIP. A REDUCTION IN STATE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PAYMENTS ALREADY

NEGOTIATED AND/OR RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETARY PRESSURES COULD CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE NEW OR A HIGHER LEVEL OF TAXES OR

ASSESSMENTS FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES ON INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND SURCHARGES ON SELECT FEE-FOR-SERVICE AND CAPITATED MEDICAL CLAIMS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESSES PROVIDING PBM SERVICES FACE REGULATORY AND OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PBM INDUSTRY THAT MAY DIFFER

FROM THE RISKS OF OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING MANAGED CARE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

WE PROVIDE PBM SERVICES THROUGH OUR PRESCRIPTION

SOLUTIONS AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES. EACH BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE ANTI-KICKBACK AND OTHER LAWS THAT GOVERN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE

LEGISLATURES REGULARLY CONSIDER NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OR REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR PBM BUSINESSES.

OUR PBM

BUSINESSES PROVIDE SERVICES TO SPONSORS OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO ERISA. THE DOL, WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT ENFORCES ERISA, COULD ASSERT THAT THE FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE APPLY TO SOME OR ALL OF THE SERVICES

PROVIDED BY OUR PBM BUSINESSES EVEN WHERE OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO ASSUME FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS. IN THE EVENT A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS APPLY TO OUR PBM BUSINESSES IN CONNECTION WITH SERVICES

FOR WHICH OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO ASSUME FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS OR ENTERING INTO CERTAIN PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS.

PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS ALSO CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS A MAIL ORDER PHARMACY, WHICH SUBJECTS IT TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE

FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. FURTHER, PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS IS SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARDS, WHICH IS A MULTIFACETED

SECURITY STANDARD THAT INCLUDES REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT, POLICIES, PROCEDURES, NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE DESIGN AND OTHER CRITICAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES TO PROTECT CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DATA AS MANDATED BY THE CREDIT CARD BRANDS. THE

FAILURE TO ADHERE TO SUCH STANDARDS COULD EXPOSE PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS TO LIABILITY OR IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, OUR PBM BUSINESSES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO CONTRACT ON FAVORABLE TERMS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND COULD FACE POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED ERRORS BY OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES,

INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. DISRUPTIONS AT ANY OF OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES DUE TO FAILURE OF TECHNOLOGY OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OR DISRUPTION TO

THESE SYSTEMS OR TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE DUE TO FIRE, ELECTRICAL OUTAGE, NATURAL DISASTER, ACTS OF TERRORISM OR SOME OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS AND DISPENSE PRESCRIPTIONS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO

CUSTOMERS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN

BUSINESSES PROVIDING HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT

THE UNITED STATES AND FACE COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES ON THE BASIS OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICE OF BENEFITS OFFERED AND COST AND RISK OF ALTERNATIVES, LOCATION AND CHOICE OF

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE,

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPREHENSIVENESS OF COVERAGE OFFERED, REPUTATION FOR QUALITY CARE, FINANCIAL STABILITY AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR OUR HEALTH BENEFITS REPORTING SEGMENT, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA

INC., CIGNA CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HEALTH NET, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE, WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND

OTHER ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKET SEGMENTS SUCH AS MEDICARE SPECIALTY SERVICES. FOR OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, COMPETITORS INCLUDE MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., CVS/CAREMARK CORPORATION AND EXPRESS

SCRIPTS, INC. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND INGENIX REPORTING SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A BROAD AND DIVERSE SET OF OTHER BUSINESSES.

WE BELIEVE THAT

BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN MANY MARKETS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL, SO THE ADDITION OF NEW COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CUSTOMERS ENJOY SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS. IN PARTICULAR MARKETS, COMPETITORS MAY HAVE

CAPABILITIES OR RESOURCES THAT GIVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. GREATER MARKET SHARE, ESTABLISHED REPUTATION, SUPERIOR SUPPLIER OR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER FACTORS ALL CAN PROVIDE A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR TO THEIR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BOTH AS TO OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND OTHER CARE PROFESSIONALS) IN THESE INDUSTRIES. CONSOLIDATION MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS, TO

IMPROVE THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, OR TO MAINTAIN OR ADVANCE PROFITABILITY. IF WE DO NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR MARKETS, IF WE SET RATES TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, IF WE DO NOT DESIGN AND PRICE

OUR PRODUCTS PROPERLY AND COMPETITIVELY, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO INNOVATE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT DEMONSTRATE VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IF WE DO NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY LEVEL OF SERVICES, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DOES

NOT INCREASE AS WE EXPECT, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DECLINES, OR IF WE LOSE ACCOUNTS WITH MORE PROFITABLE PRODUCTS WHILE RETAINING OR INCREASING MEMBERSHIP IN ACCOUNTS WITH LESS PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AS A PAYER IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAM FUNDING, ENROLLMENTS, PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS AND AUDITS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING AS A PAYER IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, VARIOUS MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP, AND RECEIVE

REVENUES FROM THESE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR

ADMINISTRATIVE OR MEDICAL COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE, CMS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED A REDUCTION IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REIMBURSEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY 5% FOR 2010. SUCH CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND WILLINGNESS

TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICARE

ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, AND VARIOUS MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP OCCURS THROUGH BIDS THAT ARE SUBMITTED PERIODICALLY. REVENUES FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PERIODIC FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND

ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING THROUGH VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS. FUNDING FOR THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AT THE FEDERAL OR APPLICABLE

STATE LEVEL, AND GENERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AND PRIORITIES. A REDUCTION OR LESS THAN EXPECTED INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS OR CHANGE IN ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CMS USES VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING DETERMINING PAYMENTS BY CONSIDERING THE RISK STATUS

OF OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS AS SUPPORTED BY PROVIDER MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENTATION. FEDERAL REGULATORS AUDIT THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS AND CAN REVISE PAYMENTS BASED ON THE AUDIT FINDINGS. CMS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 THAT IT WILL PERFORM AUDITS OF SELECTED

MEDICARE HEALTH PLANS EACH YEAR TO

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALIDATE THE CODING PRACTICES OF AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MAINTAINED BY CARE PROVIDERS. THESE AUDITS INVOLVE A REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS MAINTAINED BY PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AND OUT OF

NETWORK, AND MAY RESULT IN PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO HEALTH PLANS PURSUANT TO CMS MEDICARE CONTRACTS. CERTAIN OF OUR PLANS HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR AUDIT. THE FIRST AUDITS FOCUSED ON MEDICAL RECORDS SUPPORTING RISK

ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR 2006 THAT WERE USED TO DETERMINE 2007 PAYMENT AMOUNTS. THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR HHS IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF OUR RISK ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR TWO PLANS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE AUDITS. HOWEVER, ANY

MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ACQUIRE MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND

SCHIP ENROLLEES IS IMPACTED BY BIDS AND PLAN DESIGNS SUBMITTED BY OUR COMPETITORS AND US. UNDER THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM, STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES ARE PERIODICALLY REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO SEEK BIDS FROM ELIGIBLE HEALTH PLANS TO CONTINUE

THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACUTE CARE MEDICAID HEALTH PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING RENEWALS OF STATE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS THAT WERE ENROLLED IN THOSE MEDICAID PLANS. UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D

PROGRAM, TO QUALIFY FOR AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME MEMBERS, OUR BIDS MUST RESULT IN AN ENROLLEE PREMIUM BELOW A THRESHOLD, WHICH IS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER OUR BIDS ARE SUBMITTED. IF THE ENROLLEE PREMIUM IS NOT BELOW THE GOVERNMENT

THRESHOLD, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS WHO WERE AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LOST APPROXIMATELY 650,000 OF OUR AUTO-ENROLLED LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY MEMBERS IN 2008 BECAUSE CERTAIN OF OUR

BIDS EXCEEDED THRESHOLDS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN GENERAL, OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT, UTILIZATION, MEDICAL COSTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MATERIALLY INCORRECT OR OUR

COMPETITORS BIDS AND POSITIONING ARE DIFFERENT THAN ANTICIPATED, EITHER AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.

IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND

OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THESE COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN

SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, WHETHER IN-NETWORK OR OUT-OF-NETWORK, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER MEDICAL COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS

FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET

POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART. IN ADDITION, PHYSICIAN OR PRACTICE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WHICH AGGREGATE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND MARKETING LEVERAGE, MAY COMPETE

DIRECTLY WITH US. IF THESE PROVIDERS REFUSE TO CONTRACT WITH US, USE THEIR MARKET POSITION TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE CONTRACTS OR PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET PRODUCTS OR TO BE PROFITABLE IN THOSE AREAS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDER THE

TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER RECEIVES A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM TO COVER ALL OR A DEFINED PORTION OF THE MEDICAL COSTS PROVIDED TO THE CAPITATED MEMBER. UNDER SOME CAPITATED ARRANGEMENTS, THE PROVIDER MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL

COMPENSATION FROM RISK SHARING AND OTHER INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS. CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS, BUT EXPOSE US TO RISK RELATED TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL CARE RESOURCES OF THE

PROFESSIONAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT A CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION FACES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID HEALTH CARE CLAIMS

THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PAID THE PROVIDER UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT. FURTHER, PAYMENT OR OTHER DISPUTES BETWEEN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND SPECIALISTS WITH

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHOM THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A DISRUPTION IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS OR A REDUCTION IN THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR MEMBERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH WHOM WE CONTRACT WILL PROPERLY MANAGE THE COSTS OF SERVICES, MAINTAIN FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OR AVOID DISPUTES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR

MEMBERS AND OUR OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, SOME PROVIDERS THAT RENDER SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE CONTRACTS WITH US. IN THOSE

CASES, WE DO NOT HAVE A PRE-ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PROVIDER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT IS DUE TO THE PROVIDER FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO OUR MEMBERS. IN SOME STATES, THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION DUE TO THESE OUT-OF-NETWORK

PROVIDERS IS DEFINED BY LAW OR REGULATION, BUT IN MOST INSTANCES, IT IS EITHER NOT DEFINED OR IT IS ESTABLISHED BY A STANDARD THAT IS NOT CLEARLY TRANSLATABLE INTO DOLLAR TERMS. IN SOME INSTANCES, PROVIDERS MAY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE UNDERPAID

FOR THEIR SERVICES AND MAY EITHER LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTE WITH US OR TRY TO RECOVER FROM OUR MEMBERS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE PAID THEM AND THE AMOUNT THEY CHARGED US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION WITH

OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN LEGAL MATTERS IN NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT,

RETAIN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN PART THROUGH

INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS WHO ASSIST IN THE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING OF BUSINESS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS, WHO GENERALLY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO US AND WHO

TYPICALLY ALSO RECOMMEND AND/OR MARKET HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF OUR COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, WE MUST COMPETE INTENSELY FOR THEIR SERVICES AND ALLEGIANCE. OUR SALES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN

INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS OR IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SUPPORT, TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO THEM REGARDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS COMPLEX, OR IF OUR SALES STRATEGY IS NOT APPROPRIATELY ALIGNED ACROSS DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS AND AGENTS SELLING HEALTH

CARE PRODUCTS AND THE PAYMENTS THEY RECEIVE. THESE HAVE RESULTED IN ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AND BROKERS AND AGENTS MARKETING AND SELLING THESE COMPANIES PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, CMS AND STATE DEPARTMENTS OF

INSURANCE HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS AND AGENTS WHO MARKET MEDICARE PRODUCTS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES AND THE IMPOSITION OF

CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND/OR CHANGES TO INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH RESTRICTIONS ON PATIENT PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHO OBTAIN ACCESS TO SENSITIVE PATIENT INFORMATION MAINTAIN ITS CONFIDENTIALITY AND

SECURITY, OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE, PROTECTION, USE,

TRANSMISSION, DISCLOSURE AND DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES ARE REGULATED AT THE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL

INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS ADDRESS THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS IN THE FEDERAL GLBA AND IN HIPAA.

HIPAA NOW REQUIRES BUSINESS ASSOCIATES AS WELL AS COVERED ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY

LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES.

EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS

ASSOCIATES AND IN CERTAIN CASES ASSESS OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES SECURITY CONTROLS, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRACTICES. PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ARE ALSO IMPOSED ON US THROUGH CONTROLS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE SECURITY MEASURES

WE HAVE IN PLACE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND RULES, OUR FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES, ACTS OF VANDALISM OR THEFT, COMPUTER VIRUSES, MISPLACED OR LOST

DATA, PROGRAMMING AND/OR HUMAN ERRORS OR OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. COMPLIANCE WITH NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW REGULATIONS, SUCH AS ARRA, WILL RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES (INCLUDING FURTHER

IMPLEMENTATION OF ENCRYPTION AND OTHER DATA PROTECTION STANDARDS), NEW LIMITATIONS OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR BUSINESS MODELS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, AND

INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND FINES AND PENALTIES. THEY ALSO MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND USE OF PATIENT IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT IS HOUSED IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES.

NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PRIVACY OR SECURITY LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR ANY SECURITY BREACH INVOLVING THE MISAPPROPRIATION, LOSS OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE

OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL MEMBER INFORMATION, WHETHER BY US OR BY ONE OF OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING MANDATORY DISCLOSURE TO THE MEDIA, SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND COST OF MANAGING AND REMEDIATING DATA SECURITY INCIDENTS, INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, MATERIAL FINES AND PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, AND STATUTORY DAMAGES, LITIGATION, CONSENT ORDERS REGARDING OUR

PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES, ADVERSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR LICENSES TO DO BUSINESS, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP IS

IMPORTANT AND THE LOSS OF SUCH RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS

WITH AARP, WE PROVIDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE, HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS AND MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS TO AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS. ONE OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP EXPANDS

THE RELATIONSHIP TO INCLUDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS FOR AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS. OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP CONTAIN COMMITMENTS REGARDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, DIVERSITY AND MEASURES INTENDED TO

IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE FOR CONSUMERS. THE AARP AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED EARLY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, DEPENDING ON THE AGREEMENT, A MATERIAL BREACH BY EITHER PARTY, INSOLVENCY OF EITHER PARTY, A MATERIAL

ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAMS, MATERIAL HARM TO AARP CAUSED BY THE COMPANY, AND BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO

SERVICE AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COMPETITIVELY, MEET OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND DIVERSITY COMMITMENTS, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND

STATE REGULATORY CHANGES. THE LOSS OF OUR AARP RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LITIGATION ACTIONS, WHICH, IF RESOLVED UNFAVORABLY, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES AND/OR MONETARY DAMAGES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

PERIODICALLY, WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF LEGAL ACTIONS THAT CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS

EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER SUITS, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE

ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE AND PAYMENT (INCLUDING DISPUTES WITH ENROLLEES,

CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTED AND NON-CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS), TORT, CONTRACT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO PARTY TO CERTAIN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

BROUGHT BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS.

WE ARE LARGELY SELF-INSURED WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION RISKS. ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN EXCESS

LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH OUTSIDE INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH AS PUNITIVE

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DAMAGES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE

LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES WILL EXCEED THE LIABILITIES RECORDED.

A DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IS

INCLUDED IN NOTE 14 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE ACTIONS WITH CERTAINTY, AND WE ARE INCURRING EXPENSES IN RESOLVING THESE MATTERS. THEREFORE, THESE LEGAL ACTIONS COULD FURTHER INCREASE OUR

COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY

SUFFER LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME OR EQUITY MARKETS

COULD IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTS OUR INTEREST INCOME AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES OF VARYING MATURITIES, WHICH COMPRISE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS BY ISSUERS, PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHO FAIL TO PAY OR PERFORM ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS, COULD REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED

INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES AS WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

WE ALSO INVEST A SMALL PROPORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS WILL PRODUCE TOTAL POSITIVE RETURNS OR THAT WE WILL NOT SELL INVESTMENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT ASSETS, AS A RESULT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ILLIQUIDITY OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN ADDITION, IF IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ON

AN ACCELERATED BASIS, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF THE VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MATERIALLY

IMPAIRED, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND DEBT RATINGS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE $23.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, REPRESENTING 39% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY BE

IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE A CHARGE TO EARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ENACTMENT OF HEALTH CARE REFORMS MAY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES, AS ANY PASSED

LEGISLATION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES. ANY FUTURE EVALUATIONS REQUIRING AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY COULD, IN TURN, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DEBT RATINGS OR POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS.

LARGE-SCALE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL COSTS AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LARGE-SCALE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES CAN TAKE MANY FORMS AND CAN CAUSE WIDESPREAD ILLNESS AND DEATH. SUCH

EMERGENCIES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER, BIOTERRORISM ATTACK, PANDEMIC OR OTHER EXTREME EVENTS, WE COULD FACE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL COSTS AND INCREASED USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ANY SUCH DISASTER OR SIMILAR EVENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OR AVAILABILITY OF OUR DATA OR TO STRATEGICALLY IMPLEMENT

NEW OR UPGRADE OR CONSOLIDATE EXISTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO

ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES AND RECENTLY ENACTED REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO CONSOLIDATE AND INTEGRATE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE

UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN, PROTECT AND ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES

IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING SYSTEMS AND REGULATORY STANDARDS, AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PATTERNS. IF THE INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WERE FOUND TO BE INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OR PROTECT OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE DIFFICULTY PREVENTING,

DETECTING AND CONTROLLING FRAUD, HAVE DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, HAVE REGULATORY SANCTIONS OR PENALTIES IMPOSED, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT OUR PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATING THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE, UPGRADING AND EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES, PROTECTING AND ENHANCING OUR SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPING NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN

INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS ISSUES WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE AND INTEGRATE OUR SYSTEMS SUCCESSFULLY COULD RESULT IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED COSTS AND DIVERSION OF

MANAGEMENTS TIME AND ENERGY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE

NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES COULD BE HINDERED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, AND OUR TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT

OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE

EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD HINDER OUR

ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO

OBTAIN FUNDS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IS RESTRICTED AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

BECAUSE WE OPERATE AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON DIVIDENDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR

OBLIGATIONS. THESE SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY ARE REGULATED BY STATES DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY LAW TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIC PRESCRIBED MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE LEVELS OF CAPITALIZATION REQUIRED

DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON THE VOLUME OF PREMIUM REVENUES GENERATED. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PREMIUM VOLUME WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITALIZATION FROM US. IN MOST STATES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK PRIOR APPROVAL BY THESE STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

BEFORE WE TRANSFER MONEY OR PAY DIVIDENDS FROM THESE SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. IN ADDITION, WE NORMALLY NOTIFY THE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE PRIOR TO MAKING PAYMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE APPROVAL. AN INABILITY OF OUR REGULATED

SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES COULD IMPACT THE SCALE TO WHICH WE COULD REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR ABILITY TO REPAY

OUR DEBT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANY FAILURE BY US TO MANAGE AND COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS SUCCESSFULLY

COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH

THIRD PARTIES REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES, AND OUTSOURCING TRANSACTIONS AND OFTEN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS RELATING TO SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND COMPLETE

SUCCESSFULLY TRANSACTIONS THAT FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY INTERNALLY, WE MAY BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE MARKET

PERCEPTIONS, ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. FOR ACQUISITIONS, SUCCESS IS ALSO DEPENDENT UPON EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS INTO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE AND GROW THESE ACQUISITIONS AND TO REALIZE CONTEMPLATED REVENUE SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

DOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AND CREDIT RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATING ORGANIZATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE

POSITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. RATINGS INFORMATION IS BROADLY DISSEMINATED AND GENERALLY USED THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE OUR CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS TO CERTAIN

OF OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR DEBT RATINGS IMPACT BOTH THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS. EACH OF THE RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATINGS PERIODICALLY AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT RATINGS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. OUR

RATINGS REFLECT EACH RATING AGENCYS OPINION OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY TO MEET OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS. DOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
