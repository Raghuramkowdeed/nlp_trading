RISK FACTORS

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

THE STATEMENTS, ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, GUIDANCE OR OUTLOOK CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (PSLRA). WHEN USED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND IN FUTURE FILINGS BY US WITH THE SEC, IN OUR NEWS RELEASES, PRESENTATIONS TO SECURITIES ANALYSTS OR INVESTORS, AND IN ORAL STATEMENTS MADE BY

OR WITH THE APPROVAL OF ONE OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THE WORDS OR PHRASES BELIEVE, EXPECT, INTEND, ESTIMATE, ANTICIPATE, PLAN, PROJECT, SHOULD OR SIMILAR

EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PSLRA. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY

CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS CERTAIN

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS THAT INVESTORS AND OTHERS SHOULD CONSIDER. WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS OR UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN FUTURE FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATING RESULTS, AND DO NOT

UNDERTAKE TO ADDRESS HOW ANY OF THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE CAUSED RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM DISCUSSIONS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED IN PREVIOUS FILINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED BELOW MAY HAVE AFFECTED PAST, AS WELL AS

CURRENT, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT FUTURE RESULTS. ANY OR ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K AND IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC FILINGS OR STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY TURN OUT TO BE WRONG. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY INACCURATE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS. BY

THEIR NATURE, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OR QUANTIFY. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM

EXPECTATIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT OR ANY OF OUR PRIOR COMMUNICATIONS.

IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY ESTIMATE, PRICE FOR AND MANAGE OUR HEALTH CARE

COSTS, THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COULD DECLINE AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

UNDER OUR

RISK-BASED PRODUCT ARRANGEMENTS, WE ASSUME THE RISK OF BOTH MEDICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN RETURN FOR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. PREMIUM REVENUES FROM RISK-BASED PRODUCTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.

WE GENERALLY USE APPROXIMATELY 80% TO 85% OF OUR PREMIUM REVENUES TO PAY THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERED TO THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RISK-BASED PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT, PRICE FOR, AND

EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HEALTH CARE COSTS.

WE MANAGE HEALTH CARE COSTS THROUGH UNDERWRITING CRITERIA, PRODUCT DESIGN, NEGOTIATION OF FAVORABLE PROVIDER

CONTRACTS AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. TOTAL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES RENDERED AND THE COST OF EACH SERVICE. OUR PREMIUM REVENUE ON COMMERCIAL POLICIES IS TYPICALLY FIXED FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD AND IS

GENERALLY PRICED ONE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE CONTRACT COMMENCES. OUR REVENUE ON MEDICARE POLICIES IS BASED ON BIDS SUBMITTED IN JUNE THE YEAR BEFORE THE CONTRACT YEAR. WE BASE THE PREMIUMS WE CHARGE AND OUR MEDICARE BIDS ON OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE

HEALTH CARE COSTS OVER THE FIXED CONTRACT PERIOD; HOWEVER, MEDICAL COST INFLATION, REGULATION AND OTHER FACTORS MAY CAUSE ACTUAL COSTS TO EXCEED WHAT WAS ESTIMATED AND REFLECTED IN PREMIUMS OR BIDS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE INCREASED USE OF

SERVICES, INCREASED COST OF INDIVIDUAL SERVICES, CATASTROPHES, EPIDEMICS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW OR COSTLY TREATMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY, NEW MANDATED BENEFITS OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES, INSURED POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE

LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE USE. AS A MEASURE OF THE IMPACT OF MEDICAL COST ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, RELATIVELY SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREDICTED AND ACTUAL MEDICAL COSTS OR UTILIZATION RATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF MEDICAL COSTS INCREASED BY 1% WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL CHANGE IN RELATED REVENUES FOR COMMERCIAL INSURED PRODUCTS, OUR ANNUAL NET EARNINGS FOR 2008 WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION.

IN ADDITION, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS WE REPORT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCURRED FOR WHICH CLAIMS ARE STILL

OUTSTANDING. THESE ESTIMATES INVOLVE AN EXTENSIVE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT. IF THESE ESTIMATES PROVE TOO LOW, THEY WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, OR FAIL TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND FREQUENT CHANGES IN FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESS IS REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE LAWS AND RULES

GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE. THE BROAD LATITUDE THAT IS GIVEN TO THE AGENCIES ADMINISTERING THOSE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS FUTURE LAWS AND RULES, COULD FORCE US TO CHANGE HOW WE DO

BUSINESS, RESTRICT REVENUE AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH, INCREASE OUR HEALTH CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASE OUR LIABILITY IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS FOR COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND OTHER

ACTIONS. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES.

WE MUST OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS TO MARKET MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE PRICES FOR CERTAIN REGULATED PRODUCTS AND TO COMPLETE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION OF

CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS. DELAYS IN OBTAINING APPROVALS OR OUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN THESE APPROVALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BY CONGRESS AND STATE LEGISLATURES AND ARE CURRENTLY PENDING AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE POLICY CHANGES THAT

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF OUR INDUSTRY, SUCH AS HAVING THE FEDERAL OR ONE OR MORE STATE GOVERNMENTS ASSUME A LARGER ROLE IN THE HEALTH CARE

INDUSTRY OR A FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE MEDICARE OR MEDICAID PROGRAMS. THESE PROPOSALS MAY ALSO AFFECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND/OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS; PHYSICIAN

REIMBURSEMENT METHODS AND PAYMENT RATES; COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS; MANDATED BENEFITS; MINIMUM MEDICAL EXPENDITURES; CLAIM PAYMENTS AND PROCESSING; DRUG UTILIZATION AND PATIENT SAFETY EFFORTS; COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, MAINTENANCE AND DISPOSAL OF

INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION; PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS; CONSUMER-DRIVEN HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND INSURANCE MARKET REFORMS; AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND VARIOUS CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HAVE SIGNALED THEIR INTEREST IN REDUCING PAYMENTS TO PRIVATE PLANS OFFERING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT AND PHASING OF THESE POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS, THE NUMBER OF SENIORS PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND THE INDUSTRY-WIDE EARNINGS DERIVED FROM THESE PLANS MAY FALL. IN ADDITION, MASSACHUSETTS HAS ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE

REFORM, INCLUDING AN INDIVIDUAL HEALTH COVERAGE MANDATE COUPLED WITH AN EMPLOYER MANDATE AND A NEW STATE CONNECTOR AUTHORITY. A NUMBER OF OTHER STATE LEGISLATURES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, NEW YORK, OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA, HAVE

CONTEMPLATED BUT HAVE NOT ENACTED SIGNIFICANT REFORM OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. OTHER STATES ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIDER THESE TYPES OF REFORMS AS WELL AS MORE MODEST REFORMS AIMED AT EXPANDING MEDICAID AND/OR SCHIP ELIGIBILITY AS WELL AS

NEW COVERAGE OPTIONS FOR THOSE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE PROVISIONS AFFECTING BOTH PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND PRIVATELY FINANCED HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. STATES ALSO ARE

CONSIDERING PROPOSALS THAT WOULD REFORM THE UNDERWRITING AND MARKETING PRACTICES OF INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS BY, FOR EXAMPLE, PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON RATING AND PRICING AND MANDATING MINIMUM MEDICAL

BENEFIT COST RATIOS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, CONGRESS HAS CONSIDERED VARIOUS FORMS OF MANAGED CARE REFORM LEGISLATION WHICH IF ADOPTED, COULD FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE TREATMENT OF COVERAGE DECISIONS UNDER ERISA. ADDITIONALLY,

THERE IS LEGISLATIVE INTEREST IN MODIFYING ERISAS PREEMPTIVE EFFECT ON STATE LAWS. IF ADOPTED, SUCH LIMITATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR LIABILITY EXPOSURE AND COULD PERMIT GREATER STATE REGULATION OF OUR OPERATIONS.

WE CANNOT PREDICT IF ANY OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME LAW, OR, IF ENACTED, WHAT THEIR TERMS OR THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO SUCH LAWS WILL BE,

BUT THEIR ENACTMENT COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, EXPOSE US TO EXPANDED LIABILITY AND REQUIRE US TO REVISE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS OR PUT US AT RISK FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

SUCH CHANGES EVEN IF WE CORRECTLY PREDICT THEIR OCCURRENCE.

IN ADDITION, THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY MAY

RESULT IN INCREASED REGULATION AND LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES, WHICH MAY FURTHER INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY BY: ADVERSELY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;

REQUIRING US TO CHANGE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; OR INCREASING THE REGULATORY BURDENS UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE.

IN AUGUST 2007, WE ENTERED INTO A

MULTI-STATE NATIONAL AGREEMENT WITH REGULATORY OFFICES IN 39 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA RELATING TO THE LEGACY UNITEDHEALTHCARE FULLY INSURED COMMERCIAL BUSINESS. THE AGREEMENT COVERS SEVERAL KEY AREAS OF REVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING CLAIMS PAYMENT ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES RESOLUTION TIMELINESS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL NETWORK/SERVICE, UTILIZATION REVIEW, EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS ACCURACY, AND OVERSIGHT AND DUE DILIGENCE OF CONTRACTED ENTITIES

AND VENDOR PERFORMANCE. THE AGREEMENT ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED PAST REGULATORY MATTERS RELATED TO THE AREAS OF REVIEW PRIOR TO AUGUST 2007 AND ESTABLISHES A TRANSPARENT FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING AND REGULATING PERFORMANCE THROUGH DECEMBER 2010. ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS, THE AGREEMENT IS SIMILAR TO A CUSTOMER PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE, WHEREBY WE WILL SELF REPORT QUARTERLY AND ANNUALLY OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ON A SET OF NATIONAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AGREED TO BY THE PARTICIPATING STATES. WE MUST

PERFORM TO THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, OR BE SUBJECT TO FINES AND PENALTIES.

WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS,

AUDITS AND REVIEWS. THESE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ROUTINE, REGULAR AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS, AUDITS AND REVIEWS BY CMS, STATE INSURANCE AND HEALTH AND

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, U.S. ATTORNEYS, THE SEC, THE IRS, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2007, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE EXAMINED THE COMPANYS PACIFICARE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN

IN CALIFORNIA. THE EXAMINATION FINDINGS RELATED TO CLAIMS PROCESSING ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INTEREST PAYMENTS, TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF PROVIDER CONTRACTS, TIMELY, ACCURATE PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND OTHER RELATED

MATTERS. TO DATE, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS NOT LEVIED A FINANCIAL PENALTY RELATED TO ITS FINDINGS. THE COMPANY IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES ARISING FROM THE FINDINGS OF ITS EXAMINATION.

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION OF OUR ADMINISTRATION OF OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS WITH RESPECT TO ERISA COMPLIANCE. REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS SORT CAN LEAD TO GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, WHICH CAN RESULT

IN THE ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES, OR OTHER SANCTIONS, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS OR CHANGES IN THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, LOSS OF LICENSURE OR EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, AND COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN ADDITION, PUBLIC PERCEPTION OR PUBLICITY SURROUNDING ROUTINE GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION IN VARIOUS MARKETS OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

ADVERSE

CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND EXTREME DISRUPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS WIDELY REPORTED, WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING EXTREME DISRUPTION, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF SECURITIES AND SEVERELY DIMINISHED

LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT. THESE EXTREME EVENTS, ALONG WITH A RECESSION, INFLATION OR OTHER UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT LAYOFFS AND DOWNSIZINGS COULD LEAD TO LOWER ENROLLMENT IN OUR EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS, LOWER ENROLLMENT IN

OUR NON-EMPLOYER INDIVIDUAL PLANS AND A HIGHER NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OPTING OUT OF OUR EMPLOYER GROUP PLANS. THE ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO CAUSE EMPLOYERS TO STOP OFFERING CERTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OR ELECT TO

OFFER THIS COVERAGE ON A VOLUNTARY, EMPLOYEE-FUNDED BASIS AS A MEANS TO REDUCE THEIR OPERATING COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR EMPLOYER GROUP RENEWAL PROSPECTS AND OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE PREMIUMS AND COULD

RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY OUR CUSTOMERS. ALL OF THESE COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN OUR MEMBERSHIP LEVELS AND PREMIUM AND FEE REVENUES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, A PROLONGED ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF HOSPITALS AND OTHER CARE PROVIDERS AND THEREFORE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONTRACTED RATES WITH THESE PARTIES AND INCREASE OUR MEDICAL COSTS.

DURING A PROLONGED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, RESULTING IN REDUCED REIMBURSEMENTS OR PAYMENTS IN OUR FEDERAL AND STATE

GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND SCHIP. A REDUCTION IN STATE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO PAYMENTS ALREADY NEGOTIATED AND/OR RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, THE STATE AND FEDERAL BUDGETARY PRESSURES COULD CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE NEW OR A HIGHER LEVEL OF TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS PREMIUM TAXES ON

HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND SURCHARGES ON SELECT FEE-FOR-SERVICE AND CAPITATED MEDICAL CLAIMS, AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS IS CAUSING CONTRACTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT IN THE MARKETPLACE. WHILE OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS HAVE BEEN A SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY FOR US AND WE CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER, ALTHOUGH AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES AS A RESULT OF THE DIMINISHED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF SHORT-TERM FINANCING. IF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS ARE UNAVAILABLE OR NOT COST EFFECTIVE, WE WOULD USE

CASH ON HAND AND/OR DRAW ON OUR CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES TO REFINANCE THE COMMERCIAL PAPER WHEN IT MATURES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, UNDER EXTREME MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH SOURCES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR

SUFFICIENT.

IN ADDITION, IF THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE, INCLUDING IF MORE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMPANIES FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

PROTECTION, OR ARE TAKEN OVER BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AND IF THE PRICES OF SECURITIES CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE AND EXPERIENCE EXTREME VOLATILITY, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE IMPACTED. SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD FURTHER EXPERIENCE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING US TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR

BUSINESSES PROVIDING PBM SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PBM INDUSTRY AND IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE PROVIDE PBM SERVICES THROUGH OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS AND UNITEDHEALTHCARE BUSINESSES. EACH BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL

AND STATE ANTI-KICKBACK AND OTHER LAWS THAT GOVERN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATURES REGULARLY CONSIDER NEW REGULATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT CURRENT INDUSTRY PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OR REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF REBATES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. SEE ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR PBM BUSINESSES.

IN THE EVENT A COURT WERE TO DETERMINE THAT ONE OF OUR PBM BUSINESSES ACTS AS A FIDUCIARY UNDER ERISA, WE COULD

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS FOR ALLEGED BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF FORMULARIES, PREFERRED DRUG LISTINGS AND DRUG MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, CONTRACTING NETWORK PRACTICES, SPECIALTY DRUG DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS. OUR PBM

BUSINESSES ALSO CONDUCT BUSINESS AS MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES, WHICH SUBJECTS THEM TO EXTENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD EXPOSE OUR PBM SUBSIDIARIES TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL

PENALTIES.

IN ADDITION, WE WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY AN INABILITY TO CONTRACT ON FAVORABLE TERMS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND COULD FACE

POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH PURPORTED ERRORS BY OUR MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. FURTHER, OUR PBM BUSINESSES ARE

SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY DATA SECURITY STANDARDS, WHICH IS A MULTIFACETED SECURITY STANDARD THAT INCLUDES REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY MANAGEMENT, POLICIES, PROCEDURES, NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, SOFTWARE DESIGN AND OTHER CRITICAL

PROTECTIVE MEASURES TO PROTECT CUSTOMER ACCOUNT DATA AS MANDATED BY THE CREDIT CARD BRANDS. THE FAILURE TO ADHERE TO SUCH STANDARDS COULD EXPOSE OUR PBM SUBSIDIARIES TO LIABILITY OR IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, INCLUDING MAINTAINING OR INCREASING ENROLLMENTS IN BUSINESSES PROVIDING

HEALTH BENEFITS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND FACE

COMPETITION IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES ON THE BASIS OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICE OF BENEFITS OFFERED AND COST AND RISK OF ALTERNATIVES, LOCATION AND CHOICE OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS,

QUALITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, COMPREHENSIVENESS OF COVERAGE OFFERED, REPUTATION FOR QUALITY CARE, FINANCIAL STABILITY AND DIVERSITY OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS. FOR OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES REPORTING SEGMENT, COMPETITORS INCLUDE AETNA INC., CIGNA

CORPORATION, COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC., HEALTH NET, INC., HUMANA INC., KAISER PERMANENTE, WELLPOINT, INC., NUMEROUS FOR-PROFIT AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OPERATING UNDER LICENSES FROM THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD ASSOCIATION AND OTHER

ENTERPRISES THAT SERVE MORE LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKET SEGMENTS SUCH AS MEDICARE SPECIALTY SERVICES. FOR OUR PRESCRIPTION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, COMPETITORS INCLUDE MEDCO HEALTH SOLUTIONS, INC., CVS/ CAREMARK CORPORATION AND EXPRESS SCRIPTS,

INC. OUR OPTUMHEALTH AND INGENIX REPORTING SEGMENTS ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BUSINESSES.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THAT BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN MANY MARKETS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL, SO THE ADDITION OF NEW COMPETITORS CAN OCCUR

RELATIVELY EASILY, AND CUSTOMERS ENJOY SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MOVING BETWEEN COMPETITORS. IN PARTICULAR MARKETS, COMPETITORS MAY HAVE CAPABILITIES OR RESOURCES THAT GIVE THEM A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. GREATER MARKET SHARE, ESTABLISHED REPUTATION,

SUPERIOR SUPPLIER OR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, AND OTHER FACTORS ALL CAN PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR BUSINESSES OR TO THEIR COMPETITORS.

IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY HAS OCCURRED IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BOTH AS TO OUR COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING

HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND OTHER CARE PROFESSIONALS) IN THESE INDUSTRIES. CONSOLIDATION MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RETAIN OR INCREASE CUSTOMERS, TO IMPROVE THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DO BUSINESS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, OR TO MAINTAIN OR

ADVANCE PROFITABILITY. IF WE DO NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR MARKETS, IF WE SET RATES TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, IF WE DO NOT DESIGN AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS PROPERLY AND COMPETITIVELY, IF WE DO NOT PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY

LEVEL OF SERVICES, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DOES NOT INCREASE AS WE EXPECT, IF MEMBERSHIP OR DEMAND FOR OTHER SERVICES DECLINES, OR IF WE LOSE ACCOUNTS WITH MORE PROFITABLE PRODUCTS WHILE RETAINING OR INCREASING MEMBERSHIP IN

ACCOUNTS WITH LESS PROFITABLE PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

AS A PAYER IN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT

HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PROGRAM FUNDING, ENROLLMENTS, PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS AND AUDITS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING AS A PAYER IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, VARIOUS

MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP, AND RECEIVE REVENUES FROM THESE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES THAT MAY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ENROLLED OR ELIGIBLE, REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT OR

PAYMENT LEVELS, OR INCREASE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OR HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER SUCH PROGRAMS. SUCH CHANGES HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, MEDICARE PART D, AND VARIOUS MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND SCHIP OCCURS THROUGH BIDS THAT ARE SUBMITTED PERIODICALLY. REVENUES

FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT UPON PERIODIC FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR APPLICABLE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING THROUGH VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS. FUNDING FOR THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS

OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AT THE FEDERAL OR APPLICABLE STATE LEVEL, AND GENERAL POLITICAL ISSUES AND PRIORITIES. A REDUCTION OR LESS THAN EXPECTED INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS OR CHANGE IN

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CMS USES VARIOUS PAYMENT MECHANISMS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE

PROGRAMS, INCLUDING DETERMINING PAYMENTS BY CONSIDERING THE RISK STATUS OF OUR MEDICARE MEMBERS AS SUPPORTED BY PROVIDER MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENTATION. FEDERAL REGULATORS AUDIT THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS AND CAN REVISE PAYMENTS BASED ON THE AUDIT

FINDINGS. CMS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 THAT IT WILL PERFORM AUDITS OF SELECTED MEDICARE HEALTH PLANS EACH YEAR TO VALIDATE THE CODING PRACTICES OF AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MAINTAINED BY CARE PROVIDERS. THESE AUDITS INVOLVE A REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS

MAINTAINED BY PROVIDERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AND OUT OF NETWORK, AND MAY RESULT IN RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO HEALTH PLANS PURSUANT TO CMS MEDICARE CONTRACTS. CERTAIN OF OUR PLANS HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR AUDIT. THE

FIRST AUDITS FOCUSED ON MEDICAL RECORDS SUPPORTING RISK ADJUSTMENT DATA FOR 2006 THAT WERE USED TO DETERMINE 2007 PAYMENT AMOUNTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE AUDITS. HOWEVER, A MATERIAL ADJUSTMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ACQUIRE MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND SCHIP ENROLLEES IS IMPACTED BY BIDS AND PLAN DESIGNS SUBMITTED BY US AND OUR

COMPETITORS. UNDER THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM, STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES ARE PERIODICALLY REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO SEEK BIDS FROM ELIGIBLE HEALTH PLANS TO CONTINUE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACUTE CARE MEDICAID HEALTH PROGRAMS. IF WE ARE NOT

SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING RENEWALS OF STATE MEDICAID MANAGED

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARE CONTRACTS, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS THAT WERE ENROLLED IN THOSE MEDICAID PLANS. UNDER THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, TO QUALIFY FOR AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT

OF LOW INCOME MEMBERS, OUR BIDS MUST RESULT IN AN ENROLLEE PREMIUM BELOW A THRESHOLD, WHICH IS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER OUR BIDS ARE SUBMITTED. IF THE ENROLLEE PREMIUM IS NOT BELOW THE GOVERNMENT THRESHOLD, WE RISK LOSING THE MEMBERS WHO WERE

AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US AND WE WILL NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AUTO-ASSIGNED TO US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE LOST APPROXIMATELY 650,000 OF OUR AUTO-ENROLLED LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY MEMBERS IN 2008 BECAUSE OUR BIDS EXCEEDED THRESHOLDS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN

GENERAL, OUR BIDS ARE BASED UPON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT, UTILIZATION, MEDICAL COSTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MATERIALLY INCORRECT OR OUR COMPETITORS BIDS AND POSITIONING ARE DIFFERENT THAN

ANTICIPATED, EITHER AS A RESULT OF UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.

IF WE

FAIL TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE CONTRACT WITH PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY

DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THESE COMPETITIVE PRICES AND SERVICES. FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, WHETHER IN-NETWORK OR OUT-OF-NETWORK, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ANY PARTICULAR MARKET, PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD REFUSE TO CONTRACT, DEMAND HIGHER PAYMENTS, OR TAKE OTHER

ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS, LESS DESIRABLE PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS OR DIFFICULTY MEETING REGULATORY OR ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS. IN SOME MARKETS, CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PARTICULARLY HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN/HOSPITAL

ORGANIZATIONS OR MULTI-SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN GROUPS, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MARKET POSITIONS OR NEAR MONOPOLIES THAT COULD RESULT IN DIMINISHED BARGAINING POWER ON OUR PART. IN ADDITION, PHYSICIAN OR PRACTICE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WHICH AGGREGATE

PHYSICIAN PRACTICES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND MARKETING LEVERAGE, MAY COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH US. IF THESE PROVIDERS REFUSE TO CONTRACT WITH US, USE THEIR MARKET POSITION TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE CONTRACTS OR PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE

DISADVANTAGE, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET PRODUCTS OR TO BE PROFITABLE IN THOSE AREAS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS

WITH SOME PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDER THE TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER RECEIVES A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM TO COVER ALL OR A DEFINED PORTION OF THE MEDICAL COSTS PROVIDED TO THE CAPITATED MEMBER.

UNDER SOME CAPITATED ARRANGEMENTS, THE PROVIDER MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FROM RISK SHARING AND OTHER INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS. CAPITATION ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF INCREASING MEDICAL COSTS, BUT EXPOSE US TO RISK

RELATED TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE FINANCIAL AND MEDICAL CARE RESOURCES OF THE PROFESSIONAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT A CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION FACES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE IS UNABLE TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT, WE MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPAID HEALTH CARE CLAIMS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAPITATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY PAID THE PROVIDER UNDER THE CAPITATION ARRANGEMENT.

FURTHER, PAYMENT OR OTHER DISPUTES BETWEEN A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND SPECIALISTS WITH WHOM THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CONTRACTS CAN RESULT IN A DISRUPTION IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS OR A REDUCTION IN THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR

MEMBERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH WHOM WE CONTRACT WILL PROPERLY MANAGE THE COSTS OF SERVICES, MAINTAIN FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OR AVOID DISPUTES WITH OTHER PROVIDERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS AND OUR OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, SOME PROVIDERS THAT RENDER SERVICES TO OUR MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE CONTRACTS WITH

US. IN THOSE CASES, WE DO NOT HAVE A PRE-ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PROVIDER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT IS DUE TO THE PROVIDER FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO OUR MEMBERS. IN SOME STATES, THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION DUE TO THESE

OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS IS DEFINED BY LAW OR REGULATION, BUT IN MOST INSTANCES IT IS EITHER NOT DEFINED OR IT IS ESTABLISHED BY A STANDARD THAT IS NOT CLEARLY TRANSLATABLE INTO DOLLAR TERMS. IN SOME INSTANCES, PROVIDERS MAY BELIEVE THAT THEY

ARE UNDERPAID FOR THEIR SERVICES AND MAY EITHER LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTE WITH US OR TRY TO RECOVER FROM OUR MEMBERS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE PAID THEM AND THE AMOUNT THEY CHARGED US. FOR EXAMPLE,

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION WITH OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN LEGAL MATTERS IN NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE OUT-OF-NETWORK HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY BROKERS, CONSULTANTS

AND AGENTS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN PART THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS WHO ASSIST IN THE PRODUCTION AND SERVICING OF

BUSINESS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS, WHO GENERALLY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE TO US AND WHO FREQUENTLY ALSO RECOMMEND AND/OR MARKET HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF OUR

COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, WE MUST COMPETE INTENSELY FOR THEIR SERVICES AND ALLEGIANCE. OUR SALES WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN INDEPENDENT BROKERS, CONSULTANTS AND AGENTS OR IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE

SUPPORT, TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO THEM REGARDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS COMPLEX, OR IF OUR SALES STRATEGY IS NOT APPROPRIATELY ALIGNED ACROSS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS AND AGENTS SELLING HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND THE PAYMENTS THEY RECEIVE. THESE HAVE RESULTED IN ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS AGAINST COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AND BROKERS AND AGENTS MARKETING AND SELLING THESE COMPANIES PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, CMS AND STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE HAVE INCREASED THEIR SCRUTINY OF THE MARKETING PRACTICES OF BROKERS

AND AGENTS WHO MARKET MEDICARE PRODUCTS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES AND THE IMPOSITION OF CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND/OR CHANGES TO INDUSTRY PRACTICE WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH RESTRICTIONS ON PATIENT PRIVACY AND INFORMATION SECURITY, INCLUDING

TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WHO OBTAIN ACCESS TO SENSITIVE PATIENT INFORMATION MAINTAIN ITS CONFIDENTIALITY, OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE, USE, DISCLOSURE AND DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA BY OUR BUSINESSES ARE REGULATED AT THE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL AND STATE

LEVELS. THESE LAWS AND RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY LEGISLATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION. VARIOUS STATE LAWS ADDRESS THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH DATA TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN

THOSE CONTAINED IN THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROVISIONS IN THE FEDERAL GLBA AND IN HIPAA. HIPAA ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE IMPOSE PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS ON OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE HIPAA REGULATIONS). SEE

ITEM 1, BUSINESS  GOVERNMENT REGULATION FOR A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESSES.

EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THROUGH OUR CONTRACTS WITH OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED CONTROL OVER THEIR ACTIONS AND PRACTICES. PRIVACY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

INFORMATION ARE ALSO IMPOSED ON US THROUGH CONTROLS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE SECURITY MEASURES WE HAVE IN PLACE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND RULES, OUR FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS, AND THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDERS MAY BE VULNERABLE TO SECURITY BREACHES, ACTS OF VANDALISM OR THEFT, COMPUTER VIRUSES, MISPLACED OR LOST DATA, PROGRAMMING AND/OR HUMAN ERRORS OR OTHER SIMILAR EVENTS. CONGRESS AND MANY STATES ARE CONSIDERING NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY

REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD APPLY TO OUR BUSINESS. COMPLIANCE WITH NEW PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW REGULATIONS MAY RESULT IN COST INCREASES DUE TO NECESSARY SYSTEMS CHANGES, NEW LIMITATIONS OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR BUSINESS MODELS, THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, AND THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL NONCOMPLIANCE BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. THEY ALSO MAY IMPOSE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND USE OF PATIENT IDENTIFIABLE DATA THAT ARE HOUSED IN ONE

OR MORE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASES. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PRIVACY LAWS OR ANY SECURITY BREACH INVOLVING THE MISAPPROPRIATION, LOSS OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL MEMBER INFORMATION, WHETHER BY US OR BY ONE OF OUR

VENDORS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING: MATERIAL FINES AND PENALTIES; COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, AND STATUTORY DAMAGES; CONSENT ORDERS REGARDING OUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY

PRACTICES; ADVERSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR LICENSES TO DO BUSINESS; AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH AARP IS IMPORTANT AND THE LOSS OF SUCH RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNDER OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP, WE PROVIDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE, HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE AND

OTHER PRODUCTS TO AARP MEMBERS AND MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS TO AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS. ONE OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP EXPANDS THE RELATIONSHIP TO INCLUDE AARP-BRANDED MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS FOR AARP MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS.

OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AARP CONTAIN COMMITMENTS REGARDING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, DIVERSITY AND MEASURES INTENDED TO IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY THE HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE FOR CONSUMERS. THE AARP AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED

EARLY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, DEPENDING ON THE AGREEMENT, A MATERIAL BREACH BY EITHER PARTY, INSOLVENCY OF EITHER PARTY, A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAMS,

MATERIAL HARM TO AARP CAUSED BY THE COMPANY, AND BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR AARP ARRANGEMENTS DEPENDS, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE AARP AND ITS MEMBERS, DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PRICE THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

COMPETITIVELY, MEET OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND DIVERSITY COMMITMENTS, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY CHANGES. THE LOSS OF OUR AARP RELATIONSHIP COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LITIGATION ACTIONS, WHICH, IF RESOLVED

UNFAVORABLY, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES AND/OR MONETARY DAMAGES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

PERIODICALLY, WE BECOME A PARTY TO THE TYPES OF LEGAL ACTIONS THAT CAN AFFECT ANY BUSINESS, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION-RELATED SUITS, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT CLAIMS, BREACH OF CONTRACT ACTIONS, TORT CLAIMS, SHAREHOLDER SUITS,

AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED LITIGATION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE ROUTINELY MADE PARTY TO A VARIETY OF LEGAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS. THESE MATTERS INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHERS, CLAIMS RELATED TO HEALTH CARE BENEFITS COVERAGE AND PAYMENT (INCLUDING DISPUTES WITH ENROLLEES, CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTED AND NON-CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS), MEDICAL MALPRACTICE ACTIONS, CONTRACT

DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES. WE ARE ALSO PARTY TO CERTAIN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL GROUPS.

WE ARE LARGELY SELF-INSURED WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION RISKS. ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN EXCESS LIABILITY INSURANCE WITH OUTSIDE INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF OUR SELF-INSURANCE, CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SUCH

AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR OUR ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE COSTS RESULTING FROM SELF-INSURED MATTERS; HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTUAL LOSSES MAY EXCEED THE

LIABILITIES RECORDED.

A DESCRIPTION OF MATERIAL LEGAL ACTIONS IN WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE ACTIONS WITH CERTAINTY, AND WE ARE INCURRING EXPENSES IN RESOLVING THESE MATTERS. THEREFORE, THESE LEGAL ACTIONS COULD FURTHER INCREASE OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

MATTERS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, INCLUDING

REGULATORY INQUIRIES, LITIGATION MATTERS, AND POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL CASH AND NONCASH CHARGES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

IN

EARLY 2006, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INITIATED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES FROM 1994 TO 2005. THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED BY AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF THREE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY (INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE) WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING ADVISORS. ON OCTOBER 15, 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE HAD

COMPLETED THEIR REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND REPORTED THE FINDINGS TO THE NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. AS A

RESULT OF OUR HISTORICAL STOCK OPTION PRACTICES, WE RESTATED OUR PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE INCURRED CERTAIN CASH AND NON-CASH CHARGES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND LITIGATION MATTERS, AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

FURTHER REGULATORY INQUIRIES, LITIGATION MATTERS, AND CASH AND NONCASH CHARGES, THE OUTCOME OF ANY OR ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A MORE DETAILED

DESCRIPTION OF THESE REGULATORY INQUIRIES AND LITIGATION MATTERS.

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER LOSSES WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FIXED INCOME OR EQUITY MARKETS COULD IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. VOLATILITY IN INTEREST

RATES AFFECTS OUR INTEREST INCOME, AND THE MARKET VALUE OF, OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIXED INCOME DEBT SECURITIES OF VARYING MATURITIES, WHICH COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN ADDITION, DEFAULTS BY

ISSUERS, PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID CORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS, WHO FAIL TO PAY OR PERFORM ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS, COULD REDUCE OUR INVESTMENT INCOME AND NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR RESULT IN NET REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES AS WE MAY

BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

WE ALSO INVEST A

SMALL PROPORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER VOLATILITY THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN INVESTMENT LOSSES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS WILL PRODUCE TOTAL POSITIVE

RETURNS OR THAT WE WILL NOT SELL INVESTMENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT ASSETS, AS A RESULT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ILLIQUIDITY OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE A

NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN ADDITION, IF IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IF THE VALUE OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MATERIALLY IMPAIRED, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND DEBT RATINGS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

DUE LARGELY TO OUR PAST ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR ASSETS. GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY $22.4 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. IF WE MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS, IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS ON OUR BOOKS. WE

PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY NO LONGER BE RECOVERABLE, IN WHICH CASE A CHARGE TO EARNINGS MAY BE NECESSARY. ANY FUTURE EVALUATIONS REQUIRING AN

ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. A MATERIAL DECREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY COULD, IN

TURN, NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR DEBT RATINGS OR POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS.

LARGE-SCALE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES MAY RESULT

IN SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE COSTS AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LARGE-SCALE

MEDICAL EMERGENCIES CAN TAKE MANY FORMS AND CAN CAUSE WIDESPREAD ILLNESS AND DEATH. SUCH EMERGENCIES COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. ECONOMY IN GENERAL AND THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL

DISASTER, BIOTERRORISM ATTACK, PANDEMIC OR OTHER EXTREME EVENTS, WE COULD FACE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE COSTS AND INCREASED USE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ANY SUCH DISASTER OR SIMILAR EVENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OR AVAILABILITY OF OUR DATA OR TO STRATEGICALLY IMPLEMENT NEW OR UPGRADE

OR CONSOLIDATE EXISTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PRICE OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN EFFICIENT AND UNINTERRUPTED FASHION, AND TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS DEPENDS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATA IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES,

CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATION OF NEW BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS TO CONSOLIDATE AND INTEGRATE THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE AND HAVE UPGRADED AND EXPANDED OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES. OUR

INFORMATION SYSTEMS REQUIRE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT OF SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN, PROTECT AND ENHANCE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING SYSTEMS AND

REGULATORY STANDARDS, AND CHANGING CUSTOMER PATTERNS. IF THE INFORMATION WE RELY UPON TO RUN OUR BUSINESSES WERE FOUND TO BE INACCURATE OR UNRELIABLE OR IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DATA INTEGRITY EFFECTIVELY, WE COULD LOSE

EXISTING CUSTOMERS, HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS, HAVE PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING MEDICAL COST ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE PRICING, HAVE DISPUTES WITH CUSTOMERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, HAVE REGULATORY

PROBLEMS, HAVE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES OR SUFFER OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATING THE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WE OPERATE, UPGRADING AND EXPANDING OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES,

PROTECTING AND ENHANCING OUR SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPING NEW SYSTEMS TO KEEP PACE WITH CONTINUING CHANGES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS ISSUES WILL NOT ARISE IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE AND

INTEGRATE OUR SYSTEMS SUCCESSFULLY COULD RESULT IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED COSTS AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS TIME AND ENERGY, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO OUR DATABASES AND RELATED PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION-RELATED BUSINESSES

COULD BE HINDERED AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE RELY ON OUR AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES,

AND OUR TRADEMARKS, TRADE SECRETS, COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. THESE LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS MAY NOT PREVENT MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, AND WE EXPECT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND COMPETITORS IN THIS INDUSTRY SEGMENT GROWS. SUCH LITIGATION AND

MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO MARKET AND SELL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FUNDS FROM SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IS RESTRICTED AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

BECAUSE WE OPERATE AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON DIVIDENDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM SOME OF

OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS. THESE SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY ARE REGULATED BY STATES DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY LAW TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIC PRESCRIBED MINIMUM AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IN THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE LEVELS

OF CAPITALIZATION REQUIRED DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON THE VOLUME OF PREMIUM REVENUES GENERATED. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PREMIUM VOLUME WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITALIZATION FROM US. IN MOST STATES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK PRIOR APPROVAL BY THESE STATE

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES BEFORE WE TRANSFER MONEY OR PAY DIVIDENDS FROM THESE SUBSIDIARIES THAT EXCEED SPECIFIED AMOUNTS. IN ADDITION, WE NORMALLY NOTIFY THE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCE PRIOR TO MAKING PAYMENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE APPROVAL. AN

INABILITY OF OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES COULD IMPACT THE SCALE TO WHICH WE COULD REINVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

AND OUR ABILITY TO REPAY OUR DEBT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ANY FAILURE BY US TO MANAGE AND COMPLETE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS SUCCESSFULLY COULD HARM OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS, BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE FREQUENTLY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES REGARDING POSSIBLE

INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES, AND OUTSOURCING TRANSACTIONS AND OFTEN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS RELATING TO SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IF WE FAIL TO IDENTIFY AND COMPLETE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSACTIONS THAT FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY INTERNALLY, WE MAY BE AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE OR WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NEGATIVE MARKET PERCEPTIONS, ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

DOWNGRADES IN OUR DEBT RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AND DEBT RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATING ORGANIZATIONS ARE

INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. RATINGS INFORMATION IS BROADLY DISSEMINATED AND GENERALLY USED THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE OUR CLAIMS PAYING ABILITY AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS TO CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR DEBT RATINGS IMPACT BOTH THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS. EACH OF THE RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATINGS PERIODICALLY AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT RATINGS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE. OUR RATINGS REFLECT EACH RATING AGENCYS OPINION OF OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH, OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND ABILITY TO MEET OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS.

DOWNGRADES IN OUR RATINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
