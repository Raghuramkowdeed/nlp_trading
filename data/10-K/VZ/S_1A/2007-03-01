ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

WE FACE

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION THAT MAY REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND LOWER OUR PROFITS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED THE TRADITIONAL LINES BETWEEN LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, WIRELESS, CABLE AND INTERNET

COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND BROUGHT NEW COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES HAVE

ENABLED US TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WILL DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO

VARIOUS COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING NEW SERVICES THAT MAY BE INTRODUCED BY OUR COMPETITORS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND PRICING PRESSURES. BECAUSE WE ARE SUBJECT TO MORE REGULATION AND HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES THAN

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS, DUE IN PART TO THE PRESENCE OF A UNIONIZED WORKFORCE AND A LARGE RETIREE POPULATION IN OUR WIRELINE BUSINESS, OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER SERVICES AT LOWER PRICES. THE RESULTING PRESSURE ON THE PRICE OF SERVICES

PROVIDED BY US MAY RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES AND REDUCTION OF PROFITS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE WORKFORCE OF OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY NON-UNION, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS UNIONS MAY HAVE IN ORGANIZING THIS WORKFORCE OR

THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SUCH LABOR ORGANIZING ON OUR COSTS.

UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN A DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES OR MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.

OUR INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING RAPID CHANGE AS NEW

TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN ORDER TO GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW

OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET FUTURE ADVANCES IN COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

SERVICES IN OUR INDUSTRY REQUIRES US TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THE VARIED AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING DEMANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION,

THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS TO OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES. IF THESE SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES

MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR PRIMARY WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, CDMA, AND ITS UPGRADES OFFER MANY ADVANTAGES, MANY COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE CHOSEN GSM OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AS THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS FOR

THEIR WIRELESS NETWORKS. THERE ARE RISKS THAT CURRENT OR FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES AND EVOLUTIONARY PATH THAT WE HAVE SELECTED MAY NOT BE DEMANDED BY EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS OR PROVIDE THE ADVANTAGES THAT WE EXPECT. IN

ADDITION, THERE ARE RISKS THAT OTHER WIRELESS CARRIERS ON WHOM OUR CUSTOMERS ROAM MAY CHANGE THEIR TECHNOLOGY TO GSM OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH OURS. AS A RESULT, THE ABILITY OF OUR AND SUCH OTHER CARRIERS CUSTOMERS TO

ROAM ON OUR RESPECTIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IF THESE RISKS MATERIALIZE, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, AND TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR CUSTOMER REVENUES

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE DEPEND ON KEY

SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE ALSO DEPEND UPON VARIOUS KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE US WITH THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. IF THESE SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS FAIL TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE TO US ON A TIMELY BASIS,

IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND, IN ADDITION, WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN OUR FCC LICENSES REGARDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR WIRELESS NETWORK. THESE SUPPLIERS AND

VENDORS MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY THAT WE DEPEND ON FOR OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS.

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FCC AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE

AND LOCAL AGENCIES. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR PROVISION OF RETAIL OR WHOLESALE SERVICES, OR THE REVIEWS BY FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF REGULATORY

RULINGS. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS INTERNET PROTOCOL-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING VOIP AND SUPER HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND AND VIDEO, COULD BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING

REGULATION BETWEEN THE FCC AND VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY HAS LED TO

AN INCREASE IN EFFORTS BY SOME STATE LEGISLATURES AND STATE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS TO REGULATE THE INDUSTRY IN WAYS THAT MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON VERIZON WIRELESS. MOREOVER, MANY STATES HAVE ALSO IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT TAXES ON PROVIDERS IN

THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES OR

SETTLEMENTS.

OUR BUSINESS FACES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

LITIGATION, INCLUDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS, ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO OUR ADVERTISING, SALES, BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS ALSO FACES PERSONAL INJURY AND

CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATING TO ALLEGED HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIRELESS PHONES OR RADIOFREQUENCY TRANSMITTERS, AND CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT CHALLENGE MARKETING PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURES RELATING TO ALLEGED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF HANDHELD

WIRELESS PHONES. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OR SETTLEMENTS.
