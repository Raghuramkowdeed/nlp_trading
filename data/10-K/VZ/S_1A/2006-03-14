ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION

THAT MAY REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND LOWER OUR PROFITS

WE

FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED THE TRADITIONAL LINES BETWEEN LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, WIRELESS, CABLE AND INTERNET COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND BROUGHT NEW

COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES HAVE ENABLED US TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF

SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WILL DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING

NEW SERVICES THAT MAY BE INTRODUCED BY OUR COMPETITORS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND PRICING PRESSURES. BECAUSE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO LESS REGULATION AND HAVE LOWER COST STRUCTURES THAN US, DUE IN PART TO

THE ABSENCE OF A UNIONIZED WORK FORCE AND FEWER RETIREES, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER SERVICES AT LOWER PRICES. THE RESULTING PRESSURE ON THE PRICE OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY US MAY RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES AND REDUCTION OF PROFITS.

UNLESS WE EFFECTIVELY KEEP PACE WITH TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES

OUR INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING RAPID CHANGE AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN ORDER TO GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO

FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET FUTURE ADVANCES IN COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE

COST, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES IN OUR INDUSTRY REQUIRES US TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THE VARIED AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING DEMANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY

PREDICT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS TO OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES. IF THESE SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY REGIME UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY

THE FCC AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR PROVISION OF RETAIL OR WHOLESALE SERVICES, OR THE REVIEWS BY FEDERAL

OR STATE COURTS OF REGULATORY RULINGS. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR

CHANGES TO THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS INTERNET PROTOCOL-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING VOIP AND SUPER HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND AND VIDEO, COULD BE

SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING REGULATION BETWEEN THE FCC AND VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY.
