BACKGROUND

OUR WIRELESS SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DOING BUSINESS AS VERIZON WIRELESS. CELLCO PARTNERSHIP WAS FORMED AS A JOINT VENTURE IN APRIL 2000 BY THE COMBINATION OF THE UNITED STATES

(U.S.) WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE). ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2013, VERIZON ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH VODAFONE AND VODAFONE 4 LIMITED, PURSUANT TO WHICH VERIZON AGREED TO ACQUIRE ALL

OF VODAFONES INDIRECT 45% INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS FOR AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $130 BILLION (THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION). WE COMPLETED THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION ON FEBRUARY 21, 2014 AND, AS A RESULT, WE ACQUIRED 100%

OWNERSHIP OF VERIZON WIRELESS. THE CONSIDERATION PAID WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CASH AND VERIZON COMMON STOCK.

VERIZON

WIRELESS IS THE LARGEST WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES AS MEASURED BY RETAIL CONNECTIONS AND REVENUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, VERIZON WIRELESS HAD 108.2 MILLION RETAIL CONNECTIONS AND 2014 REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $87.6

BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 69% OF VERIZONS AGGREGATE REVENUES. WE PROVIDE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SERVICES ACROSS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS IN THE U.S. AND HAVE THE LARGEST FOURTH-GENERATION (4G) LONG-TERM

EVOLUTION (LTE) TECHNOLOGY AND THIRD-GENERATION (3G) EVOLUTIONDATA OPTIMIZED (EV-DO) NETWORKS OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER.

OUR 4G LTE NETWORK IS AVAILABLE TO OVER 98% OF THE U.S. POPULATION IN MORE THAN 500 MARKETS COVERING APPROXIMATELY 309 MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THOSE IN AREAS SERVED BY OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA

PARTNERS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE ARE WORKING WITH WIRELESS CARRIERS IN RURAL AREAS TO COLLABORATIVELY BUILD AND OPERATE A 4G LTE NETWORK USING EACH CARRIERS NETWORK ASSETS AND OUR CORE 4G LTE EQUIPMENT AND 700 MHZ C BLOCK AND ADVANCED WIRELESS

SERVICES (AWS) SPECTRUM.

WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR 4G LTE NETWORK AND ARE FOCUSING OUR CAPITAL

SPENDING ON ADDING CAPACITY AND DENSITY TO THIS NETWORK.

WIRELESS SERVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS

OUR WIRELESS SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS RECEIVING SERVICE UNDER THE VERIZON WIRELESS BRAND. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS CAN OBTAIN

WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT OPERATE ON OUR NETWORK FROM RESELLERS THAT PURCHASE NETWORK ACCESS FROM US ON A WHOLESALE BASIS.

CONNECTIONS RECEIVED OUR WIRELESS SERVICES ON A POSTPAID BASIS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014. OUR PREPAID SERVICE ENABLES INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN WIRELESS SERVICES WITHOUT A LONG-TERM CONTRACT OR CREDIT VERIFICATION BY PAYING FOR ALL SERVICES IN

ADVANCE.

WE OFFER VARIOUS POSTPAID ACCOUNT PLANS, INCLUDING OUR MORE EVERYTHING

®

CUSTOMERS THAT CHOOSE OUR VERIZON EDGE DEVICE PAYMENT PLAN OPTION, WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO UPGRADE THEIR HANDSET AFTER A MINIMUM OF THIRTY DAYS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, ALSO RECEIVE DISCOUNTED MONTHLY ACCESS FEES ON MORE EVERYTHING PLANS.

FOR AN ADDITIONAL MONTHLY ACCESS FEE, OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE THE OPTION OF SHARING LONG DISTANCE AND ROAMING MINUTES AMONG THEIR DEVICES FOR CALLS FROM THE UNITED STATES TO, AND CALLS WHILE WITHIN, CANADA AND MEXICO. THE MORE EVERYTHING PLANS ALSO

INCLUDE OUR MOBILE HOTSPOT SERVICE AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. THIS SERVICE ENABLES A CUSTOMER TO ACTIVATE A PERSONAL WI-FI HOTSPOT VIA THEIR SMARTPHONE THAT CAN PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS TO MULTIPLE WI-FI ENABLED DEVICES. WE ALSO OFFER VARIOUS VOICE AND

SHARED DATA PLANS FOR SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, MORE EVERYTHING ACCOUNTS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 61% OF OUR RETAIL POSTPAID ACCOUNTS.

WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS A WIDE VARIETY OF WIRELESS SERVICES ACCESSIBLE ON A BROAD RANGE OF OUR DEVICES. OUR MESSAGING

SERVICES ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO SEND AND RECEIVE TEXT, PICTURE AND VIDEO MESSAGES. IN ADDITION, ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS AVAILABLE ON ALL OF OUR SMARTPHONES AND NEARLY ALL OF OUR BASIC PHONES. WE ALSO OFFER SERVICE THAT ENABLES OUR CUSTOMERS TO

ACCESS THE INTERNET WIRELESSLY AT BROADBAND SPEEDS ON NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS AND TABLETS THAT EITHER HAVE EMBEDDED 4G LTE OR 3G EV-DO MODULES OR THAT ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SEPARATE DEVICES THAT ENABLE ACCESS TO THIS SERVICE, SUCH AS USB MODEMS,

JETPACKS

TM

AND OTHER DEDICATED DEVICES THAT PROVIDE A

MOBILE WI-FI CONNECTION.

OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ACCESS MULTIMEDIA OFFERINGS, MOSTLY PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, CONSISTING OF

APPLICATIONS PROVIDING MUSIC, VIDEO, GAMING, NEWS AND OTHER CONTENT. OUR BUSINESS-FOCUSED OFFERINGS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY, INCLUDE SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET, THEIR CORPORATE INTRANETS AND E-MAIL

ACROSS OUR DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF WIRELESS DEVICES. OUR LOCATION-BASED SERVICES PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH DIRECTIONS TO THEIR DESTINATION AND ENABLE OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO LOCATE, MONITOR AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR MOBILE FIELD WORKERS. OUR GLOBAL

DATA SERVICES ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS DATA SERVICES ON OUR GLOBAL READY PHONES FROM HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS AND TO ACCESS THE INTERNET AT SUCH DESTINATIONS WITH LAPTOPS THAT ARE EITHER GLOBAL READY, TETHERED TO A GLOBAL READY

PHONE, OR ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER GLOBAL READY DEVICES, SUCH AS CERTAIN USB MODEMS OR JETPACKS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING UPON THEIR WIRELESS DEVICES OPERATING SYSTEM, OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO MORE THAN ONE MILLION APPLICATIONS AND

SERVICES OFFERED BY GOOGLE INC. (GOOGLE) VIA GOOGLE PLAY, APPLE INC. (APPLE) VIA ITUNES, MICROSOFT INC. (MICROSOFT) VIA ITS WINDOWS PHONE OS OPERATING SYSTEM AND BLACKBERRY LIMITED (BLACKBERRY) VIA ITS BLACKBERRY APP WORLD WEBSTORE.

OUR CUSTOMERS CAN MAKE AND RECEIVE CALLS ON THEIR HOME PHONE HANDSETS USING OUR WIRELESS NETWORK THROUGH OUR HOME PHONE CONNECT SERVICE

OR VERIZON 4G LTE BROADBAND ROUTER WITH VOICE SERVICE. WE ALSO OFFER LTE INTERNET (INSTALLED), A HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICE THAT PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH INTERNET CONNECTIONS IN THEIR HOMES USING OUR 4G LTE NETWORK.

IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE NETWORK ACCESS AND, IN SOME CASES, ENHANCED VALUE ADDED SERVICES TO SUPPORT TELEMETRY-TYPE APPLICATIONS, WHICH

ARE CHARACTERIZED BY MACHINE-TO-MACHINE (M2M) WIRELESS CONNECTIONS. OUR M2M SERVICES SUPPORT DEVICES THAT ARE USED BY A VARIETY OF VERTICAL MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING HEALTH MONITORING, EDUCATION, MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES, DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMER

PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, COMPANIES PURCHASE NETWORK ACCESS AND, IN SOME CASES, ENHANCED SERVICES FROM US IN ORDER TO CONNECT WITH AND MONITOR EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS MEDICAL DEVICES USED TO MONITOR PATIENTS, FLEET MANAGEMENT DEVICES USED TO MONITOR

COMPANY-OPERATED VEHICLES AND UTILITY MONITORING DEVICES USED FOR SMART GRID APPLICATIONS. OTHER COMPANIES PURCHASE NETWORK ACCESS FROM US TO SUPPORT DEVICES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN A SERVICE THEY, IN TURN, SELL TO END USERS. WE ALSO SUPPORT TELEMATICS

SERVICES FOR SOME OF THE LARGEST AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS. WE EXPECT THAT CONSUMER USE OF M2M WIRELESS CONNECTIONS, SUCH AS HOME MONITORING, HEALTH MONITORING, ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND UTILITIES MANAGEMENT WILL INCREASE AS CONSUMERS INTEGRATE THESE

DEVICES INTO THEIR MOBILE LIFESTYLE.

WIRELESS DEVICES

WE OFFER SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF WIRELESS DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES AND BASIC PHONES, TABLETS AND OTHER INTERNET ACCESS DEVICES.

SMARTPHONES AND BASIC PHONES

. NEARLY ALL OF THE SMARTPHONES WE OFFER ARE ENABLED TO UTILIZE OUR 4G LTE AND/OR 3G EV-DO HIGH-SPEED

DATA SERVICES AND RUN ON VARIOUS OPERATING PLATFORMS, SUCH AS APPLE IOS, GOOGLE ANDROID, BLACKBERRY OS, AND WINDOWS PHONE OS. MOST OF THE BASIC PHONES WE OFFER ARE 3G EV-DO-ENABLED AND HAVE HTML-BROWSING CAPABILITY.

TABLETS AND OTHER INTERNET DEVICES.

WE OFFER TABLETS FROM MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS, ALL OF WHICH CAN ACCESS THE INTERNET VIA OUR 4G

LTE NETWORK OR A WI-FI CONNECTION. THE TABLETS RUN PRIMARILY ON THE APPLE IOS, GOOGLE ANDROID OR MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, WE OFFER DEDICATED DEVICES, WHICH WE REFER TO AS JETPACKS, THAT PROVIDE A MOBILE WI-FI 4G LTE AND/OR

3G EV-DO CONNECTION AND ARE CAPABLE OF CONNECTING MULTIPLE WI-FI ENABLED DEVICES TO THE INTERNET AT ONE TIME. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO ACCESS THE INTERNET WIRELESSLY AT BROADBAND SPEEDS ON THEIR

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPUTERS VIA DATA CARDS, USB MODEMS OR THROUGH THE USE OF CERTAIN LAPTOP COMPUTERS AND NETBOOKS WITH EMBEDDED 4G LTE AND 3G EV-DO MOBILE BROADBAND MODULES. DURING 2014, WE CONTINUED TO

EXPERIENCE STRONG CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR TABLETS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR RETAIL POSTPAID CONNECTION BASE REPRESENTED BY CONNECTIONS TO THESE DEVICES CONTINUED TO INCREASE.

WE PURCHASE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR WIRELESS DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES FROM APPLE, MOTOROLA MOBILITY, SAMSUNG, LG ELECTRONICS, BLACKBERRY AND HTC.

A KEY COMPONENT OF ALL WIRELESS DEVICES IS THE CHIPSET, WHICH CONTAINS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE DEVICE. THE LTE CHIPSETS USED

IN OUR 4G LTE-ENABLED DEVICES ARE MANUFACTURED BY VARIOUS COMPANIES, EACH USING ITS OWN 4G LTE CHIPSET. TO SUPPORT CDMA-1XRTT AND EVDO TECHNOLOGIES (WITH AND WITHOUT 4G LTE), MOST OF OUR WIRELESS DEVICE SUPPLIERS CURRENTLY RELY ON QUALCOMM

INCORPORATED FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF CHIPSETS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPONENTS COMMON TO WIRELESS DEVICES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELECTRONIC COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS THAT WE DO NOT DEAL WITH DIRECTLY.

NETWORK

WE HAVE THE

LARGEST 4G LTE AND 3G EV-DO NETWORKS OF ANY SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH LICENSED AND OPERATIONAL COVERAGE IN ALL OF THE 100 MOST POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. AS OF JANUARY 22, 2015, OUR 4G LTE NETWORK COVERED APPROXIMATELY

309 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S., INCLUDING THOSE IN AREAS SERVED BY OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PARTNERS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE 21 COMMITTED PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE 4G LTE COVERAGE TO APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION PEOPLE

AND, TO DATE, EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS HAVE COMMENCED 4G LTE OPERATIONS ON SUCH NETWORKS.

THE FOUNDATION OF OUR CONTINUED

SUCCESS IS NETWORK RELIABILITY, WHICH IS THE HALLMARK OF THE VERIZON BRAND. WE BELIEVE THAT STEADY AND CONSISTENT NETWORK AND PLATFORM INVESTMENTS PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHICH WILL FUEL PROFITABLE GROWTH. THE

DEPTH AND BREADTH OF OUR NETWORK PROVIDES OUR FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH AND IS THE BASIS FOR OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN 2014,

WE ANNOUNCED THE DEPLOYMENT OF AWS SPECTRUM IN OUR 4G LTE NETWORK. THIS ADDITIONAL BANDWIDTH, WHICH WE REFER TO AND BRAND AS XLTE, PROVIDES ADDITIONAL NETWORK CAPACITY AND IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN MORE THAN 400 MARKETS. NEARLY ALL 4G LTE DEVICES

THAT WE CURRENTLY SELL CAN OPERATE ON XLTE.

WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THE HIGHEST NETWORK RELIABILITY FOR THEIR

WIRELESS SERVICES. WE DESIGN AND DEPLOY OUR NETWORK IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL DATA SESSIONS, INCLUDING VIDEO, AND COMPLETIONS OF LARGE FILE DOWNLOADS AND UPLOADS WHILE DELIVERING ON OUR ADVERTISED

THROUGHPUT SPEEDS AND THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT ARE CONNECTED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND COMPLETED WITHOUT BEING DROPPED. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO UPGRADE OUR NETWORK, PRIMARILY TO INCREASE ITS CAPACITY AND DENSITY, BY UTILIZING SMALL CELL

TECHNOLOGY, IN-BUILDING SOLUTIONS AND DISTRIBUTED ANTENNAE SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO DEPLOYING EXISTING AWS SPECTRUM. WE ARE ALSO EXPLORING STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR NATIONAL NETWORK COVERAGE THROUGH SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS OF WIRELESS

OPERATIONS AND SPECTRUM LICENSES.

IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN NETWORK COVERAGE, WE HAVE ROAMING AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE WIRELESS SERVICE IN NEARLY ALL OTHER AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WIRELESS SERVICE IS AVAILABLE. WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES TO OUR

CUSTOMERS THROUGH ROAMING ARRANGEMENTS WITH WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. CERTAIN OF OUR ROAMING AGREEMENTS CAN BE TERMINATED AT-WILL BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS NOTICE; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

TERMINATION OF ANY OF THESE AT-WILL AGREEMENTS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

TECHNOLOGY

OUR PRIMARY NETWORK TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE 4G LTE AND 3G CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS (CDMA). 4G LTE PROVIDES HIGHER DATA THROUGHPUT

PERFORMANCE FOR DATA SERVICES AT A LOWER COST COMPARED TO THOSE OFFERED BY 3G TECHNOLOGIES.

IN 2014, WE COMMERCIALLY LAUNCHED

OUR MOBILE VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (VOIP) SERVICE KNOWN AS VOICE OVER LTE (VOLTE). ADVANCED CALLING 1.0 IS A FIRST GENERATION SUITE OF SERVICES ENABLED BY VOLTE, WHICH IS A TECHNOLOGY NOW BEING USED, IN ADDITION TO CDMA TECHNOLOGY, TO PROVIDE

VOICE CALLING SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

OUR NETWORK INCLUDES VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF REDUNDANCY DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE

RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICE. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF POWER DISRUPTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS, WE HAVE BATTERY BACKUP AT EVERY SWITCH AND EVERY CELL SITE IN OUR NETWORK. WE ALSO UTILIZE BACKUP GENERATORS AT A MAJORITY OF OUR CELL SITES AND AT EVERY

SWITCH LOCATION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A FLEET OF PORTABLE BACKUP GENERATORS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED TO CELL SITES, IF NEEDED. WE FURTHER ENHANCE RELIABILITY BY USING A FULLY REDUNDANT BACKBONE MULTIPROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING NETWORK IN ALL CRITICAL

LOCATIONS.

SPECTRUM

THE SPECTRUM LICENSES WE HOLD CAN BE USED FOR MOBILE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WE HAVE LICENSES TO PROVIDE THESE WIRELESS SERVICES ON PORTIONS OF THE 800 MHZ BAND, ALSO KNOWN AS

CELLULAR SPECTRUM, THE 1800-1900 MHZ BAND, ALSO KNOWN AS PERSONAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES (PCS) SPECTRUM, PORTIONS OF THE 700 MHZ UPPER C BAND AND AWS SPECTRUM IN THE 1700 AND 2100 MHZ BANDS, IN AREAS THAT, COLLECTIVELY, COVER NEARLY ALL OF THE

POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. THIS INCREASING DEMAND

IS BEING DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS AND USAGE OF WIRELESS BROADBAND SERVICES, WHICH USE MORE BANDWIDTH AND REQUIRE EVER FASTER RATES OF SPEED TO STAY COMPETITIVE. WE CAN MEET OUR FUTURE SPECTRUM NEEDS BY ACQUIRING LICENSES OR LEASING

SPECTRUM FROM OTHER LICENSEES, OR BY ACQUIRING NEW SPECTRUM LICENSES FROM THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC), IF AND WHEN FUTURE FCC SPECTRUM AUCTIONS OCCUR. ON JANUARY 29, 2015, THE FCC COMPLETED AN AUCTION OF 65 MHZ OF SPECTRUM,

WHICH IT IDENTIFIED AS THE AWS-3 BAND. VERIZON PARTICIPATED IN THAT AUCTION, AND WAS THE HIGH BIDDER ON 181 SPECTRUM LICENSES, FOR WHICH WE WILL PAY APPROXIMATELY $10.4 BILLION. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, WE MADE A DEPOSIT OF $0.9

BILLION RELATED TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS AUCTION. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2015, WE MADE A DOWN PAYMENT OF $1.2 BILLION FOR THESE SPECTRUM LICENSES. VERIZON HAS SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR THESE LICENSES AND MUST COMPLETE PAYMENT FOR THEM IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. IN ADDITION, CONGRESS HAS ADOPTED LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNDING OF A NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY NETWORK AND THE REALLOCATION AND AUCTION, THROUGH THE USE OF VOLUNTARY INCENTIVE AUCTIONS, BY 2022

OF PORTIONS OF THE EXISTING TELEVISION BROADCAST SPECTRUM IN THE 600 MHZ BAND. THE INCENTIVE AUCTION RELATED TO SUCH SPECTRUM IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN 2016, ALTHOUGH THE SPECIFIC TIMING OF THIS AND OTHER AUCTIONS WILL BE DETERMINED BY FUTURE

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

SINCE WE AND COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SPECTRUM SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN

MARKETS AND MAY HAVE SPECTRUM SURPLUSES IN OTHERS, FROM TIME TO TIME WE EXCHANGED SPECTRUM LICENSES WITH OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGH SECONDARY MARKET SWAP TRANSACTIONS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES TO TRADE SPECTRUM

LICENSES IN ORDER TO MEET CERTAIN OF OUR CAPACITY AND EXPANSION NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. IN OTHER CASES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTRA-MARKET SPECTRUM SWAPS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CONTIGUOUS SPECTRUM WITHIN FREQUENCY BANDS IN A SPECIFIC MARKET.

CONTIGUOUS SPECTRUM IMPROVES NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY. THESE SWAPS AS WELL AS ANY SPECTRUM PURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR THE TRANSFER OF SPECTRUM LICENSES IN EACH INSTANCE.

SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING SPECTRUM LICENSE TRANSACTIONS.

NETWORK EQUIPMENT AND BUILD-OUT

ALCATEL-LUCENT AND ERICSSON ARE CURRENTLY OUR PRIMARY NETWORK VENDORS FOR OUR LTE NETWORK DEPLOYMENTS FOR MACRO SITES AS WELL AS SMALL CELLS. OUR PRIMARY CDMA CELL SITE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE VENDORS

ARE ALCATEL-LUCENT, WHICH PROVIDES MORE THAN HALF OF OUR CDMA CELL SITE EQUIPMENT, AND NOKIA SOLUTIONS AND NETWORKS (NSN) AND ERICSSON, WHICH TOGETHER PROVIDE NEARLY ALL OF OUR REMAINING CELL SITE EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO RELY ON ALCATEL-LUCENT, NSN AND

ERICSSON FOR OUR SWITCHING EQUIPMENT.

AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD AND UPGRADE OUR EXISTING NETWORK, WE MUST COMPLETE A VARIETY OF

STEPS, INCLUDING SECURING RIGHTS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF SITES AND OBTAINING ZONING AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR MACRO SITES, SMALL CELLS, IN-BUILDING SYSTEMS AND ANTENNAS AND RELATED RADIO EQUIPMENT THAT COMPRISE DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS.

WE UTILIZE TOWER SITE MANAGEMENT FIRMS, SUCH AS CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION (AMERICAN TOWER), AS LESSORS OR MANAGERS OF A PORTION OF OUR EXISTING TOWER SITES.

ON FEBRUARY 5, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH AMERICAN TOWER PURSUANT TO WHICH AMERICAN TOWER WILL HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS

TO LEASE AND OPERATE OVER 11,300 OF OUR WIRELESS TOWERS FOR AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $5.0 BILLION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASES, AMERICAN TOWER WILL HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO LEASE AND OPERATE THE TOWERS OVER AN AVERAGE TERM OF APPROXIMATELY 28 YEARS.

AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION, WE WILL ALSO SELL 165 TOWERS FOR $0.1 BILLION. WE WILL SUBLEASE CAPACITY ON THE TOWERS FROM AMERICAN TOWER FOR A MINIMUM OF 10 YEARS AT CURRENT MARKET RATES, WITH OPTIONS TO RENEW. AS THE LEASES EXPIRE, AMERICAN

TOWER WILL HAVE FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE THESE TOWERS BASED ON THEIR ANTICIPATED FAIR MARKET VALUES AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERMS. THIS TRANSACTION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE DURING THE

FIRST HALF OF 2015.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON OFFERING SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF OUR VARIOUS CUSTOMER MARKET GROUPS; PROMOTING OUR BRAND; LEVERAGING OUR EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; AND JOINTLY

MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO LARGE BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS WITH VERIZONS WIRELINE BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH VERIZON ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS, A SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL OF VERIZONS SOLUTIONS FOR

MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS GLOBALLY. OUR MARKETING PLAN INCLUDES A COORDINATED PROGRAM OF TELEVISION, PRINT, RADIO, OUTDOOR SIGNAGE, INTERNET AND POINT-OF-SALE MEDIA PROMOTIONS DESIGNED TO PRESENT OUR CORPORATE MESSAGE

CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL OF OUR MARKETS. WE USE A COMBINATION OF DIRECT, INDIRECT AND ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN ORDER TO INCREASE CUSTOMER GROWTH WHILE REDUCING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS.

COMPANY-OPERATED STORES ARE A CORE COMPONENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY. OUR DIRECT CHANNEL, WHICH INCLUDES OUR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS

SALES OPERATIONS AND SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION, IS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS OF CONSUMERS AND LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A TELEMARKETING SALES FORCE DEDICATED TO HANDLING INCOMING

CALLS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND WE OFFER FULLY-AUTOMATED, END-TO-END WEB-BASED SALES OF WIRELESS DEVICES, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICE PLANS.

IN 2013, WE OPENED OUR FIRST VERIZON DESTINATION STORE AT THE MALL OF AMERICA IN BLOOMINGTON, MINNESOTA, AND IN 2014 WE OPENED TWO ADDITIONAL DESTINATION STORES IN CHICAGO AND HOUSTON. THESE STORES FOCUS

ON THE MOBILE LIFESTYLE AND HIGHLIGHT THE MANY WAYS CONSUMERS CAN USE WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. THESE STORES ARE PART OF A BROADER INITIATIVE THAT INCLUDES THE REDESIGN OF OUR RETAIL STORES NATIONWIDE INTO SMART STORES,

WHICH SHOWCASE THE SAME MOBILE LIFESTYLE ZONES AS THE VERIZON DESTINATION STORES BUT ON A SMALLER SCALE. IN ADDITION, OUR ONLINE STORE HAS ALSO BEEN REDESIGNED TO DELIVER A CONSISTENT SHOPPING EXPERIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS, WHETHER ACCESSING THE STORE

VIA THEIR DESKTOP OR MOBILE DEVICE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL INCLUDES AGENTS THAT SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AT RETAIL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE INTERNET. THE MAJORITY OF THESE AGENTS SELL BOTH OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND DO SO UNDER EXCLUSIVE SELLING ARRANGEMENTS WITH US. WE ALSO

UTILIZE HIGH-PROFILE, NATIONAL RETAILERS, SUCH AS BEST BUY, WAL-MART AND TARGET, TO SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. STORES SUCH AS DOLLAR GENERAL AND VARIOUS DRUGSTORE CHAINS SELL OUR PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE

ALSO HAVE ENTERED INTO AGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF BROADBAND, VIDEO AND VOICE SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGH WHICH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OR BUNDLED WITH THEIR SERVICES.

COMPETITION

WE OPERATE

IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY. WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING AT&T, SPRINT CORPORATION AND T-MOBILE USA, AS WELL AS VARIOUS REGIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COMPETE FOR RETAIL ACTIVATIONS

WITH RESELLERS THAT BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM FACILITIES-BASED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR RESALE, INCLUDING THOSE THAT BUY FROM US. COMPETITION HAS INTENSIFIED AND WE EXPECT IT TO REMAIN INTENSE AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING INCREASES IN

WIRELESS MARKET PENETRATION LEVELS, NETWORK INVESTMENT BY OUR COMPETITORS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, NEW MARKET ENTRANTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM, BOTH LICENSED

AND UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. COMPETITION MAY ALSO INCREASE AS SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MERGE OR TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING TO INCREASE THEIR BRAND

RECOGNITION AND CAPTURE CUSTOMER REVENUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IN ADDITION TO NON-TRADITIONAL OFFERINGS IN MOBILE DATA. FOR EXAMPLE, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, APPLE AND OTHERS ARE OFFERING ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR

MAKING WIRELESS VOICE CALLS THAT, IN CERTAIN CASES, CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF THE WIRELESS PROVIDERS VOICE SERVICE OR THE PROVISION OF ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF CONSUMING VIDEO CONTENT IN A NONLINEAR FORMAT.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY.



NETWORK RELIABILITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE.

WE BELIEVE THAT A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE SERVICE

IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE U.S. MARKET AND A DRIVER OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. LOWER PRICES, IMPROVED SERVICE QUALITY AND NEW WIRELESS SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHICH IN MANY CASES INCLUDE VIDEO CONTENT, HAVE LED TO INCREASED CUSTOMER USAGE OF WIRELESS

SERVICES, WHICH, IN TURN, PUTS PRESSURE ON NETWORK CAPACITY. IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY NEEDS AND OFFER HIGHLY RELIABLE NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR NETWORKS. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR 4G LTE NETWORK WILL HELP US TO KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR HIGHER SPEEDS.



PRICING.

SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PRICING PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE WIRELESS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. AS THE DEMAND FOR WIRELESS SERVICES

CONTINUES TO GROW, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING SERVICE PLANS THAT INCLUDE UNLIMITED VOICE MINUTES AND TEXT MESSAGES AND A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF DATA ACCESS IN VARYING MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE SIZES OR, IN SOME CASES, UNLIMITED DATA USAGE AT

COMPETITIVE PRICES. SOME WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ALSO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO ROLLOVER UNUSED DATA ALLOWANCES TO THE NEXT BILLING PERIOD AND ARE ALSO OFFERING INSTALLMENT PLANS THAT DECOUPLE SERVICE PRICING FROM EQUIPMENT PRICING AND BLUR THE

TRADITIONAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN PREPAID AND POSTPAID PLANS. IN 2015, WE EXPECT THAT CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPT THESE INSTALLMENT PLANS, WHICH ALSO OFFER DISCOUNTS ON THE COST OF WIRELESS SERVICE. FURTHERMORE, SOME WIRELESS PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING

NEW CUSTOMERS PRICE PLANS THAT UNDERCUT PRICING UNDER THE CUSTOMERS SERVICE PLAN WITH ITS CURRENT WIRELESS PROVIDER AND PROVIDE A CREDIT TO REIMBURSE EARLY TERMINATION FEES PAID TO THEIR FORMER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

LIMITATIONS, IN ADDITION TO PROMOTIONS TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TO CUSTOMERS OF VERIZON WIRELESS. WE SEEK TO COMPETE IN THIS AREA BY OFFERING OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WILL REGARD AS THE BEST AVAILABLE VALUE FOR THE PRICE, AS WELL

AS SERVICE PLANS THAT MEET THEIR WIRELESS SERVICE NEEDS.



CUSTOMER SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH-QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY FACTOR IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING THOSE OF OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CONVENIENT AND EASY-TO-USE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND FOCUSING ON THEIR NEEDS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM

RELATIONSHIPS AND MINIMIZE CHURN. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON IMPROVING IN THIS AREA. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, IN 2014 WE INTRODUCED

VERIZON SMART REWARDS, WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS A WIDE VARIETY OF REWARDS TO CUSTOMERS IN EXCHANGE FOR POINTS THEY EARN IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACCOUNT-RELATED INTERACTIONS WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. THE PROGRAM OFFERS CUSTOMERS DISCOUNTS AND

SAVINGS ON MERCHANDISE FROM WELL-KNOWN BRANDS, AS WELL AS DISCOUNTS AND OTHER OFFERS AT LOCAL SHOPPING AND DINING VENUES.



PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT.

AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP AND WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS PROLIFERATE, CONTINUED CUSTOMER AND REVENUE

GROWTH WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED DATA PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND IN

COLLABORATION WITH APPLICATION AND CONTENT PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH VARIOUS DEVICE MANUFACTURERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTINCTIVE SMARTPHONES AND OTHER WIRELESS DEVICES THAT CAN ACCESS THE GROWING ARRAY OF DATA APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT

AVAILABLE OVER THE INTERNET. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON INCREASING THE PENETRATION OF SMARTPHONES, TABLETS AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES THROUGHOUT OUR CUSTOMER BASE.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION.

KEY TO ACHIEVING SALES SUCCESS IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF SALES CHANNELS AND DISTRIBUTION

POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ATTAINING THE OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF VARYING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING PROFITABILITY, AS MEASURED BY OPERATING INCOME. WE ENDEAVOR TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES,

OUTSIDE SALES TEAMS AND TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF RETAIL OUTLETS AND PREPAID REPLENISHMENT LOCATIONS, AND MANUFACTURERS OF LAPTOPS AND NETBOOKS

WITH EMBEDDED 4G LTE AND 3G MODELS THAT CAN ACCESS THE INTERNET ON OUR NETWORK IN BROADBAND SPEEDS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL NETWORK ACCESS TO BOTH TRADITIONAL RESELLERS, WHICH RESELL NETWORK SERVICES TO THEIR END-USERS, AND TO VARIOUS COMPANIES TO

ENABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FOR THEIR M2M DEVICES OR FOR THEIR PROVISION OF TELEMATICS SERVICES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE HISTORICAL WIRELINE RESULTS FOR THESE OPERATIONS, WHICH WERE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CORPORATE, ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER TO REFLECT COMPARABLE

SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS.

ON FEBRUARY 5, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (FRONTIER) PURSUANT TO WHICH VERIZON WILL SELL ITS LOCAL EXCHANGE BUSINESS AND RELATED LANDLINE ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, AND TEXAS, INCLUDING FIOS INTERNET AND VIDEO CUSTOMERS, SWITCHED AND SPECIAL

NETWORK

TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WE OPERATE AN ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD.

FIOS

. OUR GOAL IS TO DISTINGUISH FIOS AS A PREMIER RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, OUR FIOS

SERVICE PASSED OVER 19.8 MILLION PREMISES. WE EXPECT BANDWIDTH DEMANDS TO GROW WITH THE CONTINUED EMERGENCE OF NEW VIDEO AND DATA APPLICATIONS AND THE PROLIFERATION OF IP DEVICES IN THE HOME.

THE PASSIVE OPTICAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGY UPON WHICH THE FIOS NETWORK IS DEPLOYED POSITIONS VERIZON TO MEET GROWING

BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. OUR NETWORK ARCHITECTURE PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT OUR FACILITIES MORE EASILY TO FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW OPTICAL TERMINALS CAN BE ADDED TO THE FIBER-TO-THE-PREMISE NETWORK PROVIDING GREATER

BANDWIDTH AND NEW SERVICES WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FIELD CONSTRUCTION. SELECT FIELD TRIALS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED CONNECTION SPEEDS OF NEARLY ONE GIGABIT PER SECOND (GBPS), AND WHEN A MORE ADVANCED NEXT GENERATION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO

THE FIBER-OPTIC NETWORK, CONNECTION SPEEDS OF 10 GBPS HAVE BEEN REACHED, DEMONSTRATING THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH CAPACITY BUILT INTO THE FIOS PLATFORM.

ADDITIONALLY, THIS ADVANCED OPTICAL NETWORK IS ALSO FINDING INCREASED APPLICATION OPPORTUNITIES IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR, ESPECIALLY AS THE INDUSTRY SEEKS TO MIGRATE TO ETHERNET-BASED ACCESS SERVICES.



GLOBAL IP

. VERIZON OWNS AND OPERATES ONE OF THE LARGEST GLOBAL FIBER NETWORKS WITH LONG HAUL, METRO AND SUBMARINE CABLE ASSETS PROVIDING

CONNECTIVITY TO CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD. VERIZONS GLOBAL NETWORK ENCOMPASSES OVER 800,000 ROUTE MILES OF TERRESTRIAL AND UNDERSEA CABLE, SERVING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BY SUPPORTING AND ENABLING FAR REACHING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

GLOBAL IP TRAFFIC HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND IS EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS GLOBAL BUSINESS IS ALSO RAPIDLY EVOLVING TO AN EVERYTHING-AS-A-SERVICE MODEL IN WHICH BUSINESS CUSTOMERS SEEK CLOUD-BASED, CONVERGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS DELIVERED SECURELY VIA MANAGED AND

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. WITH THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF ITS PACKET OPTICAL TRANSPORT STRATEGY, VERIZON IS CREATING A SINGLE, HIGH-CAPACITY GLOBAL NETWORK PLATFORM THAT COMBINES OPTICAL TRANSPORT WITH ADVANCED PACKET SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY. THE RESULT

IS A GLOBAL IP NETWORK THAT CAN OFFER POWERFUL SOLUTIONS TO THESE SERVICE DEMANDS.

IN 2014, A NUMBER OF KEY INFRASTRUCTURE

ENHANCEMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES WERE DESIGNED AND DEPLOYED. WITH FIOS QUANTUM, WE INTRODUCED SPEEDMATCH AND PUSHED OUR TOP TIER FIOS SERVICE OFFERING TO 500 MBPS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON ADVANCING OUR FIBER-BASED NETWORKS AND

ACHIEVING COST EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENTS WILL HELP VERIZON ADVANCE ITS POSITION AS A PROVIDER OF CHOICE TO RESIDENTIAL AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY FURTHER WITH TRADITIONAL, NON-TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING PLAYERS SEEKING INCREASED MARKET SHARE. CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, OTHER DOMESTIC AND

FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, SATELLITE TELEVISION COMPANIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES AND MANAGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS.

IN ADDITION, COMPANIES WITH A GLOBAL PRESENCE INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH OUR WIRELINE BUSINESSES. A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH GLOBAL OPERATIONS SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE GLOBAL WHOLESALE MARKETS. WE COMPETE WITH THESE FULL OR NEAR-FULL SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR LARGE CONTRACTS

TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED SERVICES TO GLOBAL ENTERPRISES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE

GROWTH.

WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND TRENDS IN THE WIRELINE INDUSTRY.



BANDWIDTH (SPEED) AND NETWORK RELIABILITY.

CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS ARE SEEKING TO LEVERAGE HIGH-SPEED CONNECTIONS FOR

ENTERTAINMENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY. AS ONLINE AND ONLINE-ENABLED ACTIVITIES INCREASE, SO WILL BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, BOTH DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM. TO SUCCEED, WE AND OTHER NETWORK-BASED PROVIDERS MUST ENSURE THAT OUR NETWORKS CAN MEET

THESE INCREASING BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO MEET THIS GROWING DEMAND. IN ADDITION, NETWORK RELIABILITY AND SECURITY ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE MARKET.



PRICING.

CABLE OPERATORS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS USE PRICING TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE FROM INCUMBENTS.

PRICING IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR AS NON-TRADITIONAL MODES OF PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES EMERGE AND NEW ENTRANTS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, VOIP AND PORTAL-BASED CALLING IS FREE OR NEARLY FREE TO CUSTOMERS AND IS OFTEN SUPPORTED BY

ADVERTISING REVENUES.



CUSTOMER SERVICE

.

CUSTOMERS EXPECT INDUSTRY-LEADING SERVICE FROM THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES EVOLVE, THE

ABILITY TO EXCEL IN THIS AREA IS IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION. IN MASS MARKETS, WE COMPETE IN THIS AREA THROUGH OUR SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND ONLINE SUPPORT. IN GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH READY ACCESS TO

THEIR SYSTEM AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, AND WE CONDUCT PROACTIVE TESTING OF OUR NETWORK TO IDENTIFY ISSUES BEFORE THEY AFFECT CUSTOMERS. IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS, WE BELIEVE SERVICE IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED SYSTEM AUTOMATION

INITIATIVES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

AS A RESULT OF PRICING PRESSURES, PROVIDERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE

SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS FROM ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS AND ARE SEEKING WAYS TO LEVERAGE THEIR BROADBAND AND VIDEO CONNECTIONS. CONVERGED FEATURES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED WIRELESS AND WIRELINE FUNCTIONALITY, ARE BECOMING SIMILARLY IMPORTANT, DRIVEN BY BOTH

CUSTOMER DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

IN THE MASS MARKETS BUSINESS, CABLE OPERATORS ARE

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS. CABLE OPERATORS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE AND CAPACITY OF THEIR NETWORKS SO THAT THEY CAN OFFER DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO MARKET COMPETITIVE BUNDLED OFFERINGS THAT INCLUDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS,

DIGITAL TELEVISION AND VOICE SERVICES. SEVERAL MAJOR CABLE OPERATORS ALSO OFFER BUNDLES WITH WIRELESS SERVICES THROUGH STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS.

WE EXPECT CUSTOMER MIGRATION FROM TRADITIONAL VOICE SERVICES TO WIRELESS SERVICES TO CONTINUE AS A GROWING NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS PLACE GREATER VALUE ON MOBILITY AND WIRELESS COMPANIES POSITION THEIR SERVICE

AS A LANDLINE ALTERNATIVE. WE ALSO FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM CABLE COMPANIES AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES AS WELL AS INTERNET PORTAL PROVIDERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996, WHICH REQUIRES US TO ALLOW POTENTIAL COMPETITORS TO PURCHASE OUR SERVICES FOR RESALE OR ACCESS COMPONENTS OF OUR NETWORK ON AN UNBUNDLED BASIS AT A

PRESCRIBED COST, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS AT SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE

OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE SCOPE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD AND THE RATES WE RECEIVE ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REVIEW AND REVISION BY THE FCC AND STATE REGULATORS. (SEE REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS.)

IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE MARKET, THE CUSTOMERS NEED TO REDUCE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY COUPLED WITH THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITY

CREATED BY TECHNOLOGY CONVERGENCE IS DRIVING THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, CARRIERS AND HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN IT SERVICES ARE EITHER MAKING

STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OR FORGING NEW ALLIANCES TO BE BETTER POSITIONED FOR A REBOUND IN TECHNOLOGY SPENDING. MANY NEW ALLIANCES AND ACQUISITIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON EMERGING FIELDS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, SOFTWARE DELIVERY, COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS

AND OTHER COMPUTING TASKS VIA THE NETWORK, RATHER THAN ON IN-HOUSE MACHINES. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO UTILIZED ACQUISITIONS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO ENTERPRISE OUTSOURCING MARKETS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN DOMINATED BY THE MAJOR IT OUTSOURCERS.

GLOBAL WHOLESALE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL CARRIERS FOR LONG-HAUL, VOICE AND IP SERVICES. IN ADDITION, MOBILE VIDEO AND DATA

NEEDS ARE DRIVING A GREATER NEED FOR WIRELESS BACKHAUL. NETWORK PROVIDERS, CABLE COMPANIES AND NICHE PLAYERS ARE COMPETITORS FOR THIS NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITY.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS, INTERCONNECTED MARKETS, SHIFTING CONSUMER NEEDS AND CONVERGING INDUSTRY ECOSYSTEMS ARE CREATING INNOVATIVE

OPPORTUNITIES FOR VERIZON. OUR VISION IS TO BE A GLOBALLY-CONNECTED SOLUTIONS COMPANY. OUR MARKET SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO DELIVER COMPELLING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, STRENGTHEN OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND DRIVE A

HIGH-QUALITY EXPERIENCE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE MARKET TRENDS, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN SEVERAL STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO FURTHER DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ENHANCE OUR MARKET AGILITY IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF

FOCUS.



INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT.

WE BELIEVE THE GROWTH IN VIDEO CONSUMPTION USING MOBILE DEVICES PROVIDES US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENUE

GROWTH. WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES INVOLVING CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS (CDNS), VIDEO STREAMING AND RELATED CONSUMER HARDWARE TO LEVERAGE NEW CONTENT MODELS. OUR WIRELESS NETWORK ENABLES US TO MOVE TOWARDS A

UNIFIED VIDEO STRATEGY THAT POSITIONS US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS GROWTH OPPORTUNITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE USING MULTIMEDIA BROADCAST MULTICAST SERVICE TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP OUR LTE MULTICAST SERVICE, WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE AVAILABLE IN

2015. THIS SERVICE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE OUR NETWORK EFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO LIVE STREAMING VIDEO CONTENT WITH VIRTUALLY NO BUFFERING, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF DEVICES USING THE SERVICE. IN ORDER TO

CONTINUE TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE ALSO EXPECT TO LAUNCH AN IP TELEVISION SERVICE IN 2015. WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE RIGHTS TO DELIVER CONTENT OVER A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN AUTHENTICATION BACK

TO A SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR NFL AGREEMENT ALLOWS OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS CERTAIN GAMES LIVE ON OUR 4G LTE NETWORK WITHOUT AUTHENTICATING BACK TO ANY SUBSCRIPTION.

CUSTOMERS ARE INCREASINGLY CONSUMING LARGE AMOUNTS OF BROADBAND DATA AS CONNECTED DEVICES AND ASSOCIATED ONLINE

APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND WE EXPECT BROADBAND USAGE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE. OUR FIOS NETWORK POSITIONS US IN THE INDUSTRY WITH LEADING BROADBAND SPEEDS AND RELIABILITY. BROADBAND REPRESENTS A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY FOR

US AS THE USE OF OVER-THE-TOP VIDEO AND USER GENERATED CONTENT AND DATA ACCELERATES AND THE NUMBER OF CONNECTED HOMES AND DEVICES CONTINUES TO GROW.

INTERNET OF THINGS

. THE ADOPTION OF MACHINE-TO-MACHINE TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO INCREASE, PRIMARILY LED BY THE TELEMATICS AND

TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT. OUR SUITE OF REAL-TIME VEHICLE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS CONNECTS AUTOMOBILES WITH CONTENT, SERVICES AND CALL CENTERS. OUR PLATFORM ENABLES

FACTORY AND AFTERMARKET-INSTALLED AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY AND SECURITY FEATURES AS WELL AS LOCATION-BASED SERVICES AND VEHICLE DIAGNOSTICS. WE PROVIDE USAGE-BASED DATA SERVICES TO NEW VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES, CHINA AND IN EUROPE. THROUGH OUR

IN-DRIVE SOLUTION, WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH A MAJOR AUTOMOTIVE INSURANCE PROVIDER TO DELIVER USAGE-BASED INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND OTHER CONNECTED APPLICATIONS. OUR NETWORKFLEET SOLUTION PROVIDES COMMERCIAL FLEET MANAGERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA WITH

REAL-TIME ACCESS TO DATA THAT YIELDS OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, INCREASED VEHICLE RELIABILITY AND IMPROVED DRIVER SAFETY. WE ALSO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE TO OVER 28,500 VEHICLES OPERATED BY VERIZON. WE ARE FURTHER EXPANDING OUR TELEMATICS PORTFOLIO TO

ADD ASSET TRACKING CAPABILITIES.

ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE A PARTNER IN A PILOT PROJECT WHICH WILL PUT A 120-MILE

FULLY AUTOMATED HIGHWAY SYSTEM IN PLACE IN MICHIGAN WITH SENSORS AND CAMERAS COMMUNICATING WITH CARS TO SHOW THE POSSIBILITIES OF WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH REAL-TIME VEHICLE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WE EXPECT THIS PROJECT WILL SHOW IMPROVEMENTS

IN AREAS SUCH AS ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND SAFETY.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2015, WE EXPECT VERIZON VEHICLE,

A VEHICLE INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICE, TO BE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. WITH THIS SUBSCRIPTION-BASED SERVICE, DRIVERS WILL HAVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR VEHICLES, ACCESS TO LIVE ASSISTANCE AT THE PRESS OF A BUTTON AND WILL BE ABLE TO

REQUEST ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WITH GPS ACCURACY WHEN NEEDED. VERIZON VEHICLE ALSO OFFERS THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH A CERTIFIED MECHANIC TO DIAGNOSE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND OFFER SOLUTIONS.

DIGITAL MEDIA.

WE HAVE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN VERIZON DIGITAL MEDIA SERVICES, WHICH OFFERS A SCALABLE PLATFORM FOR DELIVERING CONTENT

INCLUDING LIVE BROADCAST, VIDEO ON-DEMAND, GAMES, SOFTWARE AND WEBSITES TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON THEIR DEVICES AT ANY TIME. AS THE DIGITAL PLATFORM RESHAPES THE DELIVERY OF MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT, THERE IS AN INCREASING NEED FOR A STABLE,

HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO DELIVERY PLATFORM. WE AIM TO DISRUPT THE EXISTING MEDIA DELIVERY ECOSYSTEM WITH A SIMPLE, END-TO-END, GLOBAL PLATFORM THAT ENABLES THE BEST EXPERIENCE OF ANY CONTENT. THESE SERVICES ARE TARGETED AT MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT

COMPANIES AS WELL AS BUSINESSES FOCUSED ON DELIVERING THEIR DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH THE INTERNET. WE ALSO EXPECT, THROUGH THIS PLATFORM, TO FURTHER INTEGRATE OUR FIOS AND WIRELESS OFFERINGS. THE CURRENT VIDEO AND CONTENT DELIVERY

ECOSYSTEM IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, MADE UP OF LARGE AND SMALL PLAYERS, RANGING FROM COMMODITY CDNS TO VIDEO PROVIDERS FOCUSED ON VALUE-ADDED SERVICES. COMPETITION INCLUDES TRADITIONAL OPERATORS SUCH AS AT&T AND LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND

NON-TRADITIONAL OPERATORS SUCH AS AMAZON.COM, INC. AND AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

CLOUD SERVICES

. CAPITALIZING ON MARKET GROWTH IN CLOUD SERVICES AND ON ENTERPRISE TRENDS TOWARD OUTSOURCING IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND

SERVICES, VERIZON UTILIZES AN EVOLUTIONARY CLOUD PLATFORM BUILT FOR SPEED AND PERFORMANCE, USING OUR OWN SOFTWARE-BASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ENTERPRISE-GRADE RELIABILITY. VERIZON CLOUD COMPUTE AND CLOUD STORAGE ADOPT A NEW APPROACH TO HOW

PUBLIC CLOUDS ARE BUILT, ENABLING CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AGILITY AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF A GENERIC PUBLIC CLOUD ALONG WITH THE RELIABILITY AND SCALE OF AN ENTERPRISE-LEVEL SERVICE. VIRTUAL MACHINES (SOFTWARE-BASED COMPUTERS

AND SERVERS) CAN BE CREATED AND DEPLOYED IN SECONDS, AND USERS BUILD AND PAY FOR WHAT THEY NEED.

OUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLES REAL-TIME ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES FOR OUR M2M CUSTOMERS, PROVIDING AN END-TO-END CAPABILITY WHERE CUSTOMERS CAN STORE, PROCESS AND ANALYZE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA ON A

REAL-TIME BASIS. OUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO HANDLE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF AN APPLICATION PROVIDING GLOBAL SUPPORT AND AVAILABILITY OF THE APPLICATIONS WITHOUT INCREASED LATENCY. THE INTEGRATION OF OUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE WITH

OUR TELEMATICS ASSETS PROVIDES OUR CUSTOMERS WITH NEW AND INNOVATIVE SERVICE CAPABILITIES THAT ARE SCALABLE, AND WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE OPERATIONALLY SUPERIOR TO OTHER BIFURCATED APPROACHES.



FOSTERING EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS AND ALLIANCES

. AS A MARKET LEADER IN OFFERING DIFFERENTIATED SOLUTIONS TO OUR CONNECTED CUSTOMERS

ACROSS ALL THEIR DEVICES AT HOME, AT WORK AND ON THE GO, VERIZON WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN IMPORTANT PILLAR OF OUR FUTURE STRATEGY. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ARE AIMED AT COMPLEMENTING AND AUGMENTING OUR STRENGTHS,

EXPANDING OUR ADDRESSABLE MARKET, ACCELERATING OUR PACE OF INNOVATION, ENABLING FASTER DELIVERY OF SOLUTIONS SUCH AS MEDIA, INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD TO THE MARKETPLACE, AND WHERE POSSIBLE, LOWERING OUR MARKET AND EXECUTION RISK. STRONG

PARTNERSHIPS ARE EXPECTED TO FURTHER OUR EFFORTS TO OFFER COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. WE LOOK TO FORMULATE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND ALLIANCES WITH A GLOBAL ORIENTATION WHICH WILL BENEFIT US IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY SOURCING, CONTENT

ACQUISITION, CONSUMER INSIGHTS, AND APPLICATION ECOSYSTEMS.

WE BELIEVE THESE INVESTMENTS WILL ASSIST US IN

BRINGING INNOVATIVE NEXT GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MARKET AND UNCOVERING NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE, INCREASING REVENUE OF EXISTING PROJECTS AND LEVERAGING OUR STRENGTHS ACROSS THE COMPANY.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

VERIZON OWNS OR HAS LICENSES TO VARIOUS PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, DOMAIN NAMES AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY PURSUE THE FILING AND REGISTRATION OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, DOMAIN NAMES, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

AND ABROAD. VERIZON ALSO ACTIVELY GRANTS LICENSES, IN EXCHANGE FOR APPROPRIATE FEES OR OTHER CONSIDERATION AND SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS AND RESTRICTIONS, TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ENABLE SUCH COMPANIES TO UTILIZE CERTAIN VERIZON INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AS PART OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SUCH LICENSES ENABLE SUCH THIRD-PARTY LICENSEES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESULTS OF VERIZONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. WHILE THESE LICENSES RESULT IN

VALUABLE CONSIDERATION BEING PAID TO VERIZON, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LOSS OF SUCH CONSIDERATION, OR THE EXPIRATION OF ANY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

VERIZON PERIODICALLY RECEIVES OFFERS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO PURCHASE OR OBTAIN LICENSES FOR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

IN EXCHANGE FOR ROYALTIES OR OTHER PAYMENTS. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY RECEIVE NOTICES ALLEGING THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INFRINGE ON THIRD-PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE CLAIMS, WHETHER AGAINST US DIRECTLY OR AGAINST

THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT WE, IN TURN, SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES, OR CEASE OFFERING THE RELEVANT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS

REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

VERIZON OPERATES IN A REGULATED AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER VOICE AND DATA SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS OTHER WIRELESS COMPANIES, TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE

COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, SOFTWARE AND APPLICATION PROVIDERS, AND OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL COMPANIES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF

WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO FEWER REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS THAN VERIZON. FOR MANY SERVICES OFFERED BY VERIZON, THE FCC IS OUR PRIMARY REGULATOR.

THE FCC HAS JURISDICTION OVER INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND OTHER MATTERS UNDER THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (COMMUNICATIONS ACT OR ACT). OTHER VERIZON SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION.

FCC REGULATION

BROADBAND

VERIZON OFFERS MANY DIFFERENT BROADBAND AND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES. THE FCC HAS ADOPTED A SERIES OF ORDERS THAT IMPOSE

LESSER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ON BROADBAND SERVICES THAN APPLY TO OLDER VOICE AND SLOWER DATA SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE FCC CONCLUDED THAT BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES QUALIFY AS LARGELY DEREGULATED INFORMATION

SERVICES. OUR BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE SO-CALLED NETWORK NEUTRALITY RULES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL APPLICATION OF COMMON CARRIAGE REGULATION UNDER TITLE II OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT.

VERIZON HAS BEEN AND REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE OPEN INTERNET WHICH PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH COMPETITIVE CHOICES AND UNBLOCKED ACCESS TO LAWFUL WEBSITES AND CONTENT WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW THEY WANT. OUR COMMITMENT APPLIES TO BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS

SERVICES PROVIDED OVER BOTH OUR WIRELINE AND WIRELESS NETWORKS AND CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AT HTTP://RESPONSIBILITY.VERIZON.COM/BROADBAND-COMMITMENT.

VIDEO

VERIZON OFFERS A MULTI-CHANNEL VIDEO SERVICE THAT IS REGULATED LIKE

TRADITIONAL CABLE SERVICE. THE FCC HAS A BODY OF RULES THAT APPLY TO CABLE OPERATORS, AND THESE RULES ALSO GENERALLY APPLY TO VERIZON. IN ADDITION, THE ACT GENERALLY REQUIRES COMPANIES TO OBTAIN A LOCAL CABLE FRANCHISE, AND THE FCC HAS ADOPTED RULES

THAT INTERPRET AND IMPLEMENT THIS REQUIREMENT. IN AREAS WHERE VERIZON OFFERS ITS FACILITIES-BASED MULTICHANNEL VIDEO SERVICES, VERIZON HAS TYPICALLY BEEN REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A FRANCHISE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

WIRELINE VOICE

VERIZON

OFFERS MANY DIFFERENT WIRELINE VOICE SERVICES, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE SERVICE AND OTHER SERVICES THAT RELY ON NEWER TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS VOIP. FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES, LEGACY TELEPHONE SERVICES ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON

CARRIER SERVICES. COMMON CARRIER SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WITH RESPECT TO RATES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SERVICES. THE FCC HAS NOT DECIDED THE REGULATORY CLASSIFICATION OF VOIP BUT HAS SAID

VOIP SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RULES, SUCH AS 911 CAPABILITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.

WIRELESS

SERVICES

THE FCC REGULATES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF VERIZON WIRELESS OPERATIONS. GENERALLY, THE FCC HAS JURISDICTION OVER

THE CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION, ACQUISITION, AND TRANSFER OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. AND ALL WIRELESS SERVICES REQUIRE USE OF RADIO FREQUENCY SPECTRUM, THE ASSIGNMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO FCC OVERSIGHT. VERIZON WIRELESS

ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. IT CAN MEET SPECTRUM NEEDS BY PURCHASING LICENSES OR LEASING SPECTRUM FROM OTHERS, OR BY PARTICIPATING IN A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS FOR NEW SPECTRUM FROM THE FCC. BOTH

PROCESSES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REVIEWS, APPROVALS, AND POTENTIAL CONDITIONS.

TODAY, VERIZON WIRELESS HOLDS FCC SPECTRUM

LICENSES THAT ALLOW IT TO PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF MOBILE AND FIXED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING BOTH VOICE AND DATA SERVICES. FCC SPECTRUM LICENSES TYPICALLY HAVE A TERM OF 10 YEARS, AT WHICH TIME THEY ARE SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. WHILE THE FCC HAS

ROUTINELY RENEWED ALL OF VERIZON WIRELESS LICENSES, CHALLENGES COULD BE RAISED IN THE FUTURE. IF A WIRELESS LICENSE WAS REVOKED OR NOT RENEWED, VERIZON WIRELESS WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO PROVIDE SERVICES ON THE SPECTRUM COVERED BY THAT

LICENSE. SOME OF OUR LICENSES REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH SO-CALLED OPEN ACCESS FCC REGULATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE LICENSEES OF PARTICULAR SPECTRUM TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEIR CHOICE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS. THE FCC HAS ALSO IMPOSED CERTAIN SPECIFIC MANDATES ON WIRELESS CARRIERS INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION AND GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, TECHNICAL OPERATING STANDARDS, PROVISION OF ENHANCED 911 SERVICES, ROAMING

OBLIGATIONS, AND REQUIREMENTS FOR WIRELESS TOWER AND ANTENNA FACILITIES.

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION AND NETWORK ACCESS

THE FCC REGULATES SOME OF THE RATES THAT CARRIERS PAY EACH OTHER FOR THE EXCHANGE OF VOICE TRAFFIC (PARTICULARLY TRADITIONAL WIRELINE

TRAFFIC) OVER DIFFERENT NETWORKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF INTERCONNECTION FOR SOME VOICE SERVICES. IN MANY INSTANCES, VERIZON MAKES PAYMENTS TO OTHER PROVIDERS, AND IN TURN VERIZON RECEIVES SOME PAYMENTS FROM OTHER CARRIERS. IN 2011, THE FCC ISSUED A

BROAD REFORM ORDER CHANGING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FRAMEWORK FOR MANY OF THE PER-MINUTE RATES THAT CARRIERS CHARGE EACH OTHER FOR THE EXCHANGE OF VOICE TRAFFIC. THE NEW RULES GRADUALLY REDUCE MANY OF THESE RATES TO ZERO. THIS ORDER IS SUBJECT TO

PENDING RECONSIDERATION PETITIONS AND APPEALS. THE FCC ALSO REGULATES SOME OF THE RATES AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN WIRELINE SPECIAL ACCESS AND OTHER SERVICES AND NETWORK FACILITIES. VERIZON IS BOTH A SELLER AND A BUYER OF THESE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE WIRELINE SIDE VERIZON SELLS

WHOLESALE CIRCUITS TO OTHER VOICE AND DATA SERVICE PROVIDERS. ON THE WIRELESS SIDE, VERIZON PURCHASES SPECIAL ACCESS AND OTHER SERVICES TO TRANSPORT TRAFFIC TO AND FROM CELL TOWERS. IN ADDITION, AS REQUIRED BY THE ACT, VERIZON UNBUNDLES CERTAIN

WIRELINE NETWORK ELEMENTS AND MAKES THESE FACILITIES AND SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OTHER NETWORK PROVIDERS.

UNIVERSAL SERVICE

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT CHARGES THE FCC WITH ENSURING THAT CERTAIN GROUPS AND AREAS HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING RURAL

AND OTHER HIGH-COST AREAS, LOW INCOME SUBSCRIBERS, SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES, RURAL HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS, AND DEAF AND HARD-OF-HEARING INDIVIDUALS. THE FCC ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT SUBSIDY AND DISCOUNT PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. TO PAY FOR THESE

PROGRAMS, THE FCC REQUIRES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PROVIDERS SUCH AS VERIZON BASED ON REPORTED REVENUES FOR CERTAIN SERVICES. VERIZON ALSO RECEIVES SOME PAYMENTS FROM SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT IS A NET PAYER INTO THEM.

STATE REGULATION AND LOCAL REGULATION

WIRELINE SERVICES

STATE

PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS REGULATE VERIZONS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTRASTATE MATTERS. VERIZON OPERATES AS AN INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER IN 13 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

THESE INCUMBENT OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEVELS OF PRICING FLEXIBILITY AND OTHER STATE OVERSIGHT AND REQUIREMENTS. VERIZON ALSO HAS OTHER WIRELINE OPERATIONS THAT ARE MORE LIGHTLY REGULATED. IN ADDITION, AS A VIDEO SERVICES OPERATOR IN MANY

STATES, VERIZON HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A CABLE FRANCHISE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, OR IN SOME CASES A STATE-WIDE FRANCHISE, AND TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ONE-TIME AND ONGOING OBLIGATIONS AS A RESULT.

WIRELESS SERVICES

THE

COMMUNICATIONS ACT GENERALLY PREEMPTS REGULATION BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE ENTRY OF, OR THE RATES CHARGED BY, WIRELESS CARRIERS. THE ACT DOES NOT PROHIBIT STATES FROM REGULATING THE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WIRELESS

SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME STATES ATTEMPT TO REGULATE WIRELESS CUSTOMER BILLING MATTERS AND IMPOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SEVERAL STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT ADDRESS SAFETY ISSUES (E.G., USE OF WIRELESS HANDSETS WHILE DRIVING) AND

TAXATION MATTERS. IN ADDITION, WIRELESS TOWER AND ANTENNA FACILITIES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL ZONING AND LAND USE REGULATION, AND SECURING APPROVALS FOR NEW OR MODIFIED FACILITIES IS OFTEN A LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO COVER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES AND PAST

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES. THESE RESERVES INCLUDE FUNDS TO ADDRESS CONTAMINATION AT THE SITE OF A FORMER SYLVANIA FACILITY IN HICKSVILLE, NY, WHICH HAD PROCESSED NUCLEAR FUEL RODS IN THE 1950S AND 1960S. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE ARMY

CORPS OF ENGINEERS (ACE) ACCEPTED THE SITE INTO ITS FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM. AS A RESULT, THE ACE HAS TAKEN PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADDRESSING THE CONTAMINATION AT THE SITE. AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE RESERVES MAY BE

MADE AFTER A COST ALLOCATION IS CONDUCTED WITH RESPECT TO THE PAST AND FUTURE EXPENSES OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE MAY ALSO BE MADE BASED UPON THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS FOUND AT OTHER SITES REQUIRING REMEDIATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS AND THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS

COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AND FROM EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS A RECESSION OR ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE AFFORDABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMERS MAY SEEK TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BY FORGOING PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, ELECTING TO USE FEWER HIGHER MARGIN SERVICES OR OBTAINING LOWER-COST PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

SIMILARLY, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE MAY DELAY PURCHASING DECISIONS, DELAY FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE OFFERINGS OR REDUCE THEIR USE OF SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASED

NUMBER OF OUR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR SERVICES. IF THESE EVENTS WERE TO OCCUR, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION THAT MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITS.

WE

FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL DISTINCTIONS AMONG WIRELESS, CABLE, INTERNET, LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND

BROUGHT NEW COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION AND DEVICE PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES

HAVE ENABLED US TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER PROVIDERS TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NETWORK QUALITY,

CAPACITY AND COVERAGE, THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE QUALITY OF OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, OUR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE REACH AND QUALITY OF OUR SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND FOR EXISTING SERVICES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESPOND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND ADDRESS CHANGING CONSUMER DEMAND ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

OUR INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING RAPID CHANGE AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE

DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN ORDER TO GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS

OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET FUTURE CHALLENGES FROM COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT

TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS ON OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES. IF OUR SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION TO INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OFFERINGS, WE MUST PHASE OUT OUTDATED AND UNPROFITABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DO SO ON A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE

REDUCED PROFITS. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS ON OUR ABILITY TO PHASE OUT CURRENT SERVICES.

WE DEPEND ON

KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE DEPEND ON VARIOUS KEY

SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE US, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH OTHER SUPPLIERS, WITH EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, SUCH AS SWITCH AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT AND HANDSETS, THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR

EXAMPLE, OUR HANDSET AND OTHER DEVICE SUPPLIERS OFTEN RELY ON ONE VENDOR FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, USED IN THEIR DEVICES. IF THESE SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS FAIL TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE ON A TIMELY

BASIS OR FAIL TO MEET OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS AND WHEN REQUESTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE OUR NETWORKS. BECAUSE OF THE COSTS AND TIME LAGS

THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING FROM ONE SUPPLIER TO ANOTHER, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISRUPTED IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO, OR CHOSE TO, REPLACE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR SUPPLIERS WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM

ANOTHER SOURCE, ESPECIALLY IF THE REPLACEMENT BECAME NECESSARY ON SHORT NOTICE. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, DECREASE OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

THE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ON WHICH WE RELY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY ON WHICH

WE DEPEND, INCLUDING LITIGATION INVOLVING CLAIMS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT. SUCH CLAIMS HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY IN THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER OUR BUSINESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH LITIGATION. WE EXPECT OUR

DEPENDENCE ON KEY SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUE AS WE DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE MORE ADVANCED GENERATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FCC AND OTHER

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE REGULATED BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE REGULATORY REGIMES FREQUENTLY RESTRICT OR IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN DESIGNATED

AREAS AND TO PROVIDE SPECIFIED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE ARE FREQUENTLY REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN LICENSES FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STANDARDS. WE ARE OFTEN INVOLVED IN REGULATORY AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS, OR THE REVIEWS BY FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF

REGULATORY RULINGS. WITHOUT RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE LICENSES NEEDED TO

CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN OR IN MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING LICENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FCC GRANTS WIRELESS LICENSES FOR TERMS GENERALLY LASTING 10 YEARS, SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. THE LOSS OF, OR A MATERIAL LIMITATION ON, CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSES COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES

TO THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, OR INTERNATIONAL LEVEL COULD RESTRICT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MANAGE OUR WIRELINE AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS, IMPAIR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, AND POTENTIALLY IMPEDE

OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN SERVICES COULD BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING REGULATION BY THE FCC AND/OR VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WE HOLD CERTAIN WIRELESS LICENSES THAT REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH SO-CALLED OPEN ACCESS FCC REGULATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE LICENSEES OF PARTICULAR

SPECTRUM TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEIR CHOICE. IN ADDITION, OUR BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE SO-CALLED NETWORK NEUTRALITY RULES, SOME OF WHICH WERE AFFIRMED

AND OTHERS VACATED ON APPEAL BY THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN EARLY 2014. PROPONENTS OF THESE RULES WANT TO LIMIT THE WAYS THAT A BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDER CAN STRUCTURE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS AND MANAGE ITS

NETWORK. SOME OF THESE PARTIES HAVE URGED THE FCC TO RECLASSIFY BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE AS A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE UNDER TITLE II OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, THUS SUBJECTING THESE SERVICES TO TRADITIONAL

UTILITY-STYLE REGULATION. THE FCC HAS AN OPEN PROCEEDING CONCERNING WHETHER AND WHAT NEW REGULATION TO ADOPT, AND ON WHAT LEGAL BASIS. THE FURTHER REGULATION OF BROADBAND, WIRELESS, AND OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES AND ANY RELATED COURT DECISIONS COULD

RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND LIMIT THE RETURN WE CAN EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ON PAST AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR NETWORKS.

CYBER ATTACKS IMPACTING OUR NETWORKS OR SYSTEMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF MALWARE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, DEDICATED DENIAL OF SERVICES ATTACKS, CREDENTIAL HARVESTING AND OTHER MEANS FOR OBTAINING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR DISRUPTING THE

OPERATION OF OUR NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. CYBER ATTACKS MAY CAUSE EQUIPMENT FAILURES, LOSS OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR

EMPLOYEES OR VALUABLE TECHNICAL AND MARKETING INFORMATION, AS WELL AS DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OR OUR CUSTOMERS OPERATIONS. CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST COMPANIES, INCLUDING VERIZON, HAVE INCREASED IN FREQUENCY, SCOPE AND POTENTIAL HARM IN RECENT

YEARS. FURTHER, THE PERPETRATORS OF CYBER ATTACKS ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO PARTICULAR GROUPS OR PERSONS. THESE ATTACKS MAY BE COMMITTED BY COMPANY EMPLOYEES OR EXTERNAL ACTORS OPERATING IN ANY GEOGRAPHY, INCLUDING JURISDICTIONS WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT

MEASURES TO ADDRESS SUCH ATTACKS ARE UNAVAILABLE OR INEFFECTIVE, AND MAY EVEN BE LAUNCHED BY OR AT THE BEHEST OF NATION STATES. WHILE, TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUBJECT TO CYBER ATTACKS WHICH, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, HAVE BEEN MATERIAL TO

OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO REDUCE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING PROTECTION OF OUR SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REPEL OR MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A MAJOR CYBER ATTACK

IN THE FUTURE.

OUR INABILITY TO OPERATE OUR WIRELINE OR WIRELESS NETWORKS AS A RESULT OF CYBER ATTACKS, EVEN FOR A LIMITED

PERIOD OF TIME, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND/OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE TO OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A MAJOR CYBER ATTACK ON VERIZON COULD INCLUDE EXPENSIVE INCENTIVES OFFERED TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS

PARTNERS TO RETAIN THEIR BUSINESS, INCREASED EXPENDITURES ON CYBER SECURITY MEASURES AND THE USE OF ALTERNATE RESOURCES, LOST REVENUES FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND LITIGATION. THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ATTACKS COULD EXCEED THE

INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. FURTHER, CERTAIN OF VERIZONS BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THOSE OFFERING SECURITY SOLUTIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLOUD SERVICES TO BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR OWN

NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS IS CALLED INTO QUESTION AS A RESULT OF A CYBER ATTACK. IN ADDITION, IF WE FAIL TO PREVENT THE THEFT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION SUCH AS FINANCIAL DATA, SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT VERIZON AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR IF WE FAIL TO

PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIAL DATA AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS, IT COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CUSTOMER AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORIST ACTS OR ACTS OF WAR

COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER OUTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS, OTHER HOSTILE ACTS AND EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE UPON WHICH OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS

RELY, RESULTING IN DEGRADATION OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF THESE EVENTS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE

MAINTAIN. OUR SYSTEM REDUNDANCY MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR INADEQUATE, AND OUR DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO DAMAGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE SUPPLIERS THAT PROVIDE US WITH THE

EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER EVENT CAUSING SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL DAMAGE COULD CAUSE US TO EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY

TIME AND EXPENDITURES TO RESUME OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUES FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VERIZONS DEBT HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND COULD INCREASE FURTHER IF VERIZON

INCURS ADDITIONAL DEBT IN THE FUTURE AND DOES NOT RETIRE EXISTING DEBT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, VERIZON HAD

APPROXIMATELY $113.3 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY $7.9 BILLION OF UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER ITS EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY. VERIZONS DEBT LEVEL AND RELATED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE

CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING.



REQUIRING VERIZON TO DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON ITS DEBT AND

THE PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY THE ENTITY ACQUIRED FROM VODAFONE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDS VERIZON HAS AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS;



MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT OR EXPENSIVE FOR VERIZON TO OBTAIN ANY NECESSARY FUTURE FINANCING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE

REQUIREMENTS, DEBT REFINANCING, ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER PURPOSES;



REDUCING VERIZONS FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR OR REACTING TO CHANGES IN ITS INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS;



MAKING VERIZON MORE VULNERABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN IN ITS BUSINESS; AND



EXPOSING VERIZON TO INCREASED INTEREST RATE RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES.

IN ADDITION, THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT VERIZON ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION

REQUIRES VERIZON TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVERAGE RATIO UNLESS VERIZONS CREDIT RATINGS ARE AT OR ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL, WHICH COULD LIMIT VERIZONS ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE.

ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING.

WE REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE FUND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS IN PART THROUGH BORROWINGS IN THE

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CREDIT MARKETS. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR REFINANCE EXISTING

INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON OUR PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CUSTOMARY CREDIT METRICS. A DECREASE

IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. A SEVERE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND

SUCH INSTABILITY COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING.

INCREASES IN COSTS FOR PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND

RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

WITH APPROXIMATELY

177,300 EMPLOYEES AND APPROXIMATELY 209,000 RETIREES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014 ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN VERIZONS BENEFIT PLANS, THE COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

PROFITABILITY. OUR COSTS OF MAINTAINING THESE PLANS, AND THE FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE PLANS, ARE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONTINUING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

AND THE HEALTH CARE EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS, DECREASES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS ON FUNDS HELD BY OUR PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS AND CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE AND MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

CALCULATE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUR BENEFIT PLANS, THOSE COSTS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, AND WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS OR EXPERIENCE WORK

STOPPAGES AS A RESULT OF THE RENEGOTIATION OF OUR LABOR CONTRACTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, APPROXIMATELY 27% OF

OUR WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS. IN 2015, WE WILL BE ENGAGED IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH LABOR UNIONS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 39,000 EMPLOYEES OF OUR WIRELINE BUSINESS. DURING THE COURSE OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS WE COULD EXPERIENCE

LENGTHY WORK STOPPAGES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING A LOSS OF REVENUE AND STRAINED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE LENGTH OF ANY SUCH WORK STOPPAGE. DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE

NEGOTIATIONS, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE WORKFORCE OF OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY NON-UNION, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS UNIONS MAY HAVE IN ORGANIZING THIS WORKFORCE OR THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE

IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON OUR COSTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SIGNIFICANT

DAMAGES OR SETTLEMENTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FROM TIME TO TIME,

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS, PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS, ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS, WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTIONS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO OUR ADVERTISING, SALES, BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, OUR WIRELESS

BUSINESS ALSO FACES PERSONAL INJURY AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATING TO ALLEGED HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIRELESS PHONES OR RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSMITTERS, AND CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT CHALLENGE MARKETING PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURES RELATING TO

ALLEGED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF HANDHELD WIRELESS PHONES. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OR SETTLEMENTS.

OVER $9 BILLION IN DAMAGES. IN ITS JUNE 18, 2013 DECISION, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR VERIZON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND RULED THAT U.S. BANK WOULD TAKE NOTHING ON ITS CLAIMS. U.S. BANK APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE U.S.

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, WHICH UPHELD THE DISTRICT COURTS DECISION ON JULY 30, 2014. THE LITIGATION TRUST HAS SOUGHT REVIEW OF THE DECISION BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

STOCK REPURCHASES

IN MARCH 2014, THE VERIZON BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A THREE-YEAR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO 100 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE PROGRAM, SHARES MAY BE

REPURCHASED IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS AND ON THE OPEN MARKET, INCLUDING THROUGH PLANS COMPLYING WITH RULE 10B5-1(C) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON MARKET

CONDITIONS AND THE COMPANYS CORPORATE NEEDS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, VERIZON DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES

OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT COULD BE PURCHASED BY OR ON BEHALF OF VERIZON UNDER OUR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WAS 100 MILLION.

IN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED THREE-YEAR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM, IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE VERIZON BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED

VERIZON TO ENTER INTO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (ASR) AGREEMENT TO REPURCHASE $5.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES THAT VERIZON WILL REPURCHASE UNDER THE ASR AGREEMENT WILL BE BASED GENERALLY UPON THE

VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARE PRICE OF VERIZONS COMMON STOCK DURING THE TERM OF THE TRANSACTION. ON FEBRUARY 10, 2015, IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UP-FRONT PAYMENT TOTALING $5.0 BILLION, VERIZON RECEIVED AN INITIAL DELIVERY OF 86.2 MILLION

SHARES HAVING A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $4.25 BILLION. FINAL SETTLEMENT OF THE TRANSACTION UNDER THE ASR AGREEMENT, INCLUDING DELIVERY OF THE REMAINING SHARES, IF ANY, THAT VERIZON IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE, IS SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2015.

WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ROUTINELY REVIEW OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND MAKE CHANGES TO OUR SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE CONTINUING AN INITIATIVE TO IMPLEMENT NEW FINANCIAL SYSTEMS IN PHASES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

QUARTERS. WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING AN INITIATIVE TO STANDARDIZE AND CENTRALIZE TRANSACTION-PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR ACCOUNTING PROCESSES, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THESE INITIATIVES WILL INCORPORATE CERTAIN

CHANGES IN PERSONNEL AS WELL. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE INITIATIVES AND THE RESULTING CHANGES IN OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND TRANSACTION-PROCESSING ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REVIEW THE DESIGN AND DOCUMENTATION OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

AND TO ENHANCE OUR PROCESSES AS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT CONTROLS OVER OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING REMAIN EFFECTIVE.

REPORTING.
