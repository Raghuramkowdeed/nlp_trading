BACKGROUND

OUR WIRELESS SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DOING BUSINESS AS VERIZON WIRELESS. CELLCO PARTNERSHIP IS A JOINT VENTURE FORMED IN APRIL 2000 BY THE COMBINATION OF THE U.S. WIRELESS

OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, VERIZON OWNED A CONTROLLING 55% INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS AND VODAFONE OWNED THE REMAINING 45%. VERIZON WIRELESS PROVIDES WIRELESS COMMUNICATION

SERVICES ACROSS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS THE LARGEST FOURTH-GENERATION (4G) LONG-TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) TECHNOLOGY AND THIRD-GENERATION (3G) EVOLUTION - DATA OPTIMIZED (EV-DO) NETWORKS OF ANY

U.S. WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER.

ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2013, VERIZON ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH VODAFONE AND

VODAFONE 4 LIMITED, PURSUANT TO WHICH VERIZON AGREED TO ACQUIRE VODAFONES INDIRECT 45% INTEREST IN CELLCO PARTNERSHIP D/B/A VERIZON WIRELESS FOR AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $130 BILLION (THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION). WE COMPLETED THE

TRANSACTION ON FEBRUARY 21, 2014 AND ACQUIRED 100% OWNERSHIP OF VERIZON WIRELESS. THE CONSIDERATION PAID WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CASH AND VERIZON COMMON STOCK.

VERIZON WIRELESS IS THE LARGEST WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES AS MEASURED BY RETAIL CONNECTIONS AND REVENUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, VERIZON WIRELESS HAD 102.8 MILLION RETAIL

CONNECTIONS AND 2013 REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $81.0 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 67% OF VERIZONS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR 4G LTE NETWORK. OUR 4G LTE NETWORK IS AVAILABLE TO 97% OF THE U.S. POPULATION IN MORE THAN 500 MARKETS COVERING APPROXIMATELY 305 MILLION PEOPLE,

INCLUDING THOSE IN AREAS SERVED BY OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PARTNERS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE ARE WORKING WITH WIRELESS CARRIERS IN RURAL AREAS TO COLLABORATIVELY BUILD AND OPERATE A 4G LTE NETWORK USING EACH CARRIERS NETWORK ASSETS AND OUR

CORE 4G LTE EQUIPMENT AND 700 MHZ C-BLOCK SPECTRUM. OUR 4G LTE NETWORK PROVIDES HIGHER DATA THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE FOR DATA SERVICES AT A LOWER COST COMPARED TO THAT PROVIDED VIA 3G NETWORKS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WIRELESS DEVICES

WE OFFER SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF WIRELESS DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES, TABLETS AND OTHER INTERNET ACCESS DEVICES AS WELL AS BASIC PHONES.

SMARTPHONES

. OUR DEVICE LINE-UP INCLUDES AN ARRAY OF SMARTPHONES THAT ARE ENABLED TO UTILIZE OUR 4G LTE AND/OR 3G EV-DO HIGH-SPEED

DATA SERVICES AND RUN ON VARIOUS OPERATING PLATFORMS, SUCH AS APPLE IOS, GOOGLE ANDROID, BLACKBERRY OS, AND WINDOWS PHONE OS. IN AUGUST 2013, WE LAUNCHED THE NEW VERIZON EDGE DEVICE PAYMENT PLAN OPTION WHICH NOW ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO TRADE IN THEIR

PHONE FOR A NEW PHONE AFTER A MINIMUM OF THIRTY DAYS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

TABLETS AND OTHER INTERNET

DEVICES.

WE OFFER A VARIETY OF 4G LTE AND/OR 3G EV-DO-ENABLED TABLETS FROM MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS THAT RUN PRIMARILY ON EITHER THE APPLE IOS, GOOGLE ANDROID OR MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. IN 2013, WE LAUNCHED THE ELLIPSIS 7 TABLET, WHICH

IS AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY FROM VERIZON WIRELESS. THE TABLETS WE OFFER ALSO PERMIT OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET VIA A WI-FI CONNECTION. IN ADDITION, WE OFFER DEDICATED DEVICES THAT PROVIDE A MOBILE WI-FI 4G LTE AND/OR 3G EV-DO CONNECTION,

WHICH WE REFER TO AS JETPACKS, CAPABLE OF CONNECTING MULTIPLE WI-FI ENABLED DEVICES TO THE INTERNET AT ONE TIME. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO ACCESS THE INTERNET WIRELESSLY AT BROADBAND SPEEDS ON THEIR COMPUTERS VIA DATA CARDS, USB MODEMS OR THROUGH THE

USE OF CERTAIN LAPTOP COMPUTERS AND NETBOOKS WITH EMBEDDED 4G LTE AND 3G EV-DO MOBILE BROADBAND MODULES OFFERED BY ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS). DURING 2013, WE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE STRONG SUBSCRIBER DEMAND FOR TABLETS AND OTHER

INTERNET DEVICES, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR RETAIL POSTPAID CONNECTION BASE REPRESENTED BY CONNECTIONS TO THESE DEVICES CONTINUED TO INCREASE.

BASIC PHONES

. MOST OF THE BASIC PHONES WE OFFER ARE 3G EV-DO-ENABLED AND HAVE HTML-BROWSING CAPABILITY.

WE PURCHASE WIRELESS DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES FROM A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS, WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR PURCHASES MADE FROM

APPLE, MOTOROLA MOBILITY, SAMSUNG, LG ELECTRONICS, BLACKBERRY, HTC, HITACHI AND QUALITY ONE WIRELESS (THROUGH WHICH WE PURCHASE PANTECH DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES).

A KEY COMPONENT OF ALL WIRELESS DEVICES IS THE CHIPSET, WHICH CONTAINS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE DEVICE. THE LTE CHIPSETS USED IN OUR 4G LTE-ENABLED DEVICES ARE MANUFACTURED BY VARIOUS

COMPANIES, EACH USING ITS OWN 4G LTE CHIPSET TECHNOLOGY. FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF OUR CDMA-1XRTT AND EV-DO CHIPSETS, MOST OF OUR WIRELESS DEVICE SUPPLIERS RELY ON QUALCOMM INCORPORATED (QUALCOMM). WE ALSO SELL PHONES THAT INCLUDE CDMA-1XRTT

AND EV-DO CHIPSETS MANUFACTURED BY VIA TELECOM UNDER LICENSE FROM QUALCOMM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPONENTS COMMON TO WIRELESS PHONES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELECTRONIC COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS THAT WE DO NOT DEAL WITH DIRECTLY.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE DEVICES, DATA SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE TO RUN ON OUR NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



MOBILE VIDEO.

VIDEO CONTENT IS PROJECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR A MAJORITY OF MOBILE NETWORK TRAFFIC BY 2018. WE BELIEVE THE GROWTH IN VIDEO

CONSUMPTION USING MOBILE DEVICES PROVIDES US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENUE GROWTH. WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES INVOLVING CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS, VIDEO STREAMING AND RELATED CONSUMER HARDWARE TO LEVERAGE

NEW CONTENT MODELS. OUR 4G LTE NETWORK ENABLES US TO MOVE TOWARDS A UNIFIED VIDEO STRATEGY THAT POSITIONS US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS GROWTH OPPORTUNITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE USING MULTIMEDIA BROADCAST MULTICAST SERVICE TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP

OUR LTE MULTICAST SERVICE. THIS SERVICE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE OUR NETWORK EFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO LIVE STREAMING VIDEO CONTENT WITH VIRTUALLY NO BUFFERING, REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF DEVICES USING THE

SERVICE.



MOBILE COMMERCE.

EVERY DAY, LARGE VOLUMES OF TRANSACTIONS ARE CARRIED ACROSS OUR NETWORK. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO

INFLUENCE AND BENEFIT FROM THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE MOBILE COMMERCE MARKET THAT IS BEING DRIVEN BY TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES SUCH AS THE PROLIFERATIONS OF SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS. ISIS, A MOBILE COMMERCE PLATFORM, REPRESENTS THE FIRST PHASE OF OUR

INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THIS OPPORTUNITY. LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER 2013 AS A JOINT VENTURE WITH AT&T INC. (AT&T) AND T-MOBILE USA, INC. (T-MOBILE USA), ISIS ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES VIA THEIR MOBILE PHONES USING NEAR

FIELD COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN PAYING WITH CASH OR A CREDIT CARD. KNOWN AS THE ISIS MOBILE WALLET, THIS SERVICE ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO ORGANIZE ALL OF THEIR PAYMENT CARDS, OFFERS AND LOYALTY CARDS IN ONE CONVENIENT APPLICATION

ON THEIR ISIS-READY PHONE.



INNOVATION CENTERS.

WE OPERATE INNOVATION CENTERS IN WALTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS AND SAN FRANCISCO. WE BELIEVE OUR CENTERS SERVE AS CATALYSTS

FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NON-TRADITIONAL DEVICES, SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS THAT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF OUR 4G LTE NETWORK. THE CENTERS WORK WITH MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS REPRESENTING VARIOUS INDUSTRIES TO HELP THEM QUICKLY BRING PRODUCTS,

SERVICES, APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS TO MARKET.

NETWORK

WE HAVE THE LARGEST 4G LTE AND 3G EV-DO NETWORKS OF ANY SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH LICENSED AND OPERATIONAL COVERAGE IN

ALL OF THE 100 MOST POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. AS OF JANUARY 21, 2014, OUR 4G LTE NETWORK COVERS APPROXIMATELY 305 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S., INCLUDING THOSE IN AREAS SERVED BY OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PROGRAM.

WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THE HIGHEST NETWORK RELIABILITY FOR THEIR WIRELESS SERVICES. WE DESIGN AND DEPLOY OUR

NETWORK IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL DATA SESSIONS AND COMPLETIONS OF LARGE FILE DOWNLOADS AND UPLOADS WHILE DELIVERING ON OUR ADVERTISED THROUGHPUT SPEEDS, AND THAT MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT ARE

CONNECTED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND COMPLETED WITHOUT BEING DROPPED. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND UPGRADE OUR NETWORK, PRIMARILY TO INCREASE CAPACITY, AS WELL AS EXPLORE STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR NATIONAL NETWORK COVERAGE

THROUGH SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS OF WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND SPECTRUM LICENSES.

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN NETWORK COVERAGE, WE HAVE ROAMING AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE WIRELESS SERVICE IN NEARLY ALL OTHER AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WIRELESS SERVICE IS AVAILABLE. WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES TO OUR

CUSTOMERS THROUGH ROAMING ARRANGEMENTS WITH WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. CERTAIN OF OUR ROAMING AGREEMENTS ARE TERMINABLE AT WILL BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS NOTICE; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

TERMINATION OF ANY OF THESE AT-WILL AGREEMENTS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

TECHNOLOGY

OUR PRIMARY NETWORK TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE 4G LTE AND 3G CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS (CDMA). 4G LTE PROVIDES HIGHER DATA THROUGHPUT

PERFORMANCE FOR DATA SERVICES AT A LOWER COST COMPARED TO THOSE OFFERED BY 3G TECHNOLOGIES. WE CONTINUE WORKING TO EXPAND 4G LTE COVERAGE BEYOND OUR NETWORK FOOTPRINT THROUGH OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PROGRAM. WE CURRENTLY HAVE 20 COMMITTED PROGRAM

PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE 4G LTE COVERAGE TO APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION PEOPLE UNDER THE PROGRAM AND, TO DATE, SIXTEEN PARTICIPANTS HAVE COMMENCED OPERATIONS ON SUCH NETWORKS.

IN 2012, WE BEGAN TESTING OUR MOBILE VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (VOIP) NETWORK KNOWN AS VOICE OVER LTE (VOLTE). THIS TECHNOLOGY, WHICH

IS EXPECTED TO BE USED IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT VOICE TECHNOLOGY, IS ANTICIPATED TO LAUNCH COMMERCIALLY IN 2014.

OUR 3G

CDMA NETWORK IS BASED ON SPREAD-SPECTRUM DIGITAL RADIO TECHNOLOGY. CDMA-1XRTT TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED IN NEARLY ALL OF THE CELL SITES IN OUR 3G CDMA NETWORK. IN ADDITION, EV-DO, A 3G PACKET-BASED TECHNOLOGY INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR HIGH-SPEED DATA

TRANSMISSION, IS DEPLOYED IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CELL SITES IN OUR 3G CDMA NETWORK.

OUR NETWORK INCLUDES VARIOUS

ELEMENTS OF REDUNDANCY DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICE. POWER AND BACKHAUL TRANSPORT FACILITIES CAN OFTEN BECOME A NETWORKS VULNERABILITY. CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE BATTERY BACKUP AT EVERY SWITCH AND EVERY CELL SITE IN OUR

NETWORK. WE ALSO UTILIZE BACKUP GENERATORS AT A MAJORITY OF OUR CELL SITES AND AT EVERY SWITCH LOCATION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A FLEET OF PORTABLE BACKUP GENERATORS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED TO CELL SITES IF NEEDED. WE FURTHER ENHANCE RELIABILITY BY USING

A FULLY REDUNDANT BACKBONE MULTIPROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING NETWORK IN ALL CRITICAL LOCATIONS.

SPECTRUM

THE SPECTRUM LICENSES WE HOLD CAN BE USED FOR MOBILE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WE HAVE LICENSES TO PROVIDE THESE

WIRELESS SERVICES ON PORTIONS OF THE 800 MHZ BAND, ALSO KNOWN AS CELLULAR SPECTRUM, THE 1800-1900 MHZ BAND, ALSO KNOWN AS PERSONAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES (PCS) SPECTRUM, AND THE 1700 AND 2100 MHZ BAND, ALSO KNOWN AS ADVANCED WIRELESS SERVICES (AWS)

SPECTRUM, IN AREAS THAT, COLLECTIVELY, COVER NEARLY ALL OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD LICENSES FOR PORTIONS OF THE 700 MHZ UPPER C BAND, INCLUDING TEN LICENSES THAT CAN, TOGETHER, BE USED TO PROVIDE WIRELESS SERVICE

COVERAGE TO THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES AND THE GULF OF MEXICO.

SINCE 2012, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEVERAL SPECTRUM TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING.



IN 2012, VERIZON WIRELESS ACQUIRED AWS SPECTRUM IN SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS WITH SPECTRUMCO, LLC AND COX TMI WIRELESS, LLC FOR WHICH IT PAID AN

AGGREGATE OF $3.9 BILLION AT THE TIME OF THE CLOSINGS. DURING 2012, VERIZON WIRELESS ALSO COMPLETED LICENSE PURCHASE AND EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS WITH LEAP WIRELESS, SAVARY ISLAND WIRELESS, WHICH IS MAJORITY OWNED BY LEAP WIRELESS, AND A SUBSIDIARY OF

T-MOBILE USA. AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, VERIZON WIRELESS RECEIVED AN AGGREGATE $2.6 BILLION OF AWS AND PCS LICENSES AT FAIR VALUE AND TRANSFERRED CERTAIN AWS LICENSES TO T-MOBILE USA AND A 700 MEGAHERTZ (MHZ) LOWER A BLOCK LICENSE TO LEAP

WIRELESS.



DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013, WE COMPLETED LICENSE EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS WITH T-MOBILE LICENSE LLC AND CRICKET LICENSE COMPANY, LLC, A

SUBSIDIARY OF LEAP WIRELESS, TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN AWS LICENSES. THESE NON-CASH EXCHANGES INCLUDE A NUMBER OF INTRA-MARKET SWAPS THAT WE EXPECT WILL ENABLE VERIZON WIRELESS TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THE AWS BAND. AS A RESULT OF THESE EXCHANGES, WE

RECEIVED AN AGGREGATE $0.5 BILLION OF AWS LICENSES AT FAIR VALUE.



DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, AFTER RECEIVING THE REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS, VERIZON WIRELESS SOLD 39 LOWER 700 MHZ B BLOCK SPECTRUM

LICENSES TO AT&T IN EXCHANGE FOR A PAYMENT OF $1.9 BILLION AND THE TRANSFER BY AT&T TO VERIZON WIRELESS OF AWS (10 MHZ) LICENSES IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. VERIZON WIRELESS ALSO SOLD CERTAIN LOWER 700 MHZ B BLOCK

SPECTRUM LICENSES TO AN INVESTMENT FIRM FOR A PAYMENT OF $0.2 BILLION. AS A RESULT, WE RECEIVED $0.5 BILLION OF AWS LICENSES AT FAIR VALUE.



DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, WE ENTERED INTO LICENSE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS WITH T-MOBILE USA TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN AWS AND PCS LICENSES. THESE

NON-CASH EXCHANGES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2014. THE EXCHANGE INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SWAPS THAT WE EXPECT WILL

RESULT IN MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THE AWS AND PCS BANDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION WITH T-MOBILE USA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, ON JANUARY 6, 2014, WE ANNOUNCED TWO AGREEMENTS WITH T-MOBILE

USA WITH RESPECT TO OUR REMAINING 700 MHZ A BLOCK SPECTRUM LICENSES. UNDER ONE AGREEMENT, WE WILL SELL CERTAIN OF THESE LICENSES TO T-MOBILE USA IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION, AND UNDER THE SECOND AGREEMENT WE

WILL EXCHANGE THE REMAINDER OF THESE LICENSES FOR AWS AND PCS SPECTRUM LICENSES. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE FCC AS WELL AS OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE MIDDLE OF

2014.

WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. THIS INCREASING DEMAND IS BEING

DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS AND USAGE OF WIRELESS BROADBAND SERVICES, WHICH USE MORE BANDWIDTH AND REQUIRE EVER FASTER RATES OF SPEED TO STAY COMPETITIVE. WE CAN MEET SPECTRUM NEEDS BY ACQUIRING LICENSES OR LEASING SPECTRUM FROM OTHER

LICENSEES, OR BY ACQUIRING NEW SPECTRUM LICENSES FROM THE FCC, IF AND WHEN OFFERED BY THE FCC IN FUTURE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW SPECTRUM FOR COMMERCIAL WIRELESS SERVICES AND THE POSSIBLE DATES OF FUTURE FCC SPECTRUM

AUCTIONS ARE UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME, THE FCC AND THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN SEEKING THE RELEASE OF ADDITIONAL MOBILE USE SPECTRUM. THE FCC IS EXPECTED TO CONDUCT AN AUCTION FOR AWS-3 SPECTRUM IN LATE 2014. IN ADDITION,

CONGRESS HAS ADOPTED LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY NETWORK AND THE REALLOCATION AND AUCTION, THROUGH THE USE OF VOLUNTARY INCENTIVE AUCTIONS, BY 2022 OF PORTIONS OF THE EXISTING BROADCAST SPECTRUM. THE

INCENTIVE AUCTION RELATED TO THE 600 MHZ BAND IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN MID-2015 ALTHOUGH THE SPECIFIC TIMING OF THE AWS-3, 600 MHZ AND OTHER AUCTIONS WILL BE DETERMINED BY FUTURE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

SINCE WE AND COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SPECTRUM SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND MAY HAVE SPECTRUM SURPLUSES

IN OTHERS, WE HAVE AT TIMES EXCHANGED SPECTRUM LICENSES WITH OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGH SECONDARY MARKET SWAP TRANSACTIONS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES TO TRADE SPECTRUM LICENSES IN ORDER TO MEET CERTAIN OF OUR

CAPACITY AND EXPANSION NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. IN OTHER CASES, VERIZON WIRELESS HAS ENTERED INTO INTRA-MARKET SPECTRUM SWAPS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CONTIGUOUS SPECTRUM WITHIN FREQUENCY BANDS IN A SPECIFIC MARKET. CONTIGUOUS SPECTRUM

IMPROVES NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY. THESE SWAPS AS WELL AS ANY SPECTRUM PURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR THE TRANSFER OF SPECTRUM LICENSES IN EACH INSTANCE.

NETWORK EQUIPMENT AND BUILD-OUT

ALCATEL-LUCENT AND ERICSSON ARE CURRENTLY OUR PRIMARY NETWORK VENDORS FOR OUR LTE NETWORK DEPLOYMENTS FOR MACRO SITES AS WELL AS SMALL CELLS. OUR PRIMARY CDMA CELL SITE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE VENDORS

ARE ALCATEL-LUCENT, WHICH PROVIDES MORE THAN HALF OF OUR CDMA CELL SITE EQUIPMENT, AND NOKIA SIEMENS NETWORKS (NSN) AND ERICSSON, WHICH TOGETHER PROVIDE NEARLY ALL OF OUR REMAINING CELL SITE EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO RELY ON ALCATEL-LUCENT, NSN AND

ERICSSON FOR OUR SWITCHING EQUIPMENT.

AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD AND UPGRADE OUR EXISTING NETWORK, WE MUST COMPLETE A VARIETY OF

STEPS, INCLUDING SECURING RIGHTS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF SITES AND OBTAINING ZONING AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR MACRO SITES, SMALL CELLS, IN-BUILDING SYSTEMS AND ANTENNAS AND RELATED RADIO EQUIPMENT THAT COMPRISE DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS.

WE UTILIZE TOWER SITE MANAGEMENT FIRMS, SUCH AS CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION, AS LESSORS OR MANAGERS OF A PORTION OF OUR EXISTING TOWER SITES UPON WHICH OUR OPERATIONS DEPEND.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON OFFERING SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF OUR VARIOUS CUSTOMER MARKET GROUPS; PROMOTING OUR BRAND; LEVERAGING OUR EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; AND JOINTLY

MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO LARGE BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS WITH VERIZONS WIRELINE BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH VERIZON ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS, A SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL OF VERIZONS SOLUTIONS FOR

MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS GLOBALLY. OUR MARKETING PLAN INCLUDES A COORDINATED PROGRAM OF TELEVISION, PRINT, RADIO, OUTDOOR SIGNAGE, INTERNET AND POINT-OF-SALE MEDIA PROMOTIONS DESIGNED TO PRESENT OUR CORPORATE MESSAGE

CONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL OF OUR MARKETS. WE USE A COMBINATION OF DIRECT, INDIRECT AND ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN ORDER TO INCREASE CUSTOMER GROWTH WHILE REDUCING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS.

COMPANY-OPERATED STORES ARE A CORE COMPONENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY. OUR DIRECT CHANNEL, WHICH INCLUDES OUR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS

SALES OPERATIONS AND SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION, IS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS OF CONSUMERS AND LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A TELEMARKETING SALES FORCE DEDICATED TO HANDLING INCOMING

CALLS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND WE OFFER FULLY-AUTOMATED, END-TO-END WEB-BASED SALES OF WIRELESS DEVICES, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICE PLANS.

IN NOVEMBER 2013, WE LAUNCHED OUR FIRST VERIZON DESTINATION STORE AT MALL OF AMERICA IN BLOOMINGTON, MINNESOTA. THE STORE FOCUSES ON THE MOBILE LIFESTYLE AND HIGHLIGHTS THE MANY WAYS CONSUMERS CAN USE

WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. THE STORE IS PART OF A BROADER INITIATIVE THAT INCLUDES THE REDESIGN OF OUR RETAIL STORES NATIONWIDE, TO BECOME SMART STORES. THESE NEWLY REDESIGNED LOCATIONS SHOWCASE THE SAME MOBILE LIFESTYLE

ZONES AS THE VERIZON DESTINATION STORE BUT ON A SMALLER SCALE. DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE PLAN TO OPEN ADDITIONAL DESTINATION STORES IN HIGH TRAFFIC LOCATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN ADDITION, OUR ONLINE STORE AND GADGETS & GEAR PORTAL

HAVE ALSO BEEN REDESIGNED TO DELIVER A CONSISTENT SHOPPING EXPERIENCE FOR CUSTOMERS ACROSS BROWSERS AND MOBILE PLATFORMS.

OUR

INDIRECT CHANNEL INCLUDES AGENTS THAT SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT RETAIL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE INTERNET. THE MAJORITY OF THESE AGENTS SELL BOTH OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND DO SO UNDER EXCLUSIVE SELLING ARRANGEMENTS WITH US. WE ALSO UTILIZE HIGH-PROFILE, NATIONAL RETAILERS, SUCH AS BEST BUY, WAL-MART, RADIOSHACK AND TARGET, TO SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

STORES SUCH AS DOLLAR GENERAL AND VARIOUS DRUGSTORE CHAINS SELL OUR PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO AGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF BROADBAND, VIDEO AND VOICE SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGH WHICH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE

SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OR BUNDLED WITH THEIR SERVICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY. WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING AT&T, SPRINT CORPORATION AND T-MOBILE USA, AS WELL AS VARIOUS REGIONAL WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COMPETE FOR RETAIL ACTIVATIONS WITH RESELLERS THAT BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM FACILITIES-BASED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR RESALE, INCLUDING THOSE THAT BUY FROM US. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF

CONTINUING INCREASES IN WIRELESS MARKET PENETRATION LEVELS, NETWORK INVESTMENT, THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, NEW MARKET ENTRANTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM, BOTH

LICENSED AND UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. COMPETITION MAY ALSO INCREASE AS SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MERGE OR TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING TO INCREASE THEIR BRAND

RECOGNITION AND CAPTURE CUSTOMER REVENUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, APPLE AND OTHERS ARE OFFERING ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR MAKING WIRELESS VOICE CALLS THAT, IN CERTAIN CASES, CAN BE

USED IN LIEU OF THE WIRELESS PROVIDERS VOICE SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR

INDUSTRY.



NETWORK RELIABILITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE.

WE BELIEVE THAT A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE SERVICE

IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE U.S. MARKET AND A DRIVER OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. LOWER PRICES, IMPROVED SERVICE QUALITY AND NEW WIRELESS SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHICH IN MANY CASES INCLUDE VIDEO CONTENT, HAVE LED TO INCREASED CUSTOMER USAGE OF WIRELESS

SERVICES, WHICH, IN TURN, PUTS PRESSURE ON NETWORK CAPACITY. IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY NEEDS AND OFFER HIGHLY RELIABLE NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR NETWORKS. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR 4G LTE NETWORK WILL HELP US TO KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS AND MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR HIGHER SPEEDS.



PRICING.

SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PRICING PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE WIRELESS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. AS THE DEMAND FOR WIRELESS SERVICES

CONTINUES TO GROW, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING SERVICE PLANS THAT INCLUDE UNLIMITED VOICE MINUTES AND TEXT MESSAGES AND A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF DATA ACCESS IN VARYING MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE SIZES OR, IN SOME CASES, UNLIMITED DATA USAGE. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO OFFERING MINUTES-SHARING PLANS; LARGER BUNDLES OF INCLUDED MINUTES WITH NO ROAMING OR LONG DISTANCE CHARGES; FEATURES THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO PLACE AND RECEIVE CALLS FROM A GROUP OF

SELF-DESIGNATED U.S. PHONE NUMBERS (INCLUDING LANDLINE NUMBERS) AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE; AND BOTH PREPAID AND POSTPAID PLANS OFFERING UNLIMITED VOICE AND DATA USAGE. WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO OFFERING PRICE PLANS THAT DECOUPLE SERVICE

PRICING FROM EQUIPMENT PRICING AND BLUR THE TRADITIONAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN PREPAID AND POSTPAID PLANS. IN ADDITION, SOME WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING A CREDIT TO NEW CUSTOMERS TO REIMBURSE EARLY TERMINATION FEES PAID TO THEIR FORMER

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS.

WE SEEK TO COMPETE IN THIS AREA BY OFFERING OUR

CUSTOMERS PRICE PLANS FOR OUR SERVICES, AS WELL AS EQUIPMENT OFFERS, THAT THEY WILL REGARD AS THE BEST AVAILABLE VALUE FOR THE PRICE.



CUSTOMER SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH-QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY FACTOR IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING THOSE OF OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CONVENIENT AND EASY-TO-USE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS AND MINIMIZE

CHURN. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON IMPROVING IN THIS AREA.



PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT.

AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP AND WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS PROLIFERATE, CONTINUED CUSTOMER AND REVENUE

GROWTH WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED DATA PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND IN

COLLABORATION WITH APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH VARIOUS DEVICE MANUFACTURERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTINCTIVE SMARTPHONES AND OTHER WIRELESS DEVICES THAT CAN ACCESS THE GROWING ARRAY OF DATA APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT

AVAILABLE OVER THE INTERNET. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON INCREASING SMARTPHONE PENETRATION THROUGHOUT OUR CUSTOMER BASE.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION.

KEY TO ACHIEVING SALES SUCCESS IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF SALES CHANNELS AND DISTRIBUTION

POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ATTAINING THE OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF VARYING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING PROFITABILITY, AS MEASURED BY OPERATING INCOME. WE ENDEAVOR TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES,

OUTSIDE SALES TEAMS AND TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF RETAIL OUTLETS AND PREPAID REPLENISHMENT LOCATIONS AND NETBOOK AND NOTEBOOK OEMS. IN ADDITION,

WE SELL NETWORK ACCESS TO BOTH TRADITIONAL RESELLERS, WHICH RESELL NETWORK SERVICES TO THEIR END-USERS, AND TO VARIOUS COMPANIES TO ENABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FOR THEIR M2M DEVICES OR FOR THEIR PROVISION OF TELEMATICS SERVICES.



CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY AND COVERAGE OF THEIR NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AS DO SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW BUSINESS

MODELS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, REGULATORY CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PRICING STRATEGIES OF COMPETITORS.

FIOS.

OUR GOAL IS TO DISTINGUISH FIOS AS A PREMIER RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, OUR FIOS

SERVICE PASSED OVER 18.5 MILLION PREMISES, AND OUR LATEST FIOS QUANTUM SERVICE OFFERINGS NOW PROVIDE DOWNLOAD SPEEDS UP TO 500 MBPS AND UPLOAD SPEEDS UP TO 100 MBPS. NEW SERVICES SUCH AS THE FIOS MOBILE APP ARE ALSO EXTENDING OUR TV EXPERIENCE

TO A HOST OF MOBILE DEVICES. WE EXPECT BANDWIDTH DEMANDS TO GROW WITH THE CONTINUED EMERGENCE OF NEW VIDEO AND DATA APPLICATIONS AND THE PROLIFERATION OF IP DEVICES IN THE HOME.

THE PASSIVE OPTICAL NETWORK TECHNOLOGY UPON WHICH THE FIOS NETWORK IS DEPLOYED POSITIONS VERIZON TO MEET GROWING BANDWIDTH

REQUIREMENTS. OUR NETWORK ARCHITECTURE PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT OUR FACILITIES MORE EASILY TO FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW OPTICAL TERMINALS CAN BE ADDED TO THE FIBER-TO-THE-PREMISE NETWORK PROVIDING GREATER BANDWIDTH AND

NEW SERVICES WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FIELD CONSTRUCTION. SELECT FIELD TRIALS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED CONNECTION SPEEDS OF NEARLY ONE GIGABIT PER SECOND (GBPS), AND WHEN A MORE ADVANCED NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN CONNECTED TO THE

FIBER-OPTIC NETWORK, CONNECTION SPEEDS OF 10 GBPS HAVE BEEN REACHED, DEMONSTRATING THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH CAPACITY BUILT INTO THE FIOS PLATFORM.

ADDITIONALLY, THIS ADVANCED OPTICAL NETWORK IS ALSO FINDING INCREASED APPLICATION OPPORTUNITIES IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR, ESPECIALLY AS THE INDUSTRY SEEKS TO MIGRATE TO ETHERNET-BASED ACCESS SERVICES.



GLOBAL IP

. VERIZON OWNS AND OPERATES ONE OF THE LARGEST GLOBAL FIBER NETWORKS WITH LONG HAUL, METRO AND SUBMARINE CABLE ASSETS PROVIDING

CONNECTIVITY TO CUSTOMERS IN OVER 150 COUNTRIES. VERIZONS GLOBAL NETWORK ENCOMPASSES OVER 830,000 ROUTE MILES OF TERRESTRIAL AND UNDERSEA CABLE, SERVING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT AND ENABLE FAR REACHING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

GLOBAL IP TRAFFIC HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND IS EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS GLOBAL BUSINESS IS ALSO RAPIDLY EVOLVING TO AN EVERYTHING-AS-A-SERVICE MODEL IN WHICH BUSINESS CUSTOMERS SEEK CLOUD-BASED, CONVERGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS DELIVERED SECURELY VIA MANAGED AND

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. WITH THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF ITS PACKET OPTICAL TRANSPORT STRATEGY, VERIZON IS CREATING A SINGLE, HIGH-CAPACITY GLOBAL NETWORK PLATFORM THAT COMBINES OPTICAL TRANSPORT WITH ADVANCED PACKET SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY. THE RESULT

IS A GLOBAL IP NETWORK THAT CAN OFFER POWERFUL SOLUTIONS TO THESE SERVICE DEMANDS.

ALTHOUGH OVERALL WIRELINE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECLINED IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DECREASED LEGACY SPENDING REQUIREMENTS AND A DECLINE IN SPENDING ON OUR FIOS NETWORK, WE FURTHERED OUR GLOBAL IP NETWORK EXPANSION INITIATIVES INTO EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA

AND SOUTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF THE INDUSTRYS FIRST COMMERCIAL 100G GBPS TECHNOLOGY ON U.S. AND EUROPEAN BACKBONE ROUTES. MORE THAN 13,000 100G ULTRA-LONG-HAUL ROUTE MILES WERE ADDED TO THE GLOBAL IP NETWORK IN 2013,

AND WE PLAN TO FURTHER EXTEND OUR 100G TECHNOLOGY IN 2014.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON ADVANCING OUR FIBER-BASED

NETWORKS AND ACHIEVING COST EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENTS WILL HELP VERIZON ADVANCE ITS POSITION AS A PROVIDER OF CHOICE TO RESIDENTIAL AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY FURTHER WITH TRADITIONAL, NON-TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING PLAYERS SEEKING INCREASED MARKET SHARE. CURRENT

AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, OTHER DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, SATELLITE TELEVISION COMPANIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES AND

MANAGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS.

IN ADDITION, COMPANIES WITH A GLOBAL PRESENCE INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH OUR WIRELINE

BUSINESSES. A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH GLOBAL OPERATIONS SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, GLOBAL WHOLESALE MARKETS. WE COMPETE WITH THESE FULL OR NEAR-FULL

SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR LARGE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED SERVICES TO GLOBAL ENTERPRISES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING

COMPETITION AND WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH.

WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND TRENDS IN

THE WIRELINE INDUSTRY.



CUSTOMER SERVICE

: CUSTOMERS EXPECT INDUSTRY-LEADING SERVICE FROM THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES EVOLVE, THE ABILITY TO

EXCEL IN THIS AREA IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION. IN MASS MARKETS, WE COMPETE IN THIS AREA THROUGH OUR SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND ONLINE SUPPORT. IN GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH READY ACCESS TO THEIR

SYSTEM AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, AND WE CONDUCT PROACTIVE TESTING OF OUR NETWORK TO IDENTIFY ISSUES BEFORE THEY AFFECT CUSTOMERS. IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS, WE BELIEVE SERVICE IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED SYSTEM AUTOMATION

INITIATIVES.



NETWORK RELIABILITY AND BANDWIDTH (SPEED).

AS BOTH CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS LOOK TO LEVERAGE HIGH-SPEED CONNECTIONS FOR

ENTERTAINMENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY, WE EXPECT BROADBAND PENETRATION WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS ONLINE AND ONLINE-ENABLED ACTIVITIES INCREASE, SO WILL BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, BOTH DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM. TO

SUCCEED, WE AND OTHER NETWORK-BASED PROVIDERS MUST ENSURE THAT OUR NETWORKS CAN DELIVER AGAINST THESE INCREASING BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO MEET THIS FUTURE DEMAND. IN ADDITION, NETWORK RELIABILITY AND

SECURITY ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE MARKET.



PRICING.

CABLE, TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS USE PRICING TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE FROM INCUMBENTS. PRICING IS

ALSO A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR AS NON-TRADITIONAL MODES OF PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES EMERGE AND NEW ENTRANTS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, VOIP AND PORTAL-BASED CALLING IS FREE OR NEARLY FREE TO CUSTOMERS AND IS OFTEN SUPPORTED BY

ADVERTISING REVENUES.



PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

AS A RESULT OF PRICING PRESSURES, PROVIDERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE

SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS FROM ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS AND ARE SEEKING WAYS TO LEVERAGE THEIR BROADBAND AND VIDEO CONNECTIONS. CONVERGED FEATURES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED WIRELESS AND WIRELINE FUNCTIONALITY, ARE BECOMING SIMILARLY IMPORTANT, DRIVEN BY BOTH

CUSTOMER DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

IN THE MASS MARKETS BUSINESS, CABLE OPERATORS ARE

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS. CABLE OPERATORS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE AND DIGITAL CAPACITY OF THEIR NETWORKS SO THAT THEY CAN OFFER DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO MARKET COMPETITIVE BUNDLED OFFERINGS THAT INCLUDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET

ACCESS, DIGITAL TELEVISION AND VOICE SERVICES. SEVERAL MAJOR CABLE OPERATORS ALSO OFFER BUNDLES WITH WIRELESS SERVICES THROUGH STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS.

IN ADDITION, WIRELESS SUBSTITUTION IS AN ONGOING COMPETITIVE TREND, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE AS WIRELESS COMPANIES POSITION THEIR SERVICE AS A LANDLINE ALTERNATIVE. WE ALSO FACE INCREASING COMPETITION

FROM CABLE COMPANIES AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES AS WELL AS INTERNET PORTAL PROVIDERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996, WHICH REQUIRES US TO ALLOW POTENTIAL COMPETITORS TO PURCHASE OUR SERVICES FOR RESALE OR ACCESS COMPONENTS OF OUR NETWORK ON AN UNBUNDLED BASIS AT A PRESCRIBED COST, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES.

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS AT SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE SCOPE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS GOING

FORWARD AND THE RATES WE RECEIVE ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REVIEW AND REVISION BY THE FCC AND STATE REGULATORS. (SEE REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS IN THE 2013 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.)

IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE MARKET, THE CUSTOMERS NEED TO REDUCE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY COUPLED WITH THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY

TECHNOLOGY CONVERGENCE IS DRIVING THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, CARRIERS AND HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN IT SERVICES ARE EITHER MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR

FORGING NEW ALLIANCES TO BE BETTER POSITIONED FOR A REBOUND IN TECHNOLOGY SPENDING. MOST NEW ALLIANCES AND ACQUISITIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON EMERGING FIELDS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, SOFTWARE DELIVERY, COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER COMPUTING TASKS

VIA THE NETWORK, RATHER THAN ON IN-HOUSE MACHINES. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO UTILIZED ACQUISITIONS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO ENTERPRISE OUTSOURCING MARKETS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN DOMINATED BY THE MAJOR IT OUTSOURCERS.

GLOBAL WHOLESALE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL CARRIERS FOR LONG-HAUL, VOICE AND IP SERVICES. IN ADDITION, MOBILE VIDEO AND DATA NEEDS ARE

DRIVING A GREATER NEED FOR WIRELESS BACKHAUL. NETWORK PROVIDERS, CABLE COMPANIES AND NICHE PLAYERS ARE COMPETITORS FOR THIS NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

VERIZON OWNS OR HAS LICENSES TO VARIOUS PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, DOMAIN NAMES AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY PURSUE THE FILING AND REGISTRATION OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, DOMAIN NAMES, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

AND ABROAD. VERIZON ALSO ACTIVELY GRANTS LICENSES, IN EXCHANGE FOR APPROPRIATE FEES OR OTHER CONSIDERATION AND SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS AND RESTRICTIONS, TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ENABLE SUCH COMPANIES TO UTILIZE CERTAIN VERIZON INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AS PART OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SUCH LICENSES ENABLE SUCH THIRD PARTY LICENSEES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESULTS OF VERIZONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. WHILE THESE LICENSES RESULT IN

VALUABLE CONSIDERATION BEING PAID TO VERIZON, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LOSS OF SUCH CONSIDERATION, OR THE EXPIRATION OF ANY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

VERIZON PERIODICALLY RECEIVES OFFERS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO PURCHASE OR OBTAIN LICENSES FOR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

IN EXCHANGE FOR ROYALTIES OR OTHER PAYMENTS. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY RECEIVE NOTICES ALLEGING THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INFRINGE ON THIRD PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE CLAIMS, WHETHER AGAINST US DIRECTLY OR AGAINST

THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT WE, IN TURN, SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES, OR CEASE OFFERING THE RELEVANT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS AND THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS

COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AND FROM EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS A RECESSION OR ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE AFFORDABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMERS MAY SEEK TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BY FORGOING PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, ELECTING TO USE FEWER HIGHER MARGIN SERVICES OR OBTAINING LOWER-COST PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

SIMILARLY, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE MAY DELAY PURCHASING DECISIONS, DELAY FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE OFFERINGS OR REDUCE THEIR USE OF SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASED

NUMBER OF OUR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR SERVICES. IF THESE EVENTS WERE TO OCCUR, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION THAT MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITS.

WE

FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL DISTINCTIONS AMONG WIRELESS, CABLE, INTERNET, LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND

BROUGHT NEW COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION AND DEVICE PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES

HAVE ENABLED US TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER PROVIDERS TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NETWORK QUALITY,

CAPACITY AND COVERAGE, THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE QUALITY OF OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, OUR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE REACH AND QUALITY OF OUR SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND FOR EXISTING SERVICES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESPOND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND ADDRESS CHANGING CONSUMER DEMAND ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE

DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

OUR INDUSTRY IS

EXPERIENCING RAPID CHANGE AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN ORDER TO GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR EXISTING

OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET FUTURE CHALLENGES FROM COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS ON OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES. IF OUR SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE

MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION TO INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OFFERINGS, WE MUST PHASE OUT OUTDATED AND UNPROFITABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO DO SO ON A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS ON OUR ABILITY TO PHASE OUT CURRENT SERVICES.

WE DEPEND ON KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE DEPEND ON VARIOUS KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE US, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH OTHER SUPPLIERS, WITH EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, SUCH AS SWITCH AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT AND HANDSETS, THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO

OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR HANDSET AND OTHER DEVICE SUPPLIERS OFTEN RELY ON ONE VENDOR FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, USED IN THEIR DEVICES. IF THESE

SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS FAIL TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE ON A TIMELY BASIS OR FAIL TO MEET OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS AND WHEN REQUESTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO

MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE OUR NETWORKS. BECAUSE OF THE COSTS AND TIME LAGS THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING FROM ONE SUPPLIER TO ANOTHER, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISRUPTED IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO, OR CHOSE TO, REPLACE THE PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR SUPPLIERS WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, ESPECIALLY IF THE REPLACEMENT BECAME NECESSARY ON SHORT NOTICE. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, DECREASE OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ON WHICH WE

RELY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY ON WHICH WE DEPEND, INCLUDING LITIGATION INVOLVING CLAIMS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT. SUCH CLAIMS HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY IN THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT

WHETHER OUR BUSINESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH LITIGATION. WE EXPECT OUR DEPENDENCE ON KEY SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUE AS WE DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE MORE ADVANCED GENERATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FCC AND OTHER

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE REGULATED BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE REGULATORY REGIMES FREQUENTLY RESTRICT OR IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN DESIGNATED

AREAS AND TO PROVIDE SPECIFIED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE ARE FREQUENTLY REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN LICENSES FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STANDARDS. WE ARE OFTEN INVOLVED IN REGULATORY AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS, OR THE REVIEWS BY FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF

REGULATORY RULINGS. WITHOUT RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE LICENSES NEEDED TO

CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN OR IN MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING LICENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FCC GRANTS WIRELESS LICENSES FOR TERMS GENERALLY LASTING 10 YEARS, SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. THE LOSS OF, OR A MATERIAL LIMITATION ON, CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSES COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES

TO THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, OR INTERNATIONAL LEVEL COULD RESTRICT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MANAGE OUR WIRELINE AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS, IMPAIR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, AND POTENTIALLY IMPEDE

OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN SERVICES COULD BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING REGULATION BY THE FCC AND/OR VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WE HOLD CERTAIN WIRELESS LICENSES THAT REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH SO-CALLED OPEN ACCESS FCC REGULATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE LICENSEES OF PARTICULAR

SPECTRUM TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEIR CHOICE. IN ADDITION, OUR BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE SO-CALLED NETWORK NEUTRALITY RULES, SOME OF WHICH WERE AFFIRMED

AND OTHERS VACATED ON APPEAL IN EARLY 2014. PROPONENTS OF THESE RULES WANT TO LIMIT THE WAYS THAT A BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDER CAN STRUCTURE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS AND MANAGE ITS NETWORK. THE FURTHER REGULATION OF BROADBAND, WIRELESS,

AND OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES AND ANY RELATED COURT DECISIONS COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND LIMIT THE RETURN WE CAN EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ON PAST AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR NETWORKS.

CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER BREACHES OF NETWORK OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER BREACHES OF NETWORK OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SECURITY MAY CAUSE EQUIPMENT FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS TO OUR

OPERATIONS. OUR INABILITY TO OPERATE OUR WIRELINE OR WIRELESS NETWORKS AS A RESULT OF SUCH EVENTS, EVEN FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND/OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE TO OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION,

THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. CYBER ATTACKS, WHICH INCLUDE THE USE OF MALWARE, COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER MEANS FOR DISRUPTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, ON COMPANIES, INCLUDING

VERIZON, HAVE INCREASED IN FREQUENCY, SCOPE AND POTENTIAL HARM IN RECENT YEARS. WHILE, TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUBJECT TO CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER CYBER INCIDENTS WHICH, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, HAVE BEEN MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CYBER INCIDENTS AND PROTECT OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORKS MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REPEL A MAJOR CYBER ATTACK IN THE FUTURE. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A MAJOR CYBER

ATTACK ON VERIZON COULD INCLUDE EXPENSIVE INCENTIVES OFFERED TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS TO RETAIN THEIR BUSINESS, INCREASED EXPENDITURES ON CYBER SECURITY MEASURES, LOST REVENUES FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND LITIGATION. FURTHER,

CERTAIN OF VERIZONS BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONING OF SECURITY SOLUTIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLOUD SERVICES TO BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR OWN NETWORKS IS CALLED INTO QUESTION AS A

RESULT OF A CYBER ATTACK. IN ADDITION, IF WE FAIL TO PREVENT THE THEFT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION SUCH AS FINANCIAL DATA, SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT VERIZON AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE

CONFIDENTIAL DATA AGAINST BREACHES OF NETWORK OR IT SECURITY, IT COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT CUSTOMER AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORIST ACTS OR ACTS OF WAR COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO OUR

INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

INTERRUPTION BY NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER OUTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS, OTHER HOSTILE ACTS AND EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE UPON WHICH OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS RELY, RESULTING IN DEGRADATION

OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF THESE EVENTS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. OUR SYSTEM REDUNDANCY MAY BE

INEFFECTIVE OR INADEQUATE, AND OUR DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO DAMAGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE SUPPLIERS THAT PROVIDE US WITH THE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR

BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER EVENT CAUSING SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL DAMAGE COULD CAUSE US TO EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME AND EXPENDITURES TO RESUME OPERATIONS. IN

ADDITION, THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUES FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

VERIZONS DEBT HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND COULD INCREASE FURTHER IF VERIZON INCURS ADDITIONAL DEBT IN THE FUTURE AND DOES

NOT RETIRE EXISTING DEBT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, VERIZON HAD APPROXIMATELY $93.6 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING

INDEBTEDNESS, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY $6.1 BILLION OF UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER ITS EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY. SINCE THAT DATE, VERIZON HAS INCURRED $20.3 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND BECAME ENTITLED TO DRAW UPON AN ADDITIONAL $2

BILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER A 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT. VERIZONS DEBT LEVEL AND RELATED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING.



REQUIRING VERIZON TO DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON ITS DEBT AND

THE PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY THE ENTITY ACQUIRED FROM VODAFONE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDS VERIZON HAS AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS;

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS



MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT OR EXPENSIVE FOR VERIZON TO OBTAIN ANY NECESSARY FUTURE FINANCING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE

REQUIREMENTS, DEBT REFINANCING, ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER PURPOSES;



REDUCING VERIZONS FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR OR REACTING TO CHANGES IN ITS INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS;



MAKING VERIZON MORE VULNERABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN IN ITS BUSINESS; AND



EXPOSING VERIZON TO INCREASED INTEREST RATE RISK GIVEN THAT A PORTION OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES.

IN ADDITION, THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT VERIZON ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION

REQUIRES VERIZON TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVERAGE RATIO UNLESS VERIZONS CREDIT RATINGS ARE AT OR ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL, WHICH COULD LIMIT VERIZONS ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE.

ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING.

WE REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE FUND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS IN PART THROUGH BORROWINGS IN THE

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CREDIT MARKETS. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR REFINANCE EXISTING

INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON OUR PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CUSTOMARY CREDIT METRICS. A DECREASE

IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. A SEVERE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND

SUCH INSTABILITY COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING.

INCREASES IN COSTS FOR PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND

RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

WITH APPROXIMATELY

176,800 EMPLOYEES AND APPROXIMATELY 209,000 RETIREES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013 ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN VERIZONS BENEFIT PLANS, THE COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

PROFITABILITY. OUR COSTS OF MAINTAINING THESE PLANS, AND THE FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE PLANS, ARE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONTINUING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

AND THE HEALTH CARE EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS, DECREASES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS ON FUNDS HELD BY OUR PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS AND CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUR BENEFIT PLANS, THOSE COSTS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, AND WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS OR EXPERIENCE WORK

STOPPAGES AS A RESULT OF THE RENEGOTIATION OF OUR LABOR CONTRACTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, APPROXIMATELY 28% OF

OUR WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH LABOR UNIONS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 2,900 EMPLOYEES OF OUR WIRELINE BUSINESS, AND WE WILL ENGAGE IN ADDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS AS OTHER LABOR

CONTRACTS EXPIRE IN THE FUTURE. DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS, WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND/OR EXPERIENCE LENGTHY WORK STOPPAGES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CAUSING A LOSS OF REVENUE

AND STRAINED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY

SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES OR SETTLEMENTS.

OUR BUSINESS FACES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FROM TIME TO

TIME, PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS, ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS, WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTIONS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO OUR ADVERTISING, SALES, BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS ALSO FACES

PERSONAL INJURY AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATING TO ALLEGED HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIRELESS PHONES OR RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSMITTERS, AND CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT CHALLENGE MARKETING PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURES RELATING TO ALLEGED ADVERSE HEALTH

EFFECTS OF HANDHELD WIRELESS PHONES. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OR SETTLEMENTS.

SALES OF SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION MAY CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK TO FALL.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, VERIZON HAD APPROXIMATELY 2.86 BILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING. VERIZON ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 1.27

BILLION SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION. THE ISSUANCE OF THESE NEW SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DEPRESSING THE MARKET PRICE FOR VERIZON COMMON STOCK.

IN ADDITION, MANY VODAFONE SHAREHOLDERS ARE ALREADY SHAREHOLDERS OF VERIZON AND THOSE SHAREHOLDERS MAY DECIDE NOT TO HOLD THE ADDITIONAL

VERIZON SHARES THEY RECEIVED IN THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION. OTHER VODAFONE SHAREHOLDERS, SUCH AS FUNDS WITH GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATIONS ON THEIR PERMITTED INVESTMENTS, MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK THAT THEY RECEIVED IN THE

WIRELESS TRANSACTION. SUCH SALES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK COULD ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF DEPRESSING THE MARKET PRICE FOR VERIZON COMMON STOCK.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2010, THE U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (U.S. BANK), AS LITIGATION TRUSTEE FOR THE

IDEARC INC. LITIGATION TRUST (LITIGATION TRUST), FILED SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AGAINST VERIZON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES CHALLENGING THE NOVEMBER 2006 SPIN-OFF OF VERIZONS FORMER DIRECTORIES BUSINESS THEN

KNOWN AS IDEARC INC. U.S. BANK, WHICH REPRESENTS A GROUP OF CREDITORS WHO FILED CLAIMS IN IDEARCS BANKRUPTCY, ALLEGED THAT IDEARC WAS INSOLVENT AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF OR BECAME INSOLVENT SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE LITIGATION TRUST SOUGHT

OVER $9 BILLION IN DAMAGES. FOLLOWING A TWO-WEEK TRIAL IN OCTOBER 2012 LIMITED TO THE QUESTION OF THE VALUE OF IDEARC INC. ON THE DATE OF THE SPIN-OFF, ON JANUARY 22, 2013, THE COURT ISSUED A DECISION FINDING THAT THE VALUE WAS AT LEAST

$12 BILLION. AS $12 BILLION EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE DEBT AND CASH THAT IDEARC TRANSFERRED TO VERIZON ON THE DATE OF THE SPIN-OFF, THE COURT ISSUED A RELATED ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE DIRECTING THE LITIGATION TRUST TO SUBMIT A BRIEF THAT

EXPLAINS WHY ANY (OR ALL) OF ITS LEGAL CLAIMS ARE VIABLE IN LIGHT OF THE COURTS FINDING ON IDEARCS VALUE. IN ITS JUNE 18, 2013 DECISION, THE COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR VERIZON AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND RULED THAT U.S.

BANK WOULD TAKE NOTHING ON ITS CLAIMS. U.S. BANK APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, WHERE BRIEFING IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014.

ON OCTOBER 25, 2011, A LITIGATION TRUST CREATED DURING THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS OF FAIRPOINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. FILED A

COMPLAINT IN STATE COURT IN MECKLENBURG COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA, AGAINST VERIZON AND OTHER RELATED ENTITIES. THE COMPLAINT CLAIMS THAT FAIRPOINTS ACQUISITION OF VERIZONS LANDLINE OPERATIONS IN MAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND VERMONT IN MARCH

2008 WAS STRUCTURED AND CARRIED OUT IN A WAY THAT LEFT FAIRPOINT INSOLVENT OR LED TO ITS INSOLVENCY SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND ULTIMATELY TO ITS OCTOBER 2009 BANKRUPTCY. THE LITIGATION TRUST SEEKS APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION IN DAMAGES. VERIZON REMOVED THE

CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA IN NOVEMBER 2011. AT THE CLOSE OF DISCOVERY IN FEBRUARY 2012, VERIZON FILED A SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION TO DISMISS THE TWO COUNTS IN THE COMPLAINTCONSTRUCTIVE

FRAUDULENT TRANSFER AND ACTUAL FRAUDULENT TRANSFER. ON JUNE 12, 2013, THE COURT GRANTED VERIZONS SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION IN PART, DISMISSING THE LITIGATION TRUSTS CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUDULENT TRANSFER CLAIM. A TWO-WEEK BENCH TRIAL

LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL FRAUDULENT TRANSFER CLAIM CONCLUDED DECEMBER 15, 2013.

IN OCTOBER 2013, THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

GENERALS OFFICE NOTIFIED VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC. AND OTHER VERIZON COMPANIES OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE STATUTES PRIMARILY ARISING FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS, BATTERIES AND AEROSOL CANS AT

CERTAIN CALIFORNIA FACILITIES. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THIS INVESTIGATION AND CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR OPERATIONS RELATING TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. WHILE PENALTIES RELATING TO THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS COULD EXCEED $100,000, WE DO NOT EXPECT

THAT ANY PENALTIES ULTIMATELY INCURRED WILL BE MATERIAL.

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2011, THE BOARD APPROVED A SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WHICH AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF

UP TO 100 MILLION SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK TERMINATING NO LATER THAN THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 28, 2014. THE BOARD ALSO DETERMINED THAT NO ADDITIONAL SHARES WERE TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED BUYBACK

PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM PERMITS VERIZON TO REPURCHASE SHARES OVER TIME, WITH THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REPURCHASES DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CORPORATE NEEDS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO RULE 10B5-1 PLANS FROM TIME TO TIME TO FACILITATE

REPURCHASES OF ITS SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN PERMITS THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE SHARES AT TIMES WHEN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PREVENTED FROM DOING SO, PROVIDED THE PLAN IS ADOPTED WHEN THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2013, VERIZON DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT COULD BE PURCHASED BY OR ON BEHALF OF VERIZON UNDER OUR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WAS 96.5 MILLION.
