DOMESTIC TELECOM

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTING OUR WIRELINE

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS, PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 54% OF 2004 TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS PRESENTLY SERVE A TERRITORY CONSISTING OF 144.7 MILLION ACCESS LINE EQUIVALENTS IN 29 STATES AND WASHINGTON, D.C. THIS SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDES

LONG DISTANCE AND OTHER TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. DOMESTIC TELECOM PROVIDES MAINLY TWO TYPES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.



EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IS THE TRANSMISSION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMONG CUSTOMERS LOCATED WITHIN A LOCAL CALLING AREA WITHIN A LOCAL ACCESS AND

TRANSPORT AREA (LATA). EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INCLUDE SWITCHED LOCAL RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES, LOCAL PRIVATE LINE VOICE AND DATA SERVICES AND CENTREX SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE TOLL SERVICES WITHIN A LATA (INTRALATA

LONG DISTANCE) AND TOLL SERVICES OUTSIDE A LATA (INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE).



EXCHANGE ACCESS SERVICE LINKS A CUSTOMERS PREMISES AND THE TRANSMISSION FACILITIES OF OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS, GENERALLY INTERLATA CARRIERS.

EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE ACCESS SERVICES INCLUDE SWITCHED ACCESS AND SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES.

WE HAVE ORGANIZED OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT INTO FOUR MARKETING UNITS OPERATING ACROSS OUR TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES. THE UNITS FOCUS ON SPECIFIC MARKETS. WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE

CUSTOMER. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS REMAIN RESPONSIBLE WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE AREAS FOR THE PROVISION OF TELEPHONE SERVICES, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND REGULATORY MATTERS.

THE

ENTERPRISE

UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES TO LARGE BUSINESSES AND TO

DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES AND OFFICES OF THE EXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THESE SERVICES INCLUDE VOICE SWITCHING/PROCESSING SERVICES (E.G., DEDICATED PRIVATE LINES, CUSTOM CENTREX, CALL

MANAGEMENT AND VOICE MESSAGING), END-USER NETWORKING (E.G.,

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AND PERSONAL COMPUTER-BASED CONFERENCING, INCLUDING DATA AND VIDEO), INTERNETWORKING (ESTABLISHING LINKS BETWEEN THE

GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPARATE NETWORKS OF TWO OR MORE COMPANIES OR WITHIN THE SAME COMPANY), NETWORK OPTIMIZATION (DISASTER AVOIDANCE AND 911 SERVICE) AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. THE ENTERPRISE UNIT ALSO PROVIDES DATA TRANSMISSION, INTERNET AND

NETWORK INTEGRATION SERVICES, INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES, NETWORK MONITORING SERVICES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SALES TO MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES. REVENUES IN 2004 WERE APPROXIMATELY $6.4 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 17% OF

DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

THE

RETAIL

UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES WITHIN OUR TERRITORY, INCLUDING OUR LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES. OUR LONG DISTANCE SUBSIDIARY PROVIDES

NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICES IN ALL 50 STATES TO RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CALLING CARDS, 800/888 SERVICES AND OPERATOR SERVICES. THIS UNIT ALSO PROVIDES OPERATOR AND PAY TELEPHONE SERVICES AND SELLS CUSTOMER

PREMISES EQUIPMENT. REVENUES IN 2004 WERE APPROXIMATELY $22.3 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 58% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES. THESE REVENUES WERE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE PROVISION OF TELEPHONE SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL USERS.

THE

WHOLESALE

UNIT MARKETS OUR NETWORK OPERATIONS,

WHICH PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES OUR CARRIER ACCESS AND TELECOM INDUSTRY SERVICES. REVENUES IN 2004 WERE APPROXIMATELY $8.7 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 22% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES. APPROXIMATELY 66% OF TOTAL WHOLESALE

REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS (SWITCHED AND SPECIAL ACCESS). THE REMAINING REVENUES COME FROM OUR TELECOM INDUSTRY SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY FROM OTHER LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS WHICH RESELL NETWORK CONNECTIONS TO THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS.

THE

NETWORK

UNIT IS PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS NETWORKS. THIS UNIT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY AND SUPPLIES FOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND SELLS MATERIALS AND LOGISTIC SERVICES TO THIRD-PARTY

CARRIERS. REVENUES IN 2004 (AFTER ELIMINATIONS AND COMBINED WITH ALL OTHER DOMESTIC TELECOM REVENUES) WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 3% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996

THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 (THE 1996 ACT), REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL

ACTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO FEWER REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT DEFINITIVELY

THE IMPACT THAT THE ONGOING CHANGES IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FINANCIAL IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS

OF COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS, THE TIMING AND OUTCOME OF VARIOUS REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND ANY APPEALS, AND THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS OF OUR PURSUIT OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES RESULTING FROM THE 1996 ACT AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.

FCC REGULATION AND INTERSTATE RATES

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL

COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) WITH RESPECT TO INTERSTATE SERVICES AND RELATED MATTERS.

ACCESS CHARGES AND UNIVERSAL SERVICE

ON MAY 31, 2000, THE FCC ADOPTED THE COALITION FOR AFFORDABLE LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE SERVICES (CALLS) PLAN AS A COMPREHENSIVE FIVE-YEAR PLAN FOR REGULATION OF INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGES. THE CALLS PLAN HAS THREE MAIN

COMPONENTS. FIRST, IT ESTABLISHES A PORTABLE INTERSTATE ACCESS UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT OF $650 MILLION FOR THE INDUSTRY. THIS EXPLICIT SUPPORT REPLACES IMPLICIT SUPPORT EMBEDDED IN INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGES. SECOND, THE PLAN SIMPLIFIES THE

PATCHWORK OF COMMON LINE CHARGES INTO ONE SUBSCRIBER LINE CHARGE (SLC) AND PROVIDES FOR DE-AVERAGING OF THE SLC BY ZONES AND CLASS OF CUSTOMERS IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT UNDERMINE COMPARABLE AND AFFORDABLE UNIVERSAL SERVICE. THIRD, THE PLAN SETS

INTO PLACE A MECHANISM TO TRANSITION TO A SET TARGET OF $.0055 PER MINUTE FOR SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES. ONCE THAT TARGET RATE IS REACHED, LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO MAKE FURTHER ANNUAL PRICE CAP REDUCTIONS TO THEIR SWITCHED

ACCESS PRICES. THE ANNUAL REDUCTIONS LEADING TO THE TARGET RATE, AS WELL AS ANNUAL REDUCTIONS FOR THE SUBSET OF SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO PRICE CAP REGULATION WAS SET AT 6.5% PER YEAR.

AS A RESULT OF TARIFF ADJUSTMENTS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2003,

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR SWITCHED ACCESS LINES REACHED THE $.0055 BENCHMARK. ON JUNE 29, 2004, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT UPHELD THE FCCS PRIOR APPROVAL OF AN INCREASE IN THE SLC CAP. THE CURRENT CAP IS $6.50.

THE FCC PREVIOUSLY INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS OF THE INTERSTATE ACCESS RATES

CHARGED BY VERIZONS LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES DURING THE 1993 TO 1996 TARIFF YEARS UNDER THE PRICE CAP RULES THAT WERE IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CALLS PLAN. ON JULY 30, 2004, THE FCC RELEASED AN ORDER RESOLVING ONE OF THE ISSUES IN

THOSE PENDING INVESTIGATIONS, AND CONCLUDED THAT SOME OF VERIZONS LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES HAD INCORRECTLY CALCULATED THE IMPACT OF THEIR OBLIGATION TO SHARE A PORTION OF THEIR EARNINGS ABOVE CERTAIN PRESCRIBED LEVELS WITH THEIR

ACCESS CUSTOMERS. THE AMOUNT OF ANY REFUND AS A RESULT OF THAT FINDING WILL BE DETERMINED IN A FURTHER PHASE OF THE PROCEEDING. OTHER ISSUES REMAIN UNDER INVESTIGATION.

THE FCC HAS ADOPTED RULES FOR SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES THAT PROVIDE FOR PRICING FLEXIBILITY AND ULTIMATELY THE REMOVAL OF

SERVICES FROM PRICE REGULATION WHEN PRESCRIBED COMPETITIVE THRESHOLDS ARE MET. APPROXIMATELY 55% OF SPECIAL ACCESS REVENUES ARE NOW REMOVED FROM PRICE REGULATION.

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC ADOPTED A NEW MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT TO HIGH-COST

AREAS SERVED BY LARGE LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES. THIS FUNDING MECHANISM PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICES IN SEVERAL STATES SERVED BY OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS. THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY THE NEW FCC ACCESS CHARGE

PLAN DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON OCTOBER 16, 2003, IN RESPONSE TO A PREVIOUS COURT DECISION, THE FCC ANNOUNCED A DECISION PROVIDING ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS NON-RURAL HIGH-COST UNIVERSAL SUPPORT MECHANISM AND MODIFYING IT IN PART. THAT DECISION ALSO

HAS BEEN APPEALED. THE FCC ALSO HAS PROCEEDINGS UNDERWAY TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE CHANGES TO ITS CURRENT RULES FOR ASSESSING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND. ANY CHANGE IN THE CURRENT ASSESSMENT MECHANISM COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE

CONTRIBUTION THAT LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES MUST MAKE AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS.

UNBUNDLING OF NETWORK ELEMENTS

ON FEBRUARY 20, 2003, THE FCC ANNOUNCED A DECISION ADOPTING NEW RULES DEFINING THE OBLIGATIONS OF INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS TO PROVIDE COMPETING CARRIERS WITH ACCESS TO UNBUNDLED NETWORK ELEMENTS (UNES). THE DECISION WAS THE

CULMINATION OF AN FCC RULEMAKING REFERRED TO AS ITS TRIENNIAL REVIEW OF ITS UNE RULES, AND ALSO WAS IN RESPONSE TO A DECISION BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT THAT HAD OVERTURNED THE FCCS PREVIOUS UNBUNDLING RULES.

THE TEXT OF THE ORDER AND ACCOMPANYING RULES WERE RELEASED ON AUGUST 21,

2003. WITH RESPECT TO BROADBAND FACILITIES, SUCH AS MASS MARKET FIBER TO THE PREMISES LOOPS AND PACKET SWITCHING, THAT ORDER GENERALLY REMOVED UNBUNDLING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 251 OF THE 1996 ACT. WITH RESPECT TO NARROWBAND SERVICES, THE ORDER

GENERALLY LEFT UNBUNDLING OBLIGATIONS IN PLACE, WITH CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, AND DELEGATED TO STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS A FURTHER REVIEW. THE ORDER ALSO PROVIDED A NEW SET OF CRITERIA RELATING TO WHEN CARRIERS MAY PURCHASE A COMBINATION OF

UNBUNDLED LOOPS AND TRANSPORT ELEMENTS KNOWN AS ENHANCED EXTENDED LOOPS (EELS) THAT INCREASED ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR CARRIERS TO USE EELS PURCHASED AT ARTIFICIALLY LOW REGULATED UNE RATES RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE SPECIAL

ACCESS PRICES.

MULTIPLE PARTIES, INCLUDING VERIZON, APPEALED

VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE DECISION. ON MARCH 2, 2004, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT ISSUED AN ORDER UPHOLDING THE FCC IN PART, AND OVERTURNING ITS ORDER IN PART. THE COURT UPHELD THE FCC WITH RESPECT TO BROADBAND FACILITIES. ON THE

NARROWBAND UNBUNDLING REQUIREMENTS, THE COURT REVERSED AND VACATED KEY ASPECTS OF THE FCC DECISION THAT HAD REQUIRED UNBUNDLED ACCESS TO MASS MARKET SWITCHING AND HIGH CAPACITY TRANSMISSION FACILITIES. THE COURTS ORDER VACATING THOSE ASPECTS

OF THE FCCS RULES WENT INTO EFFECT ON JUNE 16, 2004, AND PETITIONS BY VARIOUS PARTIES TO OBTAIN A STAY OR U.S. SUPREME COURT REVIEW WERE DENIED.

ON AUGUST 20, 2004, THE FCC ISSUED INTERIM NARROWBAND UNBUNDLING RULES AND A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING TO ESTABLISH NEW UNBUNDLING RULES. IN THE

INTERIM RULES ORDER, THE FCC REQUIRED INCUMBENT CARRIERS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING, FOR SIX MONTHS FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ITS ORDER, UNBUNDLED MASS MARKET SWITCHING AND HIGH CAPACITY TRANSMISSION FACILITIES ON THE SAME TERMS THAT THEY WERE AVAILABLE

UNDER INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS AS OF JUNE 15, 2004. VERIZON AND OTHER PARTIES PETITIONED THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS TO OVERTURN THE INTERIM RULES. AT THE REQUEST OF THE FCC, THE COURT HELD THE PETITION IN

ABEYANCE WHILE THE FCC RULEMAKING PROCEEDED AND DIRECTED THE PARTIES TO REPORT ON THE STATUS OF THE FCC PROCEEDINGS NO LATER THAN JANUARY 4, 2005. ON JANUARY 4, 2005, VERIZON AND OTHER PARTIES ASKED THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT TO

RETAIN JURISDICTION ON THE PENDING MANDAMUS PETITION AND TO PROVIDE FURTHER BRIEFING UPON THE RELEASE OF THE FCC ORDER.

ON FEBRUARY 4, 2005, THE FCC RELEASED A DECISION ON NEW UNBUNDLING RULES. THE FCC ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT TO UNBUNDLE MASS MARKET LOCAL SWITCHING ON A

NATIONWIDE BASIS, WITH THE OBLIGATION TO ACCEPT NEW ORDERS ENDING AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE ORDER (MARCH 11, 2005). THE FCC ALSO ESTABLISHED A ONE YEAR TRANSITION FOR EXISTING UNE SWITCHING ARRANGEMENTS. FOR HIGH CAPACITY TRANSMISSION

FACILITIES, THE FCC ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING WHETHER HIGH CAPACITY LOOPS, TRANSPORT OR DARK FIBER TRANSPORT MUST BE UNBUNDLED IN INDIVIDUAL WIRE CENTERS, AND STATED THAT THESE STANDARDS WERE ONLY EXPECTED TO AFFECT A SMALL NUMBER OF WIRE

CENTERS. THE FCC ALSO ELIMINATED THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE DARK FIBER LOOPS AND FOUND THAT THERE IS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE UNES EXCLUSIVELY FOR WIRELESS OR LONG DISTANCE SERVICE. IN ANY INSTANCE WHERE A PARTICULAR HIGH CAPACITY FACILITY NO LONGER

HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE AS A UNE, THE FCC ESTABLISHED A SIMILAR ONE YEAR TRANSITION FOR ANY EXISTING HIGH CAPACITY LOOP OR TRANSPORT UNES, AND AN 18 MONTH TRANSITION FOR ANY EXISTING DARK FIBER UNES.

SEPARATELY, THE FCC HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CLARIFY ITS RULES FOR BROADBAND

FACILITIES IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS OF VARIOUS PARTIES. VERIZON PETITIONED THE FCC TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ANY BROADBAND FACILITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE TO BE UNBUNDLED UNDER SECTION 251 OF THE 1996 ACT ALSO DO NOT HAVE TO BE UNBUNDLED UNDER ANOTHER PROVISION

OF THE 1996 ACT, SPECIFICALLY SECTION 271. ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE FCC GRANTED THAT PETITION, AND THE FCCS DECISION HAS BEEN APPEALED BY VARIOUS PARTIES. IN ADDITION, THE FCC HAS CLARIFIED THAT MASS MARKET FIBER TO THE CURB LOOPS QUALIFY FOR

THE SAME REGULATORY TREATMENT AS MASS MARKET FIBER TO THE PREMISES LOOPS, THAT FIBER LOOPS TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN MULTIPLE UNIT BUILDINGS ALSO QUALIFY FOR THAT SAME REGULATORY TREATMENT AS LONG AS THE BUILDING IS PREDOMINANTLY RESIDENTIAL, AND THAT

CARRIERS THAT DEPLOY NEW BROADBAND NETWORK FACILITIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO EQUIP THOSE FACILITIES WITH LEGACY CAPABILITIES THAT COULD RENDER THEM SUBJECT TO UNBUNDLING.

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION

THE FCC HAS AN ONGOING RULEMAKING THAT COULD FUNDAMENTALLY RESTRUCTURE THE REGULATORY REGIME FOR INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

ACCESS CHARGES, COMPENSATION FOR INTERNET TRAFFIC, AND RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL TRAFFIC. TO DATE, SEVERAL PARTIES AND COALITIONS HAVE SUBMITTED ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS TO THE FCC FOR RESTRUCTURING THE INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION RULES, AND THE

FCC HAS STATED THAT IT INTENDS TO CONDUCT FURTHER PROCEEDINGS TO EVALUATE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES.

THE FCC ALSO HAS PENDING BEFORE IT ISSUES RELATING TO INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION FOR DIAL-UP INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC. THE FCC PREVIOUSLY FOUND THIS TRAFFIC IS NOT SUBJECT TO RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION

UNDER SECTION 251(B)(5) OF THE 1996 ACT. INSTEAD, THE FCC ESTABLISHED FEDERAL RATES PER MINUTE FOR THIS TRAFFIC THAT DECLINED FROM $.0015 TO $.0007 OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, ESTABLISHED CAPS ON THE TOTAL MINUTES OF THIS TRAFFIC SUBJECT TO

COMPENSATION IN A STATE, AND REQUIRED INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS TO OFFER TO BOTH BILL AND PAY RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL TRAFFIC AT

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SAME RATE AS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC. ON MAY 3, 2002, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT REJECTED PART OF THE

FCCS RATIONALE, BUT DECLINED TO VACATE THE ORDER WHILE IT IS ON REMAND. AS A RESULT, PENDING FURTHER ACTION BY THE FCC, THE FCCS UNDERLYING ORDER REMAINS IN EFFECT. ON OCTOBER 8, 2004, THE FCC ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD DENIED A PETITION TO

DISCONTINUE THE $.0007 RATE CAP ON THIS TRAFFIC, BUT HAD DECIDED TO REMOVE THE CAPS ON THE TOTAL MINUTES OF INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC SUBJECT TO COMPENSATION. THAT DECISION IS THE SUBJECT OF AN APPEAL BY SEVERAL PARTIES. DISPUTES ALSO REMAIN PENDING IN

A NUMBER OF FORUMS RELATING TO THE APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION FOR INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC DURING PREVIOUS PERIODS UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER CARRIERS.

THE FCC ALSO IS CONSIDERING MULTIPLE PETITIONS ASKING IT TO DECLARE WHETHER, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES, SERVICES THAT

EMPLOY INTERNET PROTOCOL ARE SUBJECT TO ACCESS CHARGES UNDER CURRENT LAW, OR ASKING IT TO FORBEAR FROM ANY REQUIREMENT TO PAY ACCESS CHARGES ON SOME SUCH SERVICES. ON MARCH 10, 2004, THE FCC INITIATED A RULEMAKING PROCEEDING TO ADDRESS THE

REGULATION OF SERVICES THAT USE INTERNET PROTOCOL, INCLUDING VOICE SERVICES. THE FCC ALSO CONCLUDED IN RESPONSE TO ONE SUCH PETITION THAT ONE PROVIDERS PEER-TO-PEER INTERNET PROTOCOL SERVICE THAT DOES NOT USE THE PUBLIC SWITCHED NETWORK IS AN

INTERSTATE INFORMATION SERVICE AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO ACCESS CHARGES. DURING APRIL 2004, THE FCC ISSUED AN ORDER IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER SUCH PETITION THAT STATED THAT THE PETITIONING COMPANYS SERVICE THAT UTILIZES INTERNET PROTOCOL FOR ONLY

ONE INTERMEDIATE PART OF A CALLS TRANSMISSION IS A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE SUBJECT TO ACCESS CHARGES. THE FCC ALSO HAS A STATUTORY DEADLINE OF MARCH 22, 2005 TO ADDRESS A THIRD PETITION ASKING IT TO FORBEAR FROM APPLYING ACCESS CHARGES TO

VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL SERVICES THAT ARE TERMINATED ON SWITCHED LOCAL EXCHANGE NETWORKS.

BROADBAND SERVICES

THE

FCC HAS SEVERAL ONGOING RULEMAKINGS CONSIDERING THE REGULATORY TREATMENT OF BROADBAND SERVICES. AMONG THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE ARE WHETHER TO REQUIRE LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES LIKE VERIZON TO OFFER SUCH SERVICES AS A COMMON CARRIER OR WHETHER SUCH

SERVICES MAY BE OFFERED UNDER A LESS REGULATED PRIVATE CARRIAGE ARRANGEMENT, UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS LARGELY DEREGULATED INFORMATION SERVICES, AND WHETHER TO DECLARE BROADBAND SERVICES

OFFERED BY LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES AS NON-DOMINANT AND WHAT THE EFFECT SHOULD BE OF ANY SUCH CLASSIFICATION.

STATE REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES

STATE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS REGULATE OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTRASTATE RATES AND SERVICES AND OTHER MATTERS. IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THE TELEPHONE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE RATE OF

RETURN REGULATION WITH PRICE REGULATION PLANS.

VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC.

ARIZONA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN ARIZONA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

CALIFORNIA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE OPERATED UNDER THE

NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (NRF) SINCE 1990. THE NRF ALLOWS FOR A GRADUAL TRANSITION TO LESS REGULATION ON A SERVICE-BY-SERVICE BASIS. THE NRF IS REVIEWED EVERY THREE YEARS AND CURRENTLY HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES.



EARNINGS CEILING: THE CEILING IS SUSPENDED.



PRICE CAP INDEX: BY SETTING INFLATION EQUAL TO PRODUCTIVITY, THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (CPUC) HAS SUSPENDED THE PRICE CAP INDEX. LIMITED

EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE ALLOWED. GENERALLY, EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE CHANGES UNIQUE TO OR SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO A COMPANY THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL (IN THIS CASE, CHANGES ARE PERMITTED ONLY FOR MATTERS MANDATED BY THE CPUC OR CHANGES IN TOTAL

INTRASTATE COST RECOVERY RESULTING FROM CHANGES BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE JURISDICTIONS).



PRICE FLEXIBILITY: SERVICES FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES.



CATEGORY I SERVICES CANNOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT CPUC APPROVAL.



CATEGORY II SERVICES ARE PARTIALLY COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE ADJUSTED WITHIN A CEILING/FLOOR RANGE. THE CURRENT PRICE (EFFECTIVELY THE CEILING) CANNOT BE INCREASED

WITHOUT A FORMAL APPLICATION.



CATEGORY III SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED ON SHORT NOTICE.



NEW SERVICES: NEW SERVICES CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS CATEGORY II OR III. IF INTRODUCED AS CATEGORY III, VERIZON CALIFORNIA MUST DEMONSTRATE INSIGNIFICANT MARKET

POWER.

THE CPUC WILL REVIEW NRF FEATURES

DURING 2005  2006.

NEVADA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN NEVADA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VERIZON DELAWARE INC.

SINCE 1994, VERIZON DELAWARE HAS BEEN REGULATED UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE REGULATION PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT ACT

OF 1993 (DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT). ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2003, THE DELAWARE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVED A STIPULATION PERMITTING VERIZON DELAWARE TO CONTINUE TO BE REGULATED UNDER THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2006.

THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING.



THE PRICES OF BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICES (E.G., DIAL-TONE AND LOCAL USAGE) WILL REMAIN REGULATED AND CANNOT CHANGE IN ANY ONE YEAR BY MORE THAN THE

GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT  PRICE INDEX (GDP-PI) LESS 3%.



THE PRICES OF DISCRETIONARY SERVICES (E.G., IDENTA RING(SM) AND CALL WAITING) CANNOT INCREASE MORE THAN 15% PER YEAR PER SERVICE.



THE PRICES OF COMPETITIVE SERVICES (E.G., VOICE MESSAGING AND MESSAGE TOLL SERVICE) ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TARIFF OR REGULATION.



VERIZON DELAWARE WILL DEVELOP A TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT PLAN WITH A COMMITMENT TO INVEST A MINIMUM OF $250 MILLION IN DELAWARES TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK

DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE PLAN.

VERIZON FLORIDA

INC.

FLORIDA STATUTES GOVERN THE PRICE CAP PLAN.

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2001, VERIZON FLORIDA WAS ABLE TO RAISE BASIC LOCAL RATES ON 30 DAYS NOTICE ONCE IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED THE GDP-PI LESS 1%. VERIZON FLORIDA MAY INCREASE RATES FOR NON-BASIC SERVICES BUT INCREASES FOR ANY CATEGORY

CANNOT EXCEED 6% IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD UNLESS ANOTHER COMPANY IS PROVIDING SERVICE IN A GIVEN EXCHANGE, AT WHICH TIME VERIZON FLORIDA CAN INCREASE ITS PRICE UP TO 20% IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED. LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN 2003

THAT ALLOWS VERIZON FLORIDA TO OFFSET A REDUCTION IN INTRASTATE ACCESS RATES WITH AN INCREASE IN BASIC LOCAL EXCHANGE REVENUES UPON FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (FPSC) APPROVAL. THE OFFSET MUST BE REVENUE NEUTRAL AND TAKE PLACE OVER TWO TO FOUR

YEARS. IN EVALUATING THE PETITION, THE FPSC IS TO CONSIDER WHETHER GRANTING THE PETITION WILL REMOVE CURRENT SUPPORT FOR BASIC LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PREVENTING THE CREATION OF A MORE ATTRACTIVE COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKET FOR THE

BENEFIT OF RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS AND ENHANCED MARKET ENTRY. WHEN VERIZON FLORIDAS RATES ARE REDUCED TO PARITY AS DEFINED BY THE STATUTE, VERIZON FLORIDAS BASIC SERVICES BECOME SUBJECT TO THE SAME REGULATORY TREATMENT AS ITS NON-BASIC

SERVICES.

VERIZON HAWAII INC.

VERIZON HAWAIIS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

VERIZON MARYLAND INC.

IN 1996, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND APPROVED A PRICE CAP PLAN

FOR REGULATING THE INTRASTATE SERVICES PROVIDED BY VERIZON MARYLAND. UNDER THE PLAN, SERVICES ARE DIVIDED INTO SIX CATEGORIES: ACCESS; BASIC-RESIDENTIAL; BASIC-BUSINESS; DISCRETIONARY; COMPETITIVE; AND MISCELLANEOUS. RATES FOR ACCESS,

BASIC-RESIDENTIAL, BASIC-BUSINESS AND DISCRETIONARY SERVICES CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED ANNUALLY UNDER A FORMULA THAT IS BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE GDP-PI MINUS A PRODUCTIVITY OFFSET BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE RATE OF INFLATION AS REFLECTED IN THE

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. RATES FOR COMPETITIVE SERVICES MAY BE INCREASED WITHOUT REGULATORY LIMITS. REGULATION OF PROFITS IS ELIMINATED. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN. VERIZON MARYLAND

HAS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE THE PRICE CAP FORMULA AND TO MOVE ALL BUSINESS SERVICES INTO THE COMPETITIVE CATEGORY.

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND INC.

MAINE

IN JUNE 2001, THE MAINE PUBLIC UTILITIES

COMMISSION (MPUC) ORDERED THE CONTINUATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF REGULATION (AFOR) FOR VERIZON MAINE FOR A SECOND FIVE-YEAR TERM.

THE MAINE PUBLIC ADVOCATE APPEALED THE MPUCS 2001 AFOR DECISION TO THE MAINE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT, CLAIMING THAT ANY EXTENSION TO THE AFOR MUST BE

PRECEDED BY AN INVESTIGATION OF VERIZON MAINES COSTS AND EARNINGS UTILIZING TRADITIONAL RATE OF RETURN PRINCIPLES. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2003, THE COURT RULED THAT WHILE STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT TELEPHONE RATES UNDER AN AFOR ARE NO HIGHER THAN UNDER

RATE OF RETURN REGULATION, THE MPUC HAS BROAD DISCRETION IN MAKING SUCH A DETERMINATION THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE A FULL RATE OF RETURN INQUIRY. HOWEVER, THE COURT VACATED AND REMANDED THE DECISION TO THE MPUC FOR ITS FAILURE TO EXPRESSLY

MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE THAT IF SUCH A SHOWING CANNOT BE MADE, THAT IT NONETHELESS REMAINS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF RATEPAYERS TO PROCEED WITH AN AFOR. NO CHANGE IN ANY OF VERIZON MAINES RATES WAS REQUIRED BY THE

COURTS DECISION WHILE THE REMAND PROCEEDING WAS PENDING.

IN MARCH 2003, THE MPUC OPENED A PROCEEDING TO ADDRESS THE MAINE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURTS REMAND OF THE 2001 AFOR DECISION. IN AN ORDER ISSUED ON JULY 11, 2003, THE MPUC RULED THAT IT WOULD KEEP IN PLACE THE $1.78 INCREASE IN VERIZON

NEW ENGLANDS MONTHLY BASIC EXCHANGE RATES PENDING COMPLETION OF THE REMAND AND MAINTAIN CERTAIN ELEMENTS (PRICING FLEXIBILITY, SERVICE QUALITY INDEX) OF THE PROPOSED AFOR ON AN INTERIM BASIS UNTIL A FINAL DECISION ON THE REMAND. ON SEPTEMBER

25, 2003, THE PUC ISSUED AN ORDER REINSTATING THE AFOR AND THAT ORDER WAS APPEALED. ON JANUARY 26, 2005, THE MAINE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT VACATED THE MPUC ORDER AND REMANDED THE CASE FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COURT HELD THAT THE MPUC DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT IT ENSURE THAT LOCAL RATES UNDER AN AFOR WILL NOT BE HIGHER THAN

UNDER TRADITIONAL RATE OF RETURN.

MASSACHUSETTS

IN APRIL 2001, VERIZON NEW ENGLAND

FILED WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY (DTE) A PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN TO REPLACE THE PRICE REGULATION PLAN THAT WAS TO EXPIRE IN AUGUST 2001. ON MAY 8, 2002, THE DTE ISSUED ITS DECISION IN PHASE I OF

THE CASE IN WHICH IT FOUND THAT VERIZON NEW ENGLAND HAD DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENT COMPETITION FOR MOST OF ITS RETAIL BUSINESS SERVICES AND GRANTED VERIZON NEW ENGLAND PRICING FLEXIBILITY ON THE SERVICES. PRICE INCREASES ARE NOT

CONSTRAINED. PRICE DECREASES ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLOOR REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DTE RULED THAT VERIZON NEW ENGLAND SHOULD REDUCE STATE SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES TO INTERSTATE LEVELS ON A REVENUE NEUTRAL BASIS BY INCREASES IN RESIDENCE DIAL-TONE

RATES. WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENCE SERVICES, THE DTE TENTATIVELY CONCLUDED THAT VERIZON NEW ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR NON-BASIC SERVICES BUT THAT INCREASES IN BASIC SERVICES SHOULD BE LIMITED. THE DTE DIRECTED VERIZON NEW ENGLAND TO

FILE PROPOSALS CONSISTENT WITH ITS FINDINGS.

IN MAY 2003, THE

DTE ISSUED A FINAL RULING APPROVING WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS COMPLIANCE FILING IMPLEMENTING THE DTES ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN. THE PLAN GIVES VERIZON NEW ENGLAND PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR MOST RETAIL BUSINESS

SERVICES AND RESIDENCE NON-BASIC SERVICES, INCLUDING SECOND DIAL-TONE LINES. THE DTE ALSO APPROVED RATE REDUCTIONS FOR STATE SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES TO INTERSTATE LEVELS WITH OFFSETTING REVENUE-NEUTRAL INCREASES IN RESIDENCE DIAL-TONE RATES. THOSE

RATE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JUNE 1, 2003.

NEW HAMPSHIRE

VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS OPERATIONS

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION. ON JANUARY 16, 2004, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (NHPUC) CONCLUDED A COMPREHENSIVE PROCEEDING EXAMINING THE APPROPRIATE COST OF CAPITAL FOR VERIZON. IN ITS ORDER,

THE NHPUC SET THE AVERAGE WEIGHTED COST OF CAPITAL FOR VERIZON AT 8.2%. AT PRESENT, THE NEWLY DETERMINED COST OF CAPITAL HAS NO EFFECT ON VERIZONS RETAIL REVENUES. THE NHPUC DIRECTED VERIZON TO FILE REVISED UNE RATES REFLECTING THIS NEW COST

DETERMINATION BY MARCH 16, 2004. VERIZONS CURRENT UNE RATES WERE APPROVED IN 2001 RELYING UPON AN AVERAGE WEIGHTED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10.46%. VERIZON FILED AN APPEAL OF THE NHPUC DECISION IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE

NHPUCS ORDER TO FILE NEW UNE RATES WAS STAYED BY STIPULATION DURING THE APPEAL. A DECISION BY THE COURT IS PENDING. ON JULY 9, 2004, THE NHPUC ISSUED AN ORDER FINDING THE EXISTING DIRECTORY LICENSING AGREEMENT BETWEEN VERIZON NEW ENGLAND AND

ITS AFFILIATED YELLOW PAGES COMPANY TO BE UNREASONABLE AS IT DID NOT INCLUDE A DIRECTORY REVENUE SHARING PROVISION. AS A RESULT, THE NHPUC DIRECTED THAT VERIZON IMPUTE $23.3 MILLION FOR PURPOSES OF INTRASTATE RATEMAKING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. ON OCTOBER

19, 2004, THE NHPUC ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING VERIZONS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE DECISION. AT PRESENT, THE NHPUC RULING REGARDING IMPUTATION HAS NO EFFECT ON VERIZONS RETAIL RATES. VERIZON HAS FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE NEW HAMPSHIRE

SUPREME COURT.

RHODE ISLAND

PURSUANT TO A DIRECTIVE OF THE RHODE ISLAND PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

(RIPUC), VERIZON RHODE ISLAND FILED IN JULY 2002 A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW ALTERNATIVE REGULATION PLAN TO REPLACE THE EXISTING PRICE CAP PLAN THAT WAS TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2002. FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN THE CASE, VERIZON RHODE

ISLAND AND THE RHODE ISLAND DIVISION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES AND CARRIERS (DIVISION) FILED A STIPULATION ON DECEMBER 6, 2002 RESOLVING ALL ISSUES IN THE CASE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE STIPULATED PLAN ARE.



NO INDEX OR PRICE CAP FORMULA;



PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL BUSINESS SERVICES, SUBJECT TO A LONG-RUN INCREMENTAL COST (LRIC)-BASED PRICE FLOOR;



THE COMPANY MAY INCREASE RESIDENTIAL BASIC EXCHANGE RATES BY $1 PER YEAR IN YEARS ONE AND TWO. AN ADDITIONAL $1 INCREASE IN YEAR THREE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RIPUC

AND DIVISION REVIEW;



THE COMPANY MAY PASS THROUGH EXOGENOUS CHANGES, SUBJECT TO A $2.5 MILLION ANNUAL CAP, BUT MUST ABSORB THE FIRST $1 MILLION IN EXOGENOUS CHANGES IN THE YEAR IN

WHICH APPROVAL IS SOUGHT;



THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE ITS VOLUNTARY FUNDING OF A DISCOUNT PROGRAM FOR INTERNET ACCESS FOR SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES AT UP TO $2 MILLION PER YEAR UNTIL THE

EARLIER OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, OR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM (E.G., LEGISLATION);



THE CURRENT RETAIL SERVICE QUALITY PLAN IS MAINTAINED WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS; AND



THE TERM OF THE PLAN IS THREE YEARS.

AFTER FURTHER HEARING AND BRIEFING, THE RIPUC APPROVED THE STIPULATION AT AN OPEN MEETING ON JANUARY 10, 2003, WITH TWO MODIFICATIONS. FIRST, THE RIPUC

IMPOSED LIMITS ON PRICE INCREASES FOR ALL OTHER NON-BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AS FOLLOWS.

FOR SERVICES PRICED AT $5 OR LESS, RATES MAY INCREASE 15% PER YEAR

FOR SERVICES PRICED AT $5.01 TO $10, RATES MAY INCREASE 10% PER YEAR

FOR SERVICES PRICED OVER $10, RATES MAY INCREASE 5% PER YEAR

SECOND, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FILE QUARTERLY REPORTS SHOWING FOR EACH WIRE CENTER IN THE STATE THE

NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES SERVED BY THE COMPANY AND THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF ACCESS LINES SERVED BY COMPETITORS. ON MARCH 31, 2003, THE RIPUC ISSUED AN ORDER ADOPTING THE MODIFIED STIPULATION APPROVED ON JANUARY 10, 2003.

VERMONT

IN 2000, THE VERMONT PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD APPROVED A FIVE-YEAR INCENTIVE

REGULATION PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE VERIZON NEW ENGLAND WITH INCREASED FLEXIBILITY TO INTRODUCE AND PRICE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE PLAN ALSO REMOVES MOST RESTRICTIONS ON VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS EARNINGS FROM VERMONT OPERATIONS DURING THE LIFE

OF THE PLAN AND CONTAINS NO PRODUCTIVITY ADJUSTMENT. THE PLAN LIMITS VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES ON EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND REQUIRES REVENUE REDUCTIONS OF $16.5 MILLION AT THE OUTSET OF THE PLAN, $6.5 MILLION

DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PLAN AND APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION OVER THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF THE PLAN. THE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES SOME SERVICE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL PENALTY. IN MAY 2004, THE VERMONT PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD OPENED A

PROCEEDING TO CONSIDER THE FORM OF REGULATION FOR VERIZON FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF THE CURRENT PLAN. THE VERMONT PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A DECISION BY JULY 2005.

VERIZON NEW JERSEY INC.

THE 1992 NEW JERSEY TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT CLASSIFIES TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AS COMPETITIVE OR PROTECTED. PROTECTED

TELEPHONE SERVICES INCLUDE BASIC RESIDENCE, TOUCH-TONE, ACCESS SERVICES OTHER THAN THOSE OTHERWISE DEEMED COMPETITIVE BY THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITIES (NJBPU), BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH FOUR LINES OR LESS, AND THE

ORDERING, INSTALLATION AND RESTORATION OF THESE SERVICES. VERIZON NEW JERSEY PROVIDES PROTECTED TELEPHONE SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING VERTICAL SERVICES (RATE-REGULATED SERVICES), UNDER A PLAN FOR ALTERNATIVE FORM OF

REGULATION, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2002, PURSUANT TO A DECISION ANNOUNCED BY THE NJBPU ON JUNE 19, 2002 AND ISSUED AUGUST 19, 2003. THE NEW PLAN ELIMINATES EARNINGS REGULATION, ELIMINATES EARNINGS SHARING PROVISIONS, STREAMLINES THE

PROCESS TO INTRODUCE NEW SERVICES AND STRENGTHENS COMMITMENTS TO SERVICE QUALITY, LIFELINE SERVICE AND SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. A PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE PLAN WAS FILED BY AN OPPOSING PARTY. ADDITIONALLY, A VERIZON NEW JERSEY

PETITION TO LOWER THE COMPETITIVE THRESHOLD FOR BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS WITH LESS THAN TWO LINES IS PENDING BEFORE THE NJBPU, WITH A RULING EXPECTED ON OR BEFORE MARCH 31, 2005.

VERIZON NEW YORK INC.

NEW YORK

THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (NYSPSC) ADOPTED AN INCENTIVE PLAN TO REGULATE THE SERVICES OF VERIZON NEW YORK, EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2002. THE

PLAN EXPIRED IN 2004, EXCEPT THAT THE SERVICE QUALITY PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN WILL EXPIRE IN 2005. THE PLAN ESTABLISHES STATE-WIDE SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS IF VERIZON FAILS TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS. VERIZON

NEW YORK WILL COMPLETE ITS TRANSITION TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES IN MARCH 2005. VERIZON NEW YORKS RATES ARE PROPOSED BY THE COMPANY BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE SERVICE AND THE COMPANYS UNDERLYING COSTS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE NYSPSC.

CONNECTICUT

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITY CONTROL ADOPTED AN INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN PROPOSED BY VERIZON NEW YORK, WHICH ELIMINATES

REGULATION OF EARNINGS AND PROVIDES OTHER DEREGULATORY BENEFITS FOR VERIZON NEW YORKS OPERATIONS IN CONNECTICUT.

VERIZON NORTH INC.

ILLINOIS

VERIZON NORTHS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN ILLINOIS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION. OPTIONAL TOLL PLANS, INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK

(ISDN), FRAME RELAY, PAYPHONES, CENTRANET, AND OTHER DATA SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED DEREGULATED AND HAVE TOTAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY.

DEPRECIATION RATES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO APPROVAL. THE PLAN HAS A THREE AND ONE-HALF YEAR TERM.

MICHIGAN

SINCE THE MICHIGAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT WAS PASSED IN 1991, A FORM OF REGULATION THAT FOCUSES ON SERVICES, PRICES AND COSTS HAS REPLACED RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED. ALL RATES FOR REGULATED SERVICES MUST MEET A COST FLOOR. VERIZON NORTH MAY INCREASE LOCAL RATES ANNUALLY UP TO 1% LESS THAN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ANY RATE INCREASES ABOVE THAT AMOUNT MUST BE APPROVED BY

THE MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (MPSC) AS JUST AND REASONABLE. THE MPSC MAY ONLY APPROVE RATE INCREASES BASED UPON ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING 5

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACTORS: TOTAL SERVICE LRIC; COMPARISON TO OTHER PROVIDER RATES; WHETHER A NEW FUNCTION, FEATURE OR CAPABILITY IS OFFERED; INCREASE IN COSTS TO PROVIDE LOCAL

SERVICE; AND WHETHER FURTHER INVESTMENT IS ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED. THE MPSC HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER NUMEROUS UNREGULATED SERVICES. OTHER SERVICES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY.

OHIO

VERIZON NORTHS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN OHIO ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

PENNSYLVANIA

ON JULY 26, 2001, THE PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION (PPUC) REJECTED, IN PART, AND ACCEPTED, IN PART, A PROPOSED PRICE CAP PLAN FILED BY VERIZON

NORTH. THE PPUC ACCEPTED, WITH SOME MODIFICATION, THAT PART OF THE PLAN THAT PROVIDED FOR THE DEREGULATION OF THE PRICING OF COMPETITIVE SERVICES; ELIMINATION OF EARNINGS SHARING; ADOPTION OF A PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR BASED ON INFLATION; A PROVISION TO

ADJUST RATES FOR EXOGENOUS EVENTS; AND A PRICE CAP OF RATES OF PROTECTED SERVICES. THE PPUC REJECTED THAT PART OF VERIZON NORTHS PLAN THAT PROVIDED FOR IMPROVEMENT OF VERIZON NORTHS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PPUC SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED

A REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN FOR VERIZON NORTH THAT REQUIRES, INTER ALIA, UNIVERSAL BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BY 2015.

ON NOVEMBER 30, 2004, A STATUTE REAUTHORIZING ALTERNATIVE REGULATION IN PENNSYLVANIA (ACT 183) WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. ACT 183.



AUTHORIZES VERIZON NORTH TO FILE AN AMENDED NETWORK MODERNIZATION PLAN REQUIRING IT TO DEPLOY A UNIVERSAL BROADBAND NETWORK, DEFINED AT 1.544 MEGABITS PER

SECOND, NOT LATER THAN 2015, AND THE PLAN CANNOT BE SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGED WITHOUT VERIZON NORTHS CONSENT;



PERMITS ANNUAL PRICE INCREASES UP TO, BUT NOT EXCEEDING, THE GDP-PI MINUS .5% (FOR 100 BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BY 2015) OR 0% (BY 2013).



ALLOWS NONPROTECTED SERVICES TO BE DECLARED COMPETITIVE THROUGH A ONE-DAYS NOTICE FILING WITH THE PPUC.



REDUCES PPUC REPORTING AND OTHER REGULATORY OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS.



REQUIRES VERIZON NORTH TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO 20% OF THE FIRST YEAR EFFECT OF GDP-PI PRICE INCREASES TO FUNDS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE BROADBAND IN SCHOOLS AND BROADBAND

EDUCATION AND DEMAND AGGREGATION GENERALLY.

WISCONSIN

VERIZON NORTH

ENTERED A PRICE CAP PLAN IN 1995. THE PLAN DOES NOT REGULATE EARNINGS AND PRICE CAP INDEX INCREASES CAN BE ACCUMULATED AND DEFERRED UP TO THREE YEARS. THE MAXIMUM INCREASE FOR ANY SINGLE BASIC RATE ELEMENT IS 10% OR THE INCREASE IN THE GDP-PI,

WHICHEVER IS GREATER. OVERALL BASIC LOCAL SERVICE INCREASES ARE LIMITED TO GDP-PI LESS 2%. INTRASTATE ACCESS SERVICE MIRRORS INTERSTATE RATES. THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER SERVICES AS LONG AS THEY COVER LRICS. RATE CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE ON ONE

DAYS NOTICE AFTER CUSTOMER NOTICE AND NEW SERVICES TAKE EFFECT AFTER TEN DAYS. THE STATUTE REQUIRES THAT NO EARLIER THAN SIX YEARS, AND NO MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN MAY BY

RULE INCREASE OR DECREASE THE GDP-PI PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR IN ANY TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD TO REFLECT ANY STATEWIDE CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTIVITY EXPERIENCE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THE LATEST PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND THE FACTOR

WAS NOT CHANGED.

PRICE INCREASES PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2005 ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN FCC SEPARATIONS THAT

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AFFECT NET INCOME BY AT LEAST 10% AND FOR RATE GROUP RECLASSIFICATIONS DUE TO ACCESS LINE GROWTH. AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2005, PRICE INCREASES REQUIRE APPROVAL.

FULL PACKAGING (AN INTEGRATED OFFERING OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES) IS ALLOWED.



NON-BASIC SERVICES  THIS CATEGORY ONLY INCLUDES SWITCHED ACCESS, WHICH IS PRICE-CAPPED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2005. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE LRIC. THE

STATUTE CONTAINS NO EXPIRATION PROVISION.



PRICE-CAPPED NON-BASIC SERVICES  THESE SERVICES INCLUDE BASIC LOCAL BUSINESS CHARGES SUCH AS SERVICE CONNECTION AND BRI-ISDN (BASIC RATE INTERFACE 

VIRGINIA INC.

EFFECTIVE IN 1995, THE VSCC APPROVED AN

ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN THAT REGULATES VERIZON VIRGINIAS NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES ON A PRICE CAP BASIS AND DOES NOT REGULATE VERIZON VIRGINIAS COMPETITIVE SERVICES. THE PLAN DOES NOT REGULATE PROFITS. IN JUNE 2001, THE VSCC MODIFIED

THE PLAN AND EXTENDED THE MORATORIUM ON RATE INCREASES FOR BASIC LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE UNTIL 2004. IN JANUARY 2005, THE VSCC AGAIN MODIFIED THE PLAN, PERMITTING ADDITIONAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES AND ELIMINATING VARIOUS

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE PLANS EFFECTIVE DATE IS FEBRUARY 1, 2005 AND IT HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE.

ASSISTANCE WILL BE RATE-DEREGULATED, AND VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA MAY PETITION FOR THE RATE DEREGULATION OF ANY OTHER SERVICE, EXCEPT BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICE, AT ANY TIME.

COMPETITION

CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES INCLUDE LONG DISTANCE COMPANIES, OTHER LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES,

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION AND EXISTING

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION AND MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES

THE ABILITY TO OFFER LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS. APPLICATIONS FROM COMPETITORS

TO PROVIDE AND RESELL LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN EVERY JURISDICTION IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. THE 1996 ACT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS.

ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE 1996 ACT WAS TO ENSURE, AND ACCELERATE, THE

EMERGENCE OF COMPETITION IN LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS. TOWARD THIS END, THE 1996 ACT REQUIRES MOST EXISTING LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS, OR ILECS), INCLUDING OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS, TO PERMIT POTENTIAL COMPETITORS

(CLECS) TO.



PURCHASE SERVICE FROM THE ILEC FOR RESALE TO CLEC CUSTOMERS;



PURCHASE UNES FROM THE ILEC; AND/OR



INTERCONNECT THE CLECS NETWORK WITH THE ILECS NETWORK.

AS A RESULT, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN

REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO CLECS AT DISCOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY 51% FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE SCOPE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE NEW UNBUNDLING RULES DESCRIBED

ABOVE, AND THE RATES WE CHARGE LOCAL EXCHANGE COMPETITORS FOR ACCESS TO UNES REMAIN UNDER NEAR-CONTINUAL REVIEW AND REVISION BY STATE REGULATORS AND OFTEN RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN THOSE RATES. SEE STATE REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES.

LONG DISTANCE SERVICES

WE OFFER INTRALATA AND INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES. INTRALATA TOLL

CALLS ORIGINATE AND TERMINATE WITHIN THE SAME LATA, BUT GENERALLY COVER A GREATER DISTANCE THAN A LOCAL CALL. STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS RATHER THAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES GENERALLY REGULATE THESE SERVICES. FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE JURISDICTION OVER

INTERSTATE TOLL SERVICES. ALL OF OUR STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS (EXCEPT IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE INTRALATA TOLL SERVICE IS NOT PROVIDED) PERMIT OTHER CARRIERS TO OFFER INTRALATA TOLL SERVICES WITHIN THE STATE. INTERLATA TOLL CALLS TERMINATE

OUTSIDE THE LATA OF ORIGINATION. WE NOW OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CAPPING A SEVEN-YEAR EFFORT. OUR AUTHORITY IN ALASKA IS LIMITED TO INTERSTATE AND INTERNATIONAL SERVICES. A NUMBER OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE

LONG DISTANCE BUSINESS HAVE STRONG BRAND RECOGNITION AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

ALTERNATIVE ACCESS SERVICES

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS REVENUES FROM BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS IS DERIVED FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE, MULTIPLE-LINE SUBSCRIBERS.

WE FACE COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, CONSTRUCTED BY

LARGE END-USERS, INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS AND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS VENDORS, WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF ORIGINATING AND/OR TERMINATING CALLS WITHOUT THE USE OF OUR PLANT. THE FCCS ORDERS REQUIRING US TO OFFER COLLOCATED INTERCONNECTION FOR SPECIAL AND

SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES HAVE ENHANCED THE ABILITY OF SUCH ALTERNATIVE ACCESS PROVIDERS TO COMPETE WITH US.

OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF COMPETITION INCLUDE CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS, SHARED TENANT SERVICES AND OTHER NONCARRIER SYSTEMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF BYPASSING OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS LOCAL

PLANT, EITHER PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY, THROUGH SUBSTITUTION OF SPECIAL ACCESS FOR SWITCHED ACCESS OR THROUGH CONCENTRATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ON FEWER OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS LINES, AND THROUGH SUBSTITUTION OF UNES FOR SPECIAL

ACCESS SERVICES.

VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL SERVICES

OUR WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES ALSO FACE INCREASING COMPETITION

FROM COMPANIES WHICH PROVIDE VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (VOIP) SERVICES. THESE SERVICES USE THE INTERNET OR PRIVATE BROADBAND NETWORKS TO TRANSMIT VOICE COMMUNICATIONS. VOIP SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COMPANIES INCLUDING CABLE

COMPANIES, LONG-DISTANCE COMPANIES, NATIONAL VOIP PROVIDERS AND REGIONAL SERVICE PROVIDERS.

WIRELESS SERVICES

WIRELESS SERVICES ALSO CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COMPETITION TO OUR WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, ESPECIALLY AS WIRELESS CARRIERS (INCLUDING VERIZON WIRELESS) EXPAND AND IMPROVE THEIR NETWORK COVERAGE AND CONTINUE TO LOWER

THEIR PRICES TO END-USERS. AS A RESULT, MORE END-USERS ARE SUBSTITUTING WIRELESS SERVICES FOR BASIC WIRELINE SERVICE. WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICES CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DATA TRANSMISSION.

PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES

THE GROWTH OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED USAGE OF PUBLIC TELEPHONES, AS MORE CUSTOMERS ARE SUBSTITUTING WIRELESS SERVICES FOR

PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER PROVIDERS OF PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES.

OPERATOR SERVICES

OUR OPERATOR SERVICES PRODUCT LINE FACES COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE OPERATOR SERVICES PROVIDERS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.

DOMESTIC WIRELESS

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC WIRELESS SEGMENT PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES AND

EQUIPMENT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH VERIZON WIRELESS.

VERIZON WIRELESS IS THE MOST PROFITABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER IN THE U.S., IN TERMS OF OPERATING INCOME. VERIZON WIRELESS HAS THE SECOND LARGEST CUSTOMER BASE OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS PROVIDER, WITH 43.8

MILLION WIRELESS SUBSCRIBERS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, AND PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. APPROXIMATELY 269 MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE IN AREAS OF THE U.S. IN WHICH WE HAVE FCC LICENSES TO OFFER OUR SERVICES AND

APPROXIMATELY 243 MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE IN AREAS COVERED BY OUR SERVICE. THIS COVERAGE INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE POPULATION IN OUR LICENSED AREAS AND 49 OF THE 50 AND 97 OF THE 100 MOST POPULATED U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS.

WIRELESS LICENSES ARE GRANTED BY THE FCC FOR AN INITIAL 10-YEAR TERM AND ARE

RENEWABLE FOR SUCCESSIVE 10-YEAR TERMS. TO DATE, ALL VERIZON WIRELESS AND PREDECESSOR COMPANY WIRELESS LICENSES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RENEWED.

BACKGROUND

THE WIRELESS JOINT VENTURE WAS FORMED IN APRIL 2000 IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE). THE WIRELESS

JOINT VENTURE OPERATES AS VERIZON WIRELESS. VERIZON OWNS A CONTROLLING 55% INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS AND VODAFONE OWNS THE REMAINING 45%.

RECENT ACQUISITIONS

ON OCTOBER 29, 2004, WE ACQUIRED A 10 MHZ PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES LICENSE FROM NEXTWAVE TELECOM INC. (NEXTWAVE) COVERING THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA FOR $930 MILLION IN CASH. THE

LICENSE, WHICH COVERS NEW YORK CITY AND NORTHERN AND CENTRAL NEW JERSEY, AS WELL AS WESTCHESTER AND ROCKLAND COUNTIES IN NEW YORK, PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR VOICE AND DATA SERVICES.

IN MAY 2003, WE ACQUIRED 50 WIRELESS LICENSES AND RELATED NETWORK ASSETS FROM

NORTHCOAST COMMUNICATIONS LLC FOR $762 MILLION IN CASH. THE LICENSES PROVIDE VERIZON WIRELESS WITH ADDITIONAL GROWTH CAPACITY OVER LARGE PORTIONS OF THE EAST COAST AND MIDWEST. TOTAL POPULATION SERVED BY THE LICENSES IS APPROXIMATELY 47 MILLION.

COMPETITION

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS

INDUSTRY. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER PENETRATION LEVELS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE INDUSTRY, ONGOING INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, LOCAL NUMBER PORTABILITY, THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM, BOTH LICENSED AND UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS, INCLUDING OTHER CELLULAR AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OPERATORS AND

RESELLERS, SERVE EACH OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE CURRENTLY PROVIDE SERVICE TO 49 OF THE TOP 50 MARKETS IN THE U.S., AND EACH OF THESE 49 MARKETS HAS AN AVERAGE OF FOUR OTHER COMPETING WIRELESS PROVIDERS. COMPETITION ALSO MAY INCREASE IF

SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS PROVIDERS TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED AND MORE EXPERIENCED WIRELESS PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, RESELLERS THAT BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM CARRIERS FOR RESALE, PROVIDE ANOTHER CATEGORY OF

DIFFERENTIATED COMPETITORS IN THE MARKETPLACE.

WE COMPETE

PRIMARILY AGAINST FOUR OTHER MAJOR WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS: CINGULAR WIRELESS LLC, NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS, INC., SPRINT CORPORATION AND T-MOBILE USA, INC. IN ADDITION, IN MANY MARKETS WE ALSO COMPETE WITH REGIONAL CARRIERS, SUCH AS ALLTEL

CORPORATION AND US CELLULAR CORPORATION. ON DECEMBER 15, 2004, SPRINT AND NEXTEL ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT FOR A MERGER BETWEEN THEIR COMPANIES. BASED ON REPORTED INFORMATION, THE TWO ENTITIES, IF FULLY COMBINED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WOULD HAVE BEEN

THE THIRD LARGEST U.S. WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN TERMS OF CUSTOMERS. THE ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER AND REGULATORY APPROVALS. SPRINT AND NEXTEL HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY EXPECT THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY.

NETWORK QUALITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE.

IN RECENT YEARS,

COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY HAS LED TO LOWER PRICES AND TO THE POPULARITY OF PRICING PLANS THAT DO NOT CHARGE FOR ROAMING WHICH, IN TURN, HAS LED TO INCREASED MINUTES OF USE PER CUSTOMER. AS A RESULT, THE ABILITY TO KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY

NEEDS AND OFFER HIGH QUALITY NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH THE COMPANYS NETWORK IS IMPORTANT. WE HAVE AN EXTENSIVE NATIONAL NETWORK, AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE BUILD-OUT OF EXISTING LICENSES, ACQUISITIONS

AND/OR SPECTRUM LEASING. WE OWN LICENSES THAT COVER MUCH OF THE COUNTRY BUT WE WILL NEED TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY AND EXTEND OUR COVERAGE AREA. MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO HAVE BUILD-OUT NEEDS, WHICH THEY ARE SEEKING TO

MITIGATE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OR THROUGH AFFILIATE AND/OR ROAMING AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS.

CUSTOMER SERVICE.

QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING CUSTOMERS DO NOT TERMINATE SERVICE AND TO OBTAIN NEW CUSTOMERS. WITH LOCAL NUMBER PORTABILITY, CUSTOMERS MAY

FIND IT EASIER TO SWITCH THEIR SERVICE TO AN ALTERNATE CARRIER, SINCE THEY CAN TAKE THEIR TELEPHONE NUMBER WITH THEM TO THAT CARRIER. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL BE A KEY TO RETAINING OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO ATTRACTING CUSTOMERS

WHO WANT TO SWITCH FROM OTHER CARRIERS. WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON CONTINUALLY ENHANCING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

PRICING.

SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PRICING IS AN IMPORTANT AREA IN WHICH

WIRELESS CARRIERS COMPETE. WE SEEK TO COMPETE IN THIS AREA BY OFFERING OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WILL REGARD AS THE BEST AVAILABLE VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP AND WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS PROLIFERATE, CONTINUED CUSTOMER

AND REVENUE GROWTH WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE ENHANCING OUR ABILITY TO ENVISION, EVALUATE AND RAPIDLY DEPLOY NEW AND INNOVATIVE HANDSETS AND CUSTOMER

SOLUTIONS.

DISTRIBUTION.

KEY TO ACHIEVING SALES SUCCESS

IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF SALES CHANNELS AND DISTRIBUTION POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE OPTIMAL MIX OF DIRECT, INDIRECT AND WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS AN IMPORTANT INGREDIENT IN ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING SALES. A

GOAL OF OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY IS TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES AND OUR OUTSIDE SALES TEAM, AS WELL AS THROUGH TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES. SUPPLEMENTING THIS IS AN EXTENSIVE INDIRECT

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF FULL-SERVICE RETAIL OUTLETS AND PREPAID REPLENISHMENT LOCATIONS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS RESELLERS WHO BUY OUR SERVICE ON A WHOLESALE BASIS.

CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY AND COVERAGE OF THEIR NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WIRELESS PROVIDERS

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW.

AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION, WE MAY ENCOUNTER FURTHER MARKET PRESSURES TO.



RESPOND TO PARTICULAR SHORT-TERM, MARKET-SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, PROMOTIONAL SERVICE PRICING OR EQUIPMENT DISCOUNTS;



INTRODUCE NEW SERVICE OFFERINGS AT LOWER PRICES OR RESTRUCTURE OUR SERVICE PACKAGES TO OFFER MORE VALUE;



INCREASE ADVERTISING SPENDING; OR



INCREASE OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO ENSURE WE RETAIN OUR MARKET LEADERSHIP IN SERVICE QUALITY.

SUCH MARKET PRESSURES COULD CAUSE US TO EXPERIENCE LOWER REVENUES, MARGINS

AND AVERAGE REVENUE PER USER, AS WELL AS INCREASED CAPITAL SPENDING TO ENSURE PROPER CAPACITY LEVELS.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER

PREFERENCES, REGULATORY CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND PRICING STRATEGIES OF COMPETITORS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING DYNAMIC CHANGES AS NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORMS EMBRACE

COMPETITION.

IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, VERIZON DOMINICANA

FACES BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS COMPETITORS, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL SERVICE PROVIDER IN ALL TELECOMMUNICATION SEGMENTS. THE DOMINICAN REPUBLICS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND PRICING IS SET AT MARKET RATES.

IN PUERTO RICO, TELPRI OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET. ALL WIRELINE SERVICES, INCLUDING LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, INTERNET ACCESS AND DATA, FACE COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS PROVIDERS INCLUDING A FACILITIES-BASED LOCAL CARRIER, INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS, RESELLERS, CABLE PROVIDERS, AND

INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. PRTC REMAINS THE LEADING WIRELINE SERVICE PROVIDER IN PUERTO RICO AND CONTINUES TO PROTECT ITS LEADING POSITION. IN THE WIRELESS MARKET, VWPR COMPETES AGAINST FIVE OTHER WIRELESS CARRIERS AND IS SECOND IN WIRELESS MARKET

SHARE OPERATING UNDER THE VERIZON WIRELESS BRAND. WITH RESPECT TO REGULATORY MATTERS, PRTC CONTINUES TO OPERATE IN A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. IN 2001 AND 2002 THE PUERTO RICO TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY BOARD (TRB) ISSUED ORDERS, WHICH CALLED

FOR CASH REFUNDS AND SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN ACCESS RATES FOR INTRA-ISLAND LONG DISTANCE SERVICE. IN NOVEMBER 2003, PRTC REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE TRB TO IMPLEMENT THE REDUCTION IN ACCESS RATES AND REPLACE THE CASH REFUND PORTION OF THE ORDER

WITH AN EXPANSION OF LOCAL EXCHANGE AREAS, RATE ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES, CERTAIN LOCAL RATE CREDITS AND THE ELIMINATION OF TOUCHTONE CHARGES.

IN VENEZUELA, CANTVS WIRELESS OPERATIONS HAVE FACED COMPETITION SINCE INCEPTION. IN LATE 2000, THE GOVERNMENT OPENED THE BASIC TELEPHONE MARKET FOR

LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICE TO COMPETITION AND ISSUED NEW GUIDELINES GOVERNING INTERCONNECTION AND THE USE OF WIRELESS SPECTRUM. CANTV, HOWEVER, IS STILL SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE RATE REGULATION, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT

TO RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, THAT LIMITS THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES TO KEEP PACE WITH CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INFLATION. CANTV REMAINS VENEZUELAS LEADING PROVIDER OF SWITCHED, FIXED LOCAL AND DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND IS ONE OF THE COUNTRYS TOP PROVIDERS OF WIRELESS SERVICES. IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO ACQUIRE DIGITEL, THE THIRD LARGEST WIRELESS OPERATOR IN VENEZUELA WITH 1.3 MILLION

SUBSCRIBERS FOR $450 MILLION. WHEN COMPLETED, CANTV WILL BE THE LARGEST WIRELESS PROVIDER WITH APPROXIMATELY 55 PERCENT OF THE VENEZUELAN WIRELESS MARKET. COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO THE EXECUTION OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT, AS WELL

AS REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENT APPROVALS.

IN ITALY, VODAFONE

OMNITEL OPERATES IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE AND HIGHLY PENETRATED MARKET. IT RESPONDS WITH CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN LOYALTY PROGRAMS AND RETAIL STORES, COUPLED WITH A STRONG FOCUS ON BUSINESS AND HIGH VALUE CUSTOMERS. VODAFONE OMNITEL WAS AWARDED

A LICENSE FOR THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE SPECTRUM IN 2000, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTENDED FROM A 15-YEAR LIFE TO A 20-YEAR LIFE IN NOVEMBER 2001. DURING 2004, VODAFONE OMNITEL LAUNCHED THE COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OF ITS THIRD-GENERATION NETWORK.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

MCI ACQUISITION

ON FEBRUARY 14, 2005, VERIZON ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD AGREED TO ACQUIRE MCI

FOR A COMBINATION OF VERIZON COMMON SHARES AND CASH (INCLUDING MCI DIVIDENDS). AT THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, VERIZON WILL ALSO ASSUME MCIS NET DEBT (TOTAL DEBT LESS CASH ON HAND). THIS CONSIDERATION IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AT CLOSING AND

MAY BE DECREASED BASED ON MCIS BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS-RELATED EXPERIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LIABILITIES. THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF VERIZON AND MCI HAVE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION TO MCI SHAREOWNER APPROVAL, THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES

REGULATORY APPROVALS, WHICH THE COMPANIES ARE TARGETING TO OBTAIN IN ABOUT ONE YEAR. AT LEAST ONE OTHER COMPANY HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN ACQUIRING MCI.

SPECTRUM PURCHASES

ON FEBRUARY 24, 2005, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH METROPCS, INC. TO PURCHASE 10 MHZ OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SPECTRUM COVERING THE SAN

FRANCISCO AREA FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $230 MILLION. THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE FCC AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005.

ON FEBRUARY 15, 2005, THE FCCS AUCTION OF BROADBAND PERSONAL

COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES LICENSES ENDED AND VERIZON WIRELESS, TOGETHER WITH AFFILIATE VISTA PCS, LLC, WAS THE HIGHEST BIDDER FOR 63 LICENSES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $697 MILLION.

ON NOVEMBER 4, 2004, WE ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH NEXTWAVE TO PURCHASE ALL OF NEXTWAVES

REMAINING PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SPECTRUM LICENSES IN 23 MARKETS FOR $3,000 MILLION THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF STOCK OF NEXTWAVE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF ITS BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION, WHEN IT WILL OWN NO ASSETS OTHER THAN THE LICENSES.

THE 10 MHZ AND 20 MHZ LICENSES, IN THE 1.9 GHZ PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FREQUENCY RANGE, COVER A POPULATION OF 73 MILLION PEOPLE AND WILL BE USED TO EXPAND VERIZON WIRELESSS NETWORK CAPACITY IN 22 KEY EXISTING MARKETS, INCLUDING NEW

YORK, BOSTON, WASHINGTON, D.C. AND LOS ANGELES, AS WELL AS TO EXPAND INTO TULSA, OKLAHOMA. THE TRANSACTION HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT AND THE FCC. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN APRIL

2005.

ON JULY 1, 2004 WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE

QWEST WIRELESS, LLCS SPECTRUM LICENSES AND WIRELESS NETWORK ASSETS FOR $418 MILLION COVERING SEVERAL EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS. THIS TRANSACTION CLOSED ON MARCH 4, 2005.

SALES OF BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS

TELEPHONE ACCESS LINES

IN OCTOBER 2004, VERIZON ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD SUSPENDED DISCUSSIONS WITH POTENTIAL BUYERS RELATED TO ITS UPSTATE NEW YORK ACCESS LINES, PENDING AN EVALUATION OF ITS STRATEGIC OPTIONS. HOWEVER,

WE ARE CONTINUING TO CONSIDER PLANS FOR A REDUCTION IN THE SIZE OF OUR ACCESS LINE BUSINESS, INCLUDING THROUGH A SPIN-OFF MECHANISM OR OTHERWISE, SO THAT WE MAY PURSUE OUR STRATEGY OF PLACING GREATER FOCUS ON THE HIGHER GROWTH BUSINESSES OF

BROADBAND AND WIRELESS.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, WE

ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL OUR WIRELINE-RELATED BUSINESSES IN HAWAII, WHICH OPERATES 707,000 SWITCHED ACCESS LINES, FOR $1,650 MILLION IN CASH, LESS DEBT. THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION, EXPECTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005, IS CONTINGENT ON

STATE REGULATORY APPROVAL; THE FCC AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE PROVIDED THE NECESSARY APPROVALS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DURING 2003, UNDER A GOVERNMENT-APPROVED PLAN, REMEDIATION OF THE SITE OF A FORMER FACILITY IN HICKSVILLE, NEW YORK THAT PROCESSED NUCLEAR FUEL RODS IN THE 1950S AND 1960S COMMENCED. REMEDIATION BEYOND ORIGINAL EXPECTATIONS PROVED TO BE

NECESSARY AND A REASSESSMENT OF THE ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION COSTS WAS CONDUCTED. IN ADDITION, A REASSESSMENT OF COSTS RELATED TO REMEDIATION EFFORTS AT SEVERAL OTHER FORMER FACILITIES WAS UNDERTAKEN. AS A RESULT, AN ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION EXPENSE OF $240 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN 2003.

NEW YORK RECOVERY

FUNDING

IN AUGUST 2002, PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THE

SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL THAT INCLUDED $5.5 BILLION IN NEW YORK RECOVERY FUNDING. OF THAT AMOUNT, APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO COVER UTILITY RESTORATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE REBUILDING AS A RESULT OF THE SEPTEMBER 11TH

TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE LOWER MANHATTAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION FOLLOWING AN APPLICATION AND AUDIT PROCESS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, WE HAVE APPLIED FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $266 MILLION. WE RECEIVED

AN ADVANCE OF $11 MILLION IN DECEMBER 2003 AND AN ADDITIONAL ADVANCE OF $77 MILLION IN JUNE 2004. WE ARE AWAITING THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT RELATING TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT WE HAVE APPLIED FOR REIMBURSEMENT, INCLUDING FUNDS ALREADY RECEIVED. ON
