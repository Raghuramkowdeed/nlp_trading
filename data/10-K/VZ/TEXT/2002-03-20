DOMESTIC TELECOM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTING OUR WIRELINE TELEPHONE

OPERATIONS, PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 64% OF 2001 TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES. OUR

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS PRESENTLY SERVE A TERRITORY CONSISTING OF 132.1 MILLION

ACCESS LINE EQUIVALENTS IN 32 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THIS SEGMENT

ALSO PROVIDES LONG DISTANCE AND OTHER TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. DOMESTIC

TELECOM PROVIDES MAINLY TWO TYPES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.

.    EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IS THE TRANSMISSION OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMONG CUSTOMERS LOCATED WITHIN A LOCAL CALLING AREA

WITHIN A LOCAL ACCESS AND TRANSPORT AREA (LATA). EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INCLUDE SWITCHED LOCAL RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS

SERVICES, LOCAL PRIVATE LINE VOICE AND DATA SERVICES AND CENTREX SERVICES.

WE ALSO PROVIDE TOLL SERVICES WITHIN A LATA (INTRALATA LONG DISTANCE) AND

TOLL SERVICES OUTSIDE A LATA (INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE).

.    EXCHANGE ACCESS SERVICE LINKS A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES AND THE TRANSMISSION

FACILITIES OF OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS, GENERALLY INTERLATA

CARRIERS. EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE ACCESS SERVICES INCLUDE SWITCHED ACCESS AND

SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES.

WE HAVE ORGANIZED OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT INTO FIVE MARKETING UNITS

OPERATING ACROSS OUR TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES. THE UNITS FOCUS ON SPECIFIC

MARKETS. WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

REMAIN RESPONSIBLE WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE AREAS FOR THE PROVISION OF

TELEPHONE SERVICES, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND REGULATORY MATTERS.

THE ENTERPRISE UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND

SERVICES TO LARGE BUSINESSES AND TO DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES AND OFFICES OF THE

EXECUTIVE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS. THESE SERVICES INCLUDE VOICE SWITCHING/PROCESSING SERVICES (E.G.,

DEDICATED PRIVATE LINES, CUSTOM CENTREX, CALL MANAGEMENT AND VOICE MESSAGING),

END-USER NETWORKING (E.G., CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AND PERSONAL

COMPUTER-BASED CONFERENCING, INCLUDING DATA AND VIDEO), INTERNETWORKING

(ESTABLISHING LINKS BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPARATE NETWORKS OF TWO OR MORE

COMPANIES OR WITHIN THE SAME COMPANY), NETWORK OPTIMIZATION (DISASTER AVOIDANCE,

911 SERVICE AND INTELLIGENT VEHICLE HIGHWAY SYSTEMS) AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS

INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA APPLICATIONS. THE ENTERPRISE UNIT ALSO INCLUDES OUR DATA

SOLUTIONS GROUP WHICH PROVIDES DATA

1

TRANSMISSION AND NETWORK INTEGRATION SERVICES (INTEGRATING MULTIPLE

GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPARATE NETWORKS INTO ONE SYSTEM) AND OUR STRATEGIC MARKETS

UNIT WHICH OPERATES AS A PROVIDER OF NETWORK MONITORING SERVICES AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SALES TO MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES. REVENUES IN

2001 WERE APPROXIMATELY $7.4 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 17% OF DOMESTIC

TELECOM'S AGGREGATE REVENUES.

THE RETAIL UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL

CUSTOMERS AND TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES WITHIN OUR TERRITORY,

INCLUDING OUR LONG DISTANCE SERVICES. SOME OF OUR LONG DISTANCE SUBSIDIARIES

OPERATE AS A RESELLER OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND

PROVIDE SERVICE IN ALL 50 STATES TO RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING LONG DISTANCE SERVICES, CALLING CARDS, 800/888 SERVICES AND OPERATOR

SERVICES TO ITS CUSTOMERS. UNDER THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 (1996 ACT),

OUR ABILITY TO OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE SERVICES IN THE STATES WHERE THE

FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE AS LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS

IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SATISFYING PRESCRIBED REQUIREMENTS. SEE

"TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996" BELOW. THIS UNIT ALSO PROVIDES OPERATOR AND PAY

TELEPHONE SERVICES. THE RETAIL UNIT INCLUDES VERIZON AVENUE, A SUBSIDIARY THAT

MARKETS TO CUSTOMERS LOCATED IN MULTI-TENANT BUILDINGS AND TELEPRODUCTS, A

SUBSIDIARY THAT MARKETS CUSTOMER PREMISES EQUIPMENT TO THE END-USER. REVENUES IN

2001 WERE APPROXIMATELY $23.5 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 54% OF

DOMESTIC TELECOM'S AGGREGATE REVENUES. THESE REVENUES WERE DERIVED PRIMARILY

FROM THE PROVISION OF TELEPHONE SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL USERS.

THE NETWORK UNIT MARKETS (I) SWITCHED AND SPECIAL ACCESS TO THE TELEPHONE

OPERATIONS' LOCAL EXCHANGE NETWORKS AND (II) BILLING AND COLLECTION SERVICES,

INCLUDING RECORDING, RATING, BILL PROCESSING AND BILL RENDERING. REVENUES IN

2001 WERE APPROXIMATELY $10.7 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 25% OF

DOMESTIC TELECOM'S AGGREGATE REVENUES. APPROXIMATELY 39% OF TOTAL NETWORK

SERVICE REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS. MOST OF THE REMAINING

REVENUES CAME FROM BUSINESS CUSTOMERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH THEIR OWN

SPECIAL ACCESS NETWORK CONNECTIONS, WIRELESS COMPANIES AND OTHER LOCAL EXCHANGE

CARRIERS WHICH RESELL NETWORK CONNECTIONS TO THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS. THIS UNIT ALSO

INCLUDES VARIOUS TECHNICAL PLANNING GROUPS THAT PROVIDE STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGY AND

NETWORK PLANNING, NEW SERVICE CREATION AND EMERGING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT.

THE ADVANCED SERVICES UNIT MARKETS OUR ADSL (ASYMMETRICAL DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER

LINE) AND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES. OUR GLOBAL NETWORKS UNIT IS BUILDING A NEXT

GENERATION LONG DISTANCE NETWORK USING ATM (ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE)

TECHNOLOGY. REVENUES IN 2001 WERE APPROXIMATELY $633 MILLION, REPRESENTING

APPROXIMATELY 2% OF DOMESTIC TELECOM'S AGGREGATE REVENUES. THESE REVENUES WERE

DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE PROVISION OF DATA SERVICES.

THE NATIONAL OPERATIONS UNIT MARKETS OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION

SERVICES THAT SUPPLY INSTALLATION AND REPAIR LABOR AND MANAGES OUR SUPPLY UNIT

THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY AND SUPPLIES

FOR OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. OUR SUPPLY UNIT

(AFTER ELIMINATIONS AND COMBINED WITH ALL OTHER DOMESTIC TELECOM REVENUES) WERE

APPROXIMATELY $877 MILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 2% OF DOMESTIC TELECOM'S

AGGREGATE REVENUES.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996

WE FACE INCREASING COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. THE 1996 ACT,

REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL ACTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE

TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO FEWER

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT DEFINITIVELY THE IMPACT THAT

THE ONGOING CHANGES IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE ON

OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FINANCIAL

IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS

OF COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS, THE TIMING AND OUTCOME OF VARIOUS REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS AND ANY APPEALS, AND THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS OF OUR PURSUIT

OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES RESULTING FROM THE 1996 ACT AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.

IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE

WE OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICE NATIONWIDE, EXCEPT IN THOSE STATES SERVED BY THE

FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED

AUTHORITY TO OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICE UNDER THE 1996 ACT. UNDER THE 1996 ACT,

OUR ABILITY TO OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE SERVICES IN THE STATES WHERE THE

FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE AS LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS

IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SATISFYING SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS. THE REQUIREMENTS

INCLUDE A 14-POINT "COMPETITIVE CHECKLIST" OF STEPS WHICH WE MUST TAKE TO HELP

COMPETITORS OFFER LOCAL SERVICES THROUGH RESALE, THROUGH PURCHASE OF UNBUNDLED

NETWORK ELEMENTS, OR BY INTERCONNECTING THEIR OWN NETWORKS TO OURS. WE MUST ALSO

DEMONSTRATE TO THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) THAT OUR ENTRY INTO

THE IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE MARKET WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

WE NOW HAVE AUTHORITY TO OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE SERVICE IN FIVE STATES IN

THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TERRITORY, ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE LINES

SERVED BY THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC. IN ADDITION TO ITS NEW YORK ORDER RELEASED

IN DECEMBER 1999, THE FCC RELEASED ORDERS ON APRIL 16, 2001, JULY 23, 2001,

SEPTEMBER 19, 2001 AND FEBRUARY 22, 2002, APPROVING OUR APPLICATIONS FOR

PERMISSION TO ENTER THE IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE MARKET IN MASSACHUSETTS,

CONNECTICUT, PENNSYLVANIA AND RHODE ISLAND, RESPECTIVELY. BOTH THE MASSACHUSETTS

AND PENNSYLVANIA ORDERS ARE CURRENTLY ON APPEAL TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS.

WE HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS WITH THE FCC TO OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICE IN NEW

JERSEY AND VERMONT. WE EXPECT THE FCC TO RULE ON THOSE APPLICATIONS BY MARCH 20,

2002 AND APRIL 17, 2002, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE ALSO FILED STATE APPLICATIONS FOR

SUPPORT OF ANTICIPATED APPLICATIONS WITH THE FCC FOR PERMISSION TO ENTER THE

IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE MARKET IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, DELAWARE AND MAINE. THIRD-PARTY

TESTING OF OUR OPERATIONS SUPPORT SYSTEMS IS IN ITS FINAL STAGES IN VIRGINIA,

WEST VIRGINIA, MARYLAND AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

2

FCC REGULATION AND INTERSTATE RATES

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FCC WITH RESPECT

TO INTERSTATE SERVICES AND RELATED MATTERS. IN 2001, THE FCC CONTINUED TO

IMPLEMENT REFORMS TO THE INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGE SYSTEM AND TO IMPLEMENT THE

"UNIVERSAL SERVICE" AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1996 ACT.

ACCESS CHARGES AND UNIVERSAL SERVICE

ON MAY 31, 2000, THE FCC ADOPTED A PLAN ADVANCED BY MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY (THE

COALITION FOR AFFORDABLE LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE SERVICES, OR CALLS) AS A

COMPREHENSIVE FIVE-YEAR PLAN FOR REGULATION OF INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGES. THE

CALLS PLAN HAS THREE MAIN COMPONENTS. FIRST, IT ESTABLISHES A PORTABLE

INTERSTATE ACCESS UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT OF $650 MILLION FOR THE INDUSTRY.

THIS EXPLICIT SUPPORT REPLACES IMPLICIT SUPPORT EMBEDDED IN INTERSTATE ACCESS

CHARGES. SECOND, THE PLAN SIMPLIFIES THE PATCHWORK OF COMMON LINE CHARGES INTO

ONE SUBSCRIBER LINE CHARGE (SLC) AND PROVIDES FOR DE-AVERAGING OF THE SLC BY

ZONES AND CLASS OF CUSTOMERS IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT UNDERMINE COMPARABLE AND

AFFORDABLE UNIVERSAL SERVICE. THIRD, THE PLAN SETS INTO PLACE A MECHANISM TO

TRANSITION TO A SET TARGET OF $.0055 PER MINUTE FOR SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES.

ONCE THAT TARGET RATE IS REACHED, LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED

TO MAKE FURTHER ANNUAL PRICE CAP REDUCTIONS TO THEIR SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES. THE

ANNUAL REDUCTIONS LEADING TO THE TARGET RATE, AS WELL AS ANNUAL REDUCTIONS FOR

THE SUBSET OF SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO PRICE CAP

REGULATION WAS SET AT 6.5% PER YEAR.

ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT RULED ON

AN APPEAL OF THE FCC ORDER ADOPTING THE PLAN. THE COURT UPHELD THE FCC ON

SEVERAL CHALLENGES TO THE ORDER, BUT REMANDED TWO ASPECTS OF THE DECISION BACK

TO THE FCC ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY LACKED SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION. THE COURT

REMANDED BACK TO THE FCC FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION ITS DECISION SETTING THE

ANNUAL REDUCTION FACTOR AT 6.5% AND THE SIZE OF THE NEW UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND

AT $650 MILLION. THE ENTIRE PLAN (INCLUDING THESE ELEMENTS) WILL CONTINUE IN

EFFECT PENDING THE FCC'S FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF ITS JUSTIFICATION OF THESE

COMPONENTS.

AS A RESULT OF TARIFF ADJUSTMENTS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2001,

APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR ACCESS LINES REACHED THE $0.0055 BENCHMARK.

THE FCC HAS ADOPTED RULES FOR SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES THAT PROVIDE FOR PRICING

FLEXIBILITY AND ULTIMATELY THE REMOVAL OF SERVICES FROM PRICE REGULATION WHEN

PRESCRIBED COMPETITIVE THRESHOLDS ARE MET. IN ORDER TO USE THESE RULES, CARRIERS

MUST FOREGO THE ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PROVISIONS IN THE CURRENT RULES

THAT PROVIDE RELIEF IN THE EVENT EARNINGS FALL BELOW PRESCRIBED THRESHOLDS. IN

2001, WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO REMOVE SPECIAL ACCESS AND DEDICATED TRANSPORT

SERVICES FROM PRICE CAPS IN 35 OF THE 57 METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSAS)

IN THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TERRITORY AND IN THREE ADDITIONAL MSAS IN THE FORMER

GTE TERRITORY. IN ADDITION, THE FCC FOUND THAT IN 10 MSAS WE HAVE MET THE

STRICTER STANDARDS TO REMOVE SPECIAL ACCESS CONNECTIONS TO END-USER CUSTOMERS

FROM PRICE CAPS. WE HAVE AN APPLICATION PENDING THAT, IF GRANTED, WOULD REMOVE

SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES FROM PRICE CAP REGULATION IN 16 ADDITIONAL MSAS.

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC ADOPTED A NEW MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING UNIVERSAL

SERVICE SUPPORT TO HIGH COST AREAS SERVED BY LARGE LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES.

THIS FUNDING MECHANISM PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICES

IN SEVERAL STATES SERVED BY OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS. THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN

SUPPLEMENTED BY THE NEW FCC ACCESS CHARGE PLAN DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON JULY 31,

2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT REVERSED AND REMANDED TO

THE FCC FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT THE FCC HAD FAILED TO

ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN SOME ASPECTS OF ITS DECISION AND HAD FAILED TO ADDRESS ANY

NEED FOR A STATE UNIVERSAL SERVICE MECHANISM. THE CURRENT UNIVERSAL SERVICE

MECHANISM REMAINS IN PLACE PENDING THE OUTCOME OF ANY FCC REVIEW AS A RESULT OF

THESE APPEALS.

UNBUNDLING OF NETWORK ELEMENTS (UNES)

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION SETTING FORTH NEW UNBUNDLING

REQUIREMENTS, ELIMINATING ELEMENTS THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED TO BE

UNBUNDLED, LIMITING THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE OTHERS AND ADDING NEW ELEMENTS.

APPEALS FROM THIS DECISION ARE PENDING.

IN ADDITION TO THE UNBUNDLING REQUIREMENTS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC

RELEASED AN ORDER IN A SEPARATE PROCEEDING IN DECEMBER 1999, REQUIRING INCUMBENT

LOCAL EXCHANGE COMPANIES ALSO TO UNBUNDLE AND PROVIDE TO COMPETITORS THE HIGHER

FREQUENCY PORTION OF THEIR LOCAL LOOP. THIS PROVIDES COMPETITORS WITH THE

ABILITY TO PROVISION DATA SERVICES ON TOP OF INCUMBENT CARRIERS' VOICE SERVICES.

APPEALS FROM THIS ORDER ARE ALSO PENDING.

IN JULY 2000, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT FOUND THAT SOME

ASPECTS OF THE FCC'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PRICING UNES WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE

1996 ACT. IN PARTICULAR, IT FOUND THAT THE FCC WAS WRONG TO REQUIRE INCUMBENT

CARRIERS TO BASE THESE PRICES NOT ON THEIR REAL COSTS BUT ON THE IMAGINARY COSTS

OF THE MOST EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT AND THE MOST EFFICIENT NETWORK CONFIGURATION.

THIS PORTION OF THE COURT'S DECISION HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING REVIEW BY THE U.S.

SUPREME COURT. IN ADDITION, THE COURT UPHELD THE FCC'S DECISION THAT UNES SHOULD

BE PRICED BASED ON A FORWARD-LOOKING COST MODEL RATHER THAN HISTORICAL COSTS.

THE U.S. SUPREME COURT CURRENTLY HAS THIS CASE UNDER REVIEW.

IN DECEMBER 2001, THE FCC OPENED ITS TRIENNIAL REVIEW OF UNES. THIS RULEMAKING

REOPENS THE QUESTION OF WHAT NETWORK ELEMENTS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE ON AN

UNBUNDLED BASIS UNDER THE 1996 ACT AND WILL REVISIT THE UNBUNDLING DECISIONS

DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN THIS RULEMAKING, THE FCC ALSO WILL ADDRESS OTHER PENDING

ISSUES RELATING TO UNBUNDLED ELEMENTS, INCLUDING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

COMPETING CARRIERS MAY SUBSTITUTE COMBINATIONS OF UNBUNDLED LOOPS AND TRANSPORT

FOR ALREADY COMPETITIVE SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES.

COMPENSATION FOR INTERNET TRAFFIC

ON APRIL 27, 2001, THE FCC RELEASED AN ORDER ADDRESSING INTERCARRIER

COMPENSATION FOR DIAL-UP CONNECTIONS FOR INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC. THE FCC FOUND

THAT INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC IS INTERSTATE AND SUBJECT TO THE FCC'S JURISDICTION.

MOREOVER, THE FCC AGAIN FOUND THAT INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC IS NOT SUBJECT TO

RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 251(B)(5) OF THE 1996 ACT. INSTEAD, THE

FCC ESTABLISHED FEDERAL RATES FOR THIS TRAFFIC THAT DECLINE FROM $0.0015 TO

$0.0007 OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THE FCC ORDER ALSO SETS CAPS ON THE TOTAL

MINUTES OF THIS TRAFFIC THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ANY INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION AND

REQUIRES THAT INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS MUST OFFER TO PAY RECIPROCAL

COMPENSATION FOR

3

LOCAL TRAFFIC AT THE SAME RATE AS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON INTERNET-BOUND

TRAFFIC. SEVERAL COMPETING CARRIERS AND STATE REGULATORS APPEALED THIS ORDER TO

THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT. THE COURT DENIED A MOTION TO

STAY THE FCC ORDER, AND THE ORDER WENT INTO EFFECT. THE APPEAL REMAINS PENDING.

STATE REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES

STATE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS REGULATE OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT

TO INTRASTATE RATES AND SERVICES AND OTHER MATTERS. IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THE

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE RATE OF RETURN REGULATION WITH

PRICE REGULATION PLANS.

VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC.

ARIZONA

VERIZON CALIFORNIA'S OPERATIONS IN ARIZONA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

CALIFORNIA

VERIZON CALIFORNIA'S OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE OPERATED UNDER THE NEW

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (NRF) SINCE 1990. THE NRF ALLOWS FOR A GRADUAL TRANSITION

TO LESS REGULATION ON A SERVICE-BY-SERVICE BASIS. THE NRF IS REVIEWED EVERY

THREE YEARS AND CURRENTLY HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES.

.    EARNINGS CEILING: THE CEILING IS SUSPENDED.

.    PRICE CAP INDEX: BY SETTING INFLATION EQUAL TO PRODUCTIVITY, THE CALIFORNIA

PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (CPUC) HAS SUSPENDED THE PRICE CAP INDEX.

LIMITED EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE ALLOWED. GENERALLY, EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE

CHANGES UNIQUE TO OR SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO A COMPANY THAT ARE BEYOND ITS

CONTROL (IN THIS CASE, CHANGES ARE PERMITTED ONLY FOR MATTERS MANDATED BY

THE CPUC OR CHANGES IN TOTAL INTRASTATE COST RECOVERY RESULTING FROM

CHANGES BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE JURISDICTIONS).

.    PRICE FLEXIBILITY: SERVICES FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES.

CATEGORY I SERVICES CANNOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT CPUC APPROVAL.

CATEGORY II SERVICES ARE PARTIALLY COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE ADJUSTED WITHIN A

CEILING/FLOOR RANGE. THE CURRENT PRICE (EFFECTIVELY THE CEILING) CANNOT BE

INCREASED WITHOUT A FORMAL APPLICATION.

CATEGORY III SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE INCREASED OR

DECREASED ON SHORT NOTICE.

.    NEW SERVICES: NEW SERVICES CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS CATEGORY II OR III. IF

INTRODUCED AS CATEGORY III, VERIZON CALIFORNIA MUST DEMONSTRATE

INSIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER.

THE CPUC WILL REVIEW NRF FEATURES DURING 2002.

NEVADA

VERIZON CALIFORNIA'S OPERATIONS IN NEVADA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

VERIZON DELAWARE INC.

SINCE 1994, VERIZON DELAWARE HAS BEEN REGULATED UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE REGULATION

PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT ACT OF 1993

(DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT). THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT PROVIDES

THE FOLLOWING.

.    THE PRICES OF "BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICES" (E.G., DIAL TONE AND LOCAL USAGE)

WILL REMAIN REGULATED AND CANNOT CHANGE IN ANY ONE YEAR BY MORE THAN THE

GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT - PRICE INDEX (GDP-PI) LESS 3%.

.    THE PRICES OF "DISCRETIONARY SERVICES" (E.G., IDENTA RING(SM) AND CALL

WAITING) CANNOT INCREASE MORE THAN 15% PER YEAR PER SERVICE.

.    THE PRICES OF "COMPETITIVE SERVICES" (E.G., VOICE MESSAGING AND MESSAGE

TOLL SERVICE) ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TARIFF OR REGULATION.

.    VERIZON DELAWARE WILL DEVELOP A TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT PLAN WITH A

COMMITMENT TO INVEST A MINIMUM OF $250 MILLION IN DELAWARE'S

TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE PLAN.

IN APRIL 2001, THE DELAWARE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVED VERIZON

DELAWARE'S REQUEST FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN

UNTIL ONE YEAR AFTER VERIZON DELAWARE OBTAINS AUTHORITY TO ENTER THE LONG

DISTANCE MARKET, OR MARCH 2004, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST. IN EXCHANGE FOR THE

EXTENSION, VERIZON DELAWARE AGREED TO CAP BASIC RATES UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2002.

VERIZON FLORIDA INC.

FLORIDA STATUTES GOVERN THE PRICE CAP PLAN. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2001, VERIZON

FLORIDA WAS ABLE TO RAISE BASIC LOCAL RATES ON 30 DAYS NOTICE ONCE IN ANY

12-MONTH PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED THE GDP-PI LESS 1%. VERIZON FLORIDA MAY INCREASE

RATES FOR NON-BASIC SERVICES BUT INCREASES FOR ANY CATEGORY CANNOT EXCEED 6% IN

ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD UNLESS ANOTHER COMPANY IS PROVIDING SERVICE IN A GIVEN

EXCHANGE, AT WHICH TIME VERIZON FLORIDA CAN INCREASE ITS PRICE UP TO 20% IN A

12-MONTH PERIOD. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED.

VERIZON HAWAII INC.

VERIZON HAWAII'S TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

4

VERIZON MARYLAND INC.

IN 1996, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND APPROVED A PRICE CAP PLAN FOR

REGULATING THE INTRASTATE SERVICES PROVIDED BY VERIZON MARYLAND. UNDER THE PLAN,

SERVICES ARE DIVIDED INTO SIX CATEGORIES: ACCESS; BASIC-RESIDENTIAL;

BASIC-BUSINESS; DISCRETIONARY; COMPETITIVE; AND MISCELLANEOUS. RATES FOR ACCESS,

BASIC-RESIDENTIAL, BASIC-BUSINESS AND DISCRETIONARY SERVICES CAN BE INCREASED OR

DECREASED ANNUALLY UNDER A FORMULA THAT IS BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE GDP-PI

MINUS A PRODUCTIVITY OFFSET BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE RATE OF INFLATION AS

REFLECTED IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI). RATES FOR COMPETITIVE SERVICES MAY

BE INCREASED WITHOUT REGULATORY LIMITS. REGULATION OF PROFITS IS ELIMINATED. A

REVIEW OF THE CURRENT PRICE CAP PLAN IS SCHEDULED FOR 2002.

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND INC.

MAINE

IN JUNE 2001, THE MAINE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ORDERED THE CONTINUATION OF

AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF REGULATION (AFOR) FOR VERIZON MAINE FOR A SECOND

FIVE-YEAR TERM. KEY ASPECTS OF THE NEW PLAN.

.    ELIMINATES ANNUAL FILINGS TO ADJUST RATES OF CORE SERVICES;

.    ELIMINATES THE 4.5% PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR APPLIED IN THE INITIAL AFOR TERM;

.    PROVIDES TOTAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL SERVICES EXCEPT LOCAL SERVICE,

OPERATOR SERVICES AND DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE;

.    ALLOWS AN INCREASE IN LOCAL SERVICE RATES THAT OFFSETS (IN WHOLE OR IN

PART) A LEGISLATIVELY REQUIRED ACCESS CHARGE REDUCTION;

.    REJECTS PROPOSALS TO INSTITUTE OVER 9,000 RETAIL SERVICE QUALITY MEASURES

AND INSTEAD CONTINUES THE CURRENT SERVICE QUALITY PLAN WITH SOME

MODIFICATIONS; AND

.    REQUIRES MONITORING OF VERIZON'S TOLL RATE/REVENUE REDUCTIONS TO INSURE

THAT TOLL USERS BENEFIT FROM THE ACCESS REDUCTIONS, EITHER IN REDUCED TOLL

RATES FROM VERIZON, OR IN TOLL SAVINGS FROM ALTERNATIVE CARRIERS. AT THE

END OF A TWO-YEAR MONITORING PERIOD THAT BEGAN DECEMBER 31, 2000, VERIZON

MAINE'S TOLL RATES/REVENUES MUST BE $19.8 MILLION LOWER, OR ADDITIONAL CUTS

IN TOLL RATES WILL BE REQUIRED. THEREAFTER, TOLL RATES ARE UNRESTRICTED.

MASSACHUSETTS

IN 1995, THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY (MDTE)

APPROVED A PRICE REGULATION PLAN FOR VERIZON NEW ENGLAND, WITH NO RESTRICTION ON

EARNINGS. SOME RESIDENCE EXCHANGE RATES ARE CAPPED. PRICING RULES LIMIT VERIZON

NEW ENGLAND'S ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICES FOR MOST SERVICES, INCLUDING A CEILING

ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF ALL TARIFFED SERVICES BASED ON A FORMULA OF

INFLATION MINUS A PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR PLUS OR MINUS LIMITED EXOGENOUS CHANGES.

IN ADDITION, VERIZON NEW ENGLAND'S SERVICE QUALITY PERFORMANCE LEVELS IN ANY

GIVEN MONTH COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OFFSET BY

ONE-TWELFTH OF ONE PERCENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE ANNUAL PRICE CAP FILING.

THE CURRENT PLAN EXPIRED IN AUGUST 2001. VERIZON NEW ENGLAND HAS FILED A

PROPOSED NEW PLAN, WHICH IS BEING REVIEWED BY THE MDTE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT A

NEW PLAN WILL BE ADOPTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002.

NEW HAMPSHIRE

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND'S OPERATIONS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO RATE

OF RETURN REGULATION.

RHODE ISLAND

IN 1996, THE RHODE ISLAND PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (RIPUC) APPROVED AN

INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN FOR VERIZON NEW ENGLAND. THE PLAN HAD NO EARNINGS CAP

OR SHARING MECHANISM AND NO SET TERM OR EXPIRATION, ALTHOUGH IT WAS SUBJECT TO

ANNUAL REVIEW BY THE RIPUC. OTHER FEATURES OF THE PLAN INCLUDED SERVICE QUALITY

REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING A FINANCIAL PENALTY, AND NO INCREASE IN RESIDENCE OR

BUSINESS BASIC EXCHANGE RATES THROUGH 1999. IN AUGUST 2000, THE RIPUC APPROVED A

NEW INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN FOR VERIZON NEW ENGLAND, WITH NO RESTRICTION ON

EARNINGS. THIS PLAN ESSENTIALLY CONTINUED THE PLAN ADOPTED IN 1996 WITH

ADJUSTMENTS TO SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS, INCREASES IN LIFELINE CREDITS, FUNDING

FOR DATA NETWORK ACCESS FOR SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES AND A RESIDENTIAL RATE FREEZE

FOR THE DURATION OF THE PLAN, WHICH EXPIRED DECEMBER 31, 2001. THE RIPUC HAS

DIRECTED VERIZON NEW ENGLAND TO FILE A NEW PLAN BY MAY 1, 2002.

VERMONT

IN 2000, THE VERMONT PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD APPROVED A FIVE-YEAR INCENTIVE

REGULATION PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE VERIZON NEW ENGLAND WITH INCREASED FLEXIBILITY

TO INTRODUCE AND PRICE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE PLAN ALSO REMOVES MOST

RESTRICTIONS ON VERIZON NEW ENGLAND'S EARNINGS FROM VERMONT OPERATIONS DURING

THE LIFE OF THE PLAN AND CONTAINS NO PRODUCTIVITY ADJUSTMENT. THE PLAN LIMITS

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND'S ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES ON EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

AND REQUIRES REVENUE REDUCTIONS OF $16.5 MILLION AT THE OUTSET OF THE PLAN, $6.5

MILLION DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PLAN AND APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION OVER

THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF THE PLAN. THE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES SOME SERVICE QUALITY

IMPROVEMENTS SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL PENALTY.

VERIZON NEW JERSEY INC.

THE 1992 NEW JERSEY TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT CLASSIFIES TELECOMMUNICATIONS

SERVICES AS "COMPETITIVE" OR "PROTECTED." "PROTECTED TELEPHONE SERVICES" INCLUDE

BASIC RESIDENCE AND BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE, TOUCH-TONE, ACCESS SERVICES AND THE

ORDERING, INSTALLATION AND RESTORATION OF THESE SERVICES. VERIZON NEW JERSEY

PROVIDES "PROTECTED TELEPHONE SERVICES" AND OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING VERTICAL

SERVICES (RATE-REGULATED SERVICES), UNDER A PLAN FOR ALTERNATIVE FORM OF

REGULATION, WHICH IS NOW SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON MARCH 31, 2002.

THERE IS NO CAP ON EARNINGS FOR RATE-REGULATED SERVICES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

PLAN, VERIZON NEW JERSEY SHARES EQUALLY WITH RATEPAYERS EARNINGS ABOVE A 13.7%

RETURN ON EQUITY FOR RATE-REGULATED SERVICES.

5

VERIZON NEW JERSEY FILED A NEW PROPOSED PLAN FOR ALTERNATIVE FORM OF REGULATION

WHICH PROPOSES TO LEAVE BASIC RATES UNCHANGED, ELIMINATE EARNINGS SHARING AND

TREAT MULTI-LINE BUSINESS SERVICES AS "COMPETITIVE." THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF

PUBLIC UTILITIES (NJBPU) HAS STATED ITS INTENTION TO ADOPT A NEW PLAN BY JUNE

30, 2002.

ON DECEMBER 17, 2001, THE NJBPU RELEASED AN ORDER IN WHICH IT PRESCRIBED NEW

RATES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH VERIZON NEW JERSEY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE

ITS NETWORK AVAILABLE TO COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (CLECS). MANY OF

THESE RATES CONSTITUTE SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS TO VERIZON NEW JERSEY'S PRIOR UNE

RATES. VERIZON NEW JERSEY IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING WHETHER TO SEEK JUDICIAL

REVIEW OF THESE RATES.

VERIZON NEW YORK INC.

THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (NYSPSC) HAS ADOPTED A NEW

INCENTIVE PLAN TO REGULATE THE SERVICES OF VERIZON NEW YORK, EFFECTIVE MARCH 1,

2002. THE PLAN PROVIDES PRICING FLEXIBILITY, ADOPTS NEW SERVICE QUALITY

STANDARDS AND DOES NOT RESTRICT VERIZON NEW YORK'S EARNINGS. THE PLAN WILL

EXPIRE IN 2004, EXCEPT THAT THE SERVICE QUALITY PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN WILL

EXPIRE IN 2005.

THE NEW PLAN.

.    PERMITS VERIZON NEW YORK TO INCREASE ITS RETAIL RATES BY 3% OF ITS

INTRASTATE REVENUES PER YEAR IN EACH OF THE TWO YEARS OF THE PLAN, BUT

LIMITS ANY INCREASE ON RESIDENCE SERVICE FIRST LINES TO $1.85 IN 2002 AND

$.65 IN 2003, AND FREEZES RATES AND LOWERS SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGES FOR

LOW INCOME CONSUMERS;

.    ESTABLISHES STATE-WIDE SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR

CUSTOMER CREDITS AND RESTRICTIONS ON VERIZON NEW YORK'S PRICING FLEXIBILITY

IF IT FAILS TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS;

.    ESTABLISHES THAT THE RATES PROVIDED IN THE NYSPSC'S JANUARY 2002 ORDER ON

PRICING OF UNES WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF THE PLAN; AND

.    REQUIRES VERIZON NEW YORK TO TRANSITION TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES ACCOUNTING FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR REGULATORY

PURPOSES, OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

ON JANUARY 28, 2002, THE NYSPSC ISSUED AN ORDER MANDATING SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS

IN THE RATES THAT VERIZON NEW YORK MAY CHARGE ITS LOCAL EXCHANGE COMPETITORS FOR

ACCESS TO UNES.

VERIZON NEW YORK'S OPERATIONS IN CONNECTICUT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION. IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITY CONTROL ADOPTED

AN INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN PROPOSED BY VERIZON NEW YORK, WHICH ELIMINATES

REGULATION OF EARNINGS AND PROVIDES OTHER DEREGULATORY BENEFITS.

VERIZON NORTH INC.

ILLINOIS

VERIZON NORTH'S TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN ILLINOIS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION. OPTIONAL TOLL PLANS, INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK (ISDN),

FRAME RELAY, PAYPHONES, CENTRANET(R), AND OTHER DATA SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED

DEREGULATED AND HAVE TOTAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY.

INDIANA

VERIZON NORTH'S TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN INDIANA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

MICHIGAN

SINCE THE MICHIGAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT WAS PASSED IN 1991, A FORM OF

REGULATION THAT FOCUSES ON SERVICES, PRICES AND COSTS HAS REPLACED RATE OF

RETURN REGULATION. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED. ALL RATES FOR REGULATED SERVICES

MUST MEET A COST FLOOR. VERIZON NORTH MAY INCREASE LOCAL RATES ANNUALLY UP TO 1%

LESS THAN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ANY RATE INCREASES ABOVE THAT AMOUNT MUST BE

APPROVED BY THE MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (MPSC) AS "JUST AND

REASONABLE." THE MPSC MAY ONLY APPROVE RATE INCREASES BASED UPON ONE OR MORE OF

THE FOLLOWING 5 FACTORS: TOTAL SERVICE LONG-RUN INCREMENTAL COST (LRIC);

COMPARISON TO OTHER PROVIDER RATES; WHETHER A NEW FUNCTION, FEATURE OR

CAPABILITY IS OFFERED; INCREASE IN COSTS TO PROVIDE LOCAL SERVICE; AND WHETHER

FURTHER INVESTMENT IS ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED. THE MPSC HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER

NUMEROUS UNREGULATED SERVICES. OTHER SERVICES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PRICING

FLEXIBILITY.

ON JULY 17, 2000, SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO THE MICHIGAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED VERIZON NORTH'S LOCAL RATES BY APPROXIMATELY $26

MILLION AND PROHIBITED ANY RATE INCREASES FOR THREE YEARS. ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2000,

THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN ISSUED AN ORDER

THAT TEMPORARILY STOPPED THE RATE FREEZE FROM GOING INTO EFFECT PENDING FURTHER

PROCEEDINGS, BUT REFUSED TO ISSUE AN ORDER TO STOP THE RATE REDUCTION FROM GOING

INTO EFFECT. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2000, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH

CIRCUIT ISSUED AN ORDER TO TEMPORARILY STOP THE RATE REDUCTION FROM GOING INTO

EFFECT, PENDING FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE MATTER IS PENDING.

OHIO

VERIZON NORTH'S TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN OHIO ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

PENNSYLVANIA

ON JULY 26, 2001, THE PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION (PPUC) REJECTED, IN

PART, AND ACCEPTED, IN PART, A PROPOSED PRICE CAP PLAN FILED BY VERIZON NORTH.

THE PPUC ACCEPTED, WITH SOME MODIFICATION, THAT PART OF THE PLAN THAT PROVIDED

FOR THE DEREGULATION OF THE PRICING OF

6

COMPETITIVE SERVICES; ELIMINATION OF EARNINGS SHARING; ADOPTION OF A

PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR BASED ON INFLATION; A PROVISION TO ADJUST RATES FOR

EXOGENOUS EVENTS; AND A PRICE CAP OF RATES OF PROTECTED SERVICES. THE PPUC

REJECTED THAT PART OF VERIZON NORTH'S PLAN THAT PROVIDED FOR IMPROVEMENT OF

VERIZON NORTH'S NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. ON NOVEMBER 26, 2001, VERIZON NORTH

FILED A REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN WITH THE PPUC. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE PPUC

WILL CONCLUDE REVIEW OF THIS PLAN BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002.

WISCONSIN

VERIZON NORTH ENTERED A PRICE CAP PLAN IN 1995. THE PLAN DOES NOT REGULATE

EARNINGS AND PRICE CAP INDEX INCREASES CAN BE ACCUMULATED AND DEFERRED UP TO

THREE YEARS. THE MAXIMUM INCREASE FOR ANY NON-BASIC RATE ELEMENT IS 10% OR THE

INCREASE IN THE GDP-PI, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. BASIC LOCAL SERVICE IS LIMITED TO

GDP-PI LESS 2%. INTRASTATE ACCESS SERVICE MIRRORS INTERSTATE RATES. THERE ARE NO

RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER SERVICES AS LONG AS THEY COVER LRICS. RATE CHANGES ARE

EFFECTIVE ON ONE DAY NOTICE AFTER CUSTOMER NOTICE AND NEW SERVICES TAKE EFFECT

AFTER TEN DAYS. THE STATUTE REQUIRES THAT NO EARLIER THAN SIX YEARS, AND NO MORE

FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF

WISCONSIN MAY BY RULE INCREASE OR DECREASE THE GDP-PI PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR IN ANY

TWELVE MONTH PERIOD TO REFLECT ANY STATEWIDE CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTIVITY

EXPERIENCE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THE PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR IS UNDER

REVIEW.

VERIZON NORTHWEST INC.

CALIFORNIA

VERIZON NORTHWEST'S CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

IDAHO

VERIZON NORTHWEST'S IDAHO OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

OREGON

VERIZON NORTHWEST'S OREGON OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

PRICING FLEXIBILITY IS PERMITTED IN COMPETITIVE ZONES AND VERIZON NORTHWEST

CURRENTLY HAS DIGITAL CHANNEL SERVICE, ISDN, PBX TRUNKS (TELEPHONE SWITCHING

EQUIPMENT ON CUSTOMER PREMISES), DID TRUNKS (TRUNKS FROM THE CUSTOMER PREMISES

SWITCHES TO THE CENTRAL OFFICE) AND SINGLE LINE BUSINESS SERVICE OFFERINGS IN

THESE ZONES. BILLING AND COLLECTION AND CENTRANET(R) ARE IN A COMPETITIVE CLASS

AND ARE FLEXIBLY PRICED.

WASHINGTON

VERIZON NORTHWEST'S WASHINGTON OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION. INTRALATA TOLL AND BILLING AND COLLECTION ARE FLEXIBLY PRICED.

VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA INC.

THE PPUC REGULATES VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA UNDER AN ALTERNATIVE REGULATION PLAN

APPROVED IN 1994. THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR A PURE PRICE CAP PLAN WITH NO SHARING OF

EARNINGS WITH CUSTOMERS AND REPLACES RATE BASE, RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

COMPETITIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING TOLL, DIRECTORY ADVERTISING, BILLING SERVICES,

CENTREX SERVICE, PAGING, SPEED CALLING, REPEAT CALLING, AND HICAP (HIGH CAPACITY

PRIVATE LINE) AND BUSINESS SERVICES PROVIDED TO LARGER CUSTOMERS ARE PRICE

DEREGULATED. ALL NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES ARE PRICE REGULATED.

THE PLAN.

.    PERMITS ANNUAL PRICE INCREASES UP TO, BUT NOT EXCEEDING, THE GDP-PI MINUS

2.93%;

.    REQUIRES ANNUAL PRICE DECREASES WHEN THE GDP-PI FALLS BELOW 2.93%;

.    CAPS PRICES FOR PROTECTED SERVICES, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS

BASIC EXCHANGE SERVICES, SPECIAL ACCESS AND SWITCHED ACCESS, THROUGH 1999;

AND

.    PERMITS REVENUE-NEUTRAL RATE RESTRUCTURING FOR NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES.

THE PPUC'S ORDER APPROVING THE BELL ATLANTIC-GTE MERGER EXTENDED THE CAP ON

RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS BASIC EXCHANGE SERVICES THROUGH 2003.

THE PLAN REQUIRES VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA TO PROVIDE A LIFELINE SERVICE FOR

RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. THE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES DEPLOYMENT OF A UNIVERSAL

BROADBAND NETWORK, WHICH MUST BE COMPLETED IN PHASES: 20% BY 1998, 50% BY 2004,

AND 100% BY 2015. DEPLOYMENT MUST BE REASONABLY BALANCED AMONG URBAN, SUBURBAN

AND RURAL AREAS.

ON MARCH 22, 2001, THE PPUC PROPOSED THAT VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA ADOPT A

FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION BETWEEN ITS RETAIL AND WHOLESALE BUSINESSES, AND ABIDE BY

A CODE OF CONDUCT IN ITS OPERATIONS BETWEEN THE RETAIL AND WHOLESALE BUSINESSES.

VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA ACCEPTED THIS PROPOSAL AND AGREED TO SUCH A FUNCTIONAL

SEPARATION IN ITS PENNSYLVANIA OPERATIONS. THE PPUC HAS NOT YET ADOPTED A FINAL

CODE OF CONDUCT TO GOVERN THE FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION.

VERIZON SOUTH INC.

ALABAMA

VERIZON SOUTH'S PRICE CAP PLAN STARTED IN JANUARY 1996. THE PLAN DOES NOT HAVE

AN EXPIRATION DATE BUT IS REVIEWED EVERY FIVE YEARS. THERE ARE THREE SERVICE

CATEGORIES: BASIC, NON-BASIC AND INTERCONNECTION. BASIC SERVICES ARE CAPPED FOR

FIVE YEARS FROM THE SEPTEMBER 1995 ORDER DATE. AT THE END OF THE CAP, PRICES CAN

BE INCREASED BY GDP-PI LESS A 1% PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR LESS ANY SERVICE PENALTIES

(UP TO .75% MAXIMUM PENALTY). NON-BASIC SERVICES CAN BE INCREASED BEGINNING

JANUARY 1997 AND PRICES CAN BE INCREASED A MAXIMUM OF 10% IN THE AGGREGATE FOR A

GIVEN YEAR. INDIVIDUAL PRICES CAN BE CHANGED MORE THAN 10% AS LONG AS THE

AGGREGATE CHANGE IS 10% OR LESS. VERIZON SOUTH'S INTRASTATE ACCESS

7

CHARGES ARE CAPPED AT A COMPOSITE RATE OF $0.064 PER MINUTE. TARIFF FILINGS FOR

INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS ARE PRESUMPTIVELY VALID. EARNINGS ARE NOT

REGULATED.

KENTUCKY

VERIZON SOUTH'S OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY ARE CURRENTLY UNDER RATE OF RETURN

REGULATION.

NORTH CAROLINA

VERIZON SOUTH'S OPERATIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN UNDER A PRICE CAP PLAN

SINCE 1996 THAT IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW IN 2002. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED AND

LOCAL RATES CAN BE INCREASED BY GDP-PI LESS 2%. RATE INCREASES ARE EFFECTIVE ON

FOURTEEN DAYS NOTICE. VERIZON SOUTH HAS COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE RATES

FOR BILLING AND COLLECTION, CENTREX, AND ENHANCED DIGITAL SWITCH SERVICE.

SOUTH CAROLINA

VERIZON SOUTH'S SOUTH CAROLINA PRICE CAP PLAN STARTED DURING 2000. UNDER THE

STATUTE, EXISTING RATES ARE DEEMED JUST AND REASONABLE ON THE DATE OF

NOTIFICATION. RESIDENTIAL AND SINGLE-LINE BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE RATES ARE

BE ADJUSTED ANNUALLY PURSUANT TO AN INFLATION-BASED INDEX. RATES FOR OTHER

SERVICES ARE FLEXIBLY PRICED. PRICE DECREASES ARE EFFECTIVE IN SEVEN DAYS. PRICE

INCREASES AND NEW SERVICES PRICES ARE EFFECTIVE IN FOURTEEN DAYS.

VIRGINIA

ON DECEMBER 21, 2000, THE VIRGINIA STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION (VSCC) APPROVED

A PRICE CAP PLAN FOR VERIZON SOUTH THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO VERIZON

VIRGINIA'S PLAN DESCRIBED BELOW.

THE NEW PLAN WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001 AND HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE.

VERIZON SOUTHWEST

THE TEXAS PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION REGULATES VERIZON SOUTHWEST UNDER A PRICE

CAP PLAN WITH NO CAP ON EARNINGS PURSUANT TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY ACT

(PURA). THE PLAN PLACES SERVICES INTO FOUR CATEGORIES.

.    BASIC SERVICES - THESE INCLUDE BASIC LOCAL RESIDENTIAL CHARGES SUCH AS

SERVICE CONNECTION, MANDATORY EXPANDED CALLING PLANS AND RESIDENTIAL CALL

WAITING. PRICE INCREASES PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2005 ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO

ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN FCC SEPARATIONS THAT AFFECT NET INCOME BY AT LEAST

10% AND FOR RATE GROUP RECLASSIFICATIONS DUE TO ACCESS LINE GROWTH. AFTER

SEPTEMBER 1, 2005, PRICE INCREASES REQUIRE APPROVAL. FULL PACKAGING (AN

INTEGRATED OFFERING OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES) IS

ALLOWED.

.    NON-BASIC SERVICES - THIS CATEGORY ONLY INCLUDES SWITCHED ACCESS, WHICH IS

PRICE-CAPPED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2005. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE LRIC.

THE STATUTE CONTAINS NO EXPIRATION PROVISION.

.    PRICE-CAPPED NON-BASIC SERVICES - THESE SERVICES INCLUDE BASIC LOCAL

BUSINESS CHARGES SUCH AS SERVICE CONNECTION AND BRI-ISDN (BASIC RATE

INTERFACE - INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK). THESE SERVICES ARE

PRICE-CAPPED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2005. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE LRIC.

FULL PACKAGING IS ALLOWED.

.    NON-BASIC SERVICES WITHOUT CAPS - THIS CATEGORY REPRESENTS ALL OTHER

REGULATED SERVICES, INCLUDING INTRALATA TOLL, CUSTOM CALLING FEATURES

(EXCEPT RESIDENTIAL CALL WAITING), SPECIAL ACCESS, OPERATOR SERVICES, PBX

AND ISDN SERVICES. THESE SERVICES HAVE UNLIMITED UPWARD PRICING

FLEXIBILITY. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE LRIC (WITH IMPUTATION) OR THE

PRICES IN EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1999, WHICHEVER IS LESS. FULL PACKAGING IS

ALLOWED.

VERIZON VIRGINIA INC.

EFFECTIVE IN 1995, THE VSCC APPROVED AN ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN THAT

REGULATES VERIZON VIRGINIA'S NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES ON A PRICE CAP BASIS AND

DOES NOT REGULATE VERIZON VIRGINIA'S COMPETITIVE SERVICES. THE PLAN DOES NOT

REGULATE PROFITS. IN JUNE 2001, THE VSCC MODIFIED THE PLAN AND EXTENDED THE

MORATORIUM ON RATE INCREASES FOR BASIC LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE UNTIL 2004. THE

PLAN HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE.

VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC INC.

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2002, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (DCPSC)

APPROVED A NEW PRICE CAP PLAN FOR LOCAL RETAIL SERVICES PROVIDED BY VERIZON

WASHINGTON, DC. KEY PROVISIONS OF THE 2002 PLAN INCLUDE.

.    A TWO YEAR TERM;

.    NO EARNINGS RESTRICTIONS, SERVICE PENALTIES OR REVENUE SHARING;

.    FOUR SERVICE CATEGORIES: BASIC RESIDENTIAL, BASIC BUSINESS, DISCRETIONARY

AND COMPETITIVE;

.    A CAP ON RESIDENTIAL DIAL TONE LINE RATES FOR THE TERM OF THE PLAN AND A

REDUCTION IN RESIDENTIAL SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGES;

.    ANNUAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL OTHER BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, WITH

THE INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES FROM THESE SERVICES LIMITED TO THE ANNUAL

INFLATION RATE (AS MEASURED BY THE CHANGE IN GDP-PI) AND INCREASES FOR ANY

INDIVIDUAL SERVICE IN THE CATEGORY LIMITED TO 10%;

.    CLASSIFICATION OF ALL BUSINESS SERVICES AS COMPETITIVE WITH COMPLETE

PRICING FLEXIBILITY EXCEPT FOR BASIC BUSINESS DIAL TONE LINES, PBX TRUNKS,

LOCAL DIRECTORY SERVICE AND MESSAGE UNITS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO A 10%

ANNUAL LIMIT ON ANY RATE INCREASE;

.    PRICING FLEXIBILITY ON DISCRETIONARY SERVICES, WITH A 15% ANNUAL LIMIT ON

ANY RATE INCREASE;

8

.    FLEXIBILITY TO BUNDLE OR PACKAGE EXISTING SERVICES; AND

.    ASSISTANCE BY VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC TO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT

TO SET UP "211" DIALING FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCIES,

AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SOCIAL SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND

ONE-TIME CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS.

VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA INC.

ON OCTOBER 3, 2001, THE WEST VIRGINIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WVPSC) APPROVED

VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA'S NEW INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN (IRP). THE NEW IRP

CONTINUES, UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FLEXIBLE PRICE REGULATION OF COMPETITIVE

SERVICES, CAPS ON BASIC RATES, INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITMENTS AND UNLIMITED EARNINGS

FREEDOM THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 1988. IN ADDITION, LONG DISTANCE, WIDE

AREA TELEPHONE SERVICE AND NATIONAL DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE WILL BE

RATE-DEREGULATED, AND VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA MAY PETITION FOR THE RATE

DEREGULATION OF ANY OTHER SERVICE, EXCEPT BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICE, AS EARLY AS

JANUARY 1, 2002.

THE NEW IRP ALSO RESOLVES THE PENDING REQUEST BY INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS, THE

WVPSC STAFF AND THE WVPSC CONSUMER ADVOCATE DIVISION (CAD) FOR IMMEDIATE ANNUAL

ACCESS CHARGE DECREASES. VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA WILL PHASE-IN AN ANNUAL RATE

DECREASE OF $19.2 MILLION BY JULY 2004. CUMULATIVE RATE REDUCTIONS WILL BE $91.7

MILLION OVER THE FIVE-YEAR LIFE OF THE IRP, AND TOTAL ANNUAL REDUCTIONS BY THE

END OF THE IRP WILL BE $26 MILLION. WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE IRP, THE CAD'S

PETITION FOR AN IMMEDIATE $81.6 MILLION ANNUAL RATE REDUCTION HAS BEEN

DISMISSED.

OTHER TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

OUR MISSOURI STATUTORY PRICE CAP PLAN STARTED IN FEBRUARY 1999. UNDER THE PLAN,

WE CAN REBALANCE RATES IN THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF THE PLAN BY INCREASING LOCAL

RATES BY $1.50 AND REDUCING SWITCHED ACCESS BY AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT. TOLL RATES

MUST BE REDUCED BY 10% IN THE FIRST YEAR. NON-BASIC SERVICE RATES MAY INCREASE

BY 8% ANNUALLY. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED.

COMPETITION

CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES INCLUDE LONG

DISTANCE COMPANIES, OTHER LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDERS, FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES,

INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES. MANY

OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION AND EXISTING

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION AND

MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH.

LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES

THE ABILITY TO OFFER LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS. APPLICATIONS FROM COMPETITORS TO

PROVIDE AND RESELL LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN EVERY

JURISDICTION IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. THE 1996 ACT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS.

ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE 1996 ACT WAS TO ENSURE, AND ACCELERATE, THE EMERGENCE

OF COMPETITION IN LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS. TOWARD THIS END, THE 1996 ACT REQUIRES

MOST EXISTING LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS, OR

ILECS), INCLUDING OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS, TO PERMIT POTENTIAL COMPETITORS

(CLECS) TO.

.    PURCHASE SERVICE FROM THE ILEC FOR RESALE TO CLEC CUSTOMERS;

.    PURCHASE UNES FROM THE ILEC; AND/OR

.    INTERCONNECT THE CLEC'S NETWORK WITH THE ILEC'S NETWORK.

AS A RESULT, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES TO INCREASE.

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO CLECS

AT DISCOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY 38% FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. OUR STATE REGULATORS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY

HAVE RECENTLY MANDATED REDUCTIONS IN THE RATES WE CHARGE LOCAL EXCHANGE

COMPETITORS FOR ACCESS TO UNES. A NUMBER OF OTHER STATE REGULATORS ARE

INITIATING SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS. SEE "STATE REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES."

LONG DISTANCE SERVICES

WE OFFER INTRALATA AND INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES. INTRALATA TOLL CALLS

ORIGINATE AND TERMINATE WITHIN THE SAME LATA, BUT GENERALLY COVER A GREATER

DISTANCE THAN A LOCAL CALL. STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS RATHER THAN FEDERAL

AUTHORITIES GENERALLY REGULATE THESE SERVICES. FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE

JURISDICTION OVER INTERSTATE TOLL SERVICES. ALL OF OUR STATE REGULATORY

COMMISSIONS (EXCEPT IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WHERE INTRALATA TOLL SERVICE IS

NOT PROVIDED) PERMIT OTHER CARRIERS TO OFFER INTRALATA TOLL SERVICES WITHIN THE

STATE. INTERLATA TOLL CALLS TERMINATE OUTSIDE THE LATA OF ORIGINATION. WE OFFER

INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES NATIONWIDE, EXCEPT IN THOSE STATES SERVED BY

THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED

AUTHORITY TO OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICE UNDER THE 1996 ACT. A NUMBER OF OUR

MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE LONG DISTANCE BUSINESS HAVE STRONG BRAND RECOGNITION

AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

ALTERNATIVE ACCESS SERVICES

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS' REVENUES FROM BUSINESS AND

GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS IS DERIVED FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE,

MULTIPLE-LINE SUBSCRIBERS.

WE FACE COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, CONSTRUCTED BY

LARGE END-USERS, INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS AND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS VENDORS, WHICH

ARE CAPABLE OF ORIGINATING AND/OR TERMINATING CALLS WITHOUT THE USE OF OUR

PLANT. THE FCC'S ORDERS REQUIRING US TO OFFER COLLOCATED INTERCONNECTION FOR

SPECIAL AND SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES HAVE ENHANCED THE ABILITY OF SUCH

ALTERNATIVE ACCESS PROVIDERS TO COMPETE WITH US.

9

OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF COMPETITION INCLUDE CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS, SHARED

TENANT SERVICES AND OTHER NONCARRIER SYSTEMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF BYPASSING OUR

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS' LOCAL PLANT, EITHER PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY, THROUGH

SUBSTITUTION OF SPECIAL ACCESS FOR SWITCHED ACCESS OR THROUGH CONCENTRATION OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ON FEWER OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS' LINES.

WIRELESS SERVICES

WIRELESS SERVICES ALSO CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COMPETITION TO OUR

WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, ESPECIALLY AS WIRELESS CARRIERS (INCLUDING

VERIZON WIRELESS) EXPAND AND IMPROVE THEIR NETWORK COVERAGE AND CONTINUE TO

LOWER THEIR PRICES TO END-USERS. AS A RESULT, MORE END USERS ARE SUBSTITUTING

WIRELESS SERVICES FOR BASIC WIRELINE SERVICE. WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICES CAN

ALSO BE USED FOR DATA TRANSMISSION.

PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES

THE GROWTH OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED USAGE OF

PUBLIC TELEPHONES, AS MORE CUSTOMERS ARE SUBSTITUTING WIRELESS SERVICES FOR

PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER PROVIDERS

OF PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES.

OPERATOR SERVICES

OUR OPERATOR SERVICES PRODUCT LINE FACES COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE OPERATOR

SERVICES PROVIDERS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOMESTIC WIRELESS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC WIRELESS SEGMENT PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES, PAGING

SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH VERIZON

WIRELESS.

VERIZON WIRELESS IS THE LEADING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER IN THE UNITED

STATES IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS, NETWORK COVERAGE, REVENUES AND

OPERATING CASH FLOW. VERIZON WIRELESS HAS THE LARGEST CUSTOMER BASE OF ANY U.S.

WIRELESS PROVIDER, WITH 29.4 MILLION WIRELESS SUBSCRIBERS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2001, AND PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

APPROXIMATELY 205 MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE, INCLUDING IN ALMOST EVERY MAJOR U.S.

CITY.

WIRELESS LICENSES ARE GRANTED BY THE FCC FOR AN INITIAL 10-YEAR TERM AND ARE

RENEWABLE FOR SUCCESSIVE 10-YEAR TERMS. TO DATE, ALL VERIZON WIRELESS AND

PREDECESSOR COMPANY (SEE FOLLOWING FORMATION DISCUSSION) WIRELESS LICENSES HAVE

BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RENEWED.

IN SEPTEMBER 1999, BELL ATLANTIC AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC AGREED TO COMBINE THEIR

U.S. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION BUSINESSES AND FORM VERIZON WIRELESS. IN APRIL

2000, VODAFONE CONTRIBUTED U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS (AIRTOUCH) AND ITS INTEREST

IN PRIMECO COMMUNICATIONS TO VERIZON WIRELESS IN EXCHANGE FOR A 65.1% ECONOMIC

INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS. BELL ATLANTIC CONTRIBUTED ITS U.S. WIRELESS

OPERATIONS AND ITS INTEREST IN PRIMECO TO VERIZON WIRELESS. IN JULY 2000, AFTER

THE MERGER OF BELL ATLANTIC AND GTE, VERIZON CONTRIBUTED GTE'S U.S. WIRELESS

OPERATIONS TO VERIZON WIRELESS, INCREASING VERIZON'S ECONOMIC INTEREST IN

VERIZON WIRELESS FROM 34.9% TO 55%.

VERIZON WIRELESS BROUGHT TOGETHER THE OPERATIONS OF FOUR WELL-RECOGNIZED U.S.

WIRELESS CARRIERS: BELL ATLANTIC MOBILE, GTE WIRELESS, AIRTOUCH AND PRIMECO,

RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORK IN THE UNITED

STATES.

BELL ATLANTIC MOBILE

BELL ATLANTIC MOBILE, BASED IN BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY, HAD 8.0 MILLION CUSTOMERS

AS OF MARCH 31, 2000. IT OPERATED IN 18 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND

12 OF THE TOP 50 U.S. MARKETS, INCLUDING BALTIMORE, BOSTON, NEW YORK CITY,

PHILADELPHIA AND WASHINGTON, D.C.

GTE WIRELESS

GTE WIRELESS HAD MORE THAN 7.0 MILLION U.S. WIRELESS CUSTOMERS IN JUNE 2000. IT

OPERATED IN 19 STATES AND 18 OF THE TOP 50 UNITED STATES MARKETS, INCLUDING

CHICAGO, CLEVELAND, HOUSTON, SAN FRANCISCO AND ST. LOUIS. GTE WIRELESS WAS BASED

IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA AND A SUBSIDIARY OF GTE CORPORATION.

AIRTOUCH

AIRTOUCH, BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA AND OWNED BY VODAFONE, SERVED

NEARLY 10 MILLION WIRELESS CUSTOMERS AND 3.5 MILLION PAGING CUSTOMERS IN THE

UNITED STATES AS OF MARCH 31, 2000. IT OPERATED BROADBAND WIRELESS NETWORKS IN

22 STATES AND 18 OF THE TOP 50 U.S. MARKETS, INCLUDING ATLANTA, DETROIT, LOS

ANGELES, PHOENIX, SAN DIEGO AND SEATTLE.

PRIMECO

PRIMECO WAS FORMED IN OCTOBER 1994 AS A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP TO PROVIDE ADVANCED

WIRELESS DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OVER AN ALL-DIGITAL WIRELESS NETWORK.

AS OF MARCH 31, 2000, PRIMECO HAD MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS. IMMEDIATELY

PRIOR TO ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE PARTNERSHIP, PRIMECO WAS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

BELL ATLANTIC AND VODAFONE. BASED IN WESTLAKE, TEXAS, PRIMECO OPERATED IN NINE

STATES AND 13 OF THE TOP 50 UNITED STATES MARKETS, INCLUDING DALLAS, MIAMI, SAN

ANTONIO AND TAMPA.

THE PRECEDING CUSTOMER NUMBERS INCLUDE OVERLAPPING MARKETS THAT HAVE BEEN

SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD.

PRICE COMMUNICATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2001, VERIZON WIRELESS AND PRICE COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AGREED

TO COMBINE THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF PRICE COMMUNICATIONS WIRELESS, INC. AND A

PORTION OF VERIZON WIRELESS, IN A TRANSACTION VALUED AT $1.7 BILLION, INCLUDING

$550 MILLION IN NET DEBT THAT WILL BE ASSUMED OR REDEEMED. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE TRANSACTION, WHICH REPLACES AN AGREEMENT ANNOUNCED BY THE COMPANIES IN

NOVEMBER 2000, PRICE COMMUNICATIONS WIRELESS AND VERIZON WIRELESS WILL FORM A

LIMITED PARTNERSHIP CONSISTING OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF PRICE

COMMUNICATIONS' WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND SOME OF VERIZON WIRELESS'S ASSETS.

VERIZON WIRELESS WILL CONTROL AND MANAGE THE PARTNERSHIP. PRICE COMMUNICATIONS'

PARTNERSHIP INTEREST WILL BE EXCHANGEABLE INTO VERIZON WIRELESS OR VERIZON

STOCK, SUBJECT TO SEVERAL CONDITIONS. THE TRANSACTION, WHICH REMAINS SUBJECT TO

THE APPROVAL OF PRICE COMMUNICATIONS' SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING

CONDITIONS, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE COMPANY'S FOOTPRINT IN THE

SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AND ADD APPROXIMATELY 560,000 CUSTOMERS.

DOBSON'S WIRELESS OPERATIONS

IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2001, WE ANNOUNCED THAT VERIZON WIRELESS SIGNED

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE SEVERAL OF DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION'S

ARIZONA. THE TRANSACTIONS CLOSED IN FEBRUARY 2002. THE ACQUIRED DOBSON

PROPERTIES SERVE A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILLION.

COMPETITION

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE

EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE

INDUSTRY, THE ENTRY OF NEW COMPETITORS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE AUCTION OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM AND REGULATORY

CHANGES. OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS SERVE EACH OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

WE CURRENTLY PROVIDE SERVICE TO 49 OF THE TOP 50 MARKETS IN THE U.S., AND THESE

49 MARKETS HAVE AN AVERAGE OF FIVE OTHER COMPETING WIRELESS PROVIDERS.

COMPETITION ALSO MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS

PROVIDERS TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED AND MORE EXPERIENCED

WIRELESS PROVIDERS.

WE COMPETE AGAINST FIVE OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS: AT&T;

WIRELESS, CINGULAR WIRELESS, NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS, INC., SPRINT PCS AND

VOICESTREAM. IN ADDITION, WE COMPETE AGAINST SEVERAL REGIONAL WIRELESS COMPANIES

IN MARKETS WHERE WE PROVIDE SERVICE. ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS ARE SEEKING TO ENTER

THE MARKET USING NEW TYPES OF SPECTRUM. THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS

BEEN EXPERIENCING CONSOLIDATION, AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE.

THIS CONSOLIDATION TREND MAY ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS

WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES TO COMPETE

WITH OUR OFFERINGS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR

INDUSTRY.

BRAND RECOGNITION:  WE INTRODUCED THE VERIZON WIRELESS BRAND NAME IN APRIL 2000

-----------------

AND BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED STRONG BRAND RECOGNITION.

NETWORK COVERAGE: IN RECENT YEARS, COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY HAS LED TO LOWER

----------------

PRICES AND TO THE POPULARITY OF PRICING PLANS THAT DO NOT CHARGE FOR ROAMING. AS

A RESULT, THE ABILITY TO OFFER NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH A COMPANY'S OWN NETWORK

IS IMPORTANT, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO ENSURE UNIFORM PERFORMANCE AND THE

AVAILABILITY OF FEATURES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, AS MANY FEATURES ARE NOT FULLY

AVAILABLE THROUGH ROAMING PARTNERS.

DIGITAL SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY:  DIGITAL SERVICE OFFERS BENEFITS TO THE CUSTOMER

------------------------------

AND ALSO PERMITS A NETWORK TO HAVE GREATER CAPACITY.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:  QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CARE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE

----------------

THAT EXISTING CUSTOMERS DO NOT TERMINATE SERVICE AND TO OBTAIN NEW CUSTOMERS.

CAPITAL RESOURCES:  IN ORDER TO EXPAND AND BUILD-OUT NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE

-----------------

NEXT GENERATION SERVICES, WIRELESS PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

RESOURCES.

AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION, WE MAY ENCOUNTER FURTHER MARKET PRESSURES TO REDUCE

OUR SERVICE PRICES, RESTRUCTURE OUR SERVICE PACKAGES TO OFFER MORE VALUE, OR

RESPOND TO PARTICULAR SHORT-TERM, MARKET-SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE,

SPECIAL INTRODUCTORY PRICING OR PACKAGES THAT MAY BE OFFERED BY NEW PROVIDERS

LAUNCHING THEIR SERVICE IN A PARTICULAR MARKET. WE ALSO EXPECT TO INCREASE OUR

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL SPENDING TO RESPOND TO COMPETITION.

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR MARKETING EFFORTS

AND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS COMPETITIVE FACTORS

AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, NEW SERVICES AND

TECHNOLOGIES, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND PRICING STRATEGIES BY COMPETITORS.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING DYNAMIC

CHANGES AS NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORMS EMBRACE COMPETITION.

THIS OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED BY THE GLOBAL MARKET LIBERALIZATION HAS ALLOWED US TO

EXPAND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ACROSS THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA AND THE

PACIFIC.

IN THE AMERICAS, THE DEGREE OF LIBERALIZATION VARIES WIDELY AMONG COUNTRIES. IN

ARGENTINA, CTI OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE. ARGENTINA'S

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WAS PREVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL

GOVERNMENT REGULATION IN A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. DEREGULATION OF THE INDUSTRY

STARTED IN OCTOBER 1999 AND WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2000.

IN VENEZUELA, CANTV'S WIRELESS OPERATIONS HAVE FACED COMPETITION FOR SEVERAL

YEARS. IN LATE 2000, THE GOVERNMENT OPENED THE BASIC TELEPHONY MARKET FOR LOCAL,

NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICE TO COMPETITION AND ISSUED NEW

GUIDELINES GOVERNING INTERCONNECTION AND THE USE OF WIRELESS SPECTRUM. CANTV,

HOWEVER, CONTINUES TO BE VENEZUELA'S PRINCIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER.

IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, CODETEL FACES BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS COMPETITORS.

WHILE THE COMPETITION HAS SLOWED BOTH ACCESS LINE AND WIRELESS SUBSCRIBER

GROWTH, CODETEL REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL PROVIDER OF LOCAL, NATIONAL AND

INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE, WIRELESS AND INTERNET SERVICES.

THE MEXICAN WIRELESS AND LONG DISTANCE MARKETS EACH HAVE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT

COMPETITORS. DURING 2001, IUSACELL MADE PROGRESS TOWARDS ITS GOAL OF ACHIEVING A

NATIONAL WIRELESS OPERATING FOOTPRINT WITH ITS FOURTH QUARTER ACQUISITION OF

GRUPO PORTATEL, S.A. DE C.V., A WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN SOUTHERN MEXICO,

AND LAUNCH OF WIRELESS SERVICES IN NORTHEASTERN AND NORTHWESTERN MEXICO. WITH

RESPECT TO REGULATORY MATTERS, MEXICO'S LEGAL SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE UNABLE TO

IMPLEMENT OR ENFORCE EFFECTIVE DOMINANT CARRIER REGULATION AGAINST TELEFONOS DE

MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V. (TELMEX), THE DOMINANT LOCAL WIRELINE AND LONG DISTANCE

CARRIER, AND RADIOMOVIL DIPSA, S.A. DE C.V. (TELCEL), THE DOMINANT WIRELESS

PROVIDER. FOR EXAMPLE, IN NOVEMBER 2001, TELMEX AND TELCEL CHOSE NOT TO

IMPLEMENT A NEW NATIONAL NUMBERING PLAN, PLACING IUSACELL AND OTHER COMPLYING

CARRIERS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. TO DATE, THE MEXICAN MINISTRY OF

COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORT HAS CHOSEN NOT TO IMPOSE ANY SANCTIONS AGAINST

EITHER CARRIER.

IN PUERTO RICO, FIVE OTHER FACILITIES-BASED PROVIDERS OPERATE IN THE WIRELESS

MARKET. ALL WIRELINE SERVICES, INCLUDING LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, INTERNET ACCESS

AND DATA, HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED NEW COMPETITION. NEVERTHELESS, TELPRI CONTINUES

TO BE THE PRINCIPAL PROVIDER OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN PUERTO RICO TO

BOTH THE BUSINESS AND CONSUMER MARKETS. WITH RESPECT TO REGULATORY MATTERS, THE

PUERTO RICO TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY BOARD RECENTLY ISSUED AN ORDER

REQUIRING SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN ACCESS RATES FOR INTRA-ISLAND LONG DISTANCE

SERVICE.

IN ASIA, TAIWAN CELLULAR CORPORATION CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS WIRELESS NETWORK

SYSTEM. TAIWAN CELLULAR CURRENTLY HAS 6.6 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS, THE HIGHEST

NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS OF ANY WIRELESS OPERATOR IN THE COUNTRY.

13

IN GREECE, THE GOVERNMENT APPROVED A BILL DEREGULATING THE COUNTRY'S

TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET AS OF JANUARY 1, 2001, ENDING HELLENIC

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ORGANIZATION SA'S FIXED LINE MONOPOLY. IN JULY 2001, STET

HELLAS WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE SPECTRUM.

IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, EUROTEL PRAHA WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THE

THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE SPECTRUM IN DECEMBER 2001.

IN ITALY, OMNITEL WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE SPECTRUM IN

2000. SUBSEQUENTLY, IN NOVEMBER 2001, THE LIVES OF THE FIVE THIRD-GENERATION

MOBILE LICENSES ISSUED WERE EXTENDED FROM 15 YEARS TO 20 YEARS PROVIDING THE

OPERATORS ADDITIONAL TIME TO RECOVER THEIR COSTS.

OUR EXISTING CANADIAN FOOTPRINT WITH THE CREATION OF A NEW COMPANY, DOMINION

INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

OUR DIRECTORY PUBLISHING BUSINESS COMPETES WITHIN THE YELLOW PAGES INDUSTRY WITH

FIVE MAJOR U.S.-BASED DIRECTORY PUBLISHERS (SBC COMMUNICATIONS INC., BELLSOUTH

CORPORATION, SPRINT CORPORATION, YELLOW BOOK USA, AND QWESTDEX), AND ENCOUNTERS

COMPETITION IN NEARLY ALL OUR DOMESTIC PRINT MARKETS. WE ALSO COMPETE AGAINST

ALTERNATIVE ADVERTISING MEDIA, INCLUDING RADIO, NETWORK AND CABLE TELEVISION,

VERIZON WIRELESS

FCC AUCTION

ON JANUARY 29, 2001, THE BIDDING PHASE OF THE FCC REAUCTION OF 1.9 GHZ C AND F

BLOCK BROADBAND PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SPECTRUM LICENSES, WHICH BEGAN

DECEMBER 12, 2000, OFFICIALLY ENDED. VERIZON WIRELESS WAS THE WINNING BIDDER FOR

113 LICENSES. THE TOTAL PRICE OF THESE LICENSES WAS $8,781 MILLION, $1,822

MILLION OF WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID. MOST OF THE LICENSES THAT WERE

REAUCTIONED RELATE TO SPECTRUM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY LICENSED TO NEXTWAVE PERSONAL

COMMUNICATIONS INC. AND NEXTWAVE POWER PARTNERS INC. (COLLECTIVELY NEXTWAVE),

WHICH HAVE APPEALED TO THE FEDERAL COURTS THE FCC'S ACTION CANCELING NEXTWAVE'S

LICENSES AND RECLAIMING THE SPECTRUM.

IN A DECISION ON JUNE 22, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT

RULED THAT THE FCC'S CANCELLATION AND REPOSSESSION OF NEXTWAVE'S LICENSES WAS

UNLAWFUL. THE FCC SOUGHT A STAY OF THE COURT'S DECISION WHICH WAS DENIED. THE

FCC SUBSEQUENTLY REINSTATED NEXTWAVE'S LICENSES, BUT IT HAS NEITHER RETURNED

VERIZON WIRELESS'S PAYMENT ON THE NEXTWAVE LICENSES NOR HAS IT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

THE COURT'S DECISION EXTINGUISHED VERIZON WIRELESS'S OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE THE

LICENSES. ON OCTOBER 19, 2001 THE FCC FILED A PETITION WITH THE U.S. SUPREME

COURT TO REVERSE THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT'S DECISION. ON

MARCH 4, 2002, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT GRANTED THE FCC'S PETITION AND AGREED TO

HEAR THE APPEAL.

TIMING OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO)

IN NOVEMBER 2001, VERIZON WIRELESS INC. FILED AN AMENDED REGISTRATION STATEMENT

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) IN CONNECTION WITH THE

INC. REGISTRATION STATEMENT WAS INITIALLY FILED WITH THE SEC, WE HAVE

PERIODICALLY REITERATED THAT THE IPO WOULD OCCUR WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

FAVORABLE.

IN OCTOBER 2001, WE AGREED TO SELL ALL 675,000 OF OUR SWITCHED ACCESS TELEPHONE

LINES IN ALABAMA AND MISSOURI TO CENTURYTEL INC. FOR $2.2 BILLION. THE SALE MUST

BE APPROVED BY THE MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, THE FCC AND THE

SALE IN DECEMBER 2001. WE EXPECT TO CLOSE THE SALE AND TRANSFER OUR OPERATIONS

TO CENTURYTEL DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2002.

ALSO IN OCTOBER 2001, WE AGREED TO SELL APPROXIMATELY 600,000 ACCESS LINES IN
