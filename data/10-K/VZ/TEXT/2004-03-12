INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON PAGES 19 THROUGH 25 AND IN NOTE 17 ON PAGES 62 THROUGH 64 OF THE 2003 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

DOMESTIC TELECOM

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTING OUR WIRELINE TELEPHONE OPERATIONS,

PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 60% OF 2003 TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS PRESENTLY SERVE A TERRITORY CONSISTING OF 140.3 MILLION ACCESS LINE EQUIVALENTS IN 29 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THIS SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDES LONG DISTANCE

AND OTHER TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES. DOMESTIC TELECOM PROVIDES MAINLY TWO TYPES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.



EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE IS THE TRANSMISSION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMONG CUSTOMERS LOCATED WITHIN A LOCAL CALLING AREA WITHIN A LOCAL ACCESS AND TRANSPORT AREA (LATA).

EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INCLUDE SWITCHED LOCAL RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES, LOCAL PRIVATE LINE VOICE AND DATA SERVICES AND CENTREX SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE TOLL SERVICES WITHIN A LATA (INTRALATA LONG DISTANCE) AND

TOLL SERVICES OUTSIDE A LATA (INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE).



EXCHANGE ACCESS SERVICE LINKS A CUSTOMERS PREMISES AND THE TRANSMISSION FACILITIES OF OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS, GENERALLY INTERLATA CARRIERS. EXAMPLES OF EXCHANGE

ACCESS SERVICES INCLUDE SWITCHED ACCESS AND SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES.

WE HAVE ORGANIZED OUR DOMESTIC TELECOM SEGMENT INTO FOUR MARKETING UNITS OPERATING ACROSS OUR TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARIES. THE UNITS FOCUS ON SPECIFIC MARKETS. WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS REMAIN

RESPONSIBLE WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE AREAS FOR THE PROVISION OF TELEPHONE SERVICES, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND REGULATORY MATTERS.

THE

ENTERPRISE

UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES TO LARGE BUSINESSES AND TO DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES AND OFFICES OF THE EXECUTIVE,

JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THESE SERVICES INCLUDE VOICE SWITCHING/PROCESSING SERVICES (E.G., DEDICATED PRIVATE LINES, CUSTOM CENTREX, CALL MANAGEMENT AND VOICE MESSAGING), END-USER NETWORKING

(E.G., CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AND PERSONAL COMPUTER-BASED CONFERENCING, INCLUDING DATA AND VIDEO), INTERNETWORKING (ESTABLISHING LINKS BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPARATE NETWORKS OF TWO OR MORE COMPANIES OR WITHIN THE SAME COMPANY),

NETWORK OPTIMIZATION (DISASTER AVOIDANCE AND 911 SERVICE) AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. THE ENTERPRISE UNIT ALSO PROVIDES DATA TRANSMISSION, INTERNET AND NETWORK INTEGRATION SERVICES, INTERLATA LONG DISTANCE SERVICES, NETWORK MONITORING

SERVICES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SALES TO MEDIUM AND

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LARGE BUSINESSES. REVENUES IN 2003 WERE APPROXIMATELY $6.6 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 17% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

THE

RETAIL

UNIT MARKETS COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL

CUSTOMERS AND TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES WITHIN OUR TERRITORY, INCLUDING OUR LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES. OUR LONG DISTANCE SUBSIDIARY PROVIDES NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICES IN ALL 50 STATES TO

RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CALLING CARDS, 800/888 SERVICES AND OPERATOR SERVICES. THIS UNIT ALSO PROVIDES OPERATOR AND PAY TELEPHONE SERVICES AND SELLS CUSTOMER PREMISES EQUIPMENT. REVENUES IN 2003 WERE APPROXIMATELY $23.0

BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 58% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES. THESE REVENUES WERE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE PROVISION OF TELEPHONE SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL USERS.

THE

WHOLESALE

UNIT MARKETS OUR NETWORK OPERATIONS, WHICH PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES OUR CARRIER ACCESS AND TELECOM INDUSTRY SERVICES.

REVENUES IN 2003 WERE APPROXIMATELY $8.6 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 22% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES. APPROXIMATELY 68% OF TOTAL WHOLESALE REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS (SWITCHED AND SPECIAL ACCESS). THE

REMAINING REVENUES COME FROM OUR TELECOM INDUSTRY SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY FROM OTHER LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS WHICH RESELL NETWORK CONNECTIONS TO THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS.

THE

NETWORK

UNIT IS PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS NETWORKS. THIS

UNIT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY AND SUPPLIES FOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND SELLS MATERIALS AND LOGISTIC SERVICES TO THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS. REVENUES IN 2003 (AFTER ELIMINATIONS AND COMBINED WITH ALL OTHER DOMESTIC

TELECOM REVENUES) WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 3% OF DOMESTIC TELECOMS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996

WE FACE INCREASING COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 (THE 1996 ACT), REGULATORY AND JUDICIAL ACTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO FEWER REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT DEFINITIVELY THE IMPACT THAT THE ONGOING CHANGES

IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE FINANCIAL IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS OF COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS, THE

TIMING AND OUTCOME OF VARIOUS REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND ANY APPEALS, AND THE TIMING, EXTENT AND SUCCESS OF OUR PURSUIT OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES RESULTING FROM THE 1996 ACT AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.

IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE

UNDER THE 1996 ACT, OUR ABILITY TO OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE SERVICES IN THE REGIONS WHERE THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC TELEPHONE

SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE AS LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS WAS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SATISFYING SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED A 14-POINT COMPETITIVE CHECKLIST OF STEPS WHICH WE MUST TAKE TO HELP COMPETITORS OFFER LOCAL SERVICES

THROUGH RESALE, THROUGH PURCHASE OF UNBUNDLED NETWORK ELEMENTS (UNES), OR BY INTERCONNECTING THEIR OWN NETWORKS TO OURS. WE WERE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) THAT OUR ENTRY INTO THE IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE

MARKET WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

WE NOW HAVE AUTHORITY FROM THE FCC TO

OFFER IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE SERVICE IN ALL 14 OF THE FORMER BELL ATLANTIC JURISDICTIONS. THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REMANDED THE MASSACHUSETTS ORDER TO THE FCC FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION ON ONE ISSUE, BUT LEFT OUR

LONG DISTANCE AUTHORITY IN EFFECT. THE FCCS ORDERS FOR THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONS WERE UPHELD ON APPEAL OR NO APPEAL WAS FILED.

FCC REGULATION AND INTERSTATE RATES

OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FCC WITH RESPECT TO INTERSTATE SERVICES AND RELATED MATTERS.

ACCESS CHARGES AND UNIVERSAL SERVICE

ON MAY 31, 2000, THE FCC ADOPTED THE COALITION FOR AFFORDABLE LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE

SERVICES (CALLS) PLAN AS A COMPREHENSIVE FIVE-YEAR PLAN FOR REGULATION OF INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGES. THE CALLS PLAN HAS THREE MAIN COMPONENTS. FIRST, IT ESTABLISHES A PORTABLE INTERSTATE ACCESS UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT OF $650 MILLION FOR THE

INDUSTRY. THIS EXPLICIT SUPPORT REPLACES IMPLICIT SUPPORT EMBEDDED IN INTERSTATE ACCESS CHARGES. SECOND, THE PLAN SIMPLIFIES THE PATCHWORK OF COMMON LINE CHARGES INTO ONE SUBSCRIBER LINE CHARGE (SLC) AND PROVIDES FOR DE-AVERAGING OF THE SLC BY ZONES

AND CLASS OF CUSTOMERS IN A MANNER THAT WILL NOT UNDERMINE COMPARABLE AND AFFORDABLE UNIVERSAL SERVICE. THIRD, THE PLAN SETS INTO PLACE A MECHANISM TO TRANSITION TO A SET TARGET OF $.0055 PER MINUTE FOR SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES. ONCE THAT TARGET

RATE IS REACHED, LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO MAKE FURTHER ANNUAL PRICE CAP REDUCTIONS TO THEIR SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES. THE ANNUAL REDUCTIONS LEADING TO THE TARGET RATE, AS WELL AS ANNUAL REDUCTIONS FOR THE SUBSET OF SPECIAL

ACCESS SERVICES THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO PRICE CAP REGULATION WAS SET AT 6.5% PER YEAR.

AS A RESULT OF TARIFF ADJUSTMENTS WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2003, VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR SWITCHED ACCESS LINES REACHED THE $.0055 BENCHMARK.

THE FCC HAS ADOPTED RULES FOR SPECIAL ACCESS SERVICES THAT PROVIDE FOR PRICING FLEXIBILITY AND ULTIMATELY THE REMOVAL OF SERVICES FROM PRICE REGULATION WHEN PRESCRIBED

COMPETITIVE THRESHOLDS ARE MET. APPROXIMATELY 55% OF SPECIAL ACCESS REVENUES ARE NOW REMOVED FROM PRICE REGULATION.

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE FCC ADOPTED A NEW MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT TO HIGH-COST AREAS SERVED BY

LARGE LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES. THIS FUNDING MECHANISM PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICES IN SEVERAL STATES SERVED BY OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS. THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY THE NEW FCC ACCESS CHARGE PLAN DESCRIBED

ABOVE. ON OCTOBER 16, 2003, IN RESPONSE TO A PREVIOUS COURT DECISION, THE FCC ANNOUNCED A DECISION PROVIDING ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS NON-RURAL HIGH-COST UNIVERSAL SUPPORT MECHANISM AND MODIFYING IT IN PART. THE FCC ALSO HAS PROCEEDINGS

UNDERWAY TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE CHANGES TO ITS CURRENT RULES FOR ASSESSING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND. ANY CHANGE IN THE CURRENT ASSESSMENT MECHANISM COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE CONTRIBUTION THAT LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES MUST

MAKE AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS.

UNBUNDLING OF

NETWORK ELEMENTS

ON FEBRUARY 20, 2003, THE FCC ANNOUNCED A DECISION

ADOPTING NEW RULES DEFINING THE OBLIGATIONS OF INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS TO PROVIDE COMPETING CARRIERS WITH ACCESS TO UNES. THE DECISION WAS THE CULMINATION OF AN FCC RULEMAKING REFERRED TO AS ITS TRIENNIAL REVIEW OF ITS UNE RULES, AND ALSO

WAS IN RESPONSE TO A DECISION BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT. THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT HAD OVERTURNED THE FCCS PREVIOUS UNBUNDLING RULES ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE FCC DID NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDER THE

LIMITATIONS OF THE NECESSARY AND IMPAIR STANDARDS OF THE 1996 ACT WHEN IT CHOSE NATIONAL RULES FOR UNBUNDLING AND THAT IT FAILED TO CONSIDER THE RELEVANCE OF COMPETITION FROM OTHER TYPES OF SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING CABLE AND

SATELLITE.

THE TEXT OF THE ORDER AND ACCOMPANYING RULES WAS RELEASED ON AUGUST

21, 2003. WITH RESPECT TO BROADBAND FACILITIES, SUCH AS MASS MARKET FIBER TO THE PREMISES LOOPS AND PACKET SWITCHING, THAT ORDER GENERALLY REMOVED UNBUNDLING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 251 OF THE 1996 ACT. WITH RESPECT TO NARROWBAND SERVICES, THE

ORDER GENERALLY LEFT UNBUNDLING OBLIGATIONS IN PLACE, WITH CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, AND DELEGATED TO STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS A FURTHER REVIEW. THE ORDER ALSO PROVIDED A NEW SET OF CRITERIA RELATING TO WHEN CARRIERS MAY PURCHASE A COMBINATION

OF UNBUNDLED LOOPS AND TRANSPORT ELEMENTS KNOWN AS ENHANCED EXTENDED LOOPS (EELS).

THE FCCS ORDER SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR CARRIERS TO USE EELS FOR NON-LOCAL SERVICE AT REGULATED PRICES SET USING THE PRICING FORMULA THAT APPLIES TO UNES RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE SPECIAL

ACCESS PRICES. IN ADDITION, THE FCCS ORDER ELIMINATES IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS THAT PROTECTED AGAINST THIS KIND OF ARBITRAGE, INCLUDING THE FCCS PREVIOUS RULE AGAINST CO-MINGLING UNBUNDLED ELEMENTS AND OTHER SERVICES. AS A RESULT, WE

ESTIMATE THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS RELATED TO THIS PORTION OF THE FCCS ORDER TO BE POTENTIALLY 4 CENTS TO 6 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2004.

MULTIPLE PARTIES, INCLUDING VERIZON, APPEALED VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE DECISION. MULTIPLE PARTIES ALSO HAVE ASKED THE FCC TO CLARIFY OR RECONSIDER VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS

ORDER, AND VERIZON HAS PETITIONED THE FCC TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ANY BROADBAND FACILITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE TO BE UNBUNDLED UNDER SECTION 251 OF THE 1996 ACT ALSO DO NOT HAVE TO BE UNBUNDLED UNDER ANOTHER PROVISION OF THE 1996 ACT. ON MARCH 2, 2004, THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT ISSUED AN ORDER UPHOLDING THE FCC IN PART, AND OVERTURNING ITS ORDER IN PART. THE COURT UPHELD THE FCC WITH RESPECT TO BROADBAND FACILITIES. ON THE NARROWBAND UNBUNDLING REQUIREMENTS AND ON THE EELS RULES,

THE COURT REVERSED KEY ASPECTS OF THE FCC DECISION. THE COURTS REVERSAL OF THE FCC WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT FOR 60 DAYS FOLLOWING THE RULING OR UNTIL A PETITION FOR REHEARING IS DENIED OR GRANTED.

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION

ON APRIL 27, 2001, THE FCC RELEASED AN ORDER ADDRESSING INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION FOR

DIAL-UP CONNECTIONS FOR INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC. THE FCC FOUND THAT INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC IS INTERSTATE AND SUBJECT TO THE FCCS JURISDICTION. MOREOVER, THE FCC AGAIN FOUND THAT INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC IS NOT SUBJECT TO RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION

UNDER SECTION 251(B)(5) OF THE 1996 ACT. INSTEAD, THE FCC ESTABLISHED FEDERAL RATES PER MINUTE FOR THIS TRAFFIC THAT DECLINE FROM $.0015 TO $.0007 OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THE FCC ORDER ALSO SETS CAPS ON THE TOTAL MINUTES OF THIS TRAFFIC THAT MAY

BE SUBJECT TO ANY INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION AND REQUIRES THAT INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS MUST OFFER TO BOTH BILL AND PAY RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL TRAFFIC AT THE SAME RATE AS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON INTERNET-BOUND TRAFFIC. ON MAY

3, 2002, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT REJECTED PART OF THE FCCS RATIONALE FOR ITS APRIL 27, 2001 ORDER, BUT DECLINED TO VACATE THE ORDER WHILE IT IS ON REMAND. AS A RESULT, PENDING FURTHER ACTION BY THE FCC, THE FCCS

UNDERLYING ORDER REMAINS IN EFFECT.

MORE GENERALLY, THE FCC HAS AN ONGOING

RULEMAKING THAT COULD FUNDAMENTALLY RESTRUCTURE THE REGULATORY REGIME FOR INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACCESS CHARGES, COMPENSATION FOR INTERNET TRAFFIC, AND RECIPROCAL COMPENSATION FOR LOCAL TRAFFIC. THE FCC ALSO IS

CONSIDERING MULTIPLE PETITIONS ASKING IT TO DECLARE WHETHER, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES, SERVICES THAT EMPLOY INTERNET PROTOCOL ARE SUBJECT TO ACCESS CHARGES UNDER CURRENT LAW, OR ASKING IT TO FORBEAR FROM ANY REQUIREMENT TO PAY ACCESS CHARGES ON

SOME SUCH SERVICES. THE FCC ALSO HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT INTENDS TO INITIATE A RULEMAKING PROCEEDING TO ADDRESS THE REGULATION OF VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL SERVICES GENERALLY.

BROADBAND SERVICES

THE FCC HAS SEVERAL ONGOING RULEMAKINGS CONSIDERING THE REGULATORY TREATMENT OF BROADBAND SERVICES. AMONG THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE ARE WHETHER TO REQUIRE LOCAL TELEPHONE

COMPANIES LIKE VERIZON TO OFFER SUCH SERVICES AS A COMMON CARRIER OR WHETHER SUCH SERVICES MAY BE OFFERED UNDER A POTENTIALLY LESS REGULATED PRIVATE CARRIAGE ARRANGEMENT, AND WHETHER TO DECLARE BROADBAND SERVICES OFFERED BY LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES

AS NON-DOMINANT AND WHAT THE EFFECT SHOULD BE OF ANY SUCH CLASSIFICATION.

STATE REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES

STATE PUBLIC UTILITY

COMMISSIONS REGULATE OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTRASTATE RATES AND SERVICES AND OTHER MATTERS. IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THE TELEPHONE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE RATE OF RETURN REGULATION WITH PRICE REGULATION PLANS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC.

ARIZONA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN ARIZONA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

CALIFORNIA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE OPERATED UNDER THE NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK (NRF) SINCE 1990. THE NRF ALLOWS FOR A GRADUAL TRANSITION TO LESS

REGULATION ON A SERVICE-BY-SERVICE BASIS. THE NRF IS REVIEWED EVERY THREE YEARS AND CURRENTLY HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES.



EARNINGS CEILING: THE CEILING IS SUSPENDED.



PRICE CAP INDEX: BY SETTING INFLATION EQUAL TO PRODUCTIVITY, THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (CPUC) HAS SUSPENDED THE PRICE CAP INDEX. LIMITED EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE

ALLOWED. GENERALLY, EXOGENOUS CHANGES ARE CHANGES UNIQUE TO OR SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO A COMPANY THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL (IN THIS CASE, CHANGES ARE PERMITTED ONLY FOR MATTERS MANDATED BY THE CPUC OR CHANGES IN TOTAL INTRASTATE COST RECOVERY

RESULTING FROM CHANGES BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE JURISDICTIONS).



PRICE FLEXIBILITY: SERVICES FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES.



CATEGORY I SERVICES CANNOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT CPUC APPROVAL.



CATEGORY II SERVICES ARE PARTIALLY COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE ADJUSTED WITHIN A CEILING/FLOOR RANGE. THE CURRENT PRICE (EFFECTIVELY THE CEILING) CANNOT BE INCREASED WITHOUT A FORMAL

APPLICATION.



CATEGORY III SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE AND CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED ON SHORT NOTICE.



NEW SERVICES: NEW SERVICES CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS CATEGORY II OR III. IF INTRODUCED AS CATEGORY III, VERIZON CALIFORNIA MUST DEMONSTRATE INSIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER.

THE CPUC WILL REVIEW NRF FEATURES DURING 2003  2004.

NEVADA

VERIZON CALIFORNIAS OPERATIONS IN NEVADA ARE SUBJECT

TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

VERIZON DELAWARE INC.

SINCE 1994, VERIZON DELAWARE HAS BEEN REGULATED UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE REGULATION PROVISIONS

OF THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT ACT OF 1993 (DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT). ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2003, THE DELAWARE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPROVED A STIPULATION PERMITTING VERIZON DELAWARE TO CONTINUE TO BE REGULATED UNDER

THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2006. THE DELAWARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING.



THE PRICES OF BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICES (E.G., DIAL-TONE AND LOCAL USAGE) WILL REMAIN REGULATED AND CANNOT CHANGE IN ANY ONE YEAR BY MORE THAN THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT

 PRICE INDEX (GDP-PI) LESS 3%.



THE PRICES OF DISCRETIONARY SERVICES (E.G., IDENTA RING(SM) AND CALL WAITING) CANNOT INCREASE MORE THAN 15% PER YEAR PER SERVICE.



THE PRICES OF COMPETITIVE SERVICES (E.G., VOICE MESSAGING AND MESSAGE TOLL SERVICE) ARE NOT SUBJECT TO TARIFF OR REGULATION.



VERIZON DELAWARE WILL DEVELOP A TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENT PLAN WITH A COMMITMENT TO INVEST A MINIMUM OF $250 MILLION IN DELAWARES TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK DURING THE FIRST FIVE

YEARS OF THE PLAN.

VERIZON FLORIDA INC.

FLORIDA STATUTES GOVERN THE PRICE CAP PLAN. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2001, VERIZON FLORIDA WAS

ABLE TO RAISE BASIC LOCAL RATES ON 30 DAYS NOTICE ONCE IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED THE GDP-PI LESS 1%. VERIZON FLORIDA MAY INCREASE RATES FOR NON-BASIC SERVICES BUT INCREASES FOR ANY CATEGORY CANNOT EXCEED 6% IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD UNLESS

ANOTHER COMPANY IS PROVIDING SERVICE IN A GIVEN EXCHANGE, AT WHICH TIME VERIZON FLORIDA CAN INCREASE ITS PRICE UP TO 20% IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED. LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN 2003 THAT ALLOWS VERIZON FLORIDA TO OFFSET A

REDUCTION IN INTRASTATE ACCESS RATES WITH AN INCREASE IN BASIC LOCAL EXCHANGE REVENUES UPON FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (FPSC) APPROVAL. THE OFFSET MUST BE REVENUE NEUTRAL AND TAKE PLACE OVER TWO TO FOUR YEARS. IN EVALUATING THE PETITION, THE

FPSC IS TO CONSIDER WHETHER GRANTING THE PETITION WILL REMOVE CURRENT SUPPORT FOR BASIC LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES PREVENTING THE CREATION OF A MORE ATTRACTIVE COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKET FOR THE BENEFIT OF RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS AND

ENHANCED MARKET ENTRY. WHEN VERIZON FLORIDAS RATES

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE REDUCED TO PARITY AS DEFINED BY THE STATUTE, VERIZON FLORIDAS BASIC SERVICES BECOME SUBJECT TO THE SAME REGULATORY TREATMENT AS ITS NON-BASIC

SERVICES.

VERIZON HAWAII INC.

VERIZON HAWAIIS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

VERIZON MARYLAND INC.

IN 1996, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND APPROVED A PRICE CAP PLAN FOR REGULATING

THE INTRASTATE SERVICES PROVIDED BY VERIZON MARYLAND. UNDER THE PLAN, SERVICES ARE DIVIDED INTO SIX CATEGORIES: ACCESS; BASIC-RESIDENTIAL; BASIC-BUSINESS; DISCRETIONARY; COMPETITIVE; AND MISCELLANEOUS. RATES FOR ACCESS, BASIC-RESIDENTIAL,

BASIC-BUSINESS AND DISCRETIONARY SERVICES CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED ANNUALLY UNDER A FORMULA THAT IS BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE GDP-PI MINUS A PRODUCTIVITY OFFSET BASED UPON CHANGES IN THE RATE OF INFLATION AS REFLECTED IN THE CONSUMER PRICE

INDEX (CPI). RATES FOR COMPETITIVE SERVICES MAY BE INCREASED WITHOUT REGULATORY LIMITS. REGULATION OF PROFITS IS ELIMINATED. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN. VERIZON MARYLAND HAS SOUGHT

TO ELIMINATE THE PRICE CAP FORMULA AND TO MOVE ALL BUSINESS SERVICES INTO THE COMPETITIVE CATEGORY.

VERIZON NEW ENGLAND INC.

MAINE

IN JUNE 2001, THE MAINE PUBLIC

UTILITIES COMMISSION (MPUC) ORDERED THE CONTINUATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF REGULATION (AFOR) FOR VERIZON MAINE FOR A SECOND FIVE-YEAR TERM. KEY ASPECTS OF THE PLAN.



ELIMINATES ANNUAL FILINGS TO ADJUST RATES OF CORE SERVICES;



ELIMINATES THE 4.5% PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR APPLIED IN THE INITIAL AFOR TERM;



PROVIDES TOTAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL SERVICES EXCEPT LOCAL SERVICE, OPERATOR SERVICES AND DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE;



ALLOWS AN INCREASE IN LOCAL SERVICE RATES THAT OFFSETS (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) A LEGISLATIVELY REQUIRED ACCESS CHARGE REDUCTION;



REJECTS PROPOSALS TO INSTITUTE OVER 9,000 RETAIL SERVICE QUALITY MEASURES AND INSTEAD CONTINUES THE CURRENT SERVICE QUALITY PLAN WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS; AND



REQUIRES MONITORING OF VERIZON MAINES TOLL RATE/REVENUE REDUCTIONS TO INSURE THAT TOLL USERS BENEFIT FROM THE ACCESS REDUCTIONS, EITHER IN REDUCED TOLL RATES FROM VERIZON

MAINE, OR IN TOLL SAVINGS FROM ALTERNATIVE CARRIERS. AT THE END OF A TWO-YEAR MONITORING PERIOD THAT BEGAN DECEMBER 31, 2000, VERIZON MAINES TOLL RATES/REVENUES MUST BE $19.8 MILLION LOWER, OR ADDITIONAL CUTS IN TOLL RATES WILL BE REQUIRED.

THEREAFTER, TOLL RATES ARE UNRESTRICTED. ON FEBRUARY 6, 2003, VERIZON MAINE FILED WITH THE MPUC PROOF THAT THE REQUIRED REDUCTION IN TOLL REVENUES HAD OCCURRED AND THAT NO FURTHER REGULATION OF TOLL PRICES IS REQUIRED. MPUC CONSIDERATION OF VERIZON

MAINES FILING IS PENDING.

THE MAINE PUBLIC ADVOCATE

APPEALED THE MPUCS 2001 AFOR DECISION TO THE MAINE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT, CLAIMING THAT ANY EXTENSION TO THE AFOR MUST BE PRECEDED BY AN INVESTIGATION OF VERIZON MAINES COSTS AND EARNINGS UTILIZING TRADITIONAL RATE OF RETURN PRINCIPLES.

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2003, THE COURT RULED THAT WHILE STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT TELEPHONE RATES UNDER AN AFOR ARE NO HIGHER THAN UNDER RATE OF RETURN REGULATION, THE MPUC HAS BROAD DISCRETION IN MAKING SUCH A DETERMINATION THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY

REQUIRE A FULL RATE OF RETURN INQUIRY. HOWEVER, THE COURT VACATED AND REMANDED THE DECISION TO THE MPUC FOR ITS FAILURE TO EXPRESSLY MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE THAT IF SUCH A SHOWING CANNOT BE MADE, THAT IT NONETHELESS REMAINS

IN THE BEST INTEREST OF RATEPAYERS TO PROCEED WITH AN AFOR. NO CHANGE IN ANY OF VERIZON MAINES RATES WAS REQUIRED BY THE COURTS DECISION WHILE THE REMAND PROCEEDING WAS PENDING.

IN MARCH 2003, THE MPUC OPENED A PROCEEDING TO ADDRESS THE MAINE SUPREME JUDICIAL

COURTS REMAND OF THE 2001 AFOR DECISION. IN AN ORDER ISSUED ON JULY 11, 2003, THE MPUC RULED THAT IT WOULD KEEP IN PLACE THE $1.78 INCREASE IN VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS MONTHLY BASIC EXCHANGE RATES PENDING COMPLETION OF THE REMAND AND

MAINTAIN CERTAIN ELEMENTS (PRICING FLEXIBILITY, SERVICE QUALITY INDEX) OF THE PROPOSED AFOR ON AN INTERIM BASIS UNTIL A FINAL DECISION ON THE REMAND. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2003, THE PUC ISSUED AN ORDER REINSTATING THE AFOR. CERTAIN PARTIES HAVE APPEALED

THAT DECISION TO THE MAINE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT AND THE APPEAL IS PENDING.

MASSACHUSETTS

IN APRIL 2001, VERIZON NEW

ENGLAND FILED WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY (DTE) A PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN TO REPLACE THE PRICE REGULATION PLAN THAT WAS TO EXPIRE IN AUGUST 2001. ON MAY 8, 2002, THE DTE ISSUED ITS DECISION IN

PHASE I OF THE CASE IN WHICH IT FOUND THAT VERIZON NEW ENGLAND HAD DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENT COMPETITION FOR MOST OF ITS RETAIL BUSINESS SERVICES AND GRANTED VERIZON NEW ENGLAND PRICING FLEXIBILITY ON THE SERVICES. PRICE INCREASES ARE

NOT CONSTRAINED. PRICE DECREASES ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLOOR REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE DTE RULED THAT VERIZON NEW ENGLAND SHOULD REDUCE STATE SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES TO INTERSTATE LEVELS ON A REVENUE NEUTRAL BASIS BY INCREASES IN RESIDENCE

DIAL-TONE RATES. WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENCE SERVICES, THE DTE TENTATIVELY CONCLUDED THAT VERIZON

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NEW ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR NON-BASIC SERVICES BUT THAT INCREASES IN BASIC SERVICES SHOULD BE LIMITED. THE DTE DIRECTED VERIZON NEW

ENGLAND TO FILE PROPOSALS CONSISTENT WITH ITS FINDINGS.

IN MAY 2003, THE DTE

ISSUED A FINAL RULING APPROVING WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS COMPLIANCE FILING IMPLEMENTING THE DTES ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN. THE PLAN GIVES VERIZON NEW ENGLAND PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR MOST RETAIL BUSINESS SERVICES

AND RESIDENCE NON-BASIC SERVICES, INCLUDING SECOND DIAL-TONE LINES. THE DTE ALSO APPROVED RATE REDUCTIONS FOR STATE SWITCHED ACCESS PRICES TO INTERSTATE LEVELS WITH OFFSETTING REVENUE-NEUTRAL INCREASES IN RESIDENCE DIAL-TONE RATES. THOSE RATE

CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JUNE 1, 2003.

NEW

HAMPSHIRE

VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS OPERATIONS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE

CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION. ON JANUARY 16, 2004, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (NHPUC) CONCLUDED A COMPREHENSIVE PROCEEDING EXAMINING THE APPROPRIATE COST OF CAPITAL FOR VERIZON. IN ITS ORDER, THE NHPUC SET THE

AVERAGE WEIGHTED COST OF CAPITAL FOR VERIZON AT 8.2%. AT PRESENT, THE NEWLY DETERMINED COST OF CAPITAL HAS NO EFFECT ON VERIZONS RETAIL RATES, HOWEVER, THE NHPUC DIRECTED VERIZON TO FILE REVISED UNE RATES REFLECTING THIS NEW COST OF

DETERMINATION BY MARCH 16, 2004. VERIZONS CURRENT UNE RATES WERE APPROVED IN 2001 RELYING UPON AN AVERAGE WEIGHTED COST OF CAPITAL OF 10.46%. VERIZON WILL FILE AN APPEAL OF THE NHPUC DECISION IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

RHODE ISLAND

PURSUANT TO A DIRECTIVE OF THE RHODE ISLAND PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION (RIPUC), VERIZON

RHODE ISLAND FILED IN JULY 2002 A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW ALTERNATIVE REGULATION PLAN TO REPLACE THE EXISTING PRICE CAP PLAN THAT WAS TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2002. FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN THE CASE, VERIZON RHODE ISLAND AND THE RHODE

ISLAND DIVISION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES AND CARRIERS (DIVISION) FILED A STIPULATION ON DECEMBER 6, 2002 RESOLVING ALL ISSUES IN THE CASE. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE STIPULATED PLAN ARE.



NO INDEX OR PRICE CAP FORMULA;



PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL BUSINESS SERVICES, SUBJECT TO A LONG-RUN INCREMENTAL COST (LRIC)-BASED PRICE FLOOR;



THE COMPANY MAY INCREASE RESIDENTIAL BASIC EXCHANGE RATES BY $1 PER YEAR IN YEARS ONE AND TWO. AN ADDITIONAL $1 INCREASE IN YEAR THREE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RIPUC AND DIVISION REVIEW;



THE COMPANY MAY PASS THROUGH EXOGENOUS CHANGES, SUBJECT TO A $2.5 MILLION ANNUAL CAP, BUT MUST ABSORB THE FIRST $1 MILLION IN EXOGENOUS CHANGES IN THE YEAR IN WHICH APPROVAL IS

SOUGHT;



THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE ITS VOLUNTARY FUNDING OF A DISCOUNT PROGRAM FOR INTERNET ACCESS FOR SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES AT UP TO $2 MILLION PER YEAR UNTIL THE EARLIER OF DECEMBER 31,

2004, OR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM (E.G., LEGISLATION);



THE CURRENT RETAIL SERVICE QUALITY PLAN IS MAINTAINED WITH CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS; AND



THE TERM OF THE PLAN IS THREE YEARS.

AFTER FURTHER HEARING AND BRIEFING, THE RIPUC APPROVED THE STIPULATION AT AN OPEN MEETING ON JANUARY 10, 2003, WITH TWO MODIFICATIONS. FIRST, THE RIPUC IMPOSED LIMITS ON

PRICE INCREASES FOR ALL OTHER NON-BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AS FOLLOWS.

FOR SERVICES PRICED AT $5 OR LESS, RATES MAY INCREASE 15% PER YEAR

FOR SERVICES PRICED AT $5.01 TO $10, RATES MAY INCREASE 10% PER YEAR

FOR SERVICES PRICED OVER $10, RATES MAY INCREASE 5% PER YEAR

SECOND, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO FILE QUARTERLY REPORTS SHOWING FOR EACH WIRE CENTER IN THE

STATE THE NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES SERVED BY THE COMPANY AND THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF ACCESS LINES SERVED BY COMPETITORS. ON MARCH 31, 2003, THE RHODE ISLAND PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ISSUED AN ORDER ADOPTING THE MODIFIED STIPULATION APPROVED ON

JANUARY 10, 2003.

VERMONT

IN 2000, THE VERMONT PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD APPROVED A FIVE-YEAR INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN

THAT WILL PROVIDE VERIZON NEW ENGLAND WITH INCREASED FLEXIBILITY TO INTRODUCE AND PRICE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE PLAN ALSO REMOVES MOST RESTRICTIONS ON VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS EARNINGS FROM VERMONT OPERATIONS DURING THE LIFE OF THE PLAN AND

CONTAINS NO PRODUCTIVITY ADJUSTMENT. THE PLAN LIMITS VERIZON NEW ENGLANDS ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES ON EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND REQUIRES REVENUE REDUCTIONS OF $16.5 MILLION AT THE OUTSET OF THE PLAN, $6.5 MILLION DURING THE FIRST YEAR

OF THE PLAN AND APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION OVER THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF THE PLAN. THE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES SOME SERVICE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL PENALTY.

VERIZON NEW JERSEY INC.

THE 1992 NEW JERSEY TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT CLASSIFIES TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AS COMPETITIVE OR PROTECTED. PROTECTED TELEPHONE

SERVICES INCLUDE BASIC RESIDENCE, TOUCH-TONE, ACCESS SERVICES OTHER THAN THOSE OTHERWISE DEEMED COMPETITIVE BY THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITIES (NJBPU), BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH FOUR LINES OR LESS, AND THE ORDERING,

INSTALLATION AND RESTORATION OF THESE SERVICES. VERIZON NEW JERSEY PROVIDES PROTECTED TELEPHONE SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING VERTICAL SERVICES (RATE-REGULATED SERVICES), UNDER A PLAN FOR ALTERNATIVE FORM OF REGULATION, WHICH

BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 1, 2002, PURSUANT TO A DECISION ANNOUNCED BY THE NJBPU ON JUNE 19, 2002 AND ISSUED AUGUST 19, 2003. THE NEW PLAN ELIMINATES EARNINGS REGULATION, ELIMINATES EARNINGS SHARING PROVISIONS, STREAMLINES THE PROCESS TO INTRODUCE

NEW SERVICES AND STRENGTHENS COMMITMENTS TO SERVICE QUALITY, LIFELINE SERVICE AND SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. A PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE PLAN WAS FILED BY AN OPPOSING PARTY AND IS PENDING.

VERIZON NEW YORK INC.

NEW YORK

THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (NYSPSC) HAS ADOPTED AN INCENTIVE PLAN TO REGULATE THE SERVICES OF VERIZON NEW YORK, EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2002. THE PLAN

PROVIDES PRICING FLEXIBILITY, ADOPTS NEW SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS AND DOES NOT RESTRICT VERIZON NEW YORKS EARNINGS. THE PLAN WILL EXPIRE IN 2004, EXCEPT THAT THE SERVICE QUALITY PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN WILL EXPIRE IN 2005.

THE NEW PLAN.



PERMITS VERIZON NEW YORK TO INCREASE ITS RETAIL RATES BY 3% OF ITS INTRASTATE REVENUES PER YEAR IN EACH OF THE TWO YEARS OF THE PLAN, BUT LIMITS ANY INCREASE ON RESIDENCE SERVICE

FIRST LINES TO $1.85 IN 2002 AND $.65 IN 2003, AND FREEZES RATES AND LOWERS SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGES FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS;



ESTABLISHES STATE-WIDE SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS AND RESTRICTIONS ON VERIZON NEW YORKS PRICING FLEXIBILITY IF IT FAILS TO MEET THOSE

STANDARDS;



ESTABLISHES THAT THE RATES PROVIDED IN THE NYSPSCS JANUARY 2002 ORDER ON PRICING OF UNES WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF THE PLAN; AND



REQUIRES VERIZON NEW YORK TO TRANSITION TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ACCOUNTING FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES, OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

ON JANUARY 22, 2003, THE NYSPSC, NOTING THAT CURRENT FCC AND

NYSPSC COST ALLOCATION AND ACCOUNTING SAFEGUARDS IMPOSED ON VERIZON NEW YORK OFFER STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST ABUSIVE AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS, GRANTED OUR REQUEST TO TERMINATE AN 11-YEAR OLD SET OF STRUCTURAL SAFEGUARDS THAT RESTRICTED TRANSACTIONS

BETWEEN VERIZON NEW YORK AND ITS AFFILIATES.

AS OF MAY 31, 2003, THE NYSPSC

SUSPENDED VERIZON NEW YORKS PRICING FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE INCENTIVE PLAN FOR FAILURE TO MEET THE REQUISITE SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE NYSPSC ALSO ORDERED A SERVICE QUALITY AUDIT BY AN OUTSIDE AUDITOR TO EVALUATE VERIZON

NEW YORKS SERVICE QUALITY AND ADHERENCE TO NYSPSC SERVICE QUALITY STANDARDS. THAT AUDIT IS IN PROGRESS.

CONNECTICUT

IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITY CONTROL ADOPTED AN INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN PROPOSED BY VERIZON NEW YORK, WHICH ELIMINATES REGULATION OF

EARNINGS AND PROVIDES OTHER DEREGULATORY BENEFITS FOR VERIZON NEW YORKS OPERATIONS IN CONNECTICUT. A PETITION TO EXTEND THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THAT PLAN IS CURRENTLY PENDING.

INDIANA

VERIZON NORTHS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN INDIANA ARE SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

MICHIGAN

SINCE THE MICHIGAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT WAS PASSED IN 1991, A FORM OF REGULATION THAT FOCUSES ON SERVICES, PRICES AND COSTS HAS REPLACED RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED. ALL RATES FOR REGULATED SERVICES MUST MEET A COST FLOOR. VERIZON NORTH MAY INCREASE LOCAL

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RATES ANNUALLY UP TO 1% LESS THAN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ANY RATE INCREASES ABOVE THAT AMOUNT MUST BE APPROVED BY THE MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION

(MPSC) AS JUST AND REASONABLE. THE MPSC MAY ONLY APPROVE RATE INCREASES BASED UPON ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING 5 FACTORS: TOTAL SERVICE LRIC; COMPARISON TO OTHER PROVIDER RATES; WHETHER A NEW FUNCTION, FEATURE OR CAPABILITY IS OFFERED;

INCREASE IN COSTS TO PROVIDE LOCAL SERVICE; AND WHETHER FURTHER INVESTMENT IS ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIED. THE MPSC HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER NUMEROUS UNREGULATED SERVICES. OTHER SERVICES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY.

OHIO

VERIZON NORTHS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS IN OHIO ARE

SUBJECT TO RATE OF RETURN REGULATION.

PENNSYLVANIA

ON JULY 26, 2001, THE PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY

COMMISSION (PPUC) REJECTED, IN PART, AND ACCEPTED, IN PART, A PROPOSED PRICE CAP PLAN FILED BY VERIZON NORTH. THE PPUC ACCEPTED, WITH SOME MODIFICATION, THAT PART OF THE PLAN THAT PROVIDED FOR THE DEREGULATION OF THE PRICING OF COMPETITIVE SERVICES;

ELIMINATION OF EARNINGS SHARING; ADOPTION OF A PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR BASED ON INFLATION; A PROVISION TO ADJUST RATES FOR EXOGENOUS EVENTS; AND A PRICE CAP OF RATES OF PROTECTED SERVICES. THE PPUC REJECTED THAT PART OF VERIZON NORTHS PLAN THAT

PROVIDED FOR IMPROVEMENT OF VERIZON NORTHS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PPUC SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED A REVISED INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN FOR VERIZON NORTH THAT REQUIRES, INTER ALIA, UNIVERSAL BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BY 2015.

WISCONSIN

VERIZON NORTH ENTERED A PRICE CAP PLAN IN 1995. THE PLAN DOES NOT REGULATE EARNINGS AND

PRICE CAP INDEX INCREASES CAN BE ACCUMULATED AND DEFERRED UP TO THREE YEARS. THE MAXIMUM INCREASE FOR ANY NON-BASIC RATE ELEMENT IS 10% OR THE INCREASE IN THE GDP-PI, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. BASIC LOCAL SERVICE IS LIMITED TO GDP-PI LESS 2%. INTRASTATE

ACCESS SERVICE MIRRORS INTERSTATE RATES. THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER SERVICES AS LONG AS THEY COVER LRICS. RATE CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE ON ONE DAYS NOTICE AFTER CUSTOMER NOTICE AND NEW SERVICES TAKE EFFECT AFTER TEN DAYS. THE STATUTE

REQUIRES THAT NO EARLIER THAN SIX YEARS, AND NO MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EVERY THREE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN MAY BY RULE INCREASE OR DECREASE THE GDP-PI PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR IN ANY TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD TO REFLECT ANY

STATEWIDE CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTIVITY EXPERIENCE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THE PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR REVIEW IS COMPLETE AND THE FACTOR WAS NOT CHANGED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



CAPS PRICES FOR PROTECTED SERVICES, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS BASIC EXCHANGE SERVICES, SPECIAL ACCESS AND SWITCHED ACCESS, THROUGH 1999; AND



PERMITS REVENUE-NEUTRAL RATE RESTRUCTURING FOR NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES.

THE PPUCS ORDER APPROVING THE BELL ATLANTICGTE MERGER EXTENDED THE CAP ON RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS BASIC EXCHANGE SERVICES THROUGH 2003.

THE PLAN REQUIRES VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA TO PROVIDE A LIFELINE SERVICE FOR RESIDENTIAL

CUSTOMERS. THE PLAN ALSO REQUIRES DEPLOYMENT OF A UNIVERSAL BROADBAND NETWORK. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2003, THE COMMISSION APPROVED A REVISED PLAN THAT REQUIRES VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA TO DEPLOY A UNIVERSAL BROADBAND NETWORK, DEFINED AT 1.544 MEGABITS PER

SECOND, IN THE FOLLOWING PHASES: 50% BY 2004; 60% BY 2006; 70% BY 2008; 80% BY 2010, 90% BY 2012 AND 100% BY 2015. VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA IS ALSO REQUIRED TO MAKE BROADBAND SERVICES AT 45 MBPS AVAILABLE ON A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TIME FRAME TO 50%

OF EXCHANGES BY 2004 AND 100% BY 2015.

IN 2002, VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA PROPOSED

THAT ALL BUSINESS SERVICES BE RECLASSIFIED AS COMPETITIVE. IN AUGUST 2003, THE PPUC DENIED THAT PETITION. VERIZON PENNSYLVANIA HAS FILED FOR RECONSIDERATION BY THE PPUC AND THAT PETITION IS CURRENTLY PENDING.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE STATUTE AUTHORIZING ALTERNATIVE REGULATION IN PENNSYLVANIA EXPIRED. A

PROPOSED NEW BILL WAS PASSED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE OF DELEGATES AND IS PENDING IN THE PENNSYLVANIA SENATE. IN JANUARY 2004, THE PPUC ISSUED A POLICY STATEMENT THAT THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE HAD NO EFFECT UPON CURRENT INCENTIVE REGULATION

PLANS.

VERIZON SOUTH INC.

NORTH CAROLINA

VERIZON SOUTHS OPERATIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN UNDER A PRICE CAP PLAN SINCE

1996 THAT WAS SUBJECT TO REVIEW IN 2002  2003. EARNINGS ARE NOT REGULATED AND LOCAL RATES CAN BE INCREASED BY GDP-PI LESS 2%. RATE INCREASES ARE EFFECTIVE ON FOURTEEN DAYS NOTICE. VERIZON SOUTH HAS COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE RATES FOR

BILLING AND COLLECTION, CENTREX, AND ENHANCED DIGITAL SWITCH SERVICE. THE PRICE CAP PLAN WAS TERMINATED. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE REVIEW WILL BE REINSTATED DURING LATE 2004.

SOUTH CAROLINA

VERIZON SOUTHS SOUTH CAROLINA PRICE CAP PLAN STARTED DURING 2000. UNDER THE STATUTE, EXISTING RATES ARE DEEMED JUST AND REASONABLE ON THE DATE OF NOTIFICATION.

RESIDENTIAL AND SINGLE-LINE BUSINESS LOCAL SERVICE RATES ARE CAPPED FOR TWO YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ELECTION. AFTER TWO YEARS, THESE RATES MAY BE ADJUSTED ANNUALLY PURSUANT TO AN INFLATION-BASED INDEX. RATES FOR OTHER SERVICES ARE FLEXIBLY PRICED.

PRICE DECREASES ARE EFFECTIVE IN SEVEN DAYS. PRICE INCREASES AND NEW SERVICES PRICES ARE EFFECTIVE IN FOURTEEN DAYS.

VIRGINIA

ON DECEMBER 21, 2000, THE VIRGINIA STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION (VSCC) APPROVED A PRICE CAP PLAN FOR VERIZON SOUTH THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO VERIZON

THE PLAN WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001

AND HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE.

VERIZON SOUTHWEST

THE TEXAS PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION REGULATES VERIZON SOUTHWEST UNDER A PRICE CAP PLAN

WITH NO CAP ON EARNINGS PURSUANT TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY ACT (PURA). THE PLAN PLACES SERVICES INTO FOUR CATEGORIES.



BASIC SERVICES  THESE INCLUDE BASIC LOCAL RESIDENTIAL CHARGES SUCH AS SERVICE CONNECTION, MANDATORY EXPANDED CALLING PLANS AND RESIDENTIAL CALL WAITING. PRICE INCREASES PRIOR

TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2005 ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN FCC SEPARATIONS THAT AFFECT NET INCOME BY AT LEAST 10% AND FOR RATE GROUP RECLASSIFICATIONS DUE TO ACCESS LINE GROWTH. AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2005, PRICE INCREASES REQUIRE APPROVAL. FULL

PACKAGING (AN INTEGRATED OFFERING OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES) IS ALLOWED.



NON-BASIC SERVICES  THIS CATEGORY ONLY INCLUDES SWITCHED ACCESS, WHICH IS PRICE-CAPPED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2005. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE LRIC. THE STATUTE CONTAINS NO

EXPIRATION PROVISION.



PRICE-CAPPED NON-BASIC SERVICES  THESE SERVICES INCLUDE BASIC LOCAL BUSINESS CHARGES SUCH AS SERVICE CONNECTION AND BRI-ISDN (BASIC RATE INTERFACE  INTEGRATED SERVICES

DIGITAL NETWORK). THESE SERVICES ARE PRICE-CAPPED UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2005. DECREASES CAN BE MADE TO THE LRIC. FULL PACKAGING IS ALLOWED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VERIZON VIRGINIA INC.

EFFECTIVE IN 1995, THE VSCC APPROVED AN ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY PLAN THAT REGULATES VERIZON VIRGINIAS NONCOMPETITIVE SERVICES ON A PRICE CAP BASIS AND DOES NOT

REGULATE VERIZON VIRGINIAS COMPETITIVE SERVICES. THE PLAN DOES NOT REGULATE PROFITS. IN JUNE 2001, THE VSCC MODIFIED THE PLAN AND EXTENDED THE MORATORIUM ON RATE INCREASES FOR BASIC LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE UNTIL 2004. THE PLAN HAS NO

EXPIRATION DATE.

VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC INC.

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2002, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (DCPSC) APPROVED A

NEW PRICE CAP PLAN FOR LOCAL RETAIL SERVICES PROVIDED BY VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC. KEY PROVISIONS OF THE 2002 PLAN INCLUDE.



A TWO-YEAR TERM;



NO EARNINGS RESTRICTIONS, SERVICE PENALTIES OR REVENUE SHARING;



FOUR SERVICE CATEGORIES: BASIC RESIDENTIAL, BASIC BUSINESS, DISCRETIONARY AND COMPETITIVE;



A CAP ON RESIDENTIAL DIAL-TONE LINE RATES FOR THE TERM OF THE PLAN AND A REDUCTION IN RESIDENTIAL SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGES;



ANNUAL PRICING FLEXIBILITY FOR ALL OTHER BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, WITH THE INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES FROM THESE SERVICES LIMITED TO THE ANNUAL INFLATION RATE (AS MEASURED BY THE

CHANGE IN GDP-PI) AND INCREASES FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL SERVICE IN THE CATEGORY LIMITED TO 10%;



IN NOVEMBER 2003, VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC FILED A MOTION TO EXTEND THE CURRENT INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN INDEFINITELY. IN FEBRUARY 2004, VERIZON WASHINGTON, DC REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PEOPLES

COUNSEL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO EXTEND THE CURRENT PLAN FOR A THREE-YEAR PERIOD WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS. A PETITION TO ACCEPT THAT SETTLEMENT IS CURRENTLY PENDING WITH THE DCPSC.

VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA INC.

ON OCTOBER 3, 2001, THE WEST VIRGINIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WVPSC) APPROVED VERIZON WEST VIRGINIAS NEW INCENTIVE REGULATION PLAN (IRP). THE IRP CONTINUES,

UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FLEXIBLE PRICE REGULATION OF COMPETITIVE SERVICES, CAPS ON BASIC RATES, INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITMENTS AND UNLIMITED EARNINGS FREEDOM THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 1988. IN ADDITION, LONG DISTANCE, WIDE AREA TELEPHONE

SERVICE AND NATIONAL DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE WILL BE RATE-DEREGULATED, AND VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA MAY PETITION FOR THE RATE DEREGULATION OF ANY OTHER SERVICE, EXCEPT BASIC RESIDENTIAL SERVICE, AS EARLY AS JANUARY 1, 2002.

IN ADDITION, VERIZON WEST VIRGINIA WILL PHASE-IN AN ANNUAL RATE DECREASE OF $19.2 MILLION BY

JULY 2004. CUMULATIVE RATE REDUCTIONS WILL BE $91.7 MILLION OVER THE FIVE-YEAR LIFE OF THE IRP, AND TOTAL ANNUAL REDUCTIONS BY THE END OF THE IRP WILL BE $26 MILLION.

COMPETITION

CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS IN TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES INCLUDE LONG DISTANCE COMPANIES, OTHER LOCAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS, FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION AND EXISTING CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION AND MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH.

LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES

THE ABILITY TO

OFFER LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS. APPLICATIONS FROM COMPETITORS TO PROVIDE AND RESELL LOCAL EXCHANGE SERVICES HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN EVERY JURISDICTION IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY.

THE 1996 ACT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS.

ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE 1996 ACT WAS TO ENSURE, AND ACCELERATE, THE EMERGENCE OF COMPETITION IN LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS. TOWARD THIS END, THE 1996 ACT REQUIRES MOST EXISTING LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (INCUMBENT LOCAL

EXCHANGE CARRIERS, OR ILECS), INCLUDING OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS, TO PERMIT POTENTIAL COMPETITORS (CLECS) TO.



PURCHASE SERVICE FROM THE ILEC FOR RESALE TO CLEC CUSTOMERS;

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS



PURCHASE UNES FROM THE ILEC; AND/OR



INTERCONNECT THE CLECS NETWORK WITH THE ILECS NETWORK.

AS A RESULT, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES TO INCREASE. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO CLECS AT DISCOUNTS

OF APPROXIMATELY 56% FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE RATES WE CHARGE LOCAL EXCHANGE COMPETITORS FOR ACCESS TO UNES REMAIN UNDER NEAR-CONTINUAL REVIEW AND REVISION BY STATE REGULATORS AND OFTEN RESULT IN

REDUCTIONS IN THOSE RATES. SEE STATE REGULATION OF RATES AND SERVICES.

LONG DISTANCE SERVICES

WE OFFER INTRALATA AND INTERLATA LONG

DISTANCE SERVICES. INTRALATA TOLL CALLS ORIGINATE AND TERMINATE WITHIN THE SAME LATA, BUT GENERALLY COVER A GREATER DISTANCE THAN A LOCAL CALL. STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS RATHER THAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES GENERALLY REGULATE THESE SERVICES. FEDERAL

REGULATORS HAVE JURISDICTION OVER INTERSTATE TOLL SERVICES. ALL OF OUR STATE REGULATORY COMMISSIONS (EXCEPT IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, WHERE INTRALATA TOLL SERVICE IS NOT PROVIDED) PERMIT OTHER CARRIERS TO OFFER INTRALATA TOLL SERVICES WITHIN THE

STATE. INTERLATA TOLL CALLS TERMINATE OUTSIDE THE LATA OF ORIGINATION. WE NOW OFFER LONG DISTANCE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CAPPING A SEVEN-YEAR EFFORT. OUR AUTHORITY IN ALASKA IS LIMITED TO INTERSTATE AND INTERNATIONAL SERVICES. A

NUMBER OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS IN THE LONG DISTANCE BUSINESS HAVE STRONG BRAND RECOGNITION AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

ALTERNATIVE ACCESS SERVICES

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS REVENUES FROM BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS IS DERIVED FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF LARGE, MULTIPLE-LINE

SUBSCRIBERS.

WE FACE COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS,

CONSTRUCTED BY LARGE END-USERS, INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS AND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS VENDORS, WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF ORIGINATING AND/OR TERMINATING CALLS WITHOUT THE USE OF OUR PLANT. THE FCCS ORDERS REQUIRING US TO OFFER COLLOCATED INTERCONNECTION FOR

SPECIAL AND SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICES HAVE ENHANCED THE ABILITY OF SUCH ALTERNATIVE ACCESS PROVIDERS TO COMPETE WITH US.

OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF COMPETITION INCLUDE CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS, SHARED TENANT SERVICES AND OTHER NONCARRIER SYSTEMS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF BYPASSING OUR TELEPHONE

OPERATIONS LOCAL PLANT, EITHER PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY, THROUGH SUBSTITUTION OF SPECIAL ACCESS FOR SWITCHED ACCESS OR THROUGH CONCENTRATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ON FEWER OF OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS LINES.

WIRELESS SERVICES

WIRELESS SERVICES ALSO CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF COMPETITION TO OUR WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, ESPECIALLY AS WIRELESS

CARRIERS (INCLUDING VERIZON WIRELESS) EXPAND AND IMPROVE THEIR NETWORK COVERAGE AND CONTINUE TO LOWER THEIR PRICES TO END-USERS. AS A RESULT, MORE END-USERS ARE SUBSTITUTING WIRELESS SERVICES FOR BASIC WIRELINE SERVICE. WIRELESS TELEPHONE SERVICES

CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DATA TRANSMISSION.

PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES

THE GROWTH OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED USAGE

OF PUBLIC TELEPHONES, AS MORE CUSTOMERS ARE SUBSTITUTING WIRELESS SERVICES FOR PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER PROVIDERS OF PUBLIC TELEPHONE SERVICES.

OPERATOR SERVICES

OUR OPERATOR SERVICES PRODUCT LINE FACES COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE OPERATOR SERVICES PROVIDERS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.

DOMESTIC

WIRELESS

OPERATIONS

OUR DOMESTIC WIRELESS SEGMENT PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT SALES

IN THE UNITED STATES, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH VERIZON WIRELESS.

VERIZON WIRELESS

IS THE LEADING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS, REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME. VERIZON WIRELESS HAS THE LARGEST CUSTOMER BASE OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS PROVIDER, WITH 37.5 MILLION WIRELESS

SUBSCRIBERS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, AND PROVIDES WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. APPROXIMATELY 262 MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE IN AREAS OF THE U.S. IN WHICH WE HAVE FCC LICENSES TO OFFER OUR SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 236

MILLION PEOPLE RESIDE IN AREAS COVERED BY OUR SERVICE. THIS COVERAGE INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE POPULATION IN OUR LICENSED AREAS AND 49 OF THE 50 AND 97 OF THE 100 MOST POPULATED U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WIRELESS LICENSES ARE GRANTED BY THE FCC FOR AN INITIAL 10-YEAR TERM AND ARE RENEWABLE FOR SUCCESSIVE 10-YEAR TERMS. TO

DATE, ALL VERIZON WIRELESS AND PREDECESSOR COMPANY WIRELESS LICENSES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RENEWED.

BACKGROUND

THE WIRELESS JOINT VENTURE

WAS FORMED IN APRIL 2000 IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE). THE WIRELESS JOINT VENTURE OPERATES AS VERIZON WIRELESS. VERIZON OWNS A CONTROLLING 55% INTEREST

IN VERIZON WIRELESS AND VODAFONE OWNS THE REMAINING 45%.

RECENT

ACQUISITIONS

SPECTRUM ACQUISITION

IN MAY 2003, WE ACQUIRED 50 WIRELESS LICENSES AND RELATED NETWORK ASSETS FROM NORTHCOAST

COMMUNICATIONS LLC FOR $762 MILLION IN CASH. THE LICENSES PROVIDE VERIZON WIRELESS WITH ADDITIONAL GROWTH CAPACITY OVER LARGE PORTIONS OF THE EAST COAST AND MIDWEST. TOTAL POPULATION SERVED BY THE LICENSES IS APPROXIMATELY 47 MILLION.

PRICE COMMUNICATIONS

IN AUGUST 2002, VERIZON WIRELESS AND PRICE COMMUNICATIONS CORP. (PRICE) COMBINED PRICES WIRELESS BUSINESS WITH A PORTION OF VERIZON

WIRELESS IN A TRANSACTION VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION, INCLUDING $550 MILLION OF NET DEBT. THE RESULTING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP IS CONTROLLED AND MANAGED BY VERIZON WIRELESS. IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS CONTRIBUTED ASSETS, PRICE RECEIVED A LIMITED

PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE NEW PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS EXCHANGEABLE INTO COMMON STOCK OF VERIZON WIRELESS IF AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF THAT STOCK OCCURS, OR INTO THE COMMON STOCK OF VERIZON ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSET CONTRIBUTION DATE

IF THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF VERIZON WIRELESS COMMON STOCK DOES NOT OCCUR PRIOR TO THEN. THE PRICE OF THE VERIZON COMMON STOCK USED IN DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF VERIZON COMMON SHARES RECEIVED IN AN EXCHANGE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM AND

MINIMUM AMOUNT.

COMPETITION

THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE EXPECT

COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER PENETRATION LEVELS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE INDUSTRY, THE INTRODUCTION OF WIRELESS LOCAL NUMBER PORTABILITY (LNP), THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM, BOTH LICENSED AND UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS, INCLUDING OPERATORS AND RESELLERS, SERVE EACH OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. WE CURRENTLY PROVIDE

SERVICE TO 49 OF THE TOP 50 MARKETS IN THE U.S., AND EACH OF THESE 49 MARKETS HAS AN AVERAGE OF FIVE OTHER COMPETING WIRELESS PROVIDERS. COMPETITION ALSO MAY INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS PROVIDERS TRANSFER LICENSES TO

LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED AND MORE EXPERIENCED WIRELESS PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, RESELLERS AND MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATORS, WHO BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM CARRIERS FOR RESALE, PROVIDE ANOTHER SET OF DIFFERENTIATED COMPETITORS IN THE

MARKETPLACE.

WE COMPETE PRIMARILY AGAINST FIVE OTHER MAJOR WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS: AT&T WIRELESS, CINGULAR WIRELESS, NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS, SPRINT PCS AND T-MOBILE USA. IN ADDITION, IN MANY MARKETS WE ALSO COMPETE WITH REGIONAL CARRIERS, SUCH AS ALLTEL AND US CELLULAR. THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS

EXPERIENCED CONSOLIDATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, INCLUDING THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF AT&T WIRELESS BY CINGULAR WIRELESS, AND THIS TREND MAY CONTINUE. THIS CONSOLIDATION TREND COULD ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES TO COMPETE WITH OUR OFFERINGS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY.

NETWORK TECHNOLOGY, QUALITY AND COVERAGE

: IN RECENT YEARS, COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY HAS LED TO LOWER PRICES AND TO THE POPULARITY OF PRICING PLANS THAT DO NOT

CHARGE FOR ROAMING. AS A RESULT, THE ABILITY TO OFFER HIGH QUALITY NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH ONES OWN NETWORK IS IMPORTANT. WE HAVE A MORE EXTENSIVE NETWORK THAN ANY OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES

EITHER THROUGH THE BUILD-OUT OF EXISTING LICENSES, ACQUISITIONS, ROAMING AGREEMENTS, AND/OR SPECTRUM LEASING.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

: QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING SUBSCRIBERS DO NOT TERMINATE SERVICE AND TO OBTAIN NEW SUBSCRIBERS. WITH LNP, CUSTOMERS MAY FIND IT EASIER TO SWITCH THEIR SERVICE

TO AN ALTERNATE CARRIER, SINCE THEY CAN TAKE THEIR TELEPHONE NUMBER WITH THEM TO THAT CARRIER. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL BE A KEY TO RETAINING OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO ATTRACTING CUSTOMERS WHO WANT TO SWITCH FROM OTHER CARRIERS.

PRICING

: SERVICE PRICING IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT ON WHICH WIRELESS

CARRIES COMPETE. WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES THAT WE BELIEVE REPRESENT THE BEST AVAILABLE VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY.

DISTRIBUTION

: KEY TO ACHIEVING OUR SALES SUCCESS IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF OUR SALES CHANNELS AND DISTRIBUTION POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CORRECT MIX OF DIRECT,

INDIRECT AND RESALE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS A NECESSARY INGREDIENT IN ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING SALES. A GOAL OF OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY IS TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND OUR OUTSIDE SALES TEAM, AS WELL AS THROUGH

TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

: IN ORDER TO EXPAND CAPACITY AND BUILD OUT NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

WIRELESS PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING DYNAMIC CHANGES AS NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORMS

EMBRACE COMPETITION.

IN CANADA, THE WIRELESS SERVICES MARKET HAS LONG BEEN

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND ITS LOCAL SWITCHED SERVICES VOICE MARKET WAS EFFECTIVELY OPENED TO FULL COMPETITION IN 1997. WHILE TELUS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCES AND EXPECTS CONTINUED STRONG COMPETITION WITHIN ITS WIRELINE VOICE, DATA AND INTERNET, AND WIRELESS

BUSINESSES, IT CONTINUES TO BE THE DOMINANT TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDER IN WESTERN CANADA. THE CANADIAN RADIO-TELEVISION AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (CRTC) MAY NOT REGULATE SERVICES OR CLASSES OF SERVICES IF IT FINDS THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE

SUBJECT TO AN ADEQUATE DEGREE OF COMPETITION. GENERALLY, WIRELESS SERVICES ARE NOT REGULATED. ADDITIONALLY, SELECTED WIRELINE SERVICES SUCH AS LONG DISTANCE AND DATA ARE LIGHTLY REGULATED. WIRELINE SERVICES, HOWEVER, GENERALLY CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT

TO A HIGHER DEGREE OF REGULATION. THE CRTC INSTITUTED A PRICE CAP REGULATORY REGIME FOR A NUMBER OF LOCAL SERVICES IN 2002 FOR A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD.

IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, VERIZON FACES BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS COMPETITORS, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL SERVICE PROVIDER IN ALL TELECOMMUNICATION SEGMENTS. THE

DOMINICAN REPUBLICS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND PRICING IS SET AT MARKET RATES.

IN PUERTO RICO, FIVE OTHER FACILITIES-BASED PROVIDERS OPERATE IN THE WIRELESS MARKET. ALL WIRELINE SERVICES, INCLUDING LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, INTERNET ACCESS AND DATA, FACE COMPETITION FROM A FACILITIES-BASED LOCAL

CARRIER, INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS, RESELLERS, CABLE PROVIDERS, AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. PRTC IS THE LEADING WIRELINE SERVICE PROVIDER IN PUERTO RICO AND SECOND IN WIRELESS MARKET SHARE OPERATING UNDER THE VERIZON WIRELESS BRAND. WITH RESPECT TO

REGULATORY MATTERS, PRTC OPERATES IN A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. THE PUERTO RICO TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY BOARD (TRB) ISSUED ORDERS IN OCTOBER 2001 AND FEBRUARY 2002, WHICH CALLED FOR CASH REFUNDS AND SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN ACCESS RATES

FOR INTRA-ISLAND LONG DISTANCE SERVICE. PRTC APPEALED THE ORDER WITH THE PUERTO RICO CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WHICH STAYED THE ORDERS AND HEARD THE APPEAL. THE COURT REJECTED THE CLAIMS OF PRTC IN AUGUST 2003 AND DENIED PRTCS RECONSIDERATION

REQUEST IN OCTOBER 2003. THE COMPANY FILED IN OCTOBER 2003 A WRIT OF CERTIORARI BEFORE THE PUERTO RICO SUPREME COURT CHALLENGING THE ORDER AND PARTICULARLY THE CASH REFUND ASPECT OF THE ORDER. IN NOVEMBER 2003, PRTC AGREED WITH THE TRB TO IMPLEMENT

THE REDUCTION IN ACCESS RATES AND REPLACE THE CASH REFUND PORTION OF THE ORDER WITH AN EXPANSION OF LOCAL EXCHANGE AREAS, RATE ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES, CERTAIN LOCAL RATE CREDITS, AND THE ELIMINATION OF TOUCHTONE CHARGES. WHILE THE TRB

HAS ACCEPTED AND APPROVED THESE COMMITMENTS, IT HAS NOT ISSUED A FINAL RESOLUTION AND ORDER TO TERMINATE THE REFUND PROVISIONS IN THE ORDER. IN ADDITION, SOME OF THE INTEREXCHANGE CARRIERS HAVE CHALLENGED THE EXPANSION OF THE LOCAL EXCHANGE AREAS

PORTION OF THIS COMMITMENT WHICH IS PENDING WITH THE TRB.

IN VENEZUELA,

CANTVS WIRELESS OPERATIONS HAVE FACED COMPETITION SINCE INCEPTION. IN LATE 2000, THE GOVERNMENT OPENED THE BASIC TELEPHONE MARKET FOR LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICE TO COMPETITION AND ISSUED NEW GUIDELINES GOVERNING

INTERCONNECTION AND THE USE OF WIRELESS SPECTRUM. CANTV REMAINS VENEZUELAS LEADING PROVIDER OF SWITCHED, FIXED LOCAL AND DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE SERVICES AND IS ONE OF THE COUNTRYS TOP PROVIDERS OF WIRELESS SERVICES.

CANTV IS SUBJECT TO COMPREHENSIVE RATE REGULATION, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, THAT LIMITS THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES TO KEEP PACE WITH CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND INFLATION.

IN ITALY, VODAFONE OMNITEL WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE SPECTRUM IN

2000, WHICH WAS EXTENDED FROM A 15-YEAR LIFE TO A 20-YEAR LIFE IN NOVEMBER 2001. IT IS EXPECTED THAT VODAFONE OMNITEL WILL LAUNCH COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OF THIRD-GENERATION NETWORK SERVICES DURING 2004.

IN SLOVAKIA, EUROTEL BRATISLAVA WAS AWARDED A LICENSE FOR THE THIRD-GENERATION MOBILE

SPECTRUM IN JULY 2002.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

TELEPHONE ACCESS LINES

AS WE HAVE STATED IN THE PAST, VERIZON CONTINUALLY EVALUATES ITS ASSETS

AND PROPERTIES FOR STRATEGIC FIT AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ANALYSIS, DISCUSSIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE REGARDING THE POSSIBLE SALE OF TELEPHONE ACCESS LINES IN HAWAII AND UPSTATE NEW YORK. HOWEVER, NO SALE IS PENDING AT THIS

TIME.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

DURING 2003, UNDER A GOVERNMENT-APPROVED PLAN, REMEDIATION OF THE SITE OF A FORMER FACILITY

IN HICKSVILLE, NEW YORK THAT PROCESSED NUCLEAR FUEL RODS IN THE 1950S AND 1960S COMMENCED. REMEDIATION BEYOND ORIGINAL EXPECTATIONS PROVED TO BE NECESSARY AND A REASSESSMENT OF THE ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION COSTS WAS CONDUCTED. IN ADDITION, A

REASSESSMENT OF COSTS RELATED TO REMEDIATION EFFORTS AT SEVERAL OTHER FORMER FACILITIES WAS UNDERTAKEN. AS A RESULT, AN ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION EXPENSE OF $240 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003.
