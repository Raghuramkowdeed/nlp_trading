WIRELESS

BACKGROUND

OUR WIRELESS SEGMENT, DOING BUSINESS AS VERIZON WIRELESS, PROVIDES WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ACROSS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.). VERIZON

WIRELESS IS THE LARGEST WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES AS MEASURED BY RETAIL CONNECTIONS AND REVENUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, VERIZON WIRELESS HAD 114.2 MILLION RETAIL CONNECTIONS AND 2016 REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY

$89.2 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 71% OF VERIZONS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

CELLCO PARTNERSHIP (CELLCO), WHICH

ORIGINALLY HELD THE WIRELESS ASSETS OF BELL ATLANTIC, BEGAN OPERATING AS VERIZON WIRELESS IN APRIL 2000 WITH BOTH VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE) AND BELL ATLANTIC AS PARTNERS, FOLLOWING VODAFONES CONTRIBUTION OF ITS U.S. WIRELESS

ASSETS INTO CELLCO. ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2013, VERIZON ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH VODAFONE AND VODAFONE 4 LIMITED, PURSUANT TO WHICH VERIZON AGREED TO ACQUIRE ALL OF VODAFONES INDIRECT 45% INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS FOR

AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $130 BILLION (THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION). WE COMPLETED THE WIRELESS TRANSACTION ON FEBRUARY 21, 2014 AND, AS A RESULT, WE ACQUIRED 100% OWNERSHIP OF VERIZON WIRELESS. THE CONSIDERATION PAID WAS

PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CASH AND VERIZON COMMON STOCK.

WE HAVE THE LARGEST FOURTH-GENERATION (4G) LONG-TERM EVOLUTION (LTE)

TECHNOLOGY AND THIRD-GENERATION (3G) EVOLUTION - DATA OPTIMIZED

(EV-DO)

NETWORKS OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER. OUR 4G LTE NETWORK IS AVAILABLE TO OVER 98% OF THE U.S. POPULATION IN MORE THAN 500

MARKETS COVERING APPROXIMATELY 314 MILLION PEOPLE, INCLUDING THOSE IN AREAS SERVED BY OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PARTNERS. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE ARE WORKING WITH WIRELESS CARRIERS IN RURAL AREAS TO COLLABORATIVELY BUILD AND OPERATE A 4G LTE

NETWORK USING EACH CARRIERS NETWORK ASSETS AND OUR CORE 4G LTE EQUIPMENT AND 700 MHZ C BLOCK AND ADVANCED WIRELESS SERVICES (AWS) SPECTRUM.

WE ARE ADDING CAPACITY AND DENSITY TO OUR 4G LTE NETWORK. WE ARE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING FIFTH-GENERATION (5G) WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY AND ARE WORKING WITH KEY PARTNERS TO ENSURE THE AGGRESSIVE

PACE OF INNOVATION, STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT AND APPROPRIATE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS NEXT GENERATION OF WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY. BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF OUR ONGOING

PRE-COMMERCIAL

TRIALS, WE INTEND TO BE THE FIRST

COMPANY TO DEPLOY A 5G FIXED WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT TO LAUNCH A FIXED COMMERCIAL WIRELESS SERVICE SUPPORTED BY THIS NETWORK IN 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WIRELESS SERVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS

OUR WIRELESS SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS RECEIVING SERVICE UNDER THE VERIZON WIRELESS BRAND. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS CAN OBTAIN

WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT OPERATE ON OUR NETWORK FROM RESELLERS THAT PURCHASE NETWORK ACCESS FROM US ON A WHOLESALE BASIS.

WIRELESS SERVICES

WE OFFER OUR WIRELESS SERVICES ON A POSTPAID AND PREPAID BASIS. RETAIL

(NON-WHOLESALE)

POSTPAID

ACCOUNTS PRIMARILY REPRESENT RETAIL CUSTOMERS WITH VERIZON WIRELESS THAT ARE DIRECTLY SERVED AND MANAGED BY VERIZON WIRELESS AND USE ITS BRANDED SERVICES. A SINGLE ACCOUNT MAY INCLUDE MONTHLY WIRELESS SERVICES FOR A VARIETY OF CONNECTED DEVICES. A

POSTPAID RETAIL CONNECTION REPRESENTS AN INDIVIDUAL LINE OF SERVICE FOR A WIRELESS DEVICE FOR WHICH A CUSTOMER IS BILLED IN ADVANCE A MONTHLY ACCESS CHARGE IN RETURN FOR A MONTHLY NETWORK SERVICE ALLOWANCE, AND USAGE BEYOND THE ALLOWANCE IS BILLED

IN ARREARS. APPROXIMATELY 95% OF OUR TOTAL RETAIL CONNECTIONS WERE POSTPAID RETAIL CONNECTIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. OUR PREPAID SERVICE ENABLES INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN WIRELESS SERVICES WITHOUT CREDIT VERIFICATION BY PAYING FOR ALL SERVICES

IN ADVANCE.

WE OFFER VARIOUS POSTPAID ACCOUNT SERVICE PLANS, INCLUDING SHARED DATA PLANS, SINGLE CONNECTION PLANS AND OTHER

PLANS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR SHARED DATA PLANS TYPICALLY FEATURE DOMESTIC UNLIMITED VOICE MINUTES, UNLIMITED DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TEXT, VIDEO AND PICTURE MESSAGING, AND A SINGLE DATA ALLOWANCE THAT CAN BE SHARED AMONG THE

WIRELESS DEVICES ON A CUSTOMERS ACCOUNT. THESE ALLOWANCES WILL VARY FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF PROMOTIONAL OFFERS OR IN RESPONSE TO MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2017, WE ANNOUNCED AN INTRODUCTORY PLAN, OUR NEW VERIZON UNLIMITED

PLAN, AVAILABLE TO OUR CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, WHICH OFFERS AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNLIMITED DOMESTIC VOICE, DATA AND TEXTING. BOTH OUR SHARED DATA PLANS AND THE VERIZON UNLIMITED PLAN INCLUDE OUR HD (HIGH DEFINITION) VOICE, VIDEO

CALLING AND MOBILE HOTSPOT SERVICES ON COMPATIBLE DEVICES. HD VOICE IS A SUITE OF SERVICES ENABLED BY VOICE OVER LTE (VOLTE), WHICH DELIVERS CALLS OVER OUR 4G LTE NETWORK, AND OUR VIDEO CALLING SERVICE COMBINES AN HD VOICE CALL WITH REAL-TIME VIDEO.

OUR MOBILE HOTSPOT SERVICE ENABLES A CUSTOMER TO ACTIVATE A PERSONAL

WI-FI

HOTSPOT VIA THEIR SMARTPHONE THAT CAN PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS TO MULTIPLE

WI-FI

ENABLED

DEVICES. WE ALSO OFFER VARIOUS VOICE AND SHARED DATA PLANS FOR SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES.

OUR SIMPLIFIED SHARED DATA PLAN,

THE NEW VERIZON PLAN, OFFERS CUSTOMERS VARIOUS SIZES OF DATA PACKAGES THAT CAN BE SHARED AMONG UP TO 10 DEVICES ON A CONSUMER ACCOUNT OR 25 DEVICES ON A BUSINESS ACCOUNT. THE PLAN FEATURES CARRYOVER DATA, WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO CARRY OVER UNUSED

DATA TO THE NEXT MONTH, AND SAFETY MODE, WHICH ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO AVOID DATA OVERAGE FEES BY ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE USING DATA AT A REDUCED DATA SPEED AFTER USING THEIR DATA ALLOWANCE. CERTAIN PLANS, WITH HIGHER ACCOUNT ACCESS AMOUNTS ALSO

INCLUDE CALLING TO AND VOICE, TEXT AND DATA ROAMING IN MEXICO AND CANADA. CUSTOMERS WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS NEW PLAN CAN DO SO BY PURCHASING A DEVICE FROM VERIZON EITHER UNDER OUR DEVICE PAYMENT PROGRAM OR AT FULL RETAIL, OR BY USING THEIR

OWN COMPATIBLE DEVICE.

CUSTOMERS ON OUR FIXED-TERM SERVICE PLANS HAVE HISTORICALLY PAID HIGHER ACCESS FEES FOR THEIR WIRELESS

SERVICE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE THEIR WIRELESS DEVICES AT SUBSIDIZED PRICES. WE HAVE LARGELY DISCONTINUED THIS FORM OF DEVICE SUBSIDY. UNDER THE VERIZON DEVICE PAYMENT PROGRAM, OUR ELIGIBLE WIRELESS CUSTOMERS PURCHASE WIRELESS

DEVICES UNDER A DEVICE PAYMENT PLAN AGREEMENT. CUSTOMERS THAT ACTIVATE SERVICE ON DEVICES PURCHASED UNDER THE DEVICE PAYMENT PROGRAM OR ON A COMPATIBLE DEVICE THAT THEY ALREADY OWN PAY LOWER ACCESS FEES (UNSUBSIDIZED SERVICE PRICING) AS COMPARED TO

THOSE UNDER OUR FIXED-TERM SERVICE PLANS. GENERALLY, CUSTOMERS ENTERING INTO DEVICE PAYMENT PLAN AGREEMENTS ON OR AFTER JUNE 1, 2015 ARE REQUIRED TO REPAY ALL AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THEIR DEVICE PAYMENT PLAN AGREEMENT BEFORE BEING ELIGIBLE TO

UPGRADE THEIR DEVICE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN DEVICES ARE SUBJECT TO PROMOTIONS THAT ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO UPGRADE TO A NEW DEVICE AFTER PAYING DOWN A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE BALANCE ON THEIR DEVICE PAYMENT PLAN AND TRADING IN THEIR DEVICE IN GOOD WORKING

CONDITION.

WE ALSO OFFER PREPAID SINGLE CONNECTION SERVICE PLANS THAT FEATURE DOMESTIC UNLIMITED VOICE MINUTES AND UNLIMITED

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TEXT. ON COMPATIBLE DEVICES, CERTAIN OF OUR PREPAID PLANS ALSO FEATURE VIDEO AND PICTURE MESSAGING, CARRYOVER DATA AND

ALWAYS-ON

DATA, WHICH ALLOWS A CUSTOMER TO STAY ONLINE AT

REDUCED DATA SPEEDS AFTER USING THEIR DATA ALLOWANCE. HD VOICE, VIDEO CALLING AND MOBILE HOTSPOT SERVICE ARE AVAILABLE ON COMPATIBLE DEVICES. CUSTOMERS CAN MANAGE THEIR PREPAID SERVICES ON THE DEVICE USING THEIR MY VERIZON MOBILE APPLICATION OR

LOGGING IN TO THE MY VERIZON WEBSITE.

WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS A WIDE VARIETY OF WIRELESS SERVICES

ACCESSIBLE ON A BROAD RANGE OF DEVICES. ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS AVAILABLE ON ALL SMARTPHONES AND NEARLY ALL BASIC PHONES. WE ALSO OFFER SERVICE THAT ENABLES OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET WIRELESSLY AT BROADBAND SPEEDS ON NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS

AND TABLETS THAT EITHER HAVE EMBEDDED 4G LTE OR 3G

EV-DO

MODULES OR THAT ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SEPARATE DEVICES THAT ENABLE ACCESS TO THIS SERVICE, SUCH AS USB MODEMS, JETPACKS

TM

AND OTHER DEDICATED DEVICES THAT PROVIDE A MOBILE

WI-FI

CONNECTION.

OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ACCESS MULTIMEDIA OFFERINGS, PROVIDED BY VERIZON AND BY

THIRD PARTIES, CONSISTING OF APPLICATIONS PROVIDING MUSIC, VIDEO, GAMING, NEWS AND OTHER CONTENT. OUR BUSINESS-FOCUSED OFFERINGS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY, INCLUDE SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET, THEIR

CORPORATE INTRANETS AND

E-MAIL

ACROSS OUR DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF WIRELESS DEVICES. OUR LOCATION-BASED SERVICES PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH DIRECTIONS TO THEIR DESTINATION AND ENABLE OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO

LOCATE, MONITOR AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR MOBILE FIELD WORKERS. OUR GLOBAL DATA SERVICES ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS DATA SERVICES AND THE INTERNET ON ALL SMARTPHONES AND MANY TABLETS AND BASIC PHONES FROM HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS

ENABLED DEVICES TO THE INTERNET AT ONE TIME. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO ACCESS THE INTERNET WIRELESSLY AT BROADBAND SPEEDS ON THEIR COMPUTERS VIA DATA CARDS, USB MODEMS OR THROUGH THE

USE OF CERTAIN LAPTOP COMPUTERS AND NETBOOKS ENABLED TO ACCESS OUR WIRELESS NETWORK.

WE PURCHASE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF

OUR WIRELESS DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES FROM APPLE, SAMSUNG, MOTOROLA MOBILITY, GOOGLE, LG ELECTRONICS AND HTC.

A KEY COMPONENT

OF ALL WIRELESS DEVICES IS THE CHIPSET, WHICH CONTAINS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE DEVICE. THE LTE CHIPSETS USED IN OUR 4G

LTE-ENABLED

DEVICES ARE MANUFACTURED BY VARIOUS COMPANIES, EACH USING ITS OWN

4G LTE CHIPSET TECHNOLOGY. TO SUPPORT CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS (CDMA)-1XRTT AND

EV-DO

TECHNOLOGIES (WITH AND WITHOUT 4G LTE), MOST OF OUR WIRELESS DEVICE SUPPLIERS CURRENTLY RELY ON QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF CHIPSETS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPONENTS COMMON TO WIRELESS DEVICES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELECTRONIC COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS THAT WE DO NOT DEAL WITH DIRECTLY.

NETWORK

WE HAVE

THE LARGEST 4G LTE AND 3G

EV-DO

NETWORKS OF ANY SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH LICENSED AND OPERATIONAL COVERAGE IN ALL OF THE 100 MOST POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2016, OUR 4G LTE NETWORK COVERED APPROXIMATELY 314 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THOSE IN AREAS SERVED BY OUR LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PARTNERS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE 21 LTE IN RURAL AMERICA PARTNERS THAT PROVIDE 4G LTE COVERAGE TO AN

AREA COVERING APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION PEOPLE.

THE RELIABILITY OF OUR WIRELESS NETWORK IS A KEY FACTOR FOR OUR CONTINUED

SUCCESS, AND WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THE HIGHEST NETWORK RELIABILITY FOR THEIR WIRELESS SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT STEADY AND CONSISTENT NETWORK AND PLATFORM INVESTMENTS PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

THAT WILL FUEL PROFITABLE GROWTH. THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF OUR NETWORK PROVIDES OUR FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH AND IS THE BASIS FOR OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

WE DESIGN AND DEPLOY OUR NETWORK IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL DATA SESSIONS, INCLUDING VIDEO, PERMITTING THE COMPLETION OF LARGE FILE DOWNLOADS AND UPLOADS

WHILE DELIVERING ON OUR ADVERTISED THROUGHPUT SPEEDS, AND MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT ARE CONNECTED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND COMPLETED WITHOUT BEING DROPPED. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO UPGRADE OUR NETWORK, PRIMARILY TO INCREASE ITS CAPACITY

AND DENSITY, BY UTILIZING SMALL CELL TECHNOLOGY,

IN-BUILDING

SOLUTIONS AND DISTRIBUTED ANTENNAE SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO DEPLOYING EXISTING AWS SPECTRUM. WE ARE ALSO EXPLORING STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE

OUR NETWORK CAPACITY AND EFFICIENCY THROUGH SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS OF SPECTRUM LICENSES.

OUR NETWORK INCLUDES VARIOUS

ELEMENTS OF REDUNDANCY DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICE. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF POWER DISRUPTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS, WE HAVE BATTERY BACKUP AT EVERY SWITCH AND EVERY MACROCELL IN OUR NETWORK. WE ALSO UTILIZE BACKUP GENERATORS AT

A MAJORITY OF OUR MACROCELLS AND AT EVERY SWITCH LOCATION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A FLEET OF PORTABLE BACKUP GENERATORS THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED, IF NEEDED. WE FURTHER ENHANCE RELIABILITY BY USING A FULLY REDUNDANT MULTIPROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING BACKBONE

NETWORK IN CRITICAL LOCATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION TO OUR OWN NETWORK COVERAGE, WE HAVE ROAMING AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE WIRELESS SERVICE IN NEARLY ALL OTHER AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WIRELESS SERVICE IS AVAILABLE. WE ALSO OFFER A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES TO OUR

CUSTOMERS THROUGH ROAMING ARRANGEMENTS WITH WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. CERTAIN OF OUR ROAMING AGREEMENTS CAN BE TERMINATED AT WILL BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS NOTICE; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

TERMINATION OF ANY OF THESE

AT-WILL

AGREEMENTS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

TECHNOLOGY

OUR PRIMARY

NETWORK TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE 4G LTE AND 3G CDMA. 4G LTE PROVIDES HIGHER DATA THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE FOR DATA SERVICES AT A LOWER COST COMPARED TO THAT OFFERED BY 3G TECHNOLOGIES.

IN 2014, WE COMMERCIALLY LAUNCHED OUR MOBILE VOLTE SERVICE. HD CALLING, ENABLED BY VOLTE, IS NOW BEING USED, IN ADDITION TO CDMA

TECHNOLOGY, TO PROVIDE VOICE CALLING SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING 5G WIRELESS

TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE DENSIFYING OUR 4G LTE NETWORK TO ADD CAPACITY AND

PRE-POSITION

US FOR 5G TECHNOLOGY. WE LAUNCHED THE VERIZON 5G TECHNOLOGY FORUM WITH KEY INDUSTRY PARTNERS TO DEVELOP 5G REQUIREMENTS AND

STANDARDS AND CONDUCT TESTING TO ACCELERATE THE INTRODUCTION OF 5G TECHNOLOGIES. WE BELIEVE THAT 5G TECHNOLOGY WILL PROVIDE HIGHER THROUGHPUT THAN THE CURRENT 4G LTE TECHNOLOGY, LOWER LATENCY AND THE ABILITY TO HANDLE MORE NETWORK TRAFFIC AS THE

NUMBER OF INTERNET-CONNECTED DEVICES GROWS. BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF OUR ONGOING

PRE-COMMERCIAL

TRIALS, WE INTEND TO BE THE FIRST COMPANY TO DEPLOY A 5G FIXED WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK IN THE UNITED STATES. WE

EXPECT TO LAUNCH A FIXED COMMERCIAL WIRELESS SERVICE SUPPORTED BY THIS NETWORK IN 2018.

SPECTRUM

THE SPECTRUM LICENSES WE HOLD CAN BE USED FOR MOBILE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WE HAVE LICENSES TO PROVIDE THESE

WIRELESS SERVICES ON PORTIONS OF THE 800 MHZ BAND, ALSO KNOWN AS CELLULAR SPECTRUM, THE 1800-1900 MHZ BAND, ALSO KNOWN AS PERSONAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES (PCS) SPECTRUM, PORTIONS OF THE 700 MHZ UPPER C BAND AND AWS SPECTRUM IN THE 1700 AND 2100 MHZ

BANDS, IN AREAS THAT, COLLECTIVELY, COVER NEARLY ALL OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES.

IN JANUARY 2015, THE FEDERAL

COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) COMPLETED AN AUCTION OF 65 MHZ OF SPECTRUM IN THE

AWS-3

BAND. WE PARTICIPATED IN THAT AUCTION AND WERE THE HIGH BIDDER ON 181 SPECTRUM LICENSES, FOR WHICH WE PAID CASH OF

APPROXIMATELY $10.4 BILLION. THE FCC GRANTED US THESE SPECTRUM LICENSES IN APRIL 2015.

WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL NEED

ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. THIS INCREASING DEMAND IS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN CUSTOMER CONNECTIONS AND THE INCREASED USAGE OF WIRELESS BROADBAND SERVICES, THAT USE MORE BANDWIDTH AND REQUIRE EVER FASTER RATES OF SPEED. ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM

MAY ALSO ALLOW US TO OFFER NEW PRODUCTS ENABLED BY ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING EMERGING 5G AND IOT SERVICES. WE CAN MEET OUR FUTURE SPECTRUM NEEDS BY ACQUIRING LICENSES OR LEASING SPECTRUM FROM OTHER LICENSEES, OR BY ACQUIRING NEW

SPECTRUM LICENSES FROM THE FCC, IF AND WHEN FUTURE FCC SPECTRUM AUCTIONS OCCUR. IN MARCH 2016, THE FCC COMMENCED A VOLUNTARY INCENTIVE AUCTION OF TELEVISION BROADCAST SPECTRUM IN THE 600 MHZ FREQUENCY RANGE. THE AUCTION HAS FINISHED THE

REVERSE AND FORWARD CLOCK PHASES. ANY RESULTS WILL BE DISCLOSED BY THE FCC AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT PHASE AND AFTER THE FCC ANNOUNCES THE CLOSE OF THE AUCTION BY PUBLIC NOTICE.

SINCE WE AND COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SPECTRUM SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND MAY HAVE SPECTRUM SURPLUSES

IN OTHERS, FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE EXCHANGED SPECTRUM LICENSES WITH OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGH SECONDARY MARKET SWAP TRANSACTIONS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES TO TRADE SPECTRUM LICENSES IN ORDER TO MEET CERTAIN OF

OUR CAPACITY AND EXPANSION NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. IN OTHER CASES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTRA-MARKET SPECTRUM SWAPS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CONTIGUOUS SPECTRUM WITHIN FREQUENCY BANDS IN A SPECIFIC MARKET. CONTIGUOUS SPECTRUM IMPROVES NETWORK

PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY. THESE SWAPS AS WELL AS ANY SPECTRUM PURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR THE TRANSFER OF SPECTRUM LICENSES IN EACH INSTANCE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING SPECTRUM LICENSE TRANSACTIONS IS INCLUDED IN THE 2016 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS IN

NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT.

NETWORK EQUIPMENT AND

BUILD-OUT

NOKIA AND ERICSSON ARE CURRENTLY OUR PRIMARY NETWORK VENDORS FOR OUR LTE NETWORK DEPLOYMENTS FOR MACRO SITES AS WELL AS SMALL CELLS. OUR

PRIMARY CDMA CELL SITE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE VENDORS ARE NOKIA, WHICH PROVIDES MORE THAN HALF OF OUR CDMA CELL SITE EQUIPMENT, AND ERICSSON, WHICH PROVIDES NEARLY ALL OF OUR REMAINING CELL SITE EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO RELY ON NOKIA AND ERICSSON FOR

OUR SWITCHING EQUIPMENT.

AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD AND UPGRADE OUR EXISTING NETWORK, WE MUST COMPLETE A VARIETY OF STEPS,

INCLUDING SECURING RIGHTS TO A LARGE NUMBER OF SITES AS WELL AS OBTAINING ZONING AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS AND FIBER FACILITIES FOR BOTH OUR MACRO AND SMALL CELLS. AS WE DENSIFY OUR NETWORK, WE FOLLOW A SIMILAR PROCESS FOR SMALL CELLS,

IN-BUILDING

SYSTEMS AND ANTENNAS AND RELATED RADIO EQUIPMENT THAT COMPRISE DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS. WE UTILIZE TOWER SITE MANAGEMENT FIRMS, SUCH AS CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION

(AMERICAN TOWER), AS LESSORS OR MANAGERS OF A PORTION OF OUR EXISTING TOWER SITES.

DURING MARCH 2015, WE COMPLETED A

TRANSACTION WITH AMERICAN TOWER PURSUANT TO WHICH AMERICAN TOWER ACQUIRED THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO LEASE AND OPERATE APPROXIMATELY 11,300 OF OUR WIRELESS TOWERS FOR AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $5.0 BILLION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AGREEMENTS,

AMERICAN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TOWER HAS EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO LEASE AND OPERATE TOWERS OVER AN AVERAGE TERM OF APPROXIMATELY 28 YEARS. AS THE LEASES EXPIRE, AMERICAN TOWER HAS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE THESE

TOWERS BASED ON THEIR ANTICIPATED FAIR MARKET VALUES AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERMS. AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION, WE ALSO SOLD 162 TOWERS FOR $0.1 BILLION. WE HAVE SUBLEASED CAPACITY ON THE TOWERS FROM AMERICAN TOWER FOR A MINIMUM OF 10 YEARS AT

CURRENT MARKET RATES, WITH OPTIONS TO RENEW.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON OFFERING SOLUTIONS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF OUR VARIOUS CUSTOMER MARKET GROUPS; PROMOTING OUR BRAND;

LEVERAGING OUR EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; AND JOINTLY MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO LARGE BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS WITH VERIZONS WIRELINE BUSINESS UNITS THROUGH THE WIRELESS BUSINESS GROUP, A SALES AND MARKETING

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A TELEMARKETING SALES FORCE DEDICATED TO HANDLING INCOMING CALLS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND WE OFFER FULLY-AUTOMATED,

END-TO-END

WEB-BASED

SALES OF WIRELESS DEVICES, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICE PLANS.

OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL

INCLUDES AGENTS THAT SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT RETAIL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE INTERNET. THE MAJORITY OF THESE AGENTS SELL BOTH OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, AND DO SO UNDER EXCLUSIVE SELLING ARRANGEMENTS WITH US. WE ALSO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIGH-PROFILE NATIONAL RETAILERS, SUCH AS BEST BUY,

WAL-MART

AND TARGET, TO SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID

WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. STORES SUCH AS DOLLAR GENERAL AND VARIOUS DRUGSTORE CHAINS SELL OUR PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

COMPETITION

WE OPERATE

IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY. WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING AT&T INC., SPRINT CORPORATION AND

T-MOBILE

USA, INC., AS WELL AS VARIOUS REGIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COMPETE FOR RETAIL ACTIVATIONS WITH RESELLERS THAT BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM FACILITIES-BASED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR RESALE, INCLUDING RESELLERS THAT BUY FROM US. COMPETITION IS INTENSE AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING

INCREASES IN WIRELESS MARKET PENETRATION LEVELS, NETWORK INVESTMENT BY OUR COMPETITORS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, NEW MARKET ENTRANTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM,

BOTH LICENSED AND UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. COMPETITION MAY ALSO INCREASE AS SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MERGE OR TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING TO INCREASE THEIR BRAND

RECOGNITION AND CAPTURE CUSTOMER REVENUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IN ADDITION TO

NON-TRADITIONAL

OFFERINGS IN MOBILE DATA. FOR EXAMPLE, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE, APPLE AND

OTHERS ARE OFFERING ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR MAKING WIRELESS VOICE CALLS THAT, IN CERTAIN CASES, CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF THE WIRELESS PROVIDERS VOICE SERVICE, AS WELL AS ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ACCESSING VIDEO CONTENT.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY.



NETWORK RELIABILITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE.

WE BELIEVE THAT A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES HIGH-QUALITY AND RELIABLE SERVICE

IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE U.S. MARKET AND DRIVER OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. LOWER PRICES, IMPROVED SERVICE QUALITY AND NEW WIRELESS SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHICH IN MANY CASES INCLUDE VIDEO CONTENT, HAVE LED TO INCREASED CUSTOMER USAGE OF WIRELESS

SERVICES, WHICH, IN TURN, PUTS PRESSURE ON NETWORK CAPACITY. IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY NEEDS AND OFFER HIGHLY RELIABLE NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR NETWORKS. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR 4G LTE NETWORK TO INCREASE NETWORK CAPACITY WILL ENABLE US TO MEET CONSUMER DEMAND.



PRICING.

SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PRICING PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE WIRELESS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. AS THE DEMAND FOR WIRELESS SERVICES

CONTINUES TO GROW, WE AND OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING SERVICE PLANS AT COMPETITIVE PRICES THAT INCLUDE UNLIMITED VOICE MINUTES AND TEXT MESSAGES AND A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF DATA ACCESS IN VARYING MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE SIZES OR, IN SOME

CASES, ON AN UNLIMITED BASIS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. THESE ALLOWANCES WILL VARY FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF PROMOTIONAL OFFERS OR IN RESPONSE TO MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES. WE AND MANY OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ALSO ALLOW CUSTOMERS ON

CERTAIN PLANS TO CARRY OVER UNUSED DATA ALLOWANCES TO THE NEXT BILLING PERIOD, OR TO STAY ONLINE AT A REDUCED DATA SPEED AFTER USING ALL OF A DATA ALLOWANCE FOR A BILLING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, SOME WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BUNDLED WIRELESS

SERVICE OFFERINGS WITH OTHER PRODUCTS WHILE OTHERS OFFER PROMOTIONAL PRICING AND INCENTIVES TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TO CUSTOMERS OF VERIZON WIRELESS.

WE AND OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, AS WELL AS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, OFFER DEVICE PAYMENT OPTIONS THAT DISTINGUISH

SERVICE PRICING FROM EQUIPMENT PRICING AND BLUR THE TRADITIONAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN PREPAID AND POSTPAID PLANS. THESE PAYMENT OPTIONS INCLUDE DEVICE PAYMENT PLANS,

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR DEVICE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, AND DEVICE LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. HISTORICALLY, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS OFFERED CUSTOMERS WIRELESS PLANS

WHEREBY, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE CUSTOMER ENTERING INTO A FIXED-TERM SERVICE AGREEMENT, THE WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER SIGNIFICANTLY, AND IN SOME CASES FULLY, SUBSIDIZED THE CUSTOMERS DEVICE PURCHASE. WIRELESS PROVIDERS RECOVERED THOSE SUBSIDIES

THROUGH HIGHER SERVICE FEES AS COMPARED TO THOSE PAID BY CUSTOMERS ON DEVICE PAYMENT PLANS. WE AND MANY OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS HAVE LIMITED OR DISCONTINUED THIS FORM OF DEVICE SUBSIDY.



CUSTOMER SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH-QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY FACTOR IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING THOSE OF OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CONVENIENT AND

EASY-TO-USE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND FOCUSING ON THEIR NEEDS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS AND MINIMIZE CHURN. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON IMPROVING IN THIS AREA.

AS PART OF OUR

EFFORTS TO TRANSFORM AND SIMPLIFY THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WE LAUNCHED A NEW MY VERIZON APP, WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO MANAGE THEIR PRICE PLAN, DATA USAGE, ACCOUNT AND BILLING FROM THEIR DEVICE. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM

RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, WE OFFER VERIZON SMART REWARDS, WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS A WIDE VARIETY OF REWARDS TO CUSTOMERS IN EXCHANGE FOR POINTS THEY EARN IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ACCOUNT-RELATED INTERACTIONS WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. THE

PROGRAM OFFERS CUSTOMERS DISCOUNTS AND SAVINGS ON MERCHANDISE FROM WELL-KNOWN BRANDS, AS WELL AS DISCOUNTS AND OTHER OFFERS AT LOCAL SHOPPING AND DINING VENUES.



PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT.

AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP AND WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS PROLIFERATE, CONTINUED CUSTOMER AND REVENUE

GROWTH WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED DATA PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND IN

COLLABORATION WITH APPLICATION AND CONTENT PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH VARIOUS DEVICE MANUFACTURERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTINCTIVE SMARTPHONES AND OTHER WIRELESS DEVICES THAT CAN ACCESS THE GROWING ARRAY OF DATA APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT

AVAILABLE OVER THE INTERNET. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON INCREASING THE PENETRATION OF SMARTPHONES, TABLETS AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES THROUGHOUT OUR CUSTOMER BASE.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION.

THE KEY TO ACHIEVING SALES SUCCESS IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF SALES CHANNELS AND

DISTRIBUTION POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ATTAINING THE OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF VARYING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING PROFITABILITY, AS MEASURED BY OPERATING INCOME. WE ENDEAVOR TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR

COMPANY-OPERATED STORES, OUTSIDE SALES TEAMS AND TELEMARKETING,

WEB-BASED

SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES, OUR EXTENSIVE INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF RETAIL OUTLETS AND PREPAID REPLENISHMENT LOCATIONS,

AND THROUGH MANUFACTURERS OF LAPTOPS AND NETBOOKS WITH EMBEDDED 4G LTE AND 3G MODULES THAT CAN ACCESS THE INTERNET ON OUR NETWORK AT BROADBAND SPEEDS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL NETWORK ACCESS TO BOTH TRADITIONAL RESELLERS, WHICH RESELL NETWORK SERVICES

TO THEIR

END-USERS,

AND TO VARIOUS COMPANIES TO ENABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FOR THEIR IOT DEVICES OR SERVICES.



CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY AND COVERAGE OF THEIR NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AS DO SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW BUSINESS

MODELS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, REGULATORY CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PRICING STRATEGIES OF COMPETITORS.

WIRELINE

BACKGROUND

OUR WIRELINE SEGMENT PROVIDES VOICE, DATA AND VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND ENHANCED SERVICES. WE PROVIDE THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS TO CARRIERS,

BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD. IN 2016, WIRELINE REVENUES WERE $31.3 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 25% OF VERIZONS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS

ON FEBRUARY 5, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (FRONTIER) PURSUANT TO WHICH VERIZON SOLD ITS LOCAL EXCHANGE BUSINESS AND RELATED LANDLINE

ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA AND TEXAS, INCLUDING FIOS INTERNET AND VIDEO CUSTOMERS, SWITCHED AND SPECIAL ACCESS LINES AND HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICE AND LONG DISTANCE VOICE ACCOUNTS IN THESE THREE STATES, FOR APPROXIMATELY $10.5 BILLION

(APPROXIMATELY $7.3 BILLION NET OF INCOME TAXES), SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS AND INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION OF $0.6 BILLION OF INDEBTEDNESS FROM VERIZON BY FRONTIER. THE TRANSACTION, WHICH INCLUDED THE ACQUISITION BY FRONTIER OF THE

EQUITY INTERESTS OF VERIZONS INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (ILECS) IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA AND TEXAS, DID NOT INVOLVE ANY ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF VERIZON WIRELESS. THE TRANSACTION CLOSED ON APRIL 1, 2016.

THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN FRONTIER ACQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 3.3 MILLION VOICE CONNECTIONS, 1.6 MILLION FIOS INTERNET

SUBSCRIBERS, 1.2 MILLION FIOS VIDEO SUBSCRIBERS AND THE RELATED ILEC BUSINESSES FROM VERIZON. APPROXIMATELY 9,300 VERIZON EMPLOYEES WHO SERVED CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA AND TEXAS CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT WITH FRONTIER. THE OPERATING RESULTS

OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE EXCLUDED FROM OUR WIRELINE SEGMENT FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED TO REFLECT COMPARABLE SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS CONSISTENT WITH THE INFORMATION REGULARLY REVIEWED BY OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER.

ON FEBRUARY 20, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE XO HOLDINGS

WIRELINE BUSINESS, WHICH OWNS AND OPERATES ONE OF THE LARGEST FIBER-BASED IP AND ETHERNET NETWORKS, FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT. WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION ON FEBRUARY 1, 2017. SEPARATELY, WE ENTERED INTO AN

AGREEMENT TO LEASE CERTAIN WIRELESS SPECTRUM FROM A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF XO HOLDINGS THAT HOLDS ITS WIRELESS SPECTRUM. VERIZON HAS AN OPTION, EXERCISABLE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, TO BUY THAT SUBSIDIARY.

WE ARE REINVENTING OUR NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AROUND A COMMON FIBER PLATFORM THAT WILL SUPPORT BOTH OUR WIRELESS AND WIRELINE TECHNOLOGIES.

WE EXPECT THAT THIS NEW ONE FIBER ARCHITECTURE WILL IMPROVE OUR 4G LTE COVERAGE, SPEED THE DEPLOYMENT OF 5G, DELIVER HIGH-SPEED FIOS BROADBAND TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES AND CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS MARKET.

IN APRIL 2016, WE ANNOUNCED OUR ONE FIBER STRATEGY FOR THE CITY OF BOSTON. WE LAUNCHED ONE FIBER FOR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN BOSTON LATE IN 2016.

ON DECEMBER 6, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH EQUINIX, INC. PURSUANT TO WHICH VERIZON WILL SELL 24 CUSTOMER-FACING DATA CENTER SITES IN THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA FOR

APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE SALE DOES NOT AFFECT VERIZONS DATA CENTER SERVICES DELIVERED FROM 27 SITES IN EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC AND CANADA, OR ITS MANAGED HOSTING AND CLOUD OFFERINGS. THE TRANSACTION IS

SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY REGULATORY APPROVALS AND CLOSING CONDITIONS, AND IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2017.

FIOS.

OUR

FIBER-TO-THE-HOME

NETWORK THROUGH WHICH WE PROVIDE OUR FIOS RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND SERVICE HAS PASSED OVER 16.9 MILLION

PREMISES IN THE UNITED STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016. RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND SERVICE HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN BANDWIDTH DEMAND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. THE CONTINUED EMERGENCE OF NEW

VIDEO SERVICES, NEW DATA APPLICATIONS AND THE PROLIFERATION OF IP DEVICES IN THE HOME WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE NEW NETWORK REQUIREMENTS FOR INCREASED DATA SPEEDS AND THROUGHPUT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PASSIVE OPTICAL NETWORK (PON) TECHNOLOGY UNDERPINNING

FIOS MAKES US WELL POSITIONED TO MEET THESE DEMANDS IN A COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. OUR PON TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT OUR NETWORK TO DELIVER INCREASED DATA SPEEDS AND NEW SERVICES WITHOUT MAJOR OVERHAULS OR REPLACEMENTS

TO THE FIBER-OPTIC INFRASTRUCTURE.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE DEPLOYED INITIALLY AS A CONSUMER BROADBAND NETWORK, THE PON

INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALSO FINDING MORE WIDESPREAD APPLICATION IN THE ENTERPRISE SECTOR, ESPECIALLY AS BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY MIGRATE TO ETHERNET-BASED ACCESS SERVICES.



. VERIZON OWNS AND OPERATES ONE OF THE LARGEST GLOBAL FIBER NETWORKS IN THE WORLD, PROVIDING CONNECTIVITY TO BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN

MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES. OUR GLOBAL IP NETWORK INCLUDES LONG HAUL, METRO AND SUBMARINE ASSETS THAT SPAN OVER 800,000 ROUTE MILES AND ENABLE AND SUPPORT FAR REACHING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

DEPLOYMENT OF PACKET OPTICAL TRANSPORT STRATEGY, VERIZON IS CREATING A SINGLE, HIGH-CAPACITY GLOBAL NETWORK PLATFORM THAT COMBINES OPTICAL TRANSPORT WITH ADVANCED PACKET SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY. THE RESULT IS A GLOBAL IP NETWORK THAT CAN OFFER POWERFUL

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL FIBER-BASED

NETWORKS, AND ACHIEVING COST EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENTS, WILL HELP VERIZON ADVANCE ITS POSITION AS A PROVIDER OF CHOICE TO RESIDENTIAL AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY FURTHER WITH TRADITIONAL,

NON-TRADITIONAL

AND EMERGING PLAYERS SEEKING INCREASED MARKET SHARE. CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE CABLE COMPANIES,

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, SATELLITE TELEVISION COMPANIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES AND MANAGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS.

IN ADDITION, COMPANIES WITH A GLOBAL PRESENCE INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH OUR WIRELINE BUSINESSES. A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH GLOBAL OPERATIONS SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE GLOBAL WHOLESALE MARKETS. WE COMPETE WITH THESE PROVIDERS FOR LARGE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED

SERVICES TO GLOBAL ENTERPRISES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH.

WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND TRENDS IN THE WIRELINE INDUSTRY.



BANDWIDTH (SPEED) AND NETWORK RELIABILITY.

CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS ARE SEEKING TO LEVERAGE HIGH-SPEED CONNECTIONS FOR

ENTERTAINMENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY. AS ONLINE AND ONLINE-ENABLED ACTIVITIES INCREASE, SO WILL BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, BOTH DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM. TO SUCCEED, WE AND OTHER NETWORK-BASED PROVIDERS MUST ENSURE THAT OUR NETWORKS CAN MEET

THESE INCREASING BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS.

IN ADDITION, NETWORK RELIABILITY AND SECURITY ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE MARKET. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO MEET GROWING BANDWIDTH

DEMAND AND PROVIDE THE MOST RELIABLE AND SECURE NETWORK.



PRICING.

CABLE OPERATORS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS USE PRICING TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE FROM INCUMBENTS.

PRICING IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR AS

NON-TRADITIONAL

MODES OF PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES EMERGE AND NEW ENTRANTS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, VOIP AND PORTAL-BASED CALLING IS FREE OR NEARLY

FREE TO CUSTOMERS AND IS OFTEN SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISING REVENUES.



CUSTOMER SERVICE.

CUSTOMERS EXPECT INDUSTRY-LEADING SERVICE FROM THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AS TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES EVOLVE, THE ABILITY TO

EXCEL IN THIS AREA IS IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION. IN MASS MARKETS, WE COMPETE IN THIS AREA THROUGH OUR SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND ONLINE SUPPORT. IN GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH READY ACCESS TO THEIR SYSTEM

AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, AND WE CONDUCT PROACTIVE TESTING OF OUR NETWORK TO IDENTIFY ISSUES BEFORE THEY AFFECT CUSTOMERS. IN THE GLOBAL WHOLESALE BUSINESS, WE BELIEVE SERVICE IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED SYSTEM AUTOMATION

INITIATIVES.



PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION.

AS A RESULT OF PRICING PRESSURES, PROVIDERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. CUSTOMERS ARE

SHIFTING THEIR FOCUS FROM ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS AND ARE SEEKING WAYS TO LEVERAGE THEIR BROADBAND AND VIDEO CONNECTIONS. CONVERGED FEATURES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED WIRELESS AND WIRELINE FUNCTIONALITY, ARE BECOMING SIMILARLY IMPORTANT, DRIVEN BY BOTH

CUSTOMER DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.



INNOVATION.

THE DELIVERY OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAS BEEN ACCELERATING. TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, PROVIDERS NEED TO

CONTINUOUSLY REVIEW, IMPROVE AND REFINE THEIR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND DEVELOP AND RAPIDLY DEPLOY NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMER.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE MASS MARKETS BUSINESS, CABLE OPERATORS ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS. CABLE OPERATORS

HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE AND CAPACITY OF THEIR NETWORKS IN ORDER TO OFFER DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO MARKET COMPETITIVE BUNDLED OFFERINGS THAT INCLUDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS, DIGITAL TELEVISION AND VOICE SERVICES. SEVERAL MAJOR

CABLE OPERATORS ALSO OFFER BUNDLES WITH WIRELESS SERVICES THROUGH STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS.

WE EXPECT CUSTOMER MIGRATION FROM

TRADITIONAL VOICE SERVICES TO WIRELESS SERVICES TO CONTINUE AS A GROWING NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS PLACE GREATER VALUE ON MOBILITY AND WIRELESS COMPANIES POSITION THEIR SERVICE AS A LANDLINE ALTERNATIVE. WE ALSO FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM CABLE

COMPANIES AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES AS WELL AS INTERNET PORTAL PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS HAVE MORE CHOICES FOR OBTAINING VIDEO CONTENT FROM VARIOUS ONLINE SERVICES AND THAT CONTENT CAN BE ACCESSED ON A TV, COMPUTER, TABLET OR

MOBILE PHONE.

IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE MARKET, THE CUSTOMERS NEED TO REDUCE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY COUPLED WITH THE

GROWTH OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY TECHNOLOGY CONVERGENCE IS DRIVING THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, CARRIERS AND HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN IT SERVICES ARE

MAKING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTING

NON-STRATEGIC

ASSETS OR FORGING NEW ALLIANCES TO BE BETTER POSITIONED FOR A REBOUND IN TECHNOLOGY SPENDING. MANY NEW ALLIANCES AND ACQUISITIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON EMERGING

FIELDS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, SOFTWARE DELIVERY, COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER COMPUTING TASKS VIA THE NETWORK, RATHER THAN ON

IN-HOUSE

MACHINES. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO UTILIZED ACQUISITIONS TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO ENTERPRISE OUTSOURCING MARKETS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN DOMINATED BY THE MAJOR IT OUTSOURCERS.

GLOBAL

WHOLESALE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL CARRIERS FOR LONG-HAUL, VOICE AND IP SERVICES. IN ADDITION, MOBILE VIDEO AND DATA NEEDS ARE DRIVING A GREATER NEED FOR WIRELESS BACKHAUL. NETWORK PROVIDERS, CABLE COMPANIES AND NICHE PLAYERS ARE COMPETITORS FOR

THIS NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITY.

WE ALSO COMPETE WITH COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (CLECS). OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS

GENERALLY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO CLECS AT SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS.

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS, INTERCONNECTED MARKETS, SHIFTING CONSUMER NEEDS AND CONVERGING INDUSTRY

ECOSYSTEMS ARE CREATING INNOVATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VERIZON. WE ARE TRANSFORMING AROUND THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR HIGH-PERFORMING NETWORKS, WITH A GOAL OF FUTURE GROWTH BASED ON DELIVERING WHAT CUSTOMERS WANT AND NEED IN THE NEW DIGITAL WORLD.

OUR THREE TIER STRATEGY IS TO LEAD AT THE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY LEVEL IN THE MARKETS WE SERVE, DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS MODELS THROUGH GLOBAL PLATFORMS IN DIGITAL MEDIA AND IOT AND DELIVER SOLUTIONS TO KEY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS FOR INCREMENTAL MONETIZATION.

TO EXECUTE THIS STRATEGY, WE HAVE CREATED AN ORGANIZATION DEVOTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND THE CULTIVATION OF NEW BUSINESSES. THIS ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON LEVERAGING ALL OF OUR ASSETS TO CREATE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT

CAN PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. SEVERAL STRATEGIC INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY THIS ORGANIZATION IN THE AREAS OF DIGITAL MEDIA, INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT AND IOT AND TELEMATICS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

AS A MARKET LEADER IN OFFERING DIFFERENTIATED SOLUTIONS TO OUR CONNECTED CUSTOMERS ACROSS THEIR DEVICES AT HOME, AT

WORK AND ON THE GO, VERIZON WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN IMPORTANT PILLAR OF OUR FUTURE STRATEGY. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ARE AIMED AT COMPLEMENTING AND AUGMENTING OUR STRENGTHS, EXPANDING OUR ADDRESSABLE MARKET,

ACCELERATING OUR PACE OF INNOVATION, ENABLING FASTER DELIVERY OF SOLUTIONS SUCH AS MEDIA AND IOT TO THE MARKETPLACE AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, LOWERING OUR MARKET AND EXECUTION RISK. STRONG PARTNERSHIPS ARE EXPECTED TO FURTHER OUR EFFORTS TO OFFER

COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. WE LOOK TO FORMULATE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND ALLIANCES WITH A GLOBAL ORIENTATION, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BENEFIT US IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY SOURCING, CONTENT ACQUISITION, CONSUMER INSIGHTS AND APPLICATION

ECOSYSTEMS.

WE BELIEVE THESE INVESTMENTS WILL ASSIST US IN BRINGING INNOVATIVE NEXT GENERATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO

MARKET AND UNCOVERING NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE, INCREASING REVENUE FROM EXISTING PROJECTS AND LEVERAGING OUR STRENGTHS ACROSS THE COMPANY.

DIGITAL MEDIA AND INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT

VERIZON HAS BEEN INVESTING IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT TAPS INTO THE MARKET SHIFT TO DIGITAL CONTENT AND ADVERTISING. WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN VIDEO ASSETS AND CAPABILITIES WITH A GOAL OF BUILDING A

GLOBAL PLATFORM AND DEVELOPING NEW BUSINESS MODELS FOR REACHING THE DIGITAL VIDEO CUSTOMER. WE BELIEVE THE GROWTH IN VIDEO CONSUMPTION USING MOBILE DEVICES PROVIDES US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENUE GROWTH. THROUGH VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS AND

INVESTMENTS AND THE LAUNCH OF VIDEO STREAMING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ARE EXPANDING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DELIVER CONTENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



IN JUNE 2015, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF AOL INC. (AOL), A LEADER IN DIGITAL CONTENT AND ADVERTISING. AOLS BUSINESS MODEL ALIGNS WITH OUR

APPROACH, AND WE BELIEVE THAT ITS COMBINATION OF OWNED AND OPERATED CONTENT PROPERTIES PLUS A DIGITAL ADVERTISING PLATFORM ENHANCES OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER DEVELOP FUTURE REVENUE STREAMS. DURING 2015, WE ALSO ACQUIRED MILLENNIAL MEDIA, AN ADVERTISING

TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS.



IN JULY 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT) WITH YAHOO! INC. (YAHOO). PURSUANT TO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, UPON

THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS THEREOF, WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE THE STOCK OF ONE OR MORE SUBSIDIARIES OF YAHOO HOLDING ALL OF YAHOOS OPERATING BUSINESS, FOR APPROXIMATELY $4.83 BILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS (THE

TRANSACTION). ON FEBRUARY 20, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TRANSACTION PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE REDUCED BY $350 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $4.48 BILLION IN CASH,

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE US WITH A VALUABLE PORTFOLIO OF ONLINE PROPERTIES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING MARKET LEADING CONTENT IN SPORTS, FINANCE, NEWS AND EMAIL SERVICES, WHICH HAVE ATTRACTED OVER

ONE BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE CONSUMER VIEWS. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO ALSO EXPAND OUR ANALYTICS AND AD TECH CAPABILITIES AND ENHANCE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND VALUE PROPOSITION TO ADVERTISERS. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE TRANSACTION IS

INCLUDED IN THE 2016 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS



IN 2015, WE LAUNCHED GO90, A MOBILE-FIRST SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

AD-SUPPORTED

MOBILE VIDEO STREAMING AS WELL AS SUBSCRIPTION-BASED SERVICES. DIGITAL CONTENT AVAILABLE ON THE GO90 PLATFORM INCLUDES LIVE EVENTS, POPULAR WEB AND TELEVISION CONTENT AND ORIGINAL CONTENT. IN

2016, WE INTRODUCED STREAMPASS, WHICH OFFERS STREAMING OF LIVE SPORTS THROUGH GO90 FREE OF DATA CHARGES TO VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMERS ON CERTAIN DATA PLANS. WE ALSO INTRODUCED FREEBEE DATA, A SPONSORED DATA SERVICE THAT ENABLES CONTENT PROVIDERS TO

PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO SOME OR ALL OF THE PROVIDERS MOBILE CONTENT OR TO SPONSOR SPECIFIC CONSUMER ACTIONS ON A

PER-CLICK

BASIS, FREE OF DATA CHARGES TO THE CUSTOMER.



WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES INVOLVING CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS (CDNS), VIDEO STREAMING AND RELATED CONSUMER

HARDWARE TO LEVERAGE NEW CONTENT MODELS. OUR WIRELESS NETWORK ENABLES US TO MOVE TOWARDS A UNIFIED VIDEO STRATEGY THAT POSITIONS US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS GROWTH OPPORTUNITY. WE BEGAN USING MULTIMEDIA BROADCAST MULTICAST SERVICE TECHNOLOGY TO

DEVELOP OUR LTE MULTICAST SERVICE, WHICH WE USE TO DELIVER LIVE EVENTS IN GO90. THIS SERVICE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE OUR NETWORK EFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO LIVE STREAMING VIDEO CONTENT WITH VIRTUALLY NO BUFFERING,

REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF DEVICES USING THE SERVICE. WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE RIGHTS TO DELIVER CONTENT OVER A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT DO NOT REQUIRE AN AUTHENTICATION BACK TO A SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR NFL AGREEMENT

ALLOWS OUR CUSTOMERS TO ACCESS CERTAIN GAMES LIVE ON OUR 4G LTE NETWORK WITHOUT AUTHENTICATING BACK TO ANY SUBSCRIPTION.



WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN VERIZON DIGITAL MEDIA SERVICES, WHICH OFFERS A SCALABLE PLATFORM FOR DELIVERING CONTENT, INCLUDING LIVE BROADCASTS, VIDEO

ON DEMAND, GAMES, SOFTWARE AND WEBSITES, TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON THEIR DEVICES AT ANY TIME. AS THE DIGITAL PLATFORM RESHAPES THE DELIVERY OF MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT, THERE IS AN INCREASING NEED FOR A STABLE, HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO DELIVERY PLATFORM.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING A SIMPLE

END-TO-END

GLOBAL PLATFORM FOR THE DELIVERY OF MEDIA TO CUSTOMERS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE SUPERIOR TO THAT OFFERED BY THE EXISTING

AND HIGHLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA DELIVERY ECOSYSTEM. THIS PLATFORM IS TARGETED AT MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES AND OTHER BUSINESSES FOCUSED ON DELIVERING THEIR DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH THE INTERNET. WE ALSO EXPECT, THROUGH THIS

PLATFORM, TO FURTHER INTEGRATE OUR FIOS AND WIRELESS OFFERINGS.



DURING 2016, WE ESTABLISHED VERIZON HEARST MEDIA PARTNERS, LLC, A CONTENT JOINT VENTURE WITH HEARST ENTERTAINMENT & SYNDICATION (HEARST),

TO BUILD NEW MULTIPLATFORM DIGITAL VIDEO CHANNELS TARGETED TO THE MOBILE MILLENNIAL AUDIENCE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HEARST, WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED IN TWO MEDIA COMPANIES, AWESOMENESSTV HOLDINGS, LLC AND COMPLEX MEDIA, INC. & CM PARTNERS, LLC, WHICH

ARE LEADERS IN PRODUCING CONTENT TARGETED AT KEY DEMOGRAPHICS, IN ORDER TO FURTHER DIVERSIFY OUR CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES WITHIN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA PORTFOLIO.

INTERNET OF THINGS AND TELEMATICS

THE ADOPTION OF IOT TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES

TO GROW AS COMPANIES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES ARE LEVERAGING IOT TECHNOLOGIES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY, GAIN BETTER CUSTOMER INSIGHTS, FACILITATE COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS AND BUILD NEW BUSINESS MODELS. ALTHOUGH IOT GROWTH IS EXPANDING

BROADLY, ADOPTION IS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE TELEMATICS AND TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS THE FIELDS OF SMART COMMUNITIES, HEALTHCARE, UTILITIES AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT. WE ARE BUILDING OUR GROWTH CAPABILITIES IN THE IOT MARKET BY

DEVELOPING BUSINESS MODELS THAT MONETIZE USAGE ON OUR NETWORK AT THE CONNECTIVITY, PLATFORM AND SOLUTION LAYERS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED IOT SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS KEY MARKET NEEDS FOR ELECTRIC AND OTHER UTILITIES, FARMS AND OTHER PURVEYORS

OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, DRUG COMPANIES AND OTHERS WITH COMPLEX SUPPLY CHAINS. IN ADDITION, OUR IOT CUSTOMERS CAN TURN THE DATA THAT OUR SOLUTIONS PROVIDE INTO ACTIONABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES AND CREATE REVENUE GROWTH.

OUR STRATEGY TO SIMPLIFY IOT TECHNOLOGY AND ACCELERATE ITS ADOPTION ALSO INCLUDES THINGSPACE, AN IOT PLATFORM. THINGSPACE IS DESIGNED TO

HELP DEVELOPERS CREATE, TEST, MANAGE AND MARKET

IOT-BASED

SOLUTIONS AIMED AT MAJOR VERTICAL MARKETS, SUCH AS ENERGY, HEALTH CARE AND CONNECTED CITIES. THINGSPACE COMES WITH A PORTAL THAT INCLUDES IMMEDIATE

ACCESS TO DEDICATED APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES AND PARTNER DEVELOPMENT KITS. IN OCTOBER 2016, WE ACQUIRED SENSITY SYSTEMS, INC., A LEADING PROVIDER OF IOT SOLUTIONS FOR SMART COMMUNITIES, IN ORDER TO ADD A LEADING COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF

SMART CITY SOLUTIONS.

THROUGH VERIZON TELEMATICS, WE PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY AND TELEMATICS SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS TO

MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS

MERCEDES-BENZ

AND HELP BUSINESSES MANAGE LARGE VEHICLE FLEETS MORE EFFICIENTLY. OUR SUITE OF REAL-TIME VEHICLE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS CONNECTS AUTOMOBILES WITH CONTENT

SERVICES AND CALL CENTERS. OUR PLATFORM ENABLES FACTORY AND AFTERMARKET-INSTALLED AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY AND SECURITY FEATURES AS WELL AS LOCATION-BASED SERVICES AND VEHICLE DIAGNOSTICS. WE PROVIDE USAGE-BASED DATA SERVICES TO NEW VEHICLES IN THE

UNITED STATES, CHINA AND EUROPE. OUR VERIZON TELEMATICS SOLUTION PROVIDES COMMERCIAL FLEET MANAGERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA WITH REAL-TIME ACCESS TO DATA THAT YIELDS OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, INCREASED VEHICLE RELIABILITY AND IMPROVED DRIVER

SAFETY. WE ALSO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE TO OVER 23,000 VEHICLES OPERATED BY VERIZON.

IN 2015, WE INTRODUCED HUM, AN AFTERMARKET

VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. THIS SUBSCRIPTION-BASED SERVICE PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR VEHICLES, ACCESS TO LIVE ASSISTANCE AND ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WITH GPS ACCURACY WHEN NEEDED. OUR HUM SERVICE ALSO

OFFERS THE ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH A CERTIFIED MECHANIC TO DIAGNOSE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND OFFER SOLUTIONS.

IN 2016, WE

ACQUIRED FLEETMATICS GROUP PLC, A GLOBAL PROVIDER OF FLEET AND MOBILE WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, AND TELOGIS, INC., A GLOBAL, CLOUD-BASED MOBILE ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE COMPANY. WE EXPECT THESE ACQUISITIONS TO ADVANCE OUR FLEET

TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS, EXPAND OUR DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS AND POSITION OUR TELEMATICS BUSINESS AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF FLEET AND MOBILE WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS GLOBALLY.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSES TO VARIOUS PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, DOMAIN NAMES AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY PURSUE THE FILING AND REGISTRATION OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, DOMAIN NAMES, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. WE

ALSO ACTIVELY GRANT LICENSES, IN EXCHANGE FOR APPROPRIATE FEES OR OTHER CONSIDERATION AND SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS AND RESTRICTIONS, TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ENABLE THEM TO UTILIZE CERTAIN OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PROPRIETARY

TECHNOLOGY AS PART OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SUCH LICENSES ENABLE THE LICENSEES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESULTS OF VERIZONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. WHILE THESE LICENSES RESULT IN VALUABLE CONSIDERATION BEING PAID TO US, WE DO

NOT BELIEVE THAT THE LOSS OF SUCH CONSIDERATION, OR THE EXPIRATION OF ANY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE PERIODICALLY RECEIVE OFFERS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO PURCHASE OR OBTAIN LICENSES FOR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN EXCHANGE FOR ROYALTIES OR OTHER PAYMENTS. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY

RECEIVE NOTICES ALLEGING THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INFRINGE ON THIRD-PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE CLAIMS, WHETHER AGAINST US DIRECTLY OR AGAINST THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT WE, IN TURN, SELL

TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES, OR CEASE OFFERING THE RELEVANT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES IS INCLUDED IN THE 2016 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREOWNERS UNDER THE HEADING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT.

REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS

REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

VERIZON OPERATES IN A REGULATED AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER VOICE AND DATA SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS OTHER WIRELESS COMPANIES, TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE

COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, SOFTWARE AND APPLICATION PROVIDERS, AND OTHER

NON-TRADITIONAL

COMPANIES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION AND

EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO FEWER REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS THAN VERIZON. FOR MANY SERVICES OFFERED BY

VERIZON, THE FCC IS OUR PRIMARY REGULATOR. THE FCC HAS JURISDICTION OVER INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND OTHER MATTERS UNDER THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (COMMUNICATIONS ACT OR ACT). OTHER VERIZON SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO

STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION.

FEDERAL REGULATION

WIRELESS SERVICES

THE FCC REGULATES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF OUR WIRELESS

OPERATIONS. GENERALLY, THE FCC HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION, ACQUISITION AND TRANSFER OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. ALL WIRELESS SERVICES REQUIRE USE OF RADIO FREQUENCY SPECTRUM, THE ASSIGNMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF WHICH IS

SUBJECT TO FCC OVERSIGHT. VERIZON ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. WE CAN MEET OUR NEEDS FOR LICENSED SPECTRUM BY PURCHASING LICENSES OR LEASING SPECTRUM FROM OTHERS, OR BY PARTICIPATING IN A COMPETITIVE

BIDDING PROCESS TO ACQUIRE NEW SPECTRUM FROM THE FCC. THOSE PROCESSES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REVIEWS, APPROVALS AND POTENTIAL CONDITIONS.

TODAY, VERIZON HOLDS FCC SPECTRUM LICENSES THAT ALLOW IT TO PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF MOBILE AND FIXED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING BOTH VOICE AND DATA SERVICES. FCC SPECTRUM LICENSES TYPICALLY HAVE A

TERM OF 10 YEARS, AT WHICH TIME THEY ARE SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. WHILE THE FCC HAS ROUTINELY RENEWED ALL OF VERIZONS WIRELESS LICENSES, CHALLENGES COULD BE RAISED IN THE FUTURE. IF A WIRELESS LICENSE WAS REVOKED OR NOT RENEWED, VERIZON WOULD NOT

BE PERMITTED TO PROVIDE SERVICES ON THE SPECTRUM COVERED BY THAT LICENSE. SOME OF OUR LICENSES REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH

SO-CALLED

OPEN ACCESS FCC REGULATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE LICENSEES OF

PARTICULAR SPECTRUM TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEIR CHOICE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS. THE FCC HAS ALSO IMPOSED CERTAIN SPECIFIC MANDATES ON WIRELESS CARRIERS, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION AND GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE

REQUIREMENTS, TECHNICAL OPERATING STANDARDS, PROVISION OF ENHANCED 911 SERVICES, ROAMING OBLIGATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR WIRELESS TOWER AND ANTENNA FACILITIES.

BROADBAND

VERIZON OFFERS MANY DIFFERENT BROADBAND SERVICES. TRADITIONALLY,

THE FCC RECOGNIZED THAT BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES AS INFORMATION SERVICES SUBJECT TO A LIGHT TOUCH REGULATORY APPROACH RATHER THAN TO THE TRADITIONAL, UTILITIES-STYLE REGULATIONS. IN 2015, THE FCC REVERSED COURSE AND

DECLARED THAT BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES ARE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SUBJECT TO COMMON CARRIAGE REGULATION UNDER TITLE II OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT. THIS DECISION CREATED UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE LEVEL OF REGULATION THAT

WILL APPLY TO BROADBAND SERVICES. IT CREATED A RISK THAT SUCH REGULATION WOULD LIMIT THE WAYS THAT BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDERS STRUCTURE THEIR BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS AND MANAGE THEIR NETWORKS AND COULD SPUR ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS,

INCLUDING RATE REGULATION, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT BROADBAND INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION. THE FCCS DECISION WAS AFFIRMED BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS, BUT MAY BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHALLENGE IN THE COURTS. IN ADDITION, CONGRESS

AND THE FCC ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO DEBATE THE PROPER SCOPE OF SUCH REGULATIONS. REGARDLESS OF REGULATION, VERIZON REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE OPEN INTERNET WHICH PROVIDES CONSUMERS WITH COMPETITIVE CHOICES AND UNBLOCKED ACCESS TO LAWFUL WEBSITES AND

CONTENT WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW THEY WANT, AND OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AT HTTP://RESPONSIBILITY.VERIZON.COM/BROADBAND-COMMITMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WIRELINE VOICE

VERIZON OFFERS MANY DIFFERENT WIRELINE VOICE SERVICES, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE SERVICE AND OTHER SERVICES THAT RELY ON TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS VOIP. FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES, LEGACY TELEPHONE SERVICES

ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON CARRIER SERVICES. COMMON CARRIER SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WITH RESPECT TO RATES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SERVICES. THE FCC HAS NOT DECIDED THE

REGULATORY CLASSIFICATION OF VOIP BUT HAS SAID VOIP SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST COMPLY WITH CERTAIN RULES, SUCH AS 911 CAPABILITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.

VIDEO

VERIZON OFFERS A MULTICHANNEL VIDEO SERVICE THAT IS REGULATED LIKE

TRADITIONAL CABLE SERVICE. THE FCC HAS A BODY OF RULES THAT APPLY TO CABLE OPERATORS, AND THESE RULES ALSO GENERALLY APPLY TO VERIZON. IN AREAS WHERE VERIZON OFFERS ITS FACILITIES-BASED MULTICHANNEL VIDEO SERVICES, VERIZON HAS TYPICALLY BEEN

REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A FRANCHISE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY THAT IMPACT ALL PARTS OF OUR

BUSINESS, INCLUDING VOICE, WIRELESS, BROADBAND AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND ROLL OUT OF NEW PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THOSE IN THE IOT SPACE. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE FCCS PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. IN

NOVEMBER 2016, THE FCC RELEASED NEW PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY RULES THAT WILL APPLY TO ALL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING OUR FIXED AND MOBILE VOICE AND BROADBAND SERVICES. OTHER PARTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PRIVACY AND DATA

SECURITY OVERSIGHT OF OTHER FEDERAL REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. GENERALLY, ATTENTION TO PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS IS INCREASING AT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL. IN ADDITION, A NEW DATA PROTECTION REGULATION

WILL GO INTO EFFECT IN EUROPE IN MAY 2018 THAT INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES FOR

NON-COMPLIANCE.

PUBLIC SAFETY AND CYBERSECURITY

THE FCC HAS PLAYED A ROLE IN ADDRESSING PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS BY REGULATING EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND MANDATING WIDESPREAD AVAILABILITY OF BOTH MEDIA (BROADCAST/CABLE) AND WIRELESS EMERGENCY

ALERTING SERVICES. IN RESPONSE TO RECENT CYBER ATTACKS, HOWEVER, THE FCC OR OTHER REGULATORS MAY ATTEMPT TO INCREASE REGULATION OF THE CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES OF PROVIDERS.

INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION AND NETWORK ACCESS

THE FCC REGULATES SOME OF THE

RATES THAT CARRIERS PAY EACH OTHER FOR THE EXCHANGE OF VOICE TRAFFIC (PARTICULARLY TRADITIONAL WIRELINE TRAFFIC) OVER DIFFERENT NETWORKS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF INTERCONNECTION FOR SOME VOICE SERVICES. THE FCC ALSO REGULATES SOME OF THE RATES AND TERMS

AND CONDITIONS FOR CERTAIN WIRELINE BUSINESS DATA SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES AND NETWORK FACILITIES. VERIZON IS BOTH A SELLER AND A BUYER OF THESE SERVICES, AND BOTH MAKES AND RECEIVES INTERCONNECTION PAYMENTS. THE FCC HAS FOCUSED IN

RECENT YEARS ON WHETHER CHANGES IN THE RATES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR BOTH THE EXCHANGE OF TRAFFIC AND FOR BUSINESS DATA SERVICES MAY BE APPROPRIATE.

STATE REGULATION AND LOCAL REGULATION

WIRELESS SERVICES

THE ACT GENERALLY PREEMPTS REGULATION BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE ENTRY OF, OR THE RATES CHARGED BY, WIRELESS CARRIERS. THE ACT

DOES NOT PROHIBIT STATES FROM REGULATING THE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF WIRELESS SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME STATES ATTEMPT TO REGULATE WIRELESS CUSTOMER BILLING MATTERS AND IMPOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SEVERAL STATES ALSO HAVE LAWS

OR REGULATIONS THAT ADDRESS SAFETY ISSUES (E.G., USE OF WIRELESS HANDSETS WHILE DRIVING) AND TAXATION MATTERS. IN ADDITION, WIRELESS TOWER AND ANTENNA FACILITIES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL ZONING AND LAND USE REGULATION, AND SECURING

APPROVALS FOR NEW OR MODIFIED FACILITIES IS OFTEN A LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS.

WIRELINE SERVICES

STATE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS REGULATE VERIZONS TELEPHONE OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTRASTATE

MATTERS. VERIZON OPERATES AS AN INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER IN NINE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THESE INCUMBENT OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEVELS OF PRICING FLEXIBILITY AND OTHER STATE OVERSIGHT AND REQUIREMENTS.

VERIZON ALSO HAS OTHER WIRELINE OPERATIONS THAT ARE MORE LIGHTLY REGULATED. IN ADDITION, AS A VIDEO SERVICES OPERATOR IN MANY STATES, VERIZON HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A CABLE FRANCHISE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, OR IN SOME CASES A STATE-WIDE

FRANCHISE, AND COMPLY WITH CERTAIN

ONE-TIME

AND ONGOING OBLIGATIONS, AS A RESULT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO COVER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES AND PAST

TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES. THESE RESERVES INCLUDE FUNDS TO ADDRESS CONTAMINATION AT THE SITE OF A FORMER SYLVANIA FACILITY IN HICKSVILLE, NY, WHICH HAD PROCESSED NUCLEAR FUEL RODS IN THE 1950S AND 1960S. IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE ARMY

CORPS OF ENGINEERS (ACE) ACCEPTED THE SITE INTO ITS FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM. AS A RESULT, THE ACE HAS TAKEN PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADDRESSING THE CONTAMINATION AT THE SITE. AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE RESERVES MAY BE

MADE AFTER A COST ALLOCATION IS CONDUCTED WITH RESPECT TO THE PAST AND FUTURE EXPENSES OF ALL OF THE PARTIES. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE MAY ALSO BE MADE BASED UPON THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS FOUND AT OTHER SITES REQUIRING REMEDIATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS AND THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS

COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AND FROM EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS A RECESSION OR ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE AFFORDABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMERS MAY SEEK TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BY FORGOING PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, ELECTING TO USE FEWER HIGHER MARGIN SERVICES OR OBTAINING LOWER-COST PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

SIMILARLY, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE MAY DELAY PURCHASING DECISIONS, DELAY FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE OFFERINGS OR REDUCE THEIR USE OF SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASED

NUMBER OF OUR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR SERVICES. IF THESE EVENTS WERE TO OCCUR, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION THAT MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITS.

WE

FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL DISTINCTIONS AMONG WIRELESS, CABLE, INTERNET, LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND

BROUGHT NEW COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES, CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION AND DEVICE PROVIDERS AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES HAVE ENABLED US TO

OFFER NEW TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER PROVIDERS TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERING THE FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR

CUSTOMERS THROUGH COMMERCIAL OFFERS THAT VARY SERVICE AND DEVICE PRICING, PROMOTIONS, INCENTIVES AND LEVELS OF SERVICE PROVIDED  IN SOME CASES SPECIFICALLY TARGETING VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMERS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND

ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NETWORK QUALITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE, THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE QUALITY OF OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, OUR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE REACH AND QUALITY OF OUR SALES AND

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES. IT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND

FOR EXISTING SERVICES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESPOND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ADAPT TO CHANGES AND DISRUPTIONS IN TECHNOLOGY AND ADDRESS CHANGING CONSUMER DEMAND ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY

EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES, BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

OUR INDUSTRY IS RAPIDLY CHANGING AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS AND ALLOW NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETS WE SERVE. IN ORDER TO

GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET FUTURE CHALLENGES FROM COMPETING

TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR

REGULATORY RESTRAINTS ON OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW SERVICES. IF OUR SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND

ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN ADDITION TO INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OFFERINGS, WE MUST PHASE OUT

OUTDATED AND UNPROFITABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DO SO ON A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS, WE COULD EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS ON OUR ABILITY TO PHASE OUT CURRENT SERVICES.

WE DEPEND ON KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE DEPEND ON VARIOUS KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE US, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH OTHER SUPPLIERS, WITH EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, SUCH AS

SWITCH AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT, SMARTPHONES AND OTHER WIRELESS DEVICES, THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR SMARTPHONE AND OTHER DEVICE SUPPLIERS OFTEN RELY ON ONE VENDOR FOR THE

MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, USED IN THEIR DEVICES. IF THESE SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS FAIL TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE ON A TIMELY BASIS OR FAIL TO MEET OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS AND WHEN REQUESTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE OUR NETWORKS. BECAUSE OF THE COST AND TIME LAG THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING FROM ONE SUPPLIER TO ANOTHER, OUR

BUSINESS COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISRUPTED IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO, OR CHOSE TO, REPLACE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR SUPPLIERS WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, ESPECIALLY IF THE REPLACEMENT BECAME NECESSARY ON SHORT

NOTICE. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, DECREASE OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ON WHICH WE RELY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY ON WHICH WE DEPEND, INCLUDING

LITIGATION INVOLVING CLAIMS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT. SUCH CLAIMS ARE FREQUENTLY MADE IN THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER OUR BUSINESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH LITIGATION. WE EXPECT OUR DEPENDENCE ON KEY SUPPLIERS TO

CONTINUE AS WE DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE MORE ADVANCED GENERATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE FCC AND OTHER

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE REGULATED BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE REGULATORY REGIMES FREQUENTLY RESTRICT OR IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN DESIGNATED

AREAS AND PROVIDE SPECIFIED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE ARE FREQUENTLY REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN LICENSES FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STANDARDS. WE ARE OFTEN INVOLVED IN REGULATORY AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS OR INQUIRIES RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS, OR THE REVIEWS BY FEDERAL OR STATE

COURTS OF REGULATORY RULINGS. WITHOUT RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE LICENSES

NEEDED TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN OR IN MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING LICENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FCC GRANTS WIRELESS LICENSES FOR TERMS GENERALLY LASTING 10 YEARS, SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. THE LOSS OF, OR A MATERIAL LIMITATION ON, CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSES

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS

OR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, OR INTERNATIONAL LEVEL COULD RESTRICT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MANAGE OUR WIRELINE AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS, IMPAIR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES AND

POTENTIALLY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION. A NEW DATA PROTECTION

REGULATION WILL GO INTO EFFECT IN EUROPE IN MAY 2018 THAT INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES FOR

NON-COMPLIANCE.

IN ADDITION, IN ITS ORDER IMPOSING

SO-CALLED

NETWORK

NEUTRALITY REGULATIONS, THE FCC REVERSED COURSE IN 2015 ON THE LONGSTANDING LIGHT TOUCH APPROACH AND RECLASSIFIED BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SUBJECT TO UTILITIES-STYLE COMMON

CARRIAGE REGULATION. WHILE THE FULL SCOPE AND EFFECT OF THIS NEW REGULATORY APPROACH IS UNCERTAIN, THESE RULES LIMIT THE WAYS THAT A BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDER CAN STRUCTURE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS, MANAGE ITS NETWORK AND OPEN THE DOOR

TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING RATE REGULATION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT BROADBAND INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION. THESE RULES MAY BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER CHALLENGE IN THE COURTS AND THE PROPER SCOPE OF SUCH REGULATIONS IS BEING DEBATED IN

CONGRESS AND THE FCC, BUT THE OUTCOME AND TIMING OF THOSE CHALLENGES AND DEBATES REMAIN UNCERTAIN. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WE HOLD CERTAIN WIRELESS LICENSES THAT REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH

SO-CALLED

OPEN

ACCESS FCC REGULATIONS, WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRE LICENSEES OF PARTICULAR SPECTRUM TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEIR CHOICE. MOREOVER, CERTAIN SERVICES COULD BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING REGULATION BY THE FCC AND/OR

VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES. THE FURTHER REGULATION OF BROADBAND, WIRELESS AND OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES AND ANY RELATED COURT DECISIONS COULD RESTRICT OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND LIMIT THE RETURN WE CAN EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ON PAST AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR NETWORKS.

CYBER ATTACKS IMPACTING OUR NETWORKS OR SYSTEMS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF MALWARE, COMPUTER VIRUSES, DEDICATED DENIAL OF SERVICES ATTACKS, CREDENTIAL HARVESTING AND

OTHER MEANS FOR OBTAINING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR DISRUPTING THE OPERATION OF OUR NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR SUPPLIERS, VENDORS AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. CYBER ATTACKS MAY CAUSE EQUIPMENT

FAILURES, LOSS OF INFORMATION, INCLUDING SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES OR VALUABLE TECHNICAL AND MARKETING INFORMATION, AS WELL AS DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OR OUR CUSTOMERS OPERATIONS. CYBER ATTACKS AGAINST COMPANIES,

INCLUDING VERIZON, HAVE INCREASED IN FREQUENCY, SCOPE AND POTENTIAL HARM IN RECENT YEARS. FURTHER, THE PERPETRATORS OF CYBER ATTACKS ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO PARTICULAR GROUPS OR PERSONS. THESE ATTACKS MAY BE COMMITTED BY COMPANY EMPLOYEES OR EXTERNAL

ACTORS OPERATING IN ANY GEOGRAPHY, INCLUDING JURISDICTIONS WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO ADDRESS SUCH ATTACKS ARE UNAVAILABLE OR INEFFECTIVE, AND MAY EVEN BE LAUNCHED BY OR AT THE BEHEST OF NATION STATES. WHILE, TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUBJECT

TO CYBER ATTACKS WHICH, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, HAVE BEEN MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO REDUCE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING PROTECTION OF OUR SYSTEMS AND

NETWORKS, MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REPEL OR MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A MAJOR CYBER ATTACK IN THE FUTURE.

THE INABILITY TO

OPERATE OUR NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS OR THOSE OF OUR SUPPLIERS, VENDORS AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS AS A RESULT OF CYBER ATTACKS, EVEN FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES TO VERIZON AND/OR A LOSS OF MARKET SHARE TO OTHER

COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A MAJOR CYBER ATTACK ON VERIZON COULD INCLUDE EXPENSIVE INCENTIVES OFFERED TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS TO RETAIN THEIR BUSINESS, INCREASED EXPENDITURES ON CYBERSECURITY MEASURES AND

THE USE OF ALTERNATE RESOURCES, LOST REVENUES FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND LITIGATION. THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ATTACKS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. FURTHER, CERTAIN OF VERIZONS BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THOSE

OFFERING SECURITY SOLUTIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLOUD SERVICES TO BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR OWN NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS IS CALLED INTO QUESTION AS A RESULT OF A CYBER ATTACK. MOREOVER, OUR

INCREASING PRESENCE IN THE IOT INDUSTRY WITH OFFERINGS OF TELEMATICS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING VEHICLE TELEMATICS, COULD ALSO INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL COSTS AND EXPENSES AND REPUTATIONAL HARM IN THE EVENT OF CYBER ATTACKS IMPACTING

THESE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, A COMPROMISE OF SECURITY OR A THEFT OR OTHER COMPROMISE OF VALUABLE INFORMATION, SUCH AS FINANCIAL DATA AND SENSITIVE OR PRIVATE PERSONAL INFORMATION, COULD RESULT IN LAWSUITS AND GOVERNMENT CLAIMS,

INVESTIGATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, ADVERSELY IMPACT CUSTOMER AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND COULD FURTHER RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON VERIZONS RESULTS OF OPERATION OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORIST ACTS OR ACTS OF WAR COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY NATURAL DISASTERS,

POWER OUTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS, OTHER HOSTILE ACTS AND EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE UPON WHICH OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS RELY, RESULTING IN DEGRADATION OR DISRUPTION OF SERVICE TO OUR

CUSTOMERS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF THESE EVENTS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. OUR SYSTEM REDUNDANCY MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR INADEQUATE, AND

OUR DISASTER RECOVERY

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PLANNING MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES. THESE EVENTS COULD ALSO DAMAGE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE SUPPLIERS THAT PROVIDE US WITH THE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE

OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER EVENT CAUSING SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL DAMAGE COULD CAUSE US TO EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME AND EXPENDITURES TO RESUME OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUES FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

VERIZON HAS SIGNIFICANT DEBT, WHICH COULD INCREASE FURTHER IF VERIZON INCURS ADDITIONAL DEBT IN THE FUTURE AND DOES NOT RETIRE

EXISTING DEBT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, VERIZON HAD APPROXIMATELY $108.1 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING

INDEBTEDNESS, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY $8.9 BILLION OF UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER ITS EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY. VERIZONS DEBT LEVEL AND RELATED DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING.



REQUIRING VERIZON TO DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON ITS DEBT AND

THE PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED BY AN ENTITY ACQUIRED IN A TRANSACTION WITH VODAFONE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDS VERIZON HAS AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS;



MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT OR EXPENSIVE FOR VERIZON TO OBTAIN ANY NECESSARY FUTURE FINANCING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE

REQUIREMENTS, DEBT REFINANCING, ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER PURPOSES;



REDUCING VERIZONS FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR OR REACTING TO CHANGES IN ITS INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS;



MAKING VERIZON MORE VULNERABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DOWNTURN IN ITS BUSINESS; AND



EXPOSING VERIZON TO INCREASED INTEREST RATE RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES.

IN ADDITION, OUR TERM LOAN AGREEMENTS REQUIRE VERIZON TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVERAGE RATIO UNLESS

VERIZONS CREDIT RATINGS ARE AT OR ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL, WHICH COULD LIMIT VERIZONS ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THE FUTURE.

ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING.

WE REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE FUND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS IN PART THROUGH BORROWINGS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CREDIT MARKETS. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT

MARKETS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR REFINANCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY

SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON OUR PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CUSTOMARY CREDIT METRICS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING

AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. A SEVERE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND SUCH INSTABILITY COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING.

INCREASES IN COSTS FOR PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND

INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 160,900 EMPLOYEES AND APPROXIMATELY 201,000 RETIREES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016 ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN VERIZONS BENEFIT PLANS, THE COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR COSTS OF MAINTAINING THESE PLANS, AND THE

FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE PLANS, ARE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE POTENTIAL REPEAL AND REPLACEMENT OR MODIFICATION OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,

INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS, DECREASES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS ON FUNDS HELD BY OUR PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS AND CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE AND MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES. IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUR BENEFIT PLANS, THOSE COSTS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, AND WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS OR EXPERIENCE WORK STOPPAGES AS A RESULT OF THE RENEGOTIATION OF OUR LABOR CONTRACTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, APPROXIMATELY 23% OF OUR WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS. WHILE LESS THAN 1%

OF THE WORKFORCE OF OUR WIRELESS AND OTHER BUSINESSES OUTSIDE OF WIRELINE ARE REPRESENTED BY UNIONS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS UNIONS MAY HAVE IN ORGANIZING THESE WORKFORCES OR THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON OUR

COSTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES OR SETTLEMENTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FROM TIME TO TIME, SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS,

PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS, ANTITRUST CLASS ACTIONS, WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTIONS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO OUR ADVERTISING, SALES, BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS ALSO FACES PERSONAL

INJURY AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATING TO ALLEGED HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIRELESS PHONES OR RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSMITTERS, AND CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT CHALLENGE MARKETING PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURES RELATING TO ALLEGED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS

OF HANDHELD WIRELESS PHONES. WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OR SETTLEMENTS.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

IN OCTOBER 2013, THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE NOTIFIED VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC. AND OTHER

VERIZON COMPANIES OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE STATUTES PRIMARILY ARISING FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS, BATTERIES AND AEROSOL CANS AT CERTAIN CALIFORNIA FACILITIES. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THIS

INVESTIGATION AND CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR OPERATIONS RELATING TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. WHILE PENALTIES RELATING TO THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS COULD EXCEED $100,000, WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ANY PENALTIES ULTIMATELY INCURRED WILL BE MATERIAL. ON

APRIL 1, 2016, WE COMPLETED THE SALE TO FRONTIER OF OUR LANDLINE BUSINESS OPERATED BY VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC. AND CERTAIN OTHER VERIZON LANDLINE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, FRONTIER NOW OWNS AND OPERATES VERIZON CALIFORNIA INC.

STOCK REPURCHASES

IN MARCH 2014, THE VERIZON BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A THREE-YEAR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO 100 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE PROGRAM, SHARES MAY BE

REPURCHASED IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS AND ON THE OPEN MARKET, INCLUDING THROUGH PLANS COMPLYING WITH RULE

10B5-1(C)

UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE

PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE COMPANYS CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES.

DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2016, VERIZON DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT COULD BE PURCHASED BY OR ON BEHALF OF VERIZON UNDER OUR SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WAS 97.2 MILLION.
