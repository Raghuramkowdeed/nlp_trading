DOMESTIC WIRELESS

BACKGROUND

OUR DOMESTIC WIRELESS SEGMENT, CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DOING BUSINESS AS VERIZON WIRELESS (VERIZON WIRELESS), IS A JOINT VENTURE FORMED IN

APRIL 2000 BY THE COMBINATION OF THE U.S. WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE GROUP PLC (VODAFONE). VERIZON OWNS A CONTROLLING 55% INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS, AND VODAFONE OWNS THE REMAINING 45%. VERIZON WIRELESS PROVIDES

WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES ACROSS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS THE LARGEST THIRD GENERATION (3G) NETWORK OF ANY U.S. WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER.

VERIZON WIRELESS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE UNITED STATES AS MEASURED BY TOTAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND

REVENUE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BEGUN THE DEPLOYMENT IN OUR NETWORK OF A FOURTH-GENERATION (4G) TECHNOLOGY, LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE), WHICH PROVIDES HIGHER DATA THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVED NETWORK EFFICIENCIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2010, THIS 4G LTE NETWORK WAS DEPLOYED IN 38 MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS AND MORE THAN 60 COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT TO DEPLOY 4G LTE IN AN ADDITIONAL 140 MARKETS BY THE END OF 2011 AND IN VIRTUALLY OUR ENTIRE CURRENT 3G

NETWORK FOOTPRINT BY THE END OF 2013.

IN 2010, DOMESTIC WIRELESS REVENUES WERE $63.4 BILLION, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 60% OF

VERIZONS AGGREGATE REVENUES.

WIRELESS SERVICE AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS

OUR WIRELESS SERVICES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS RECEIVING SERVICE UNDER THE

VERIZON WIRELESS

BRAND. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS RECEIVE SERVICES ON OUR NETWORK AS A RESULT OF WHOLESALE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE ALSO DESCRIBED BELOW.

TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPONENTS COMMON TO WIRELESS PHONES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELECTRONIC COMPONENT MANUFACTURERS THAT WE DO NOT DEAL WITH DIRECTLY.

APPLICATION AND DEVICE DEVELOPMENT

WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE DEVICES, DATA SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE TO RUN ON OUR 3G AND/OR 4G LTE NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



OPEN ACCESS.

AS PART OF OUR INITIATIVE INTENDED TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO USE, ON OUR NETWORK, THIRD-PARTY DEVICES AND MOBILE

APPLICATIONS THAT WE DO NOT SELL, WE PUBLISHED THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE STANDARDS USED BY THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY TO DESIGN SUCH DEVICES. INDEPENDENT TESTING LABORATORIES PERFORM TESTS ON THIRD-PARTY DEVICES TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONFORM TO THESE

STANDARDS, AND NUMEROUS DEVICES HAVE ALREADY BEEN CERTIFIED TO RUN ON OUR 3G NETWORK. WHILE WE INITIALLY COMMENCED THIS INITIATIVE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS, WE ARE ALSO OBLIGATED TO ABIDE BY CERTAIN OPEN ACCESS RULES IMPOSED BY THE FCC WITH

RESPECT TO THE 700 MHZ C BLOCK SPECTRUM LICENSES WE HOLD AND ARE USING IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR 4G LTE NETWORK. THESE OPEN ACCESS RULES REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT WE ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS

OF THEIR CHOICE ON THIS SPECTRUM, AS LONG AS SUCH DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS MEET CERTAIN NETWORK STANDARDS AND HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY US. CONSISTENT WITH THESE RULES, FURTHER DESCRIBED IN REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDSFCC

REGULATIONWIRELESS SERVICES, WE HAVE PUBLISHED STANDARDS FOR OUR 4G LTE NETWORK THAT DEVELOPERS WILL USE TO DESIGN DEVICES THAT CAN RUN ON THIS NETWORK, AND WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR SUCH DEVICES. WE HAVE ALSO

PUBLISHED GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPERS SEEKING TO DESIGN APPLICATIONS THAT WILL RUN ON OUR 4G LTE NETWORK.



BUSINESS SOLUTIONS

. OUR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING WIRELESS SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS

CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, UTILITIES, FINANCE, RETAIL AND GOVERNMENT SECTORS. THIS ORGANIZATION HAS CREATED THE BUSINESS SOLUTION ALLIANCE, A JOINT MARKETING PROGRAM WITH KEY DEVICE AND APPLICATION DEVELOPERS

THAT BRINGS INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS TO OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE ALSO LAUNCHED AN EXTERNAL BUSINESS SOLUTION FINDER WEBSITE, WHERE BUSINESSES CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THE VARIOUS SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THESE

DEVICE AND APPLICATION DEVELOPERS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE DEDICATED RESOURCES TO HELP DESIGN CUSTOM SOLUTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.



NPHASE.

NPHASE, OUR JOINT VENTURE WITH QUALCOMM, IS FACILITATING OUR PROVISION OF M2M WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS TO A VARIETY OF

VERTICAL MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING HEALTHCARE, MANUFACTURING, UTILITIES, TELEMATICS, DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS.



LTE INNOVATION CENTER

. WE OPERATE THE VERIZON WIRELESS LTE INNOVATION CENTER, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL SERVE AS A CATALYST FOR THE EARLY

DEVELOPMENT OF DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS FOR USE ON LTE NETWORKS. THE CENTER WORKS WITH SEVERAL OF OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HELP THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY QUICKLY BRING PRODUCTS TO MARKET.



ISIS

. IN 2010, WE FORMED ISIS, A JOINT VENTURE WITH AT&T AND T-MOBILE, TO CREATE A MOBILE PAYMENT NETWORK THAT WILL ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO

PAY FOR POINT-OF-SALE PURCHASES VIA THEIR MOBILE PHONES VIA NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY, RATHER THAN BY USING CASH OR A CREDIT CARD.

NETWOR

K

OUR NETWORK IS AMONG THE LARGEST IN THE

UNITED STATES, WITH LICENSED AND OPERATIONAL COVERAGE IN ALL OF THE TOP 100 MOST POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. OUR NETWORK COVERS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 292 MILLION AND PROVIDES SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE OF APPROXIMATELY

94.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST NETWORK RELIABILITY. WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS

ON DESIGNING AND DEPLOYING OUR NETWORK IN A MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE MAXIMIZES THE NUMBER OF CALLS BY OUR CUSTOMERS THAT ARE CONNECTED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND COMPLETED WITHOUT BEING DROPPED. THIRD-PARTY STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2010 SHOW THAT, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, WE HAVE THE FEWEST DROPPED CALLS AND THE FEWEST INEFFECTIVE ATTEMPTS AMONG THE NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE 98 MOST POPULOUS U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT, EXPAND AND

UPGRADE OUR NETWORK AND EXPLORE STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR NATIONAL NETWORK COVERAGE THROUGH SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS OF WIRELESS OPERATIONS AND SPECTRUM LICENSES.

TECHNOLOGY

OUR PRIMARY NETWORK TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS CDMA, BASED

ON SPREAD-SPECTRUM DIGITAL RADIO TECHNOLOGY. CDMA-1XRTT TECHNOLOGY IS DEPLOYED IN VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE CELL SITES IN OUR CDMA NETWORK. IN ADDITION, EV-DO, A 3G PACKET-BASED TECHNOLOGY INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR HIGH-SPEED DATA TRANSMISSION, IS DEPLOYED

IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CELL SITES IN OUR CDMA NETWORK. WE ALSO PROVIDE GSM SERVICE AND FULFILL GSM ROAMING OBLIGATIONS IN CERTAIN MARKETS AS A RESULT OF OUR PURCHASE OF RURAL CELLULAR AND ALLTEL, AS WELL AS CERTAIN MARKETS FROM AT&T THAT IT

HAD PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED FROM CENTENNIAL COMMUNICATIONS.

COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE CHOSEN GSM/HSPA (HIGH SPEED

PACKET DATA) OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES AS THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS FOR THEIR 3G NETWORKS. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR 3G CDMA TECHNOLOGY OFFERS MANY ADVANTAGES COMPARED TO GSM/HSPA, SUCH AS MORE EFFICIENT SPECTRUM USAGE AND LOWER OVERALL OPERATING COSTS,

GSM/HSPA SUBSTANTIALLY LEADS IN WORLDWIDE MARKET SHARE, AFFORDING ITS USERS CERTAIN SCALE ADVANTAGES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2010, WE LAUNCHED OUR 4G LTE NETWORK IN 38 MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS AND MORE THAN 60

COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WE EXPECT TO DEPLOY LTE IN AN ADDITIONAL 140 MARKETS BY THE END OF 2011 AND IN VIRTUALLY OUR ENTIRE CURRENT 3G NETWORK FOOTPRINT BY THE END OF 2013. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY FOLLOWS GSMS EVOLUTIONARY

PATH BUT IS DIFFERENT FROM, AND IS AN IMPROVEMENT UPON, THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF BOTH GSM/HSPA- AND CDMA-BASED DIGITAL RADIO TECHNOLOGIES. LTE NETWORKS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HIGHER THROUGHPUT PERFORMANCE AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES FOR 4G LTE

WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES. MANY OTHER MAJOR WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN, HAVE ALSO SELECTED LTE AS THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR 4G LTE DEPLOYMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT LTE WILL PROVIDE US WITH A 4G TECHNOLOGY WITH GLOBAL

SCALE.

OUR NETWORK INCLUDES VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF REDUNDANCY DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICE. POWER AND

BACKHAUL TRANSPORT FACILITIES CAN OFTEN BECOME A NETWORKS VULNERABILITY. CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE BATTERY BACKUP AT EVERY SWITCH AND VIRTUALLY EVERY CELL SITE IN OUR NETWORK. WE ALSO UTILIZE BACKUP GENERATORS AT A MAJORITY OF OUR CELL SITES AND

AT EVERY SWITCH LOCATION. WE FURTHER ENHANCE RELIABILITY BY PROVIDING SECONDARY TRANSPORT FACILITIES FOR CRITICAL LINKS IN THE NETWORK.

SPECTRUM AND NETWORK COVERAGE

THE SPECTRUM LICENSES WE HOLD CAN BE USED FOR MOBILE WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING TEXT AND MULTI-MEDIA MESSAGING, LOCATION BASED SERVICES, MACHINE-TO-MACHINE SERVICES AND

BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS. WE HAVE LICENSES TO PROVIDE WIRELESS SERVICES ON PORTIONS OF THE 800 MHZ BAND (ALSO KNOWN AS CELLULAR SPECTRUM) AND/OR 1800-1900 MHZ BAND (ALSO KNOWN AS PCS SPECTRUM) IN AREAS WHERE VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE POPULATION OF

UNITED STATES RESIDE. IN PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES, WE ALSO HAVE LICENSES FOR ADVANCED WIRELESS SERVICES (AWS) SPECTRUM IN SEGMENTS OF THE 1700 AND 2100 MHZ BANDS. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD LICENSES FOR PORTIONS OF THE 700 MHZ BAND, INCLUDING EIGHT

LICENSES THAT CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE WIRELESS SERVICE COVERAGE TO THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. WE PLAN ON USING BOTH OUR 700 MHZ AND AWS SPECTRUM TO PROVIDE ADVANCE BROADBAND SERVICES, AND IN DECEMBER 2010 WE BEGAN USING CERTAIN OF OUR 700 MHZ LICENSES

FOR THAT PURPOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LAUNCH OF OUR 4G LTE NETWORK.

IN ADDITION TO OUR LICENSED COVERAGE, WE HAVE ROAMING

AGREEMENTS WITH A NUMBER OF WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE WIRELESS SERVICE IN VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WIRELESS SERVICE IS AVAILABLE. CERTAIN OF OUR ROAMING AGREEMENTS ARE TERMINABLE AT

WILL BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS NOTICE; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TERMINATION OF ANY OF THESE AT-WILL AGREEMENTS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF OUR MARKETS TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. WE CAN MEET SPECTRUM NEEDS

BY ACQUIRING LICENSES OR LEASING SPECTRUM FROM OTHER LICENSEES, OR BY ACQUIRING NEW SPECTRUM LICENSES FROM THE FCC, IF AND WHEN OFFERED BY THE FCC IN FUTURE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW SPECTRUM FOR COMMERCIAL WIRELESS

SERVICES AND THE POSSIBLE DATES OF FUTURE FCC SPECTRUM AUCTIONS ARE UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, THE FCC AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN SEEKING THE RELEASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 300 MHZ OF MOBILE USE SPECTRUM BY 2015 AND A FURTHER 200 MHZ BY 2020. AS WE

AND COMPETING WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SPECTRUM SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AND HAVE SPECTRUM SURPLUSES IN OTHERS, WE HAVE AT TIMES ARRANGED SPECTRUM SWAPS, AND WE EXPECT TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THE BENEFICIAL TRADING OF

SPECTRUM LICENSES IN ORDER TO MEET CERTAIN OF OUR CAPACITY AND EXPANSION NEEDS IN THE FUTURE, SUBJECT TO OBTAINING GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS FOR THE TRANSFER OF SPECTRUM LICENSES IN EACH INSTANCE.

NETWORK EQUIPMENT AND BUILD-OUT

OUR PRIMARY CELL SITE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE VENDORS ARE ALCATEL-LUCENT, WHICH PROVIDES MORE THAN HALF OF OUR CELL SITE EQUIPMENT, AND MOTOROLA AND ERICSSON, WHICH TOGETHER PROVIDE NEARLY ALL OF OUR

REMAINING CELL SITE EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO RELY UPON ALCATEL-LUCENT, MOTOROLA AND ERICSSON FOR OUR SWITCHING EQUIPMENT. ALCATEL-LUCENT AND ERICSSON ARE CURRENTLY OUR PRIMARY NETWORK VENDORS FOR OUR LTE NETWORK DEPLOYMENTS.

AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD AND UPGRADE OUR EXISTING NETWORK, WE MUST COMPLETE A VARIETY OF STEPS, INCLUDING SECURING RIGHTS TO A LARGE

NUMBER OF CELL SITE AND SWITCH SITE LOCATIONS AND OBTAINING ZONING AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING THE NECESSARY SITE LEASES AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE RATES AND THE ZONING APPROVALS

NEEDED TO CONSTRUCT NEW TOWERS. WE UTILIZE TOWER SITE MANAGEMENT FIRMS, SUCH AS CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION, AS LESSORS OR MANAGERS OF OUR EXISTING TOWER SITES UPON WHICH OUR OPERATIONS DEPEND.

MARKETING

WE FOCUS OUR

MARKETING STRATEGY ON OFFERING SOLUTIONS THAT ARE TARGETED TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR VARIOUS CUSTOMER MARKET SEGMENTS, SUCH AS YOUNG ADULTS, SENIORS, FAMILIES, SMALL TO LARGE BUSINESSES, GLOBAL ENTERPRISES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT; PROMOTING OUR

BRAND; LEVERAGING OUR EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; AND CROSS-MARKETING WITH VERIZONS OTHER BUSINESS UNITS AND VODAFONE.

OUR MARKETING PLAN INCLUDES A COORDINATED PROGRAM OF TELEVISION, PRINT, RADIO, OUTDOOR SIGNAGE, INTERNET AND POINT-OF-SALE MEDIA PROMOTIONS DESIGNED TO CONSISTENTLY PRESENT OUR MARKETING MESSAGE ACROSS

ALL OF OUR MARKETS. OUR PROMOTION OF THE

VERIZON WIRELESS

BRAND IS COMPLEMENTED BY OUR MARKETING OF THE

VERIZON

BRAND, REINFORCING THE AWARENESS OF OUR SERVICES IN SHARED MARKETS AND CAPITALIZING ON THE SIZE AND BREADTH OF OUR GLOBAL

ENTERPRISE AND CONSUMER WIRELINE BASE.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

OUR SALES STRATEGY IS TO USE A COMBINATION OF DIRECT, INDIRECT AND ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN ORDER TO INCREASE CUSTOMER GROWTH

WHILE REDUCING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS. WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS FOR DEVICE WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION.

DIRECT

COMPANY-OPERATED STORES

. COMPANY-OPERATED STORES ARE A CORE COMPONENT OF OUR DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY. WE OPERATE

STORES AND KIOSKS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING STORE-WITHIN-A-STORE KIOSKS IN MANY BJS WHOLESALE AND PC RICHARD AND SON LOCATIONS.

BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS

. OUR DIRECT CHANNEL ALSO INCLUDES OUR BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL,

REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.

ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT

. WE HAVE A DEDICATED ORGANIZATION TO MORE

EFFECTIVELY SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR LARGEST CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND OUR FEDERAL AND OTHER LARGE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS. THIS ORGANIZATION IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING TO THESE CUSTOMERS INTEGRATED, INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS TO MEET THEIR

TELECOMMUNICATIONS NEEDS.

TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED

. WE HAVE A TELEMARKETING SALES FORCE DEDICATED TO HANDLING

INCOMING CALLS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND WE OFFER FULLY-AUTOMATED, END-TO-END WEB-BASED SALES OF WIRELESS PHONES, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICE PLANS.

INDIRECT

OUR AGENTS

SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT RETAIL LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE INTERNET.

LOCAL AGENTS

. WE HAVE LOCAL AGENTS STRATEGICALLY PLACED WITHIN OUR MARKETS, IN MANY CASES IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE OF OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORE LOCATIONS. THE MAJORITY

OF THESE AGENTS SELL BOTH OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND DO SO UNDER EXCLUSIVE SELLING ARRANGEMENTS WITH US.

NATIONAL RETAILERS.

HIGH-PROFILE, NATIONAL RETAILERS, SUCH AS BEST BUY, WAL-MART AND TARGET, SELL OUR POSTPAID AND PREPAID WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO PURCHASE THE IPHONE

4 AT APPLE STORES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, STORES, SUCH AS DOLLAR GENERAL, BIG LOTS AND VARIOUS DRUGSTORE CHAINS SELL OUR PREPAID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE AND OTHER NATIONAL RETAILERS CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

INDIRECT SALES CHANNEL. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW SUBSCRIBERS AND OUR REVENUE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY OF OUR NATIONAL INDIRECT DISTRIBUTORS WERE TERMINATED OR IF THEY SHIFTED THE MIX OF THEIR BUSINESS TO FAVOR OTHER

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

OEMS

. OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK HAS BEEN FURTHER EXPANDED BY FORMING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

OEMS IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, OEMS SUCH AS DELL, LENOVO, HEWLETT PACKARD, PANASONIC, OQO AND SAMSUNG ARE EMBEDDING EV-DO MOBILE BROADBAND MODULES INTO CERTAIN OF THEIR NOTEBOOK COMPUTER MODELS AND TABLETS, ENABLING USERS TO ACTIVATE

DATA SERVICE ON OUR NETWORK AND CONNECT AT BROADBAND SPEEDS TO CORPORATE NETWORKS, E-MAIL AND THE INTERNET.

BULK SALE OF WIRELESS ACCESS

WE SELL WIRELESS CAPACITY ON A BULK BASIS. OUR TRADITIONAL WHOLESALE BUSINESS INVOLVES THE SALE OF VOICE AND/OR DATA

ACCESS TO INDEPENDENT COMPANIES, SUCH AS TRACFONE, THAT IN TURN RESELL WIRELESS SERVICES TO THEIR END USERS. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 6.6 MILLION OF THESE WHOLESALE LINES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. WE ALSO SELL WIRELESS CAPACITY TO SUPPORT

TELEMETRY AND TELEMATICS SERVICES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION

WE BELIEVE THAT QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT INCREASES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION,

WHICH REDUCES THE RATE AT WHICH OUR CUSTOMERS DISCONNECT INDIVIDUAL LINES OF SERVICE (CHURN). THEREFORE, SATISFYING AND RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS IS CRITICAL TO THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF

OUR STRATEGY. OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, RETENTION AND SATISFACTION PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CONVENIENT AND EASY-TO-USE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS AND MINIMIZE CHURN.

WE HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AVAILABLE 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO ASSIST WITH TECHNICAL CUSTOMER ISSUES, AS WELL AS

DEDICATED CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS TO ADDRESS THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH US AT ANY TIME WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEAK WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE THROUGH OUR ENHANCED SELF-SERVE

APPLICATIONS, WHICH ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS THEIR ACCOUNT INFORMATION, MAKE PAYMENTS AND MAKE CHANGES TO THEIR ACCOUNTS. THESE APPLICATIONS INCLUDE OUR INTERACTIVE VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEM, OUR WEB SITE AND APPLICATIONS ACCESSIBLE FROM A CUSTOMERS

PHONE.

WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER RETENTION INITIATIVES, INCLUDING PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH THE OPTION TO

CHANGE THEIR SERVICE PLAN AT ANY TIME TO ANY QUALIFYING WIRELESS SERVICE PLAN WITHOUT PAYING ANY ADDITIONAL FEES OR REQUIRING ANY CONTRACT EXTENSION; INSTITUTING AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE THAT DECREASES AFTER EACH FULL MONTH THAT A CUSTOMER REMAINS

ON THEIR CONTRACT; AND PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO UPGRADE THEIR PHONE PRIOR TO THE END OF THEIR CONTRACT TERM AT PROMOTIONAL PRICING, PROVIDED THAT THE CUSTOMER SIGNS A NEW QUALIFYING SERVICE CONTRACT. WE ALSO CONTACT CUSTOMERS AT KEY

TIMES DURING THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP ABOUT TARGETED OFFERS AND TO PROVIDE PROACTIVE SERVICE PLAN ANALYSIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

WE COMPETE PRIMARILY AGAINST THREE OTHER NATIONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS: AT&T, SPRINT NEXTEL CORPORATION AND T-MOBILE USA. IN ADDITION, IN MANY MARKETS WE ALSO COMPETE WITH REGIONAL WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS US CELLULAR, METRO PCS AND LEAP WIRELESS. WE ALSO COMPETE FOR RETAIL ACTIVATIONS WITH RESELLERS THAT BUY BULK WHOLESALE SERVICE FROM FACILITIES-BASED WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR RESALE, INCLUDING THOSE THAT BUY FROM US.

WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING INCREASES IN WIRELESS MARKET PENETRATION LEVELS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, NEW MARKET ENTRANTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF

ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM, BOTH LICENSED AND UNLICENSED, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. COMPETITION MAY ALSO INCREASE IF SMALLER, STAND-ALONE WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MERGE OR TRANSFER LICENSES TO LARGER, BETTER CAPITALIZED AND MORE EXPERIENCED WIRELESS

SERVICE PROVIDERS.

THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING TO

INCREASE THEIR BRAND RECOGNITION AND CAPTURE CUSTOMER REVENUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, SKYPE, AS WELL AS GOOGLE, APPLE AND OTHERS, ARE OFFERING ALTERNATIVE MEANS FOR MAKING WIRELESS VOICE CALLS

THAT, IN CERTAIN CASES, CAN BE USED IN LIEU OF THE WIRELESS PROVIDERS VOICE SERVICE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST

IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY.



NETWORK RELIABILITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE

. WE BELIEVE THAT A WIRELESS NETWORK THAT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE SERVICE

IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR IN THE U.S. MARKET AND A DRIVER OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. LOWER PRICES, IMPROVED SERVICE QUALITY AND NEW DATA SERVICE OFFERINGS HAVE LED TO INCREASED CUSTOMER USAGE OF WIRELESS SERVICES, WHICH IN TURN PUTS PRESSURE ON NETWORK

CAPACITY. IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST KEEP PACE WITH NETWORK CAPACITY NEEDS AND OFFER HIGHLY RELIABLE NATIONAL COVERAGE THROUGH THEIR NETWORKS. WE HAVE BEGUN THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR 4G LTE NETWORK. CERTAIN OTHER

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE ALSO DEPLOYED, OR ARE PLANNING TO DEPLOY, LTE OR OTHER 4G TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS WORLDWIDE INTEROPERABILITY FOR MICROWAVE ACCESS (WIMAX).



PRICING

. SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT PRICING PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE WIRELESS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. AS THE DEMAND FOR WIRELESS DATA SERVICES

CONTINUES TO GROW, WIRELESS SERVICES PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING SERVICE PLANS THAT INCLUDE BUNDLED DATA PACKAGES IN VARYING MEGABYTE OR GIGABYTE SIZES OR, IN SOME CASES, UNLIMITED DATA USAGE. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO

OFFERING MINUTES-SHARING PLANS; FREE MOBILE-TO-MOBILE CALLING; OFFERINGS OF LARGER BUNDLES OF INCLUDED MINUTES AT ATTRACTIVE PRICE POINTS, WITH NO ROAMING OR LONG DISTANCE CHARGES; CALLING GROUP FEATURES THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO PLACE AND RECEIVE

CALLS FROM A GROUP OF U.S. PHONE NUMBERS THEY DESIGNATE (INCLUDING LANDLINE NUMBERS) WITHOUT THE CALL TIME COUNTING AGAINST THEIR MINUTE ALLOTMENT; AND BOTH PREPAID AND POSTPAID PLANS OFFERING UNLIMITED VOICE AND DATA USAGE. WE SEEK TO COMPETE IN

THIS AREA BY OFFERING OUR CUSTOMERS SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT THAT THEY WILL REGARD AS THE BEST AVAILABLE VALUE FOR THE PRICE, AS WELL AS SERVICE PLANS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS FOR BOTH VOICE AND DATA SERVICES.



CUSTOMER SERVICE

. WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH-QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A KEY FACTOR IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING BOTH NEW-TO-WIRELESS

CUSTOMERS AND CUSTOMERS OF OTHER WIRELESS PROVIDERS. WE CONTINUALLY FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON IMPROVING IT.



PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT

. AS WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP AND WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS PROLIFERATE, CONTINUED CUSTOMER AND REVENUE

GROWTH WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED DATA PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE WIRELESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND IN

COLLABORATION WITH APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH VARIOUS DEVICE MANUFACTURERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTINCTIVE SMARTPHONES AND OTHER WIRELESS DEVICES THAT CAN ACCESS THE GROWING ARRAY OF DATA APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT

AVAILABLE OVER THE INTERNET. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON INCREASING SMARTPHONE PENETRATION THROUGHOUT OUR CUSTOMER BASE.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

. KEY TO ACHIEVING SALES SUCCESS IN THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS THE REACH AND QUALITY OF SALES CHANNELS AND DISTRIBUTION

POINTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ATTAINING THE OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF VARYING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING INDUSTRY-LEADING PROFITABILITY, AS MEASURED BY OPERATING INCOME. WE ENDEAVOR TO INCREASE SALES THROUGH OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES,

OUTSIDE SALES TEAMS AND TELEMARKETING AND WEB-BASED SALES AND FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF RETAIL OUTLETS AND PREPAID REPLENISHMENT LOCATIONS AND NETBOOK AND NOTEBOOK OEMS. IN ADDITION,

WE SELL WIRELESS ACCESS TO BOTH TRADITIONAL RESELLERS, WHICH RESELL WIRELESS SERVICES TO THEIR END-USERS, AND TO VARIOUS COMPANIES TO ENABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FOR THEIR M2M DEVICES OR FOR THEIR PROVISION OF TELEMATICS SERVICES. SEE

MARKETINGSALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.



CAPITAL RESOURCES

. IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY AND COVERAGE OF THEIR NETWORKS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WIRELESS SERVICE

PROVIDERS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AS DO SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS.

OUR SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW BUSINESS

MODELS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, REGULATORY CHANGES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PRICING STRATEGIES OF COMPETITORS.

IN JULY 2010, THE COMPANY SPUN OFF A SUBSIDIARY OF VERIZON (SPINCO) TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS WHICH HELD DEFINED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE

LOCAL EXCHANGE BUSINESS AND RELATED LANDLINE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY IN PREDOMINANTLY RURAL AREAS IN 14 STATES. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SPIN-OFF, SPINCO MERGED WITH FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (FRONTIER) PURSUANT TO A DEFINITIVE

AGREEMENT WITH FRONTIER. THIS TRANSACTION FURTHER FOCUSED THE COMPANYS MASS MARKETS ASSET BASE AROUND ITS FASTEST GROWING BUSINESS  FIOS FIBER-OPTIC SERVICES.

MASS MARKETS

MASS MARKETS OPERATIONS PROVIDE LOCAL EXCHANGE (BASIC

SERVICE AND END-USER ACCESS), LONG DISTANCE (INCLUDING REGIONAL TOLL), BROADBAND SERVICES (INCLUDING HIGH-SPEED INTERNET AND FIOS INTERNET) AND FIOS TV SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL BUSINESS SUBSCRIBERS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DIRECTV, VERIZON ALSO

FLORIDA, MARYLAND, PENNSYLVANIA, MASSACHUSETTS, VIRGINIA AND RHODE ISLAND, AS WELL AS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. WE BELIEVE FIOS TV HAS FEATURES THAT DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE COMPETITION, INCLUDING ITS CHANNEL LINE-UP, BREADTH OF HIGH DEFINITION

CONTENT AND VIDEO ON DEMAND, AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING.



FIOS TV WIDGETS  VIEWERS HAVE ONE-TOUCH, ON DEMAND ACCESS TO LOCAL WEATHER, TRAFFIC AND COMMUNITY INFORMATION AND INCREASINGLY POPULAR SOCIAL

MEDIA APPLICATIONS SUCH AS FACEBOOK AND TWITTER, AS WELL AS ONLINE COMMERCE OPPORTUNITIES. THE WIDGET PLATFORM HAS EVOLVED TO AN OPEN-DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT, WHICH PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIRD PARTIES TO DEVELOP ENHANCED CUSTOMER FEATURES VIA

THE FIOS TV PRODUCT.



FLEXVIEW

 WITH FLEXVIEW, FIOS CUSTOMERS CAN VIEW NEARLY 2,000 TITLES OUTSIDE THE HOME FROM A COMPUTER, TABLET, NETBOOK OR COMPATIBLE

MOBILE PHONE. WE EXPECT THAT FLEXVIEW WILL ALSO INCLUDE TV SHOWS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

NETWORK

IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR MASS MARKETS, GLOBAL

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREMIER BROADBAND AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE MASS MARKET. NETWORK RELIABILITY AND FUNCTIONALITY ARE KEY TO ACHIEVING THAT GOAL. OUR DEPLOYMENT OF FIBER-TO-THE-PREMISE

(FTTP) ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES OVER FIBER OPTIC CABLES PROVIDES THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE BANDWIDTH TO THE CUSTOMER PREMISE BASED ON CURRENT TECHNOLOGY AND ALLOWS US THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT OUR FACILITIES MORE EASILY TO FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FOR

EXAMPLE, NEW OPTICAL TERMINALS CAN BE ADDED TO THE FTTP NETWORK PROVIDING GREATER BANDWIDTH AND NEW SERVICES WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FIELD CONSTRUCTION. VERIZONS RECENT LAUNCH OF 150/35 MBPS INTERNET SERVICE DELIVERS THE FASTEST MASS-MARKET

BROADBAND SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES OVER OUR FIOS NETWORK. OUR NEW INTERNET SERVICE OFFERS THREE TIMES THE DOWNSTREAM SPEED PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE TO FIOS CUSTOMERS. RECENT FIELD TRIALS SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED CONNECTION SPEEDS OF NEARLY 1 GIGABIT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FTTP NETWORK IS ALSO SUPPORTING THE INTRODUCTION OF FLEXVIEW, GIVING FIOS TV CUSTOMERS

THE ABILITY TO TAKE VIDEO PROGRAMMING OUTSIDE OF THE HOME AND VIEW IT ON A COMPUTER, TABLET, NETBOOK OR COMPATIBLE MOBILE PHONE. FIOS ALSO SUPPORTS 3-D PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING SEVERAL FEATURE FILMS AND THE FIRST TELEVISED NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL GAMES IN 3-D. OTHER EMERGING APPLICATIONS THAT WILL BE SUPPORTED BY OUR EXPANDED NETWORK CAPACITY INCLUDE HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO SHARING, VIDEO TELEPHONY, TELEMEDICINE AND OFFSITE BACKUPS AND STORAGE SERVICES.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EVOLUTION OF OUR ACCESS PLANT, WE ARE ALSO TRANSITIONING OUR METRO (LOCAL) NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE FROM

TRADITIONAL TDM/SONET (SYNCHRONOUS OPTICAL NETWORK)/ATM TECHNOLOGIES TO ETHERNET OVER DENSE WAVELENGTH DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (DWDM). THIS NEW OPTICAL TRANSPORT NETWORK PROVIDES FEATURES OPTIMIZED FOR VIDEO DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND HIGH SPEED DATA

SERVICES, WHILE MAINTAINING THE LEVEL OF NETWORK RELIABILITY ACHIEVED WITH SONET.

TO LEVERAGE THIS NEW NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE

AND ALLOW FOR THE MORE EFFICIENT SHARING OF OUR NETWORK ACROSS SERVICES, WE ARE UPGRADING OUR MULTIPLEXING AND ROUTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO USE IP, ETHERNET AND MPLS TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE MIGRATING FROM TRADITIONAL TDM-BASED VOICE SWITCHING

TO VOIP. THIS MIGRATION LOWERS THE COST OF CURRENT DATA AND VOICE SERVICES AND CREATES A NETWORK THAT CAN OFFER FUTURE MULTI-MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY ADDING SERVICE PLATFORMS WITHOUT REQUIRING WIDESPREAD NETWORK UPGRADES. WE HAVE BEEN

FOCUSED ON GROWING OUR ETHERNET INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE FULL RANGE OF ETHERNET PRIVATE LINE AND E-LAN SERVICES LOCALLY, DOMESTICALLY AND GLOBALLY. TO LOWER THE ACCESS COST AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT SERVICE FLEXIBILITY, WE ARE USING A CONVERGED

PACKET ACCESS STRATEGY THAT REPLACES THE PRIVATE CIRCUIT-BASED CUSTOMER ACCESS AND AGGREGATES TRAFFIC FROM MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS ONTO A SHARED ETHERNET AND MPLS NETWORK. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EMERGING OPTICAL TRANSPORT TECHNOLOGIES TO LOWER

OVERALL COST AS WE INTEGRATE ETHERNET, SONET AND OPTICS, AND ULTRA-LONG-HAUL TECHNOLOGIES.

WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR VIRTUAL

PRIVATE LAN SERVICE TO EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC, AND ADDITIONAL NORTH AMERICAN LOCATIONS. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE EXPANSION OF OUR PRIVATE IP NETWORK TO SERVE ALL KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WITH MANAGED QUALITY OF SERVICE-AWARE IP VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK

SERVICES. OUR PUBLIC IP NETWORK IS NOW INTERCONNECTED TO OUR PRIVATE IP NETWORK THROUGH SECURITY GATEWAY PLATFORMS THAT ALLOW BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO EXTEND THE REACH OF THEIR PRIVATE VIRTUAL NETWORKS TO OFF-NET SITES, SUCH AS

EMPLOYEES HOMES, SMALL BRANCH OFFICES AND MOBILE WORK FORCES. WE HAVE INSTALLED ADDITIONAL PRIVATE IP EDGE ROUTERS FOR A TOTAL OF 814 EDGE ROUTERS IN 233 SITES THROUGHOUT 61 COUNTRIES; AND ADDED NINETEEN NEW CONVERGED PACKET ARCHITECTURE

SWITCHES, FOR A TOTAL OF 153 CPA SWITCHES IN 132 SITES ACROSS 36 COUNTRIES.

WE DEPLOYED THE INDUSTRYS FIRST COMMERCIAL

100G (GIGABITS PER SECOND) ULTRA-LONG-HAUL OPTICAL SYSTEM FOR LIVE TRAFFIC ON OUR EUROPEAN OPTICAL CORE NETWORK, AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED OTHER FIELD TRIALS OF 100G TECHNOLOGY IN NORTH AMERICA AND GREAT BRITAIN IN PREPARATION FOR FURTHER

ULTRA-LONG-HAUL DEPLOYMENTS. WE EXPECT TO ACTIVATE THE EUROPE INDIA GATEWAY SYSTEM IN EARLY 2011, LINKING COUNTRIES/TERRITORIES BETWEEN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND INDIA, DELIVERING SIGNIFICANT NETWORK CAPACITY AND DIVERSITY INTO EMERGING

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE ADDED A JAPAN LANDING TO THE TRANS-PACIFIC EXPRESS (TPE) SUBMARINE CABLE SYSTEM CONNECTING THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES TO CHINA, KOREA AND TAIWAN.

OUR FIBER-TO-THE-CELLSITE (FTTCS) BACKHAUL INITIATIVE IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING THE SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH REQUIREMENTS OF EXPANDING 3G AND

4G LTE WIRELESS DATA NETWORKS NATIONWIDE. TO SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE, OVER 8,900 CELL SITE CONNECTIONS WERE COMPLETED IN 2010, TOTALING ALMOST FOUR TIMES THE SITES COMPLETED IN 2009.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE

AS A KEY FACTOR IN ACHIEVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND RETENTION. AS PART OF THAT ENDEAVOR, WE FOCUS ON ALLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH US IN THE WAY THAT IS MOST CONVENIENT FOR THEM.

INCREASINGLY, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE CHOOSING TO DO BUSINESS WITH US ONLINE, INCLUDING DIAGNOSING AND FIXING PROBLEMS AND ORDERING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN LIGHT OF THIS, IN 2010, WE COMPLETED A REDESIGN OF OUR WEBSITE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO USE. WE ALSO DEPLOYED IN-HOME AGENT TO OUR BROADBAND AND FIOS TV CUSTOMERS. THIS TOOL ALLOWS OUR INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO SELF-DIAGNOSE AND CORRECT ISSUES THEY MAY ENCOUNTER WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE A CALL TO US OR SCHEDULE A TECHNICIAN VISIT.

IN ADDITION WE ENHANCED THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE FOR OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING CONTENT TARGETED DIRECTLY TO OUR MAJOR SEGMENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT ALL OF

OUR CORE AND STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS.

WE PROVIDE LIVE 24/7 CUSTOMER SUPPORT ON ALL FIOS SALES AND SERVICE ISSUES. WE HAVE ALSO

THE WIRELINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY FURTHER WITH TRADITIONAL, NON-TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING PLAYERS SEEKING INCREASED MARKET SHARE. CURRENT

AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS INCLUDE CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, OTHER DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, SATELLITE TELEVISION COMPANIES, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT OFFER NETWORK SERVICES AND

MANAGED ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS.

IN THE MASS MARKETS BUSINESS, CABLE OPERATORS ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS. CABLE OPERATORS HAVE

INCREASED THE SIZE AND DIGITAL CAPACITY OF THEIR NETWORKS SO THAT THEY CAN OFFER DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO MARKET COMPETITIVE BUNDLED OFFERINGS THAT INCLUDE HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS, DIGITAL TELEVISION AND VOICE SERVICES.

SEVERAL MAJOR CABLE OPERATORS ALSO OFFER BUNDLES WITH WIRELESS SERVICES THROUGH STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS.

IN ADDITION,

WIRELESS SUBSTITUTION IS AN ONGOING COMPETITIVE TREND, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE AS WIRELESS COMPANIES POSITION THEIR SERVICE AS A LANDLINE ALTERNATIVE. WE ALSO FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE VOIP SERVICES. VOIP SERVICES

ARE AVAILABLE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COMPANIES INCLUDING CABLE COMPANIES, AND NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PROVIDERS. INTERNET PORTAL PROVIDERS ARE ALSO ENTERING OUR COMPETITIVE SPACE.

AS A RESULT OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996, WHICH REQUIRES US TO ALLOW POTENTIAL COMPETITORS TO PURCHASE OUR SERVICES FOR RESALE, OR ACCESS COMPONENTS OF OUR NETWORK ON AN UNBUNDLED BASIS AT A

PRESCRIBED COST, COMPETITION IN OUR LOCAL EXCHANGE MARKETS CONTINUES. OUR TELEPHONE OPERATIONS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SELL THEIR SERVICES TO COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS AT SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS FROM THE PRICES OUR TELEPHONE

OPERATIONS CHARGE THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS. THE SCOPE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD AND THE RATES WE RECEIVE, ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REVIEW AND REVISION BY THE FCC AND STATE REGULATORS. SEE REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE TRENDS IN THE

2010 VERIZON ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREOWNERS.

IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE BUSINESS, THE CUSTOMERS NEED TO REDUCE TECHNICAL

COMPLEXITY COUPLED WITH THE GROWTH OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY TECHNOLOGY CONVERGENCE IS DRIVING THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, CARRIERS, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PROVIDERS. SOME OF THE BIGGEST

COMPANIES IN IT SERVICES ARE EITHER MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR FORGING NEW ALLIANCES TO BE BETTER POSITIONED FOR A REBOUND IN TECHNOLOGY SPENDING. MOST NEW ALLIANCES AND ACQUISITIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON EMERGING FIELDS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, SOFTWARE

DELIVERY, COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS AND OTHER COMPUTING TASKS VIA THE NETWORK, RATHER THAN ON IN-HOUSE MACHINES. CARRIERS HAVE ALSO UTILIZED ACQUISITIONS TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INROADS INTO ENTERPRISE OUTSOURCING MARKETS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN DOMINATED

BY THE MAJOR IT OUTSOURCERS.

GLOBAL WHOLESALE COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL CARRIERS FOR LONG-HAUL, VOICE AND IP SERVICES.

ADDITIONALLY, MOBILE VIDEO AND DATA NEEDS ARE DRIVING A GREATER NEED FOR WIRELESS BACKHAUL. NETWORK PROVIDERS, CABLE COMPANIES AND NICHE PLAYERS ARE COMPETITORS FOR THIS NEW REVENUE OPPORTUNITY.

IN ADDITION, COMPANIES WITH A GLOBAL PRESENCE INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH OUR WIRELINE BUSINESSES. A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH GLOBAL OPERATIONS SERVE CUSTOMERS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, GLOBAL WHOLESALE MARKETS. WE COMPETE WITH THESE FULL, OR NEAR-FULL SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR LARGE CONTRACTS TO

PROVIDE INTEGRATED SERVICES TO GLOBAL ENTERPRISES. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE A STRONG MARKET PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO INTENSIFYING COMPETITION AND WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

REVENUE GROWTH.

WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND TRENDS IN THE WIRELINE INDUSTRY.



CUSTOMER SERVICE

: CUSTOMERS EXPECT INDUSTRY LEADING SERVICE FROM THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE MASS MARKETS, GLOBAL ENTERPRISE AND GLOBAL

WHOLESALE BUSINESSES. AS TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES EVOLVE, THE ABILITY OF A CARRIER TO EXCEL IN THIS AREA IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION. IN MASS MARKETS, WE COMPETE IN THIS AREA THROUGH OUR SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES AND

ONLINE SUPPORT, RECENTLY RECOGNIZED AS INDUSTRY LEADING BY AN INDEPENDENT SURVEY ORGANIZATION. IN GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH READY ACCESS TO THEIR SYSTEM AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION AND CONDUCT PROACTIVE TESTING OF THE NETWORK

TO IDENTIFY MINOR ISSUES BEFORE THEY AFFECT CUSTOMERS. IN THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS, SERVICE IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED SYSTEM AUTOMATION INITIATIVES.



NETWORK RELIABILITY AND BANDWIDTH (SPEED).

AS BOTH CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS LOOK TO LEVERAGE HIGH SPEED CONNECTIONS FOR

ENTERTAINMENT, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PRODUCTIVITY, WE EXPECT BROADBAND PENETRATION WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS ONLINE AND ONLINE-ENABLED ACTIVITIES INCREASE, SO WILL BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS, BOTH DOWNSTREAM AND UPSTREAM.

TO SUCCEED, WE AND OTHER NETWORK-BASED PROVIDERS MUST ENSURE THAT OUR NETWORKS CAN DELIVER AGAINST THESE INCREASING BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD OUT OUR NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO MEET THIS FUTURE DEMAND. IN ADDITION, NETWORK

RELIABILITY AND SECURITY ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE GLOBAL ENTERPRISE BUSINESS.



PRICING

: CABLE, TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES AND INTEGRATED SERVICE PROVIDERS USE PRICING TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE FROM INCUMBENTS. PRICING IS

ALSO SIGNIFICANT AS NON-TRADITIONAL MODES OF PROVIDING COMMUNICATION SERVICES EMERGE AND NEW ENTRANTS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, PORTAL-BASED AND VOIP CALLING IS FREE OR NEARLY FREE TO CUSTOMERS AND IS OFTEN SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISING

REVENUES.



PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION

: AS A RESULT OF PRICING PRESSURES, PROVIDERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR PRODUCTS. CUSTOMERS ARE SHIFTING FROM AN

ACCESS TO AN APPLICATIONS MINDSET AND ARE FOCUSED ON HOW THEY CAN LEVERAGE THEIR BROADBAND AND VIDEO CONNECTIONS. CONVERGED FEATURES, SUCH AS INTEGRATED WIRELESS AND WIRELINE FUNCTIONALITY, ARE BECOMING SIMILARLY IMPORTANT, ENABLED BY BOTH CUSTOMER

DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES

VERIZON OWNS OR HAS LICENSES TO VARIOUS PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, DOMAIN NAMES AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS NECESSARY TO

CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. WE ACTIVELY PURSUE THE FILING AND REGISTRATION OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, DOMAIN NAMES, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, AND HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

THE RATE OF SUCH FILINGS EACH YEAR. VERIZON ALSO ACTIVELY GRANTS LICENSES, IN EXCHANGE FOR APPROPRIATE FEES OR OTHER CONSIDERATION AND SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS AND RESTRICTIONS, TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ENABLE SUCH COMPANIES TO UTILIZE

CERTAIN VERIZON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AS PART OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SUCH LICENSES ENABLE SUCH THIRD PARTY LICENSEES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESULTS OF VERIZONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

WHILE THESE LICENSES RESULT IN VALUABLE CONSIDERATION BEING PAID TO VERIZON, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LOSS OF SUCH CONSIDERATION, OR THE EXPIRATION OF ANY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

VERIZON PERIODICALLY RECEIVES OFFERS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO PURCHASE OR OBTAIN LICENSES FOR PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN EXCHANGE FOR ROYALTIES OR OTHER PAYMENTS. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY RECEIVE NOTICES ALLEGING THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES INFRINGE ON THIRD PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE CLAIMS, WHETHER AGAINST US DIRECTLY

OR AGAINST THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT WE, IN TURN, SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES, OR CEASE OFFERING THE RELEVANT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK

FACTORS IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISKS IS NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE

IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR FUTURE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AND FROM EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UNFAVORABLE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS A RECESSION OR ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR OTHER

MAJOR MARKETS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE AFFORDABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CONSUMERS MAY SEEK TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BY FORGOING PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, ELECTING TO

USE FEWER HIGHER MARGIN SERVICES OR OBTAINING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER LOWER-COST PROGRAMS OFFERED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SIMILARLY, UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT WE SERVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD MAY DELAY PURCHASING

DECISIONS, DELAY FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE OFFERINGS OR REDUCE THEIR USE OF SERVICES. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF OUR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR SERVICES. IF THESE

EVENTS WERE TO OCCUR, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION THAT MAY

REDUCE OUR MARKET SHARE AND LOWER OUR PROFITS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN OUR INDUSTRY. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF

NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS HAS ELIMINATED THE TRADITIONAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN LOCAL, LONG DISTANCE, WIRELESS, CABLE AND INTERNET COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND BROUGHT NEW COMPETITORS TO OUR MARKETS, INCLUDING OTHER TELEPHONE COMPANIES,

CABLE COMPANIES, WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SATELLITE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION AND DEVICE PROVIDERS, ELECTRIC UTILITIES, AND PROVIDERS OF VOIP SERVICES. WHILE THESE CHANGES HAVE ENABLED US TO OFFER NEW TYPES OF SERVICES, THEY HAVE ALSO ALLOWED OTHER

SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THEIR OWN COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NETWORK QUALITY, CAPACITY AND COVERAGE, THE PRICING OF OUR SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT, THE QUALITY OF

OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, OUR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE REACH AND QUALITY OF OUR SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES. IT WILL ALSO DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY WE ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO VARIOUS

FACTORS AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND FOR EXISTING SERVICES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO THESE

COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES, WE COULD LOSE MARKET SHARE AND EXPERIENCE REDUCED PROFITS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES OR MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.

OUR INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING RAPID CHANGE AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED THAT OFFER CONSUMERS AN ARRAY OF CHOICES FOR THEIR

COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN ORDER TO GROW AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE WILL NEED TO ADAPT TO FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING OFFERINGS AND INTRODUCE NEW OFFERINGS TO ADDRESS OUR CUSTOMERS CHANGING DEMANDS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO

MEET FUTURE ADVANCES IN COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, WE COULD LOSE CUSTOMERS TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES IN OUR INDUSTRY REQUIRES US TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THE VARIED

AND CONTINUALLY CHANGING DEMANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OR THE SUCCESS OF NEW SERVICES IN THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THERE COULD BE LEGAL OR REGULATORY RESTRAINTS TO OUR INTRODUCTION OF NEW

SERVICES. IF THESE SERVICES FAIL TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR IF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE SERVICES MATERIALLY INCREASE, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SELECTED LONG TERM EVOLUTION TECHNOLOGY (LTE) AS OUR NEXT-GENERATION WIRELESS

NETWORK ACCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE EXPECT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE US TO OFFER A MOBILE DATA NETWORK WITH HIGHER SPEEDS AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES. OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR PLANS TO ADOPT LTE AS THEIR NEXT-GENERATION

TECHNOLOGY, AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BECOME THE PRINCIPAL NEXT-GENERATION GLOBAL STANDARD. THERE ARE RISKS, HOWEVER, THAT THESE OTHER WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY DELAY THEIR DEPLOYMENT OF LTE OR CHANGE THEIR SELECTION AND ADOPT DIFFERENT

NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH OURS. AS A RESULT, LTE MAY NOT BECOME THE PRINCIPAL NEXT-GENERATION GLOBAL STANDARD AND MAY NOT PROVIDE US WITH THE GLOBAL SCALE, COMPATIBILITY AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT

WE EXPECT IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO DEPLOY LTE ON OUR NETWORK SUCCESSFULLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT OUR SUPPLIERS MAY BE UNABLE TO

MANUFACTURE AND DELIVER LTE DEVICES AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT ON SCHEDULE AND ACCORDING TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS. FURTHERMORE, OUR DEPLOYMENT OF LTE MAY NOT OCCUR AT THE COST WE HAVE ESTIMATED. IF THESE RISKS MATERIALIZE, OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE NEXT

GENERATION WIRELESS SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT CUSTOMERS, AND TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR CUSTOMER REVENUES COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DEPEND ON KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEED TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE DEPEND ON VARIOUS KEY SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO PROVIDE US, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH OTHER SUPPLIERS, WITH EQUIPMENT AND

SERVICES, SUCH AS SWITCH AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT, HANDSETS AND OTHER DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT, THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR HANDSET AND OTHER DEVICE SUPPLIERS OFTEN RELY ON ONE

VENDOR FOR THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, USED IN THEIR DEVICES. IF THESE SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS FAIL TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE ON A TIMELY BASIS OR FAIL TO MEET OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS AND WHEN REQUESTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OR UPGRADE OUR NETWORKS. BECAUSE OF THE COSTS AND TIME LAGS THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING FROM ONE SUPPLIER TO

ANOTHER, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISRUPTED IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO, OR CHOSE TO, REPLACE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE MAJOR SUPPLIERS WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, ESPECIALLY IF THE REPLACEMENT BECAME NECESSARY

ON SHORT NOTICE. ANY SUCH DISRUPTION COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS, DECREASE OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ON WHICH WE RELY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY ON WHICH WE DEPEND, INCLUDING

LITIGATION INVOLVING CLAIMS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT. SUCH CLAIMS HAVE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY IN THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER OUR BUSINESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH LITIGATION. WE EXPECT OUR DEPENDENCE ON KEY

SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUE AS WE DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE MORE ADVANCED GENERATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY.

CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WHICH

WE OPERATE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION BY THE FCC AND OTHER FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE REGULATED BY VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE REGULATORY REGIMES FREQUENTLY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN OR

PROVIDE SPECIFIED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN DESIGNATED AREAS, REQUIRE THAT WE MAINTAIN LICENSES FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STANDARDS. WE ARE FREQUENTLY INVOLVED IN REGULATORY AND NON-REGULATORY

GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF PENDING FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS, OR THE REVIEWS BY FEDERAL OR STATE

COURTS OF REGULATORY RULINGS. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE RELIEF, EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SIMILARLY, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL AT OBTAINING THE LICENSES WE NEED TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR IN MAINTAINING OUR EXISTING LICENSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FCC GRANTS WIRELESS LICENSES FOR TERMS GENERALLY LASTING 10 YEARS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RENEWAL. THE LOSS OF, OR

A MATERIAL LIMITATION ON, CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS OR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS PLANS. NEW REGULATIONS COULD RESTRICT THE

WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN MANAGE OUR WIRELINE AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS, IMPAIR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, AND POTENTIALLY IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE,

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS IP-BASED SERVICES, INCLUDING VOIP AND SUPER HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND AND VIDEO, COULD BE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING REGULATION BETWEEN THE FCC AND VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING AND INTRODUCING NEW SERVICES BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY.

AS THE HOLDER OF 700 MHZ C BLOCK

LICENSES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN OPEN ACCESS REGULATIONS THAT THE FCC HAS IMPOSED ON ALL LICENSEES OF 700 MHZ C BLOCK SPECTRUM. THESE RULES REQUIRE US TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO USE DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS OF THEIR CHOICE ON

THE LTE NETWORK WE ARE DEPLOYING ON THAT SPECTRUM, INCLUDING THOSE OBTAINED FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN US OR OUR DISTRIBUTORS OR DEALERS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS ESTABLISHED BY US. THE FCC HAS NOT YET FINALLY DETERMINED WHAT LEVEL OF

ACCESS WILL SATISFY THE OPEN ACCESS REQUIREMENTS. ONCE FINALLY DETERMINED, THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OR LIMIT THE REVENUE-GENERATING POTENTIAL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR USE OF THE C BLOCK. IN ADDITION, ON DECEMBER 21,

2010, THE FCC ADOPTED AN ORDER IN WHICH IT IMPOSED SO-CALLED NET NEUTRALITY RULES THAT IT DESCRIBES AS INTENDED TO PRESERVE THE OPENNESS OF THE INTERNET. THESE NEW RULES LIMIT THE WAYS THAT A BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE PROVIDER

CAN MANAGE ITS NETWORK AND THE SERVICES IT CAN PROVIDE OVER THE NETWORK. GIVEN THAT THE SCOPE OF THE RESTRICTIONS AND MANY CRITICAL TERMS IN THIS ORDER ARE NOT FULLY DEFINED AND GIVEN THAT THE ORDER CREATES PROCEDURAL MECHANISMS FOR PARTIES TO

COMPLAIN OF VIOLATIONS OF THE ORDER, IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT LITIGATION TO RESOLVE AMBIGUITIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO YET FURTHER REGULATION. THE REGULATION OF BROADBAND ACTIVITIES AND ANY RELATED COURT DECISIONS COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND LIMIT THE RETURN WE CAN EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ON PAST AND FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR BROADBAND NETWORKS.

NATURAL

DISASTERS, TERRORIST ATTACKS OR BREACHES OF NETWORK OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

NATURAL DISASTERS, TERRORIST ACTS, ACTS OF WAR, CYBER ATTACKS OR OTHER BREACHES OF NETWORK OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SECURITY MAY CAUSE EQUIPMENT FAILURES OR DISRUPT OUR

OPERATIONS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF THESE EVENTS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN. OUR INABILITY TO OPERATE OUR WIRELINE OR WIRELESS

NETWORKS AS A RESULT OF SUCH EVENTS, EVEN FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND/OR LOSS OF MARKET SHARE TO OTHER COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, A FAILURE TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE

CONFIDENTIAL DATA AGAINST BREACHES OF NETWORK OR IT SECURITY COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

FINANCING.

WE REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE FUND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS IN PART

THROUGH BORROWINGS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CREDIT MARKETS. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON OUR PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CUSTOMARY CREDIT METRICS. A DECREASE IN THESE

RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. A SEVERE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, AND SUCH

INSTABILITY COULD AFFECT OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING.

INCREASES IN COSTS FOR PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS MAY

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 194,400 EMPLOYEES AND APPROXIMATELY

215,400 RETIREES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 PARTICIPATING IN VERIZONS BENEFIT PLANS, THE COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND ACTIVE AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. OUR COSTS OF MAINTAINING THESE

PLANS, AND THE FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE PLANS, ARE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE RECENTLY ENACTED PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010, THE ENACTMENT OF ANY

SIMILAR HEALTH CARE REFORM MEASURES AT THE STATE LEVEL, INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS, DECREASES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS ON FUNDS HELD BY OUR PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTS AND CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO LIMIT FUTURE INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUR BENEFIT PLANS, THOSE COSTS COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY AND INCREASE OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS AND WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS OR EXPERIENCE WORK STOPPAGES AS A RESULT OF THE RENEGOTIATION OF OUR LABOR CONTRACTS OR

ADDITIONAL ORGANIZING ACTIVITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY LABOR

UNIONS. LABOR CONTRACTS COVERING MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES WILL EXPIRE IN 2011. ACCORDINGLY, IN 2011, WE WILL BE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR LABOR UNIONS REGARDING NEW CONTRACTS. DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS, WE COULD INCUR

ADDITIONAL COSTS AND/OR EXPERIENCE LENGTHY WORK STOPPAGES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING A LOSS OF REVENUE AND STRAINED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THE LENGTH OF ANY SUCH WORK STOPPAGE. IN

ADDITION, WHILE THE WORKFORCE OF OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY NON-UNION, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS UNIONS MAY HAVE IN ORGANIZING THIS WORKFORCE OR THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON OUR COSTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES OR SETTLEMENTS.

OUR BUSINESS FACES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING, FROM TIME TO TIME, PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS, ANTITRUST CLASS

ACTIONS, WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTIONS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS RELATING TO OUR ADVERTISING, SALES, BILLING AND COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, OUR WIRELESS BUSINESS ALSO FACES PERSONAL INJURY AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RELATING

TO ALLEGED HEALTH EFFECTS OF WIRELESS PHONES OR RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSMITTERS, AND CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT CHALLENGE MARKETING PRACTICES AND DISCLOSURES RELATING TO ALLEGED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF HANDHELD WIRELESS PHONES. WE MAY INCUR

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES IN DEFENDING THESE LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT AWARDS OR SETTLEMENTS.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC.

(VERIZON), AND A NUMBER OF OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES, HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MULTIPLE CLASS ACTION SUITS CONCERNING ITS ALLEGED PARTICIPATION IN INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING ACTIVITIES ALLEGEDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AT THE

DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENTS POST-SEPTEMBER 11 PROGRAM TO PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. PLAINTIFFS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT VERIZON HAS PARTICIPATED BY PERMITTING THE GOVERNMENT TO GAIN ACCESS TO

THE CONTENT OF ITS SUBSCRIBERS TELEPHONE CALLS AND/OR RECORDS CONCERNING THOSE CALLS AND THAT SUCH ACTION VIOLATES FEDERAL AND/OR STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY LAW. RELIEF SOUGHT IN THE CASES INCLUDES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, ATTORNEYS

FEES, AND STATUTORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON AUGUST 9, 2006, THE JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION (PANEL) ORDERED THAT THESE ACTIONS BE TRANSFERRED, CONSOLIDATED AND COORDINATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA. THE PANEL SUBSEQUENTLY ORDERED THAT A NUMBER OF TAG ALONG ACTIONS ALSO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. VERIZON BELIEVES THAT THESE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT. ON JULY 10, 2008, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED

INTO LAW THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008, WHICH PROVIDES FOR DISMISSAL OF THESE SUITS BY THE COURT BASED ON SUBMISSION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF A SPECIFIED CERTIFICATION. ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2008, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE

SUCH A SUBMISSION IN THE CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDINGS. BASED ON THIS SUBMISSION, THE COURT ORDERED DISMISSAL OF THE COMPLAINTS ON JUNE 3, 2009. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THIS DISMISSAL, AND THE APPEAL REMAINS PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2010, THE U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (U.S. BANK), AS LITIGATION

TRUSTEE FOR THE IDEARC, INC. LITIGATION TRUST (LITIGATION TRUST), FILED SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AGAINST VERIZON AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES CHALLENGING THE NOVEMBER 2006 SPIN-OFF OF VERIZONS FORMER

DIRECTORIES BUSINESS THEN KNOWN AS IDEARC INC. U.S. BANK, WHICH REPRESENTS A GROUP OF CREDITORS WHO FILED CLAIMS IN THE IDEARC, INC. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, ALLEGES THAT IDEARC INC. WAS INSOLVENT AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF OR BECAME INSOLVENT

SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE LITIGATION TRUST SEEKS OVER $9 BILLION IN DAMAGES.

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE SPINOFF OF CERTAIN OF VERIZONS LOCAL EXCHANGE BUSINESS AND RELATED LANDLINE ACTIVITIES IN 14 STATES.

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2011, THE BOARD APPROVED A SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM WHICH AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO 100 MILLION SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK TERMINATING NO LATER THAN THE CLOSE OF

BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 28, 2014. THE BOARD ALSO DETERMINED THAT NO ADDITIONAL SHARES WERE TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED BUYBACK PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM PERMITS VERIZON TO REPURCHASE SHARES OVER TIME, WITH THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF

REPURCHASES DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CORPORATE NEEDS. THE BOARD MAY ALSO ENTER INTO RULE 10B5-1 PLANS FROM TIME TO TIME TO FACILITATE REPURCHASES OF ITS SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN PERMITS THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE

SHARES AT TIMES WHEN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PREVENTED FROM DOING SO, PROVIDED THE PLAN IS ADOPTED WHEN THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, VERIZON DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF VERIZON COMMON STOCK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES THAT COULD BE PURCHASED BY OR ON BEHALF OF VERIZON

UNDER THE SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM IN PLACE AT THAT TIME WAS 60,015,938.
